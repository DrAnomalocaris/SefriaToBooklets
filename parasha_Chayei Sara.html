        <summary>Sarah's age at death was significant as she overcame astrological predictions of barrenness through her merits and prayers, giving &quot;life&quot; to her years through good deeds and devotion to Hashem. Rashi emphasizes her sinlessness and beauty at different stages of life, with her last 37 years being most significant, connected to the purchase of the cave of Machpelah and the birth of Rebecca. Midrash highlights the blessings and offerings related to Sarah, Abraham, and their descendants, emphasizing their righteousness and honor. Musar stresses the importance of humility leading to honor in the world to come, symbolized by the division of Sarah's life into three periods reflecting her beauty, sinlessness, and motherly role. Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, Haamek Sheilah, Hizkuni, Da'at Zekenim, Targum Jonathan, and Onkelos provide additional insights into the significance of Sarah's life and age.</summary>

            <summary>Sarah's age at death is significant because she was initially destined to be barren due to astrological predictions, but through her merits and prayers, she was able to conceive. Her life was marked by accumulating merits through good deeds, and she was able to give &quot;life&quot; to her years. The Talmudic teachings about praying for the glory of Hashem and the Jewish people are interconnected, emphasizing the importance of kindness and mercy. Sarah's life was also linked to humility and surrender, corresponding to the 100 sockets in the Mikdash. Additionally, Sarah's devotion to Hashem is highlighted by her connection to the Holy name of Hashem throughout her life.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>‎Genesis 23,1. “The years of Sarah’s life were one hundred years, ‎etc.;” I believe, G’d willing, that I have understood the reason ‎why Sarah is the only woman in the Bible of whose age at the ‎time of her death we have been told. The Talmud Nedarim ‎‎64, in referring to Rachel’s outburst (Genesis 30,1) that unless her ‎husband Yaakov would give her children she considered herself as ‎‎“dead,” is quoted by Rashi on that verse saying that seeing ‎that a woman’s primary task in life is to mother children, any ‎woman who has not given birth to a live child is considered as ‎dead. We also know from Shabbat 156, that when G’d took ‎Avraham outside (Genesis 15,5) that He showed him that ‎according to the constellation of the stars, Sarai was not slated to ‎give birth to children. This ‎מזל‎, astrological prognosis of her life, ‎could be changed only due to merits she would acquire during the ‎years to come. She did indeed acquire such merits, as our sages ‎conclude from a comment they made in Shir Hashirim ‎Rabbah, 2,32 where the phenomenon of all the matriarchs ‎originally being barren is discussed. Among a variety of answers ‎offered there, one is that G’d was desirous of listening to their ‎praying to Him to be granted children, just as He is desirous of ‎listening to the prayers of the righteous, generally. In other ‎words, Sarah, (after a name change) both due to her merits and ‎her supplications, was “lifted” out of the limitations predicted for ‎her by a zodiac sign she had been born under, so that she could ‎conceive. When the Torah refers to her “life” as being 127 years ‎long, this means nothing less than that she had spent all these ‎years accumulating merits for the good deeds she performed. ‎Expressed somewhat differently, the Torah states that it was ‎Sarah, who with her good deeds gave “life” to her years.‎</p>

              <p>An additional lesson to be derived from this unique verse in ‎the Torah, is that seeing that during all her years she cleaved to ‎the Holy name of Hashem, ‎י-ה-ו-ה‎, this fact is hinted at when ‎the Torah summarizes her life her by commencing with a word ‎containing these letters of G’d’s name. She was conscious at all ‎times that her life depended on that attribute of G’d and not, G’d ‎forbid, on the side of the emanations known popularly as the ‎‎sitra achara, “the left side.”‎</p>

              <p>“And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty and seven years, these were the years of the life of Sarah.” (Bereshit, 23:1) The Gemrara (in Berachot, 8a) tells us, “On this every faithful man shall pray unto You at a time when you are found (Tehilim, 32:6). One says this refers to woman, one says this is Torah, one says this is death, and one says this is the toilet.” All of these concern times when a man is in a state of uncertainty over matters beyond his control, and he needs only to pray to God to help him. “One says Torah,” meaning that when he does something, he should pray to God to shine into him the way of Torah, and only act if the Torah permits. “One says that this is woman” means that God should always be before him. One must know, “it is a time to do for God, Your Torah has been made void” (Tehilim, 119:126), which concerns woman, the spouse, as was explained in Parshat Bereshit. (When Adam was uncertain as to whether or not to take Hava’s advice, for she was initially given to Adam precisely to advise him, “eizor c’negdo,” yet he should have not listened to her regarding the tree of knowledge. See above.)  “One says this is death,” for here too one enters into uncertainty. This is as Reb Yochanan said (Berachot, 28b), “there are two ways open before me,” and as it is said (Berachot, 8a), “a man should pray for peace even up to the last handful of earth thrown over his grave.” “One says this is burial,” for even once he is buried there is also a depth, and one enters into uncertainty for his way is open to the world to come, as stated in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabba, 42:6). “One says that this is the toilet,” meaning shame, so that one should pray that nothing he would later be ashamed of will leave his mouth. These five matters are hinted at in this week’s Parsha. “Torah” is hinted at in “Avraham became old,” for “wisdom is acquired with age.” “Woman” is hinted at in Rivka marrying Yitzchak, and also in “and Avraham again took a wife,” for there is a great depth in that it was necessary for him to father all these generations whose roots are not in Kedusha. All the same, Yitzchak will control all these powers, and on all of them will exult the name of God. “One says burial” is hinted at with Sarah, and “death” with Avraham Avinu. “Toilet” is hinted at with the last section concerning the sons of Ishmael, on that which Avraham said, “would that Ishmael live before you,” which was considered as shaming Avraham, as said in the holy Zohar (Bereshit, 205b)</p>

              <p>“And the life of Sarah was ….” (Bereshit, 23:1) It is said in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabba, 38:1) on the verse (Tehilim, 37:18), “God knows the days of the whole-hearted [Temimim in Hebrew; also upright, honest, innocent],” “just as they are whole-hearted, so are their years whole. Reb Yochanan says, ‘like a whole unblemished and perfect heifer.’” The verse tells us (Tehilim, 1:6), “God knows the way of the Tsaddikim [righteous].” In other words, it is the way of the Tsaddikim to know God, in the language of mankind, where that way leads to, and thus the way of the Tsaddikim is cleared of barriers and vanities of this world, leading only to the knowledge of God. And so is the explanation of “God knows the way of the whole-hearted,” meaning that the way of the whole-hearted draws him to the knowledge of God. Knowledge signifies connection and intense cleaving, as in “and Adam knew his wife Chava.” The meaning is to connect and join intensely in God, and it follows that going in this way is the very beginning of their life. In this way the Midrash explains, “and these were the years of the life of Sarah,” meaning that now life truly began, for “God knows the days of the whole.” On this, Reb Yochanan said, “like a whole, perfect heifer.” Eglah in Hebrew, the same letters as agalah, a circle, something round, made in a perfect and complete circle, which has no end, and each point is its beginning, since is singularly encompassing, and “its end is wedged in its beginning” (Sefer Yetsira, ch. 1). Now that her days in this world had been completed, it says, “and these are the lives of Sarah,” for this is the beginning of her life, as explained in the holy Zohar.</p>

              <p>And Sarah’s lifetime etc (Genesis 23:1)  - And the explanation of Rashi &quot;at the age of one hundred she was as a woman of twenty etc beautiful as when she was seven&quot;. And for start, what difference does it make that she was as beautiful as she when was seven? And it appears that Rashi z&quot;l intended that his words would hint to two levels that a person should behave all days of their life. The first is that one should be careful and guard oneself against any type of sin and transgression, one should not transgress any positive or negative commandment. And the second level is that even in permitted things, such as eating and drinking, one interjects all of it in holiness, intending them for heaven: that is, when a person dresses in nice clothes, and wears beautiful adornments, one should intend to be adorning the Image of the King, as explained in the Gemara [source not found], and so in every thing one's intention should be to heaven. And when one behaves in such a way, then anything one has, be it money, clothing, they will feel satisfied with what they have, and will be glad because of that, and their life will be theirs. But if one's intent is not for heaven in any of that, then they will always feel lack, and nothing will ever be enough for them, and they will find that their life is not really life, and is not theirs at all.</p>

'What, Israel, does Ad-nai your God ask of you?' (Deut. 10:12) etc do not read mah (what) but me'ah (100).&quot;(Menachot 43b:15). And one needs to say that the explanation is that the essence of the root of a person is to be in a great surrender, and humble in one's own eyes, and think of oneself as  &quot;mah&quot;, and then one can act on one's deeds as if the Mikdash was still around, and this is the hint of the 100 blessings, as they correspond to the 100 sockets that were in the Mikdash. And this is the explanation of the Gemara &quot;do not read  mah , but  me'ah&quot;, meaning, when you reach the level of mah, in surrender, you will be able to fix also 100 sockets, meaning, that you will be able to act in your deeds as in the time of the Mikdash.</p>

And this what Rashi z&quot;l explained: &quot;at age 100 like age 20 regarding sin&quot;, meaning, just as at age 20, when a person is searching their deeds and finding lacking in them, and seizing with strength the way to fix them, which is the first beginning, as explained, so too she [Sarah] was at age 100, at that same level, and &quot;as age 20 like age 7 for beauty&quot; (Rashi on Genesis 23:1:1) also is understood in that way, since in learning one needs also to exert oneself greatly to understand God's Torah just as when one did at their tender age. And the tzadik that behaves like that, as explained, merits eternal life. And this is &quot;the years of Sarah's lifetime&quot; (Genesis 23:1), using the name  Havayah , connecting with eternal life, &quot;the years of the lifetime of Sarah, all equally good&quot; (Rashi on Genesis 23:1:2) is a hint that once the tzadik reaches that level, then all is similar in their eyes, all is for the good.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Genesis 23:1: Rashi says all of Sarah’s years were good. The Midrash asks: why did Moshe merit to have his face shine? Because, for all of his life, he waited for the glory of Hashem and glory of the Jewish people and for there to be peace between the Jewish people and Hashem. It's known that Hashem created this world as a kindness to His creation; His only intention was to do kindness for the world. [Hence] we always need to draw kindness and mercy to the Jewish people, which is the glory of Hashem, and, concomitantly, the glory of the Jewish people, and it is good to them for all their days. When a person prays for Hashem's name to be sanctified in the world, he needs to attach, to that prayer, [the supplication] that there should be more kindness and mercy and more abundant goodness to the Jewish people since the glories of Hashem and the Jewish people are interdependent. This is the meaning of a Talmudic teaching: &quot;if two people entered a synagogue to pray, and one of them finishes early and doesn’t wait for the other person: his prayers are taken away and he causes the Shechina to depart from the Jewish people.” The meaning [is that treatment of your fellow Jew impacts the glory of Hashem and that] you have to daven for two things-- glory of Hashem and glory of Jewish people and know that they’re interconnected. This is also the meaning of the Mishnaic teaching: whenever you ask about your friend’s welfare, you should mention Hashem's name. [In light of the theme, this means that] when you ask about your friend’s welfare, you should pray for the glory of Hashem [since that, in turn, draws blessing to the glory of the Jewish people and this will result in] your friend’s welfare and peace. Also, in the Torah, Boaz said &quot;Hashem is with you.” [By doing so,] he was blessing the work of their hands. This is also explains the significance of saying the blessing of the Kohanim after the blessings of the Torah [since this draws blessing from Hashem’s glory directly to the Jewish people]. Also, the Talmud says &quot;a Torah scholar is immediately accompanied by blessing.” Additionally, Avraham Avinu said “I will bless those you bless you”: blessing the Jewish people causes the glory of Hashem to be enhanced, as intended in creation. This also the meaning of baruch she’amor: [when it says] blessed is the One Who Spoke and it came to be [and] blessed is the One Who Makes Creation, [this is followed by] blessed is the One Who Has Mercy on His Creations. Hashem bestows goodness, and they sing and praise His name with appropriate blessing: “All powerful G-d, all merciful Father.” G-d is exalted when He has mercy. Moreover, when the Red Sea split, the Jewish people observed the dead Egyptians and saw His great hand, which caused them to sing to Hashem [once again, demonstrating the beneficial dynamic between the glory of Hashem and the glory of the Jewish people]. They sang at their best because of the visible victor; yet, if G-d forbid, it wasn’t that way, the Jewish people would still bless G-d since we bless Him for the good and for the band. However, how would that praise look? Doesn't Hashem's praise need joy? That's the meaning of the verse: satiate us in the morning with your kindness, and we will sing and rejoice all our days. [Thus] that’s the meaning of the verse: the entire life of Sarah was good for the Jewish people forever, amen</p>

            <summary>Rashi explains that the repetition of the word &quot;years&quot; in the description of Sarah's life at different ages is to emphasize that each period represented a separate part of her life, indicating that she was sinless and beautiful at various stages. The Torah also alludes to the fact that Sarah's life was divided into different periods, with her last 37 years being the most significant. Other commentators note that the Torah's unique description of Sarah's life highlights her virtues and the significance of her death, which was related to the purchase of the cave of Machpelah. Additionally, the Torah's wording regarding Sarah's death serves to connect her passing with the birth of Rebecca, indicating a continuity of righteousness in the family.</summary>

This is the numerical value of the word: ויהיו. As long as a person has no child he or she is considered as dead. (Talmud Nedarim, 64)</p>

              </summary>
              <p>מאה שנה, “one hundred years;” Rashi comments on the reason why the word: שנה, “year,” is repeated here three times, when the Torah could have simply written: מאה עשרים ושבע שנה, “one hundred and twenty seven years.” He suggests that the Torah wished us to know that Sarah was as free from sin at a hundred as she had been at twenty, and that she was as beautiful at twenty as she had been at seven. This, of course, raises the question why the Torah, in reporting the death of Yishmael at 137 years (Genesis, 25,32) used exactly the same formulation? We can answer this by pointing out that when reporting Sarah’s age, each group of years is reported separately, as an individual unit, whereas when reporting Yishmael’s age at death, the groups of years are introduced in the construct mode, i.e. מאת, not מאה, i.e. all the years had the same common factor. Not only that, but the Torah sums up her years once more with the words: שני חיי שרה, “the years of Sarah’s life,” i.e. all her years were earmarked by a common denominator. If, when Avraham’s death is reported our sages have seen fit to read something into the way his years are reported, although there too just as at the death of Yishmael we find the word מאת in the construct form, this can be accounted for by the word: ימי, “days of,” which are superfluous and therefore available for interpretation. (Genesis 25,7) Rashi also adds that Sarah was free from sin at twenty as if this was something exceptional; this sounds strange as at that time everyone was free from sin, i.e. not held accountable until the age of twenty? We must understand Rashi as if he had written: ”just as she was free from sin at 20, she remained free from sin until the end of her life. Accountability for sins at the age of 12 or 13 for females and males respectively, commenced only after the Torah had been given. [Our midrashim describe Yishmael as “innocent” when expelled by Sarah, as he was below 20 years of age. Ed.] Sarah had not required cosmetics at twenty anymore than she had required it at the age of seven. We know from Rivkah, who accepted jewelry at the age of three in order to enhance her appearance, that girls in those days felt the need to enhance their natural charms at an early age. (Compare Genesis 24,22) There is a Midrash in pessikta zutrata according to which the reference to her being one hundred as meaning that she was as beautiful at a hundred as she had been at twenty, whereas she was as free from sin at twenty as she had been at seven.</p>

The wording used by the Torah when reporting Yishmael’s life does not lend itself to such an interpretation, seeing that up until his death we had never heard anything about his age, as distinct from Sarah. It is clear therefore that the words underlined earlier were meant to relay an additional message to the reader.</p>

              <p>חיי שרה, “the lives of Sarah;” according to Rashi all the years that Sarah lived on this earth were equal in the sense that she was a good person during all these years. When we look at the way the Torah describes the years of Yishmael after his death, (Genesis 25,17) the Torah describes them in the same terms, i.e. ואלה שני חיי ישמעאל מאת שנה ושלושים שנה ושבע שנים; does Rashi imply that the Torah compliments Yishmael in the same manner as it complimented Sarah? When we accept that the word ואלה, “and these,” are a hint that he had become a penitent, as Rashi derives from the manner in which his burial is described in the Torah in same verse from the fact that he is described as having been gathered into his forefathers, and we know that a proselyte is considered as if newly born from the day of his conversion, i.e. free from sin, it follows that the years he had lived prior to this have now been converted as a prelude to his conversion, i.e. as part of that conversion process. Another way of explaining the Torah’s wording of the death and burial of Yishmael: the Torah did not preface his death with the unusual words: “and the lives of Sarah were,“ words which alert us that they must have more meaning than the plain text suggests. When Sarah’s death is reported the word חיי, “lives of,” is mentioned twice, not only once. This calls for closer examination. Rashi, therefore was quite correct in alerting his readers to this.</p>

              <p>THE LIFE OF. The word life (chayyim) is always encountered in the plural. We never find it in the singular. [A HUNDRED AND SEVEN AND TWENTY YEARS.] Hebrew usually first lists the larger numbers and then the smaller ones. (Verse 1 literally reads, And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty and seven years.)  But we also find the opposite, an example being Scripture’s enumeration of Jacob’s years (Gen. 47:28 literally reads, So the days of Jacob, the years of his life were seven years and forty and a hundred years. Here Scripture lists the smaller numbers first.)  (Gen. 47:28).</p>

              <p>Another reason why the Torah phrases Sarah's lifetime in this unusual manner may be based on Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer 32 where Sarah's death at that time is described as due to the fact that Satan informed her of Isaac's imminent death. The word ויהיו then reflects a &quot;new existence, הויה, &quot;i.e. although she had been allocated a certain number of years at birth, the trauma caused by Satan's information cut short her years. The reason the Torah speaks about חיי שרה, is to remind us that whereas the righteous give life to their days (such as Sarah), the reverse is the case with the wicked.</p>

As to my second explanation that she &quot;lost&quot; a number of years of the life that had been intended for her, you need to understand the kindness that G'd does with the righteous. When such a righteous person dies &quot;prematurely,&quot; for reasons such as in Sarah's case, G'd does not deduct from the sum total of their achievements what such a person would have achieved had he not died before his allotted time. The Torah therefore tells us that Sarah received full credit for all she would have accomplished had she lived out her remaining years (Tanchuma פרשת כי תשא 3).</p>

              <p>אורח חיים למעלה למשכיל למען סור משאול מטה , “for an intelligent man the path of life is upward, so that he may turn away from heading towards hell, downwards” (Proverbs 15,24) In this verse Solomon informed us that an intelligent human being is aware that terrestrial life, by definition, is headed for destruction, for disintegration. He is aware that the true life is to be found only in the “upper regions,” in the celestial spheres, in an environment which is eternal. As a result of such knowledge the intelligent man removes himself from the attractions of the terrestrial world, performs such tasks as are necessary only because they preserve his health and life without making them an objective in themselves. He does so in order to escape the prospect of שאול מטה, “hell and eternal damnation.”   Let me explain this by means of a parable. A person lives in a certain city, aware that his dwelling is only a temporary one. He craves to move to another town where he may be able to secure for himself a permanent residence. While such a person has hope to secure a permanent residence in another city he is certainly not going to make investments in fields, buildings, and other properties which he cannot transfer to the city which he hopes to move to. He will limit his investments and efforts in the city in which he dwells presently to a minimum, conserving his strength to acquire things useful to him when he does make the move.  The intelligent person is aware that the עולם הבא, the hereafter, is the only permanent residence; he will therefore prepare himself in this life for his hereafter so that when he arrives there he will find that a suitable residence has been prepared for him. Having this in mind, Solomon began his book Kohelet with the words הבל הבלים, “vanity of vanities,” whereas he concluded it (Kohelet 12,13) by exhorting his listeners to practice יראת השם, reverence for G’d.  Another way of understanding the verse we have quoted from Proverbs is this: אורח חיים למעלה למשכיל, Solomon is addressing the intelligent person saying to him: ”you, intelligent person that you are, should know that there is a path of life which leads upwards. In order to secure this path of life for yourself you have to abandon the path that leads to hell, downwards.” In other words, you have to abandon your cravings for all kinds of physical pleasures and indulgences as otherwise these physical pleasures will drag you down to hell. According to this interpretation, the word סור is a command, not an infinitive. The whole verse then has to be understood as a warning and commandment to the intelligent human being that if he is really interested in something enduring, something of infinite duration, he must abandon his preoccupation with transient values. The worst danger is to be preoccupied with physical pleasures.   As to the meaning of the word אורח instead of the normal דרך which we would have expected to describe a “path,” the reason for that choice of word is that it suggests something temporary, i.e. a “visitor.” Any human being who lives on earth is nothing but a visitor, a transient (compare Jeremiah 14,8 “why should you be like a stranger on earth, like a guest in need of lodging”). Just as a guest who enters a tavern knowing that he will continue his journey on the following day and that therefore he will stay only for a brief period at that tavern, all the while longs for his proper home, so the intelligent person on earth is aware that there is a life beyond this earth where he will experience proper life. The reason the נפש, “physical life-force,” is known as חיה, is that it operates (lives) only within the domain known as טבע, nature.  Philosophers/researchers have said that this נפש which lives as part of nature dies due to a quirk of fate. Such “quirks” of fate are triggered through sins. The body lives only through being inhabited by such a נפש. The reason that the mortal body ever lived was only because it was connected to this disembodied life-force we call נפש. Separation of this נפש from the body is equivalent to death of the body. It is also known that the death of the body causes the “life” of the נפש, i.e. releases it from imprisonment in a body. This is why Solomon said (Kohelet 7,1) “better the day of death than the day of birth.” He praised the day of death when compared to the day of one’s birth on two counts. On the one hand, dying in this life means transferring to the hereafter. Once the נפש has arrived in that region, it can no longer accumulate merits which will help its stature in the eternal world. Therefore, seeing that death of the body implies birth of one’s afterlife, such a “birthday” spells finis to any moral/ethical achievements of the נפש. At the same time, death of the body puts an end to the trials and disappointments which are an inevitable part of life on earth; achieving freedom from such troubles is preferable to being born to them. Hence, from that angle too the day of death has much to be said for it. Only when a person dies do his achievements during his life on earth become visible, appreciated and irreversible. As long as he is alive we can never be sure that he will not undo any good he may have done previously. Our sages have illustrated this concept in connection with the blessing provided for mankind during the lifetime of Sarah (compare Rashi on 24,67). We are told there that as long as she was alive there was a light burning in her tent which burned from one Friday to the next. Her dough was always blessed and a cloud was seen to hover over her tent. When Sarah died these phenomena disappeared. Only then did her merit become public knowledge, i.e. only then did it become clear that these blessings had been due to her all the time. Moreover, she died on holy soil [the first of the patriarchs or matriarchs of whom death and burial in Eretz Yisrael is reported. Ed.] and was buried in the holy soil of Eretz Yisrael after she had lived a long life.  The Torah writes: “Sarah lived for 127 years, these were the years of the lives of Sarah.” The Torah continues: “Sarah died in Kiryat Arba which is Chevron in the land of Canaan.” This whole passage should have appeared immediately after the Torah concluded its narrative about the binding of Yitzchak seeing that according to Bereshit Rabbah 58,5 the immediate cause of her death were the rumours that her son Yitzchak had been slaughtered. We know that the order in which the various passages of the Torah have been arranged are not accidental, nor are they necessarily chronological. The sequence in which the Torah relates matters to us is of crucial significance to our proper understanding of the message the Torah wishes to teach us. On occasion, the very order in which the Torah relates matters reveals such important truths as that the existence of G’d preceded the universe, or some secrets about the composition of the creatures G’d has created as in this paragraph, or, the Torah takes us into its confidence concerning laws of nature by the wording and the positioning of certain passages such as the first part of Parshat Tazria, where the secrets of who will be born male and who female appear next to the paragraph dealing with certain skin diseases caused by meta-physical rather than natural considerations. The reason why the Torah interrupted its report about the repercussions of the binding of Yitzchak also including the death of his mother Sarah was in order to bring us up to-date on Nachor’s family, seeing that Yitzchak was going to replace his mother with his future wife Rivkah who had been born now so that there would be continuity in Yitzchak’s life and he would continue to experience the blessings he had enjoyed while his mother had been alive. According to a Midrash cited by Rashi the report of Sarah’s death follows immediately upon the report of Rivkah’s birth to inform us that Sarah and Rivkah were viewed as if the younger one was merely the embodiment of the virtues of the senior one, i.e. as if Sarah and Rivkah were virtually one. Had Rivkah’s birth preceded the death of Sarah this would have been impossible; as it were, Sarah had to die first so that her soul could resurface in the body of Rivkah. The word אמו in 24,67 is unnecessary as we all know that Sarah had been Yitzchak’s mother. The reason the Torah wrote this word was to hint that her soul had been reincarnated in the body of Rivkah. When the Midrash stated that as soon as Rivkah moved into the tent of her mother-in-law, the light started burning again and the various phenomena which had been commonplace during Sarah’s lifetime began to manifest themselves anew, this is proof of the metaphysical continuity between Sarah and Rivkah.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>מאה שנה ועשרים שנה ושבע שנים, “one hundred and twenty-seven years.” Ordinarily, the Torah should have written מאה ועשרים ושבע שנים. Still, it is quite acceptable to write the word “year” or “years” after every unit of years in order to separate these 3 different parts of a person’s life by inserting the word “year,” or “years” between each group. It is appropriate to separate a century from a decade and a decade from individual years lived. We find such patterns when the Torah describes the lifetime of Avraham as well as when it describes the lifetime of Ishmael.  The unusual way about describing Sarah’s lifetime is only the repetition of the words שני חיי שרה, “the years of the lives of Sarah.” From these words our sages derive the message that all her years were lived in the same state of piety, etc. A Midrashic approach (Bereshit Rabbah 58,1) to these words: “at 100 she was as free from sin as at 20; at 20 years of age she was as beautiful as at seven years of age.” The meaning of these words is that just as a girl’s looks are apt to improve after she has reached the age of seven, Sarah’s looks kept improving even after she had reached the age of twenty (which is usually the time when physical beauty is at its best). Man’s life is divided into three periods. 1) youth, i.e. the period when one grows towards maturity. 2) maturity; roughly the period between 20-30 before one’s physique begins to decline. 3) old age, a period when decline becomes visible. Another Midrashic approach: The verse may be divided into the sections ויהיו חיי שרה, that the numerical value of the life of Sarah was equivalent to the numerical value of the word ויהיו, i.e. 37. These were the 37 years during which she was able to practice motherhood, having given birth to Yitzchak when she was 90 years old. The second part of the verse which mentions the number 127 records the number of years she lived not from her point of view but from an historian’s point of view.   We find something similar when the Torah reports the years of Yaakov’s life in Genesis 47,28. The numerical value of the word ויחי is 34, i.e. a combination of the 17 years Yaakov enjoyed Joseph’s company after he had been born and the last 17 years of Yaakov’s life when he again enjoyed Joseph’s company. These 34 years were the only truly happy ones he experienced. Another way of looking at the words ויהיו חיי שרה is that they refer to the hereafter. This would reflect the fact that the Torah reported her death immediately after she had heard that Yitzchak’s soul had “flown” to heaven as a result of his having been offered to G’d as a sacrifice. The form ויהיו would hint that both her soul and that of Yitzchak departed from earth at the same time to take up permanent residence in the celestial regions. The word ויהי or ויהיו basically means that something exists permanently. The word שני, “years of,” is deliberately omitted at that point as the very word “year” implies something of limited duration. The same word does, however, appear at the end of our verse, as at that point the Torah underlines another aspect of the message it tries to convey. At that point the Torah speaks about Sarah’s life on earth. Naturally, in that context the words “years of” are very relevant.</p>

              <p>ויהיו חיי שרה מאה שנה ועשרים שנה ושבע שנים .The Torah repeats the word “year” or “years” three times, even though this verse could have been written using the word שנה only once. We encounter a similar “waste” of the word “year” and “years” in Genesis 6,9 in connection with Noach, as well as in connection with בני ישראל, “the Children of Israel” in Numbers 8,19 where that word occurs no fewer than five times We also find such a repetitive use of the word “year” when we are told about Avraham’s death in Genesis 25,7. Even when reporting the death of Ishmael in Genesis 25,17 the word שנה is repeated three times. Some commentators claim that this is a feature of the Holy Tongue, which endeavours to be clear and unambiguous. When a large number of years (unit) is mentioned the word שנה, “year” appears in the singular mode, whereas when less than ten years are mentioned the years appear in the plural mode, i.e. שנים. There is an aggadic approach to these seemingly superfluous words, especially in our verse here (mentioned by Rashi) which sees in the wording an allusion to the fact that Sarah at her death was as pure and beautiful as at 7 or at 20 years respectively. Seeing that the word שנה did not occur at the beginning of the verse, the verse concludes with the summary שני חיי שרה.</p>

              <p>A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS Rashi comments: “The reason the word ‘years’ is written at every term is that it informs you that each term must be interpreted by itself. At the age of one hundred she was as a woman of twenty as regards sin [for at the age of twenty she had not sinned since she had not reached the age when she was subject to punishment], (The Heavenly Court does not punish one for sin before the age of twenty. The verse thus indicates that at the age of a hundred, Sarah never sinned, just as at the age of twenty she had never sinned.)  and at the age of twenty she was as beautiful as when she was seven.” Rashi wrote similarly on the verse, the years of Abraham’s life. (Further, 25:7.)  However, this exegesis of his (Ramban does not disagree with Rashi’s interpretation as this is based on the Rabbis’ comment in Bereshith Rabbah. However, Ramban does dispute which words in the Torah-text are the basis for their interpretation. Thus according to Ramban a similar interpretation would not follow in the verses concerning Abraham and Ishmael.)  is not correct. In the case of the verse, the years of the life of Ishmael, (Further, 25:17.)  it is stated exactly as in the verse, the years of Abraham’s life, (Further, 25:7.)  whereas these years of Ishmael were not all equally good since Ishmael was wicked in his early years, and only in the end did he repent of his evil ways. (See Ramban, ibid.)  Furthermore, the repetition of the word “year” at every term would seem to indicate an intent to distinguish between them and, thus, should not be interpreted to imply equality. Rather, the use of the word shanah (year) and shanim (years) in this instance is the customary usage of the Hebrew language, while that which the Rabbis have said in Bereshith Rabbah, (Bereshith Rabbah 58:1.)  “At the age of one hundred she was as a woman of twenty as regards sin,” is an interpretation which they derived only from the redundant expression, the years of the life of Sarah, which includes them all and equates them. The Rabbis would not make a similar interpretation of the verse concerning Abraham [since in his case Scripture does not conclude with a similar comprehensive expression].</p>

              <p>Es ist hier das einzige Mal, daß in תנ&quot;ך von dem erreichten Lebensalter einer Frau erzählt wird. (Wohl wahrscheinlich darum, weil das Leben der Frauen der öffentlichen Geschichte ferner liegt und ihre Jahre nicht zur chronologischen Feststellung der Begebenheiten Bedürfnis sind). Außerdem ist noch hier die Eigentümlichkeit, daß es heißt ויהיו חיי שרה und nicht שני חיי שרה, und dies muss so eigentümlich sein, daß, was wieder eine Eigentümlichkeit bildet, der Text sich genötigt sieht, dies am Schlusse durch das wiederholte: שני חיי שרה gleichsam berichtigend nachzuholen. Daß die Weisen darauf hindeuten, wie sich hier das Lebensalter in drei Gruppen darstellt, ist bekannt. Nehmen wir es, wie es sich ohne weiteres darbietet, so ist uns gesagt: Sara lebte nicht hundertsiebenundzwanzig Jahre, sondern hundert Jahre, zwanzig Jahre und sieben Jahre. Diese drei Ziffern repräsentieren uns den Entwicklungsgang eines Menschenlebens: das Kindesalter, die reife Jugend, das vollendete Greisenalter. Ein geistig und sittlich vollkommenes Leben lässt sich nicht besser ausdrücken als: er war als Greis Greis, als Mann Mann, als Kind Kind. Ja, die Weisen bemerken: der wahrhaft Lebende nimmt aus jedem Alter die dieses Alter krönende Eigentümlichkeit mit hinein in das spätere Leben. Daher auch der Ausdruck בא בימים, er geht die Tage durch, er geht nicht auf und unter in die Tage, sondern er geht durch sie hin, nimmt alle geistigen und sittlichen Errungenschaften der vergangenen Tage in die kommenden mit hinüber und lässt sich nichts, was wahrhaft &quot;sein&quot; geworden, von den Tagen rauben. &quot;Sara nahm die Schönheit des Kindes mit ins Frauenalter, und die Unschuld der zwanzigjährigen Frau mit ins Grab&quot;. Wie weit ab, und sicherlich nicht zu unserem Vorteil, kontrastiert diese Anschauung der Rabbinen mit der unsrigen! Sie suchen die Schönheit nicht in den Zwanzigern, sondern in dem Kinde, und die Unschuld nicht in der Kindheit, sondern in der reifen Jugend. Wir sind gewöhnt, von &quot;kindlicher Unschuld&quot; zu sprechen. Es wäre traurig, wenn das Kind beneidenswert wäre wegen seiner Unschuld. Unschuld setzt die Möglichkeit einer Schuld voraus, Unschuld heißt Kämpfe gehabt haben mit der Sinnlichkeit und Leidenschaft und Sieger geblieben sein, und nur die zur Frau reifende Jungfrau, sowie der zum Mann reifende Jüngling können sich den Kranz der Unschuld ins Haar winden.</p>

              <p>The reason שנה is written with every set... I.e., and Scripture does not gather the ones and the tens in a set, and the hundreds in a separate set, as it did in Parshiyos Bereishis and Noach. Rashi’s is not asking why it says שנה for 100 years whereas it says שנים for seven years, for also in Parshiyos Bereishis and Noach it is always written שנה for hundreds, and שנים for smaller numbers. Rather, Rashi’s question is about the middle שנה, written after twenty, for שנה is never written three times. Perforce, it is meant to be expounded upon. Since one of them is to be expounded, so too are the rest to be expounded. </p>

              <p>That every set is to be explained by itself. I.e., each set bears its own meaning and does not join with the other sets to form a single sum, as numbers composed of ones, tens and hundreds usually do. This is because the repetitive שנה divides them, placing the ones on their own, and so the tens and the hundreds. According to this [Midrashic interpretation], it is not twenty-seven plus one hundred. Rather, twenty-seven represents the first years within the one hundred. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>At one hundred years old she was like a twenty year old, regarding sin. Rashi implies that from this comparison we learn that all Sarah’s days were good. But Rashi’s next comment — “‘The years of Sarah’s life,’ they were all equally good” — implies that “The years of Sarah’s life” comes to teach that all her days were good. If so, Rashi seems to be contradicting himself! But in fact, this is not a question. On the contrary, from the comparison of one hundred to twenty regarding sin, we would not know that at one hundred she was beautiful as at twenty, since we learn only one quality from each set by itself. Therefore, we still need “‘The years of Sarah’s life,’ they were all equally good.” A further answer: Since שנה is repeated in order to compare one hundred to twenty, which are the first twenty years counting from her birth [see previous entry], therefore, the “twenty-seven” years are within the one hundred and are not the additional years after the one hundred that the verse’s simple meaning infers. If so, we might think that during the twenty-seven years after the one hundred, she had sin and not beauty. This is why we need “The years of Sarah’s life,” to tell us that they were all equally good. And from “The years of Sarah’s life” alone, we would know just that her years were equally good in one quality. Thus it says שנה after each set, to compare them in both qualities: lack of sin and that she possessed beauty. And “The years of Sarah’s life” applies to both [qualities, telling us that in all her years she possessed beauty and she was without sin]. (R. Meir Stern) </p>

              <p>Just as when she was twenty she was not considered as having sinned... Question: Here, Rashi implies that right after turning twenty she was subject to [Heavenly] punishment. But regarding “Noach produced Sheim...” (5:32), Rashi said that before the Torah was given, people were not subject to [Heavenly] punishment until the age of one hundred? The answer is: Sarah was subject to punishment right after turning twenty because they accepted the Torah upon themselves—and after the Torah was given, people were subject to punishment from the age of twenty. Thus, Scripture is telling us that even by post-Torah standards, she was without sin. (Re’m) </p>

A literal rendition of the verse would read: The lifetime of Sarah was one hundred years and twenty years, and seven years, the years of the life of Sarah. Some commentaries explain that the repetition of “years” in the verse teaches that at each stage of her life, whether she was seven, twenty-seven, or one hundred, Sarah exhibited the same good qualities.1 The concluding phrase, “the years of the life of Sarah,” indicates that in each of those stages she lived a full and complete life.</p>

              <p>ויהיו חיי שרה מאה שנה ועשרים שנה ושבע שנים, “Sarah lived for 127 years.” Rashi explains that the reason why the word is repeated twice is to draw our attention to the fact that each period so designated represented a separate part of her life. She was as free from sin at 127 as she had been at the age of 7 and as beautiful at the time of her death as she had been at the age of 20.      Nachmanides writes that Rashi does not derive this information from the repetition of the word שנה, seeing that there is nothing exceptional in this, and the sum total of the lives of lesser individuals has been described in similar terms, Ishmael’s death being reported in a similar fashion to that of Sarah’s, for instance. Rather, we derive this interpretation quoted by Rashi from the superfluous sounding introduction of the words חיי שרה-followed by the words שני חיי שרה. This formulation indicates that all these years had been lived under the aegis of purity and beauty.     There are some books in which the version in the Bereshit Rabbah is as follows בת ק כבת עשרים ליופי ובת עשרים כבת שבע לחטא, “at 100 she was as beautiful as she had been at 20, and at 20 she was as free from sin as at 7. This is the correct version, seeing that girls are more beautiful at 20 than at 7 having learned in the intervening years how to use cosmetics to bring out their beauty.</p>

              <p>“The span of Sarah’s life” [23:1]. The sages said about Sarah that as long as she lived, there was a light from the eve of Sabbath until the next Sabbath. The blessing was in the dough and a cloud hovered over her tent. As soon as Sarah died, these three things stopped, since these three things were seen as a result of her merit. She had the merit to die in the land of Israel and was buried in the land of Israel and lived the fullness of her days. This is the meaning of “The span of Sarah’s life came to one hundred and twenty-seven years” [23:1]. It says that Sarah lived a long time. “And Sarah died” [23:2]. Then Sarah died. It was appropriate for the Torah to write about Sarah’s death immediately after the story of the binding of Isaac, because Sarah died when she heard someone say that her son Isaac was to be slaughtered. However, the Torah immediately wrote that Rebecca was born and Sarah died. This shows us that when one righteous person dies, another righteous person comes into the world. They were written near the binding of Isaac, because Sarah was told how Isaac was bound to be slaughtered. She became very frightened and her soul left her. (Bahya, Hayye Sarah, Introduction.)  Hizkuni writes. Sarah did not need to adorn herself with makeup or other jewelry. People used to adorn themselves at the age of twenty years. However, Sarah did not need to adorn herself with jewelry, but as like a seven year old who is beautiful without any jewelry. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 23:1.)  Bahya and Hizkuni write that the verse “the span of Sarah’s lifetime” [23:1] shows us that the word “and they were” has the numerical value of thirtyseven. That is to say, Sarah truly lived from the time that Isaac was born, which is thirty-seven years. However, the years she lived without Isaac were not called really living, since she was without children. Whoever does not have children, it is as if they are dead. (Bahya and Hizkuni, Genesis, 23:1.)  Ba’al ha-Turim also writes “in Kiryat Arba,” Sarah died in Kiryat Arba. It was called Kiryat Arba, because four pairs were buried there: Adam and his wife, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah. Another explanation is that there were four giants there. (This comment is not found in the Ba’al ha-Turim, but is found in Rashi, Genesis, 23:2.) </p>

Naphtali honored his father and was compared to Sarah and Abraham in terms of righteousness. Abraham was tested ten times and had good deeds, while Sarah converted women.

              <p>“On the twelfth day, prince of the children of Naphtali, Aḥira son of Einan” (Numbers 7:78).  “On the twelfth day, prince of the children of Naphtali, Aḥira son of Einan” – why did Naphtali present his offering after Asher? It is because Asher was called for the happiness [ishuran] of Israel, and Naphtali is called for the Torah that Israel received. What is Naphtali? It is nofet li. This is the Torah, in whose regard it is written: “They are more desirable than gold, than quantities of fine gold, and sweeter than honey and the juices of [nofet] ripe fruit” (Psalms 19:11), and it was given after forty days, the numerical value of li. (Lamed – 30 ; yod – 10; together they equal 40.)  Because the happiness of Israel was contingent upon the Torah, therefore, Naphtali presented his offering after Asher. And just as the thought of Israel arose before the Omnipresent first, (Before creation of the world.)  and then he instituted the Torah for them; that is why He had Asher precede Naphtali. Alternatively, it is because Jacob blessed Naphtali after Asher,  because both of them were equal in the blessing of the land. Asher was “his bread shall be rich” (Genesis 49:20), and Naphtali’s land was “a doe let loose” (Genesis 49:21). That is why here Naphtali presented his offering after Asher.  “His offering was one silver dish, its weight one hundred and thirty; one silver basin of seventy shekels, in the sacred shekel; both of them full of high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering” (Numbers 7:79).  “His offering was one silver dish…” – Rabbi Yudan said: It was corresponding to the patriarchs and the matriarchs that the prince of Naphtali presented his offering. Why is that so? It is because Naphtali honored his father too much, as his father would send him to any place that he wished, and he was speedy in his errands, and he derived satisfaction from him [Naphtali], and his [Naphtali’s] sayings were pleasant for him. This is why his father blessed him as “a doe let loose” (Genesis 49:21), because he would run his errands like a doe. This is why he blessed him with “[who provides] pleasant sayings” (Genesis 49:21), because his sayings were pleasant. That is why Naphtali merited that the Holy One blessed be He exacted retribution from Sisera by means of Barak, who was from Kedesh Naftali. And because Naphtali was diligent in the honor of his ancestors, therefore, the prince of Naphtali learned from his grandfather and adopted his ways and presented his offering in accordance with the fathers and mothers of Naphtali. That is what is written: “His offering was [one silver] dish [kaarat]…” – it corresponds to Sarah, who was the pillar [akeret] of the household, and she was primary among the matriarchs, as she was first. “Silver” – because she was righteous, just as it says: “The tongue of the righteous is choice silver” (Proverbs 10:20). “One” – as she was a righteous woman unique in her generation. “Its weight one hundred and thirty” – as she lived a bit less than one hundred and thirty years, as it is stated: “The lifetime of Sarah was one hundred and twenty-seven years” (Genesis 23:1).  “Basin [mizrak]” – this is Abraham, who was cast out [shenizrak] of his land and his patrilineal house, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Abram: Go from your land, and from your birthplace, and from your father’s house, to the land that I will show you” (Genesis 12:1). “One” – just as it is stated: “Abraham was one and he inherited…” (Ezekiel 33:24). “Silver” – as he was righteous, after: “The tongue of the righteous is choice silver” (Proverbs 10:20). “Seventy shekels in the sacred shekel” – when the Holy One blessed be He entered into a covenant with Abraham, between the parts, (The Covenant between the Parts, known in Hebrew as Berit bein habetarim; see Genesis 15:7–21.)  he was seventy years old, as the decree between the parts was decreed thirty years before Isaac was born; (See Rashi, Exodus 12:40.)  this is the statement of Rabbi Yosei, to realize what is stated: “It was at the end of four hundred and thirty years; it was on that very day that all the hosts of the Lord departed from the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:41).  “Both of them full of high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering” – as both Abraham and Sarah were full of good deeds, as it is stated: “And the people that they had acquired in Haran” (Genesis 12:5) – it teaches that Abraham would convert the men and Sarah would convert the women.  “One gold ladle of ten shekels, filled with incense” (Numbers 7:80).  “One gold ladle of ten shekels” – this is Abraham, who overcame his evil inclination and withstood ten ordeals with which the Omnipresent tested him. “Filled with incense” – as his actions were pleasant before the Omnipresent like the fragrance of the incense.   “One young bull, one ram, one lamb in its first year, as a burnt offering” (Numbers 7:81).  “One goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 7:82).  “One young bull…” – it corresponds to the offerings that the Holy One blessed be He commanded him to prepare when He entered into the Covenant between the Parts with him, just as it says: “He said to him: Take Me a triple calf, and a triple female goat, [and a triple ram, and dove, and a pigeon.] (Genesis 15:9). “Bull” – corresponding to the calf; “ram” – corresponding to the triple ram; “one lamb” – corresponding to the dove and the young pigeon, which were the offering of the poor, instead of the lamb, which is the offering of the wealthy, as it is stated: “If her means do not suffice for a lamb, she shall take two doves, or two young pigeons, one as a burnt offering and one as a sin offering, and the priest shall atone for her, and she shall be purified” (Leviticus 12:8). That is why he sacrificed a lamb instead of a dove and a young pigeon, as there is no poverty in a place of wealth. (In the Tabernacle.)  “One goat…” – it corresponds to the “triple female goat.”   “And for the peace offering, two bulls, five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Aḥira son of Einan” (Numbers 7:83).  “And for the peace offering, two bulls” – it corresponds to Isaac and Rebecca, who were unflawed (A synonym for temimim is shelemim, similar to the zevaḥ hashelamim.)  and children of kings. (Abraham and Betuel were kings. See Bereshit Rabba 42:5.)   “Five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year” – why were there three species: rams, goats, and sheep? They correspond to Jacob, Leah, and Rachel. Why were they of five each? It is because their tally totals fifteen, corresponding to Jacob, Leah, Rachel, and the twelve tribes. The concubines, because they called them maidservants, they did not enter into the tally.  “This was the offering of Aḥira son of Einan” – since the Holy One blessed be He saw that he presented the offering in this order of the patriarchs, He began lauding his offering….</p>

(Only from the age of twenty is one held accountable for those sins that are punishable by heavenly action.)   Another matter, “the Lord knows the days of the faultless [temimim]” – this refers to Sarah, who was faultless in her actions. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Like a calf without blemish [temima]. “Their inheritance will last forever,” as it is stated: “Sarah’s lifetime was” – why was it necessary to say: “The years of the life of Sarah” at the end?

The day that Rabbi Akiva died, Rabbeinu [Yehuda HaNasi] was born, and they applied this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” On the day that Rabbeinu died, Rav Ada bar Ahava was born, and they applied this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” On the day that Rav Ada bar Ahava died, Rabbi Avun was born, and they applied this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” On the day that Rabbi Avun died, his son Rabbi Avun was born. On the day that Rabbi Avun died, Abba Hoshaya of Teriya was born. On the day Abba Hoshaya died, Rabbi Hoshaya was born, and they applied this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.”  Before He caused Moses’ sun to set, He caused Joshua’s sun to rise, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses: Take you Joshua, the son of Nun […and lay your hands upon him]” (Numbers 27:18). Before Joshua’s sun set, the sun of Otniel ben Kenaz rose, (Otniel was the first of the Judges, (as the leaders of Israel were called after Joshua’s death).)  as it is stated: “Otniel son of Kenaz…captured it” (Otniel captured Kiryat Sefer while Joshua was still alive.)  (Joshua 15:17). Before Eli’s sun set, Samuel’s sun rose: “The lamp of God was not yet extinguished, and Samuel was lying in the Sanctuary of the Lord” (I Samuel 3:3). (This is interpreted here as a metaphor: Before the life of Eli, the priest of God, was “extinguished,” Samuel was already in place to act as spiritual leader in the Sanctuary.)  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Like a calf without blemish. (This sentence is an error and should be deleted (Yefe Toar).)  Before the Holy One blessed be He caused Sarah’s sun to set, Rebecca’s sun rose. First, “behold, Milka, she too has borne children” (Genesis 22:20), (One of Milka’s descendants listed there is Rebecca. )  and only then: “Sarah’s lifetime was one hundred years….”</p>

              <p>Our forefather Jacob was 63 when he was blessed. Ishmael died at that time as is written, &quot;Esau saw that Isaac had blessed...Jacob listened to his father...Esau saw [the Canaanite women] were bad [in the eyes of Isaac]...Esau went to Ishmael...&quot;(Genesis 28:9). There seems no need for the verse to state &quot;sister of Nebaioth.&quot; What do we learn from the fact that it says &quot;sister of Nebaioth&quot;? We learn that Ishmael died and Nebaioth [Ishmael's firstborn therefore] married off his sister to Esau. Jacob our forefather hid [from Esau] 14 years in the land of Israel and served Eber. Eber died two years after Jacob went to Aram-Naharaim. [Jacob] left and went to Aram-Naharaim and he was found by the well when he was 77 years old and he was in Laban's house for 20 years: 7 before he married any matriarchs, 7 from when he married in the Matriarchs and 6 years after the 11 tribes and Dinah were born. It comes out that all the tribes were born in seven years besides Benjamin. Each and every one each 7 months. He left Aram-Naharaim and came to Succoth and stayed there 18 months as is written &quot;And Jacob went to Succoth&quot; (Genesis 33:17). He left Succoth and went to Bet El and made 6 new encampments close to the place. </p>

            <summary>The Tosephta d'Zohar emphasizes the importance of humility in this world leading to honor in the world to come, contrasting it with those who seek greatness. The division of Sarah's years into three periods symbolizes her beauty, sinlessness, and motherly role, reflecting the Jewish people's relationship with G-d. The destruction of the Temple led to a loss of closeness with G-d, symbolized by the reduction of letters in words, and the hope for redemption with the coming of the Messiah.</summary>

              <p>In the Tosephta d'Zohar (page 4 on Chayey Sarah, Sullam edition), we read as follows: &quot;Hail to the person who humbles himself in this world for he will be correspondingly more distinguished and highly regarded in the world to come.&quot; He who tries to appear as great in this world, will become insignificant in the world to come. The Torah writes: ויהיו חיי שרה מאה שנה, beginning with a great number, i.e. 100, and continues by describing this in the singular not שנים, but שנה. This is a hint of how someone should humble oneself. On the other hand, when the Torah refers to the smallest unit of her years, i.e. שבע שנים, we have the word &quot;years&quot; in the plural, i.e. שנים. This is an allusion to the type of person who tries to emphasize his importance in this world.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>The symbolisms expressed by the use of בת-אחות-אם &quot;daughter-sister-mother&quot; relationship between G–d and the Jewish people, or the matriarchs and G–d, which we have described on page 137 and later, may be alluded to in the way the Torah divides the number of years Sarah lived into three distinct periods, i.e. &quot;one hundred years, twenty years and seven years&quot; (Genesis 23,1). Bereshit Rabbah 58,1 explains that Sarah was as beautiful at twenty as she had been at seven years of age, whereas she was as free from sin at a hundred years of age as she had been at twenty. The number seven may allegorically be explained as referring to the seven days of Creation (including the Sabbath) before the original light was withdrawn. This association gives Sarah the אם כל חי, &quot;Mother Superior&quot; image. When the Torah was given to the Jewish people and the serpent's pollutant was neutralised, the world was restored to a state when כתנות אור, garments woven of light, could have been worn. The passage dealing with the creation of light in Genesis 1, 3-5, mentions the word אור, light, five times, an allusion to the five Books of Moses, as pointed out in the Midrash. The Zohar sees in the verse commencing with Hashem Hashem in Exodus 34,6 an allusion to the number twenty, i.e. the Ten Commandments and the ten directives by which the universe was created. These complemented each other. When you spell the two letters Yud as words, i.e. יוד, their combined value is also 20. This idea is reflected in the &quot;twenty years&quot; the Torah here speaks of. Although the universe did not actually revert to the condition it had been in prior to withdrawal of the אור בראשית, the original light, the precondition existed, and, but for the sin of the golden calf, Israel would have achieved that status through Torah study and observance, and the original light would have been revealed to them. At the moment the Torah was revealed, the light appeared to them just as it had been during the seven days of Creation. This is the deeper meaning of Proverbs 7,4: אמור לחכמה אחותי את, &quot;Say to wisdom 'you are my sister.'&quot; Israel, due to the Revelation and Torah study, was on the level we have described as אחות. Afterwards, when the people made the golden calf, they ruined even that level of closeness to G–d with the result that the כ in 23,2 became reduced in size. When the Temple, which was one hundred cubits high, was built, this provided some degree of rehabilitation for the opportunity lost through the golden calf. [The Temple the author refers to must be the one of Herod; Solomon's Temple was only thirty cubits high. Ed.] When Bereshit Rabbah 58,1 on our verse next compares Sarah's innocence at one hundred to her innocence at twenty, this is an allusion to the partial rehabilitation during the period of the second Temple. There were public offerings which achieved atonement for the people. Nonetheless, the people were only on the level of בת, (the lowest of the three levels described on pages 137/138). This is why we find Israel referred to as בת ציון, בת ירושלים in Isaiah, Lamentations and elsewhere. The small letter כ in the word ולבכותה is a clear allusion to the aforegoing. When you remove the letter כ completely, you are left with the word לבתה, &quot;to her daughter,&quot; i.e. the word בת, daughter. When the Temple was destroyed, the letter ק was also reduced in size, as pointed out by the Baaal Haturim in his commentray on Genesis 27,46 where Rebeccah expressed disdain for her own life if Jacob, too, were to marry a Canaanite girl. The cause of Rebeccah's desperate outcry, according to Baa l Haturim, was that in her mind's eye she saw the destruction of the hundred-cubit high Temple. When the Temple was destroyed the Jewish people forfeited even the status of בת in their relationship with G–d. For some time after that the most they could achieve in the way of direct communication with G–d was the בת קול, an echo of their former relationship. Nowadays, due to our sins, we do not even experience that form of communication with G–d. This situation will not improve until the Messiah will come, hopefully very soon. At such a time, אור חדש will shine over Zion.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>כמה ימי שני חייך, “for how many years have you lived thus far?” Pharaoh was probably prompted to ask this unusual question of his guest as he looked as if he was exceedingly old. Yaakov, when replying, did not refer to his having “lived” at all, but described his sojourn on earth as something of a very temporary nature, ימי מגורי, “the days of my being a stranger,” as opposed to ימי שני חיי, “the days of the years the life,” the way the Torah had described the life of his grandmother Sarah at her death, reported in Genesis 23,1. He indicated that as opposed to his forefathers, he had had a very troubled life thus far. This resulted in his features reflecting this. An explanation by the Midrash of this strange sounding conversation between the ruler of the civilised world at the time and Joseph’s father: As soon as Yaakov had uttered the words that his life compared unfavourably with that of his father and grandfather, G–d told him “I have saved you from Esau and Lavan, I restored your daughter Dinah to you, as well as your son Joseph, and you have the nerve to describe your life on earth in negative terms when speaking to Pharaoh? I am now forced to make sure that you did not tell a lie, by shortening your lifespan when compared to that of your father and grandfather. He therefore deducted a year for each of the words in this reply by Yaakov, i.e. 33 words, so that he died at 147 years, 33 years younger than the lifespan of his father who had lived for 180 years. [This includes the opening blessing and the concluding blessing Yaakov gave to Pharaoh. Ed.]

              </summary>
              <p>[The only prophecy that may be written] is the twenty-four holy books, [even though] much of it consists of narratives. Nevertheless, they were intended to be recorded in holiness through prophecy or Divine inspiration. (Ruah ha-kodesh, usually translated as Divine inspiration or the Holy Spirit, is a lower level of prophecy than nevuah. Ruah ha-kodesh indicates how the prophet obtained insights from God regarding a vision or event. With nevuah, however, the prophet heard and communicated actual words that he received from God, though they may have been combined with a vision. Since the Hagiographa was written through ruah ha-kodesh, it was mainly written in a style similar to the manner in which people normally speak, whereas the books of the prophets, which were written with nevuah, were couched in a style unlike the usual manner of speech. Because of these differences, the writings that are classified as the books of the prophets are considered holier than the Kesuvim (Hagiographa). See the Netziv in Emek ha-Netziv on the Sifrei, commenting on the Torah portion of Be-ha’alosecha, pesikta 38, and what he writes in Ha’amek Davar on Gen. 23:1.)  It is easy to understand [as will be explained shortly], that in addition to that which is revealed, [the narratives in the Prophets and Hagiographa were in many instances intentionally] distorted in order to teach Israel the wisdom and knowledge that is veiled within the words. (The Netziv may be directing this argument against the Tosafos s.v. Man de-hu, in Tractate Ta’anis 15a, that states that the narratives in the Books of the prophets are not divrei kabbalah, words received through Divine inspiration or conveyed from Moses at Sinai. The responsa of the Havos Da’as, siman 9, claims that this Tosafos was written in “great error” by a student of the Ba’alei ha-Tosafos, the Tosafists.)  There is not a single verse [in Scripture] that does not hint of secrets [of the Torah], the mysteries of science, or matters of ethics. If it appears to us that the [Books of the Prophets] lack substance, it only seems that way to us due to our deficient understanding. This is stated in the Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Peah, 1:1: [When Scripture states]: “For it is not an empty thing for you, [for it is your life],…” (Deut. 32:47.)  this is referring to the Torah. For if it appears empty to you, why is this so? This is because you do not toil in the study of Torah. [When Scripture states], “For it is your life,” [when is it your life]? It is your life when you toil in the study of Torah. [The Torah is not “an empty thing” to you when it becomes “your life”; when you toil in its study].” (Some of this text is not found in our version of Tractate Pe’ah.) </p>

              <p>We need to consider why the Torah enumerates the years of Jacob's life in a different manner from the way it enumerated the lives of Abraham and the other patriarchs. When the Torah told us about the number of years Abraham lived, it commenced with the larger unit first, i.e. 100 years plus seventy years plus five years (compare Genesis 25,7). We find the same thing in Genesis 35,28 when Isaac's life is described; the same also is the case when the Torah described the number of years Sarah lived (Genesis 23,1). Perhaps the reason that the Torah reversed this in Jacob's case is to drive home the point that Jacob's last 17 good years were the key to his whole life.</p>

The mention of Kiryat Arba indicates the location where Sarah passed away, and the small &quot;kaf&quot; in &quot;bewail her&quot; suggests Abraham did not cry excessively due to Sarah's old age. The Torah juxtaposes Sarah's death after the Binding of Isaac, indicating her soul left her upon hearing of the near-sacrifice. Avraham's journey from Mount Moriah to Beer-sheba and then Hebron suggests he was grateful for the miracle and then mourned Sarah.

              <p>ותמת שרה, “Sarah died;” it is most unusual for the Torah to report the fact that a woman died. (Miriam, Moses’ sister’s death are exceptions, Numbers 20,1 as are Rachel’s premature death in Genesis 35,18, and Deborah, Rivkah’s nursemaid in Genesis 35,8.) When such a death is reported it is not only a compliment to the virtuous lives these women had lived, but is always associated with a remarkable event. Sarah’s death is associated with the enormous amount of money paid by her husband for acquiring the land for burying her. Rachel’s premature death is reported so that we should know where she has been buried. Deborah’s death is reported so that we should know why the place where this occurred became known subsequently as אלון בכות, “oak of mourning.” [Also in order to draw our attention to the fact that her mistress, Rivkah’s death has not been reported. Ed.] Miriam’s death was the reason that the well that had accompanied the Israelites throughout their long march in the desert ceased flowing.</p>

              <p>בקרית ארבע, in Kiryat Arba; there is an opinion that the reason why the location where she died is mentioned, while the locations where the other matriarchs died were not mentioned is that Avraham had sent her there before taking Yitzchok with him to be offered as a sacrifice on Mount Moriah. He did not want her to have any knowledge of this. Avraham and Sarah at that time had been residents of B’er Sheva. Another commentator claims that Sarah had moved from B’er Sheva for health reasons as the climate in Chevron (mountainous instead of desert) was more likely to cure her. When she heard why Avraham had taken Yitzchok to Mount Moriah she died. This is why Avraham had to come all the way from B’er Sheva to mourn and bury her. Had she died in B’er Sheva, Avraham could have buried her there without problems as he was at home there.</p>

First it belonged to the tribe of Yehudah; then it became the private property of Calev of that tribe; subsequently it became a city of priests, and eventually one of the cities of refuge.

Compare also in Baba Batra 122. ויבא אברהם, “Avraham arrived.” Some scholars claim that the term: ויבא, need not imply that the subject came from afar, even if he only came from the outside of the house this term is used as we know from Joseph’s entering Potiphar’s house where the Torah wrote: ויבא הביתה לעשות מלאכתו, “he entered the house in order to perform his tasks.” (Genesis 39,11)</p>

              <p>+++ To be proofread +++                  Sarah died in Kiriath-arba—now Hebron.

              <p>ותמת שרה בקרית ארבע. Sarah died at Kiryat Arba. We must not misunderstand that Kiryat Arba was the cause of her death. The reason the town was mentioned and was so named is to tell us that it was built on the four basic elements. Death normally implies a departure from, or disintegration of, the four basic elements that a body is composed of. When the Torah adds that &quot;Kiryat Arba&quot; is also known as חברון, this is an allusion to the word חבור, something that is joined together. The message is that when the righteous &quot;die,&quot; this is not to be viewed as a process of disintegration. The righteous are still called &quot;alive&quot; even when they have ceased to function in regular bodies on this earth. The story in Shabbat 152 about how the grave of Rabbi Achai bar Yoshiah was disturbed by diggers on a property of Rav Nachman and how Rabbi Achai reacted illustrates this concept. What all this means is that while the righteous are alive in this world, the four basic material elements that every human being is composed of become transformed into something spiritual and attach themselves to their souls by means of the good deeds that such persons perform during their sojourn on earth. Maimonides illustrates this somewhat in the fourth chapter of Hilchot Yesodey Torah where he describes that one element is capable of becoming transformed into another element which was similar to it, i.e. earth can be transformed into water. When man cleaves to G'd all his elements become transformed into the element fire which forms the basis of the soul. Kabbalists are familiar with this.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ותמת שרה בקרית ארבע, “Sarah died there at Kiryat Arba, etc.” The main thrust of the verse is to alert us to the fact that this righteous woman died and was buried in Eretz Yisrael. The Torah emphasises that the place called קרית ארבע at that time was renamed חברון afterwards in order that no one should forget that we speak about a town inside Eretz Yisrael. At the conclusion of Sarah’s burial in verse 19, the Torah repeats once more that the cave of Machpelah where she is buried is situated היא חברון בארץ כנען, “at Chevron in the land of Canaan.” The Torah teaches that it was a great privilege to be buried in the same burial ground reserved for such outstanding individuals as Adam, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, a place which would later on (28,17) be called “the gateway to heaven.” [The author apparently views the site where Yaakov had the dream as being Chevron rather than Mount Moriah. Ed.]   The reason the town was called קרית ארבע, “the city of Four,” is because four pairs of outstanding human beings were buried in the cave of Machpelah there. They are: Adam and Chavah, Avraham and Sarah, Yitzchak and Rivkah, and Yaakov and Leah. The mystical dimension of the name חברון is that the soul of everyone buried in that cave joins (מתחבר) the celestial city of G’d, i.e. the four encampments of the שכינה. Our patriarchs would not have made great efforts to be buried there had they not been aware of a profound spiritual dimension involved. They knew that transfer to the עולם האמת from that site would be a crucial experience for them. It is the place from which the souls return to their origin, the throne of G’d’s’ glory.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויבא אברהם לספוד לשרה ולב-כ-ותה, “Avraham came to eulogise Sarah and to weep for her.” If it had been the intention of the Torah to inform us that Avraham came from elsewhere, i.e. from another town, the Torah would have written: “he came from such and such a place.” The meaning of the word ויבא is simply that Avraham roused himself (from his shock) in order to eulogise Sarah. When a person rouses himself to undertake a certain activity, this is described as בא אליה, “coming to it, i.e. coming to grips with the planned activity.” The Talmud in Tamid 4,3 when discussing the skinning and cutting up of of animals which had been slaughtered in preparation for being offered on the altar, uses the expression בא לו לגרה והניח שתי צלעות, בא לו לעוקץ וגו', “when the officiating priest got ready to deposit two ribs near the neck, etc.” The expression בא לו cannot mean “that he came to a certain location,” as a single animal is discussed. All parts were in the same place. It must refer to something different. In Bechorot 20 we encounter Rabbi Akiva saying: לא באתי למדה זו, and it certainly cannot mean “I have not come to this measure,” or something similar. It is clear that the meaning of the word is: “I have not (yet) begun to work on this subject,” or something similar. In our verse too, the Torah describes that now Avraham would attend to the task of eulogising his wife. Had the meaning been that Avraham came from afar, the Torah would have written ויבא אברהם ויספוד את שרה, “Avraham came and eulogised Sarah.”   The two words לספוד לשרה i.e. mentioning her name which was well known to all those present, need clarification. We would have expected simply לספדה ולבכותה, “to eulogise her and to weep for her.” The reason the Torah did not write this abbreviated version is that it is the custom of the professional eulogisers to again and again mention the name of the departed whom they eulogise. We find that when David eulogised King Shaul and his own intimate friend Yonathan, that he spoke of שאול ויהונתן הנאהבים והנעימים, “Shaul and Yonathan the beloved and the cherished ones.” Seeing that in the same chapter (Samuel II 1,18) David already had mentioned both Shaul and Yonathan by name, he could have now referred to them by the pronoun “they.” Nonetheless, during the course of that eulogy David mentions both Shaul and Yonathan by name no fewer than six times.   In our verse, all the Torah had to write was that Avraham set out to “weep for her, and to bury her.” After all, burial is the principal act of true kindness one performs for one’s dead and concludes the acts of eulogising and weeping. Burying a human being is one of the great acts of kindness which G’d Himself performs on occasion. Had the Torah written the sequence of the words we mentioned, the impression this would have created amongst the readers would be that all these activities occurred one immediately after the other. The truth is that whereas eulogising and weeping occurred consecutively, there was quite an interval before Sarah was finally laid to rest. Avraham first had to secure a plot of land in which to bury Sarah. I believe further that if Avraham and Yitzchak came from out of town in order to eulogise Sarah, etc, then the Torah should have written that “Avraham and Yitzchak came to eulogise, etc.” Yitzchak most certainly should also have eulogised his mother and wept for her. In fact, his duty to do so would have been even greater than Avraham’s seeing that he was her flesh and blood. In addition, the love Sarah must have lavished on Yitzchak whom she bore after waiting for him for 90 years must certainly have evoked reciprocal feelings in Yitzchak so that he would have eulogised her. Perhaps, at this point in the story Yitzchak had not heard yet that his mother had died. Seeing that Sarah’s death had been attributed to the binding of Yitzchak, people might have tried to withhold the information from him as long as possible. This is most likely the reason why we do not hear a single word about Yitzchak in the whole paragraph, neither during the eulogy and weeping nor even during the burial ceremony. In fact, we have not heard a word about Yitzchak ever since he took part in the binding on the altar. Although Avraham had told the lads that both he and Yitzchak would return to them from the mountain, the Torah did not report that this happened. All we were told is that “Avraham returned to his lads” (22,19). We would have expected the Torah to write that “Avraham and Yitzchak returned to the lads.” Possibly, Yitzchak had decided to remain for some time on Mount Moriah until he became forty years of age when he married Rivkah. At that point the Torah does mention that Yitzchak had come fromבאר לחי רואי, “from the well of the Living One who Sees,” the well at which Hagar’s prayers had once been answered. According to Bereshit Rabbah 58,5 the words “Avraham came,” mean that he came from Mount Moriah, that Sarah heard about what had transpired there, as a result of which her soul departed from her. This is the reason why this paragraph follows the one of the binding of Yitzchak.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND ABRAHAM CAME. Rashi comments: “From Beer-sheba.” Now this does not mean to imply that Abraham remained in Beer-sheba — as is indicated in the verse, And Abraham abode at Beer-sheba, (Above, 22:19.)  for how then would Sarah have been in Hebron? Rather, the intent is to state that Abraham had gone to Beer-sheba for the day for some purpose, and while there he heard of the death of Sarah and came from there to Hebron to mourn and weep for her. However, the expression of our Rabbis is, (Bereshith Rabbah 58:5.)  “And Abraham came — from Mount Moriah.” This is in accord with the Midrash which the Rabbi [Rashi] previously cited (In his commentary to Verse 2.)  which states that hearing of the Binding [in which her son had been made ready for sacrifice and had indeed almost been sacrificed] her soul flew from her and she died. It would appear that the Divine command concerning the Binding was delivered to Abraham in Beer-sheba for there he dwelt and he returned thereto after the Binding, for so it is written at the outset: And Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba and called there on the name of the Eternal, the Everlasting G-d. (Above, 21:33.)  It further states, And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days. (Ibid., Verse 34.)  This refers to his dwelling in Beer-sheba, which is in the land of the Philistines, and it is there that he was commanded concerning the Binding. It is for this reason that he expended three days on the journey to Mount Moriah, (Ibid., 22:4.)  for the land of the Philistines is distant from Jerusalem. On the other hand, Hebron is in the mountains of Judah, as Scripture testifies, (Joshua 20:7; 21:11.)  and is therefore near to Jerusalem. Thus, when coming from the Binding, he returned to Beer-sheba, as it is said, So Abraham returned to his lads and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba. (Above, 22:19.)  This teaches us that he tarried there and dwelled in Beer-sheba for a period of years. Now if this was the case, Sarah did not die during that period immediately following the Binding for it would not be that Abraham lived in Beer-sheba while Sarah dwelt in Hebron. And so it also appears since Isaac was born in Beer-sheba for it is previously written, And Abraham journeyed from there towards the land of the south and abode between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar, (Ibid., 20:1.)  and Abimelech said to him, Behold, my land is before thee; abide where it is good in thine eyes. (Ibid., Verse 15.)  There in that land Abraham settled in the city of Beer-sheba, for so it is written, And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying. (Ibid., 21:22.)  Though it is not written there that they came to him from Gerar, [as it is written in the case of Isaac], (Further, 26:26.)  from which you might infer that Abraham lived in Gerar, this is not the case. Scripture clearly states that it was in Beer-sheba that they made the covenant. (Above, 21:32.)  Similarly, you will see that when Hagar was sent away from the house of Abraham on the day that Isaac was weaned, (Ibid., Verse 8.)  she walked in the desert of Beer-sheba, (Ibid., Verse 14.)  for it was there that they lived. However, after many days, he [Abraham] journeyed from the land of the Philistines and came to Hebron, and there the righteous woman Sarah passed away. However, according to the Midrash [which states that Sarah died at the time of the Binding], we must say that Abraham and Sarah lived in Hebron at the time of the Binding, and there Abraham was commanded concerning it. The verse which states that On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, (Ibid., 22:4.)  poses this difficulty: Since Hebron is near Mount Moriah, which is in Jerusalem, why did he not arrive at the mountain until the third day? The answer is as follows: The mountain which G-d had desired for His abode (Psalms 68:17. A reference to the fact that in the future the Temple of Jerusalem was to be built on that mountain. See Ramban, above, 22:2.)  was not revealed to him until the third day. Thus for two days he wandered in the environs of Jerusalem, and it was not yet the Divine Will to indicate the mountain to him. After the Binding, Abraham did not return to his place in Hebron. Rather, he went first to Beer-sheba, the place of his tamarisk-tree, to give thanks for the miracle that befell him. It was there that he heard of the death of Sarah, and he came to Hebron. The two apparently divergent opinions — namely, that Abraham came from Mount Moriah and that he came from Beer-sheba — are thus one [since, as explained, on his way from Mount Moriah he went to the tamarisk-tree which was in Beer-sheba, there to give thanks for the miracle]. Accordingly, the verse which states, And Abraham abode at Beer-sheba, (Above, 22:19.)  is intended to indicate that upon his return from the Binding he went to Beer-sheba, and from there he went to bury Sarah. After the internment he immediately returned to Beer-sheba and settled there for years. Scripture, however, concludes the subject of Beer-sheba all at once, and following that it tells of the burial, [which explains the lack of chronology in the verse, And Abraham dwelt in Beer-sheba]. It was there in Beer-sheba that Isaac married Rebekah, as it says, For he dwelt in the land of the South, (Further, 24:62.)  the locus of Beer-sheba. It is thus the opinion of all the commentators that Abraham was in another place, and it was from there that he came to the burial. In my opinion, Sarah had a tent for herself and her attendants. And so it is written elsewhere into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid servants. (Ibid., 31:33.)  Sarah thus died in her tent, and Abraham came into her tent with a group of his friends to bewail her. [This is a simple explanation of the expression, and Abraham came.] It may be that the word vayavo (and he came) indicates that Abraham was bestirred to make this eulogy, and he began to make it, for all who bestir themselves to begin doing a certain task are spoken of in Hebrew as “coming to it.” This usage is quite common in the language of Sages, as we learn in Tractate Tamid: (Tamid, IV, 3.)  “He came to the neck and left with it two ribs on either side…. He came to the left flank…. He came to the rump.” And also (you have) their expression, (Bechoroth 20a.)  “I have not come to this principle.” In Scripture, likewise, you find, he came for his hire, (Exodus 22:14.)  meaning that he came for the purpose of this work and did it for his hire. However, it does not appear to me feasible that Abraham came from another city to Hebron. If that were the case, Scripture would have mentioned that place and would have expressly written: “and Abraham heard, and he came from such and such a place.”</p>

              <p>ויבא אברהם, gewöhnlich: da kam Abraham usw. also war er nicht gegenwärtig bei ihrem Tode. Es wird dahin erklärt: als er von der Akeda nach Hause kam, fand er sein Weib nicht mehr. So wenig misst sich der Lohn, die Verheißung, die den Vätern gegeben worden, nach der Freude und der Heiterkeit, die sie im Leben genießen. Zu dieser Erklärung muß jedoch dann auch noch suppliert werden, daß Sara von Abraham vor seinem Gange nach Moria von Beerscheba nach Chebron entfernt worden war, damit sie den Schmerz nicht plötzlich erhielte. Allein eine Erwägung der ursprünglichen Bedeutung des בוא dürfte diese ganze Voraussetzung unnötig machen. בוא heißt ursprünglich: sich aus dem Freien ins Haus, aus der Öffentlichkeit in einen Privatraum begeben. So bei Gideon (Richter 6, 19) וגדעון בא ויעש וגוי. — (Jes. 26, 20) לך עמי בא בחדריך. — (Jechesk. 3, 23) בא הסגר בתוך ביתך, ziehe dich zurück und schließe dich ein. So auch בוא השמש im Gegensatz zu צאת השמש. Also: Abraham zog sich zurück, schloss sich ein, um zu klagen um seine Sara und sie zu beweinen. Er trägt seinen Schmerz nicht zur Schau, macht kein Gepränge damit. Ob hier nicht darum auch ein kleines כ in לבכתה steht, stellen wir als möglich hin. Wir wissen, was die Sara dem Abraham gewesen, wie unendlich tief der Schmerz gewesen sein muss, wenn ein Abraham eine Sara verliert. Er klagt, er weint, aber er trägt den Schmerz in sich, zu Hause.</p>

              <p>So called because of the four giants that were there... Re’m writes: However, I do not know what brought Chazal to say that Kiryas Arba was named after the four giants [or the four couples], when the city’s ruler was himself named Arba! It is written: “And the name of Hebron previously was Kiryas Arba; he was the greatest man among the giants” (Yehoshua 14:15). Chazal should have said that Kiryas Arba means “the city of the man named Arba,” and then explain why he was named Arba, rather than why the city was named Arba. The Re’m answers: Perhaps it is because Chazal found a reason for the city to be called Arba, but not for its ruler to be called Arba. Therefore they explained that the city was so called because of [the four giants or] the four couples — and the city’s ruler was also called Arba, after his city’s name. </p>

              <p>Another explanation: So called because of the four couples that were buried there... Both explanations are needed, because each on its own raises the question: Why does the city’s name not reflect the reason for its origin? If after the four giants, it should be named Kiryas Anakim, and if after the four couples, it should be named Kiryas Zugos — but not Kiryas Arba. Since it makes no difference that there were exactly four giants, or couples, the city should not be called after a number which is not the reason for its name. That is why Rashi uses both explanations — to say that Kiryas Arba is called after the fact that it contains certain things which relate to the number four. E.g., it has four giants and four couples. But it was not called after one thing alone. Furthermore, we could even say it was called after the thing itself, but was called a number for the sake of brevity. The word “Arba,” alludes to two things the city has, both related to the number four. And since both are equally alluded to, both are included. (R. Meir Stern) </p>

Rather, [Rashi means that the events] are juxtaposed in time, as Chazal had an oral tradition that Sarah died close to the Akeidah, and they found support for this in the phrase, “Avraham came.” [Although Avraham came from Beer Sheva, he was there for just a short while (see Rashi on 22:19), so it is as if he came straight from the Akeidah.] (Re’m) </p>

He delayed the end of his account that Yitzchok was actually saved from slaughter. He “almost” told her that Yitzchok had “not been slaughtered,” but a moment before, she became so shocked by his words that her spirit and soul departed. (Mahara’i)</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויבא אברהם, “Avraham came, etc.” According to Rashi he came from Beer Sheva. Nachmanides adds that Rashi did not mean to imply that at that time Avraham resided in Beer Sheva on a permanent basis, whereas Sarah had resided in Kiryat Arba, (Chevron) as it is quite inconceivable that Avraham and Sarah lived in different locations from each. Avraham heard the news of Sarah’s death while he was in Beer Sheva on “business.” Some commentators think that Avraham at the time was in the process of establishing residence in Beer Sheva, and had wanted to prepare everything before bringing Sarah there also. According to the Bereshit Rabbah, Avraham arrived on his returned from Mount Moriah to find that Sarah had died from the distress that Yitzchok had been sacrificed. Nachmanides writes that according to the report in the Torah the commandment to offer up Yitzchok as a burnt offering was issued when Avraham was in Beer Sheva, where he resided at the time. This was the meaning of 22,34-35 “he planted an orchard in Beer Sheva and he resided there for many years.” This is why it took him three days to get to Chevron, seeing that the land of the Philistines was not that close to Chevron. If Avraham would have had to return from Mount Moriah to Chevron it would not have taken more than a single day at most, whereas the Toah reports that it took him three days to reach Mount Moriah on his way to binding Yitzchok on the altar there. If the Midrash were correct in saying that Sarah died [precisely during the time Avraham performed the binding of Yitzchok, we must assume that at the time of the Akeydah, Avraham and Sarah had both lived in Chevron, so that the meaning of 22,4 “it was on the third day (of Avraham and Yitzchok’s journey to Mount Moriah) must be that G’d for reasons best known to Him, did not want Avraham to locate the mountain until the third day of his journey. He had been walking in the neighbourhood until G’d indicated to him which of the mountains He had had in mind. The reason that he went to Beer Sheva after the binding of Yitzchok was to give thanks for the miracle he had been allowed to experience, and while there the news of Sarah’s death reached him. It is the consensus of all the commentators that Avraham was not at home at the time that Sarah died. My personal opinion is that Sarah had a tent which served as her home as well as the home for her maidservants. She died within her own tent, and the words ויבא אברהם simply mean that he came to her tent upon hearing what had happened It is also possible that the term described Avraham’s preparation to eulogize Sarah appropriately. Whenever a person prepares himself to carry out a certain assignment, the term used to describe the preparation for such an undertaking is ויבא, He came, i.e., “he became ready.” In my opinion, it is most unlikely that the word ויבא means that Avraham came from another city, as the Torah would have mentioned from which city Avraham had to come in order to make burial arrangements for Sarah.</p>

              <p>“Abraham came to mourn Sarah and to bewail her” [23:2]. Abraham came from Beer Sheva to mourn and bewail Sarah. (Rashi, Genesis, 23:2.)  Bahya asks a question. Why does it have to say, “to mourn Sarah”? He had already mentioned her with her name, “and Sarah died.” The explanation is that when a person mourns and cries over the deceased, they would mention and repeat the name many times. Bahya asks another question. Why did Isaac also not mourn and cry over his mother? Scripture only says that Abraham mourned. The explanation is that they did not want to tell Isaac that his mother had died, in the hope that Isaac should not be anguished that his mother had died because Sarah had heard how Isaac was bound to be slaughtered, and her soul left her. That is why Isaac is not mentioned in the eulogy and burial of Sarah. Isaac is also not mentioned from the time that he was bound on Mount Moriah, since he spent three years on Mount Moriah, until he was forty years old and married Rebecca. This is why the verse says, “Abraham returned to his servants” [22:19]. This means, Abraham came back alone from Mount Moriah to his servants, but Isaac remained on Mount Moriah. (Bahya, Genesis, 23:2.)  Toldot Yizhak asks a question. Why did Abraham not purchase a place to bury himself and his wife, since they were already old? The explanation is that Abraham did this with wisdom. He thought to himself. I know well that Adam and his wife are buried in the cave, and it is an important place. Therefore, I will not offer to buy the cave from him. He may not know that Adam and Eve are buried there and may consider the cave to be unimportant. However, if I offer to buy it before Sarah dies, Ephron would think about it. Why does Abraham desire to bury his dead in that cave? There must be something there and he would ask people about this and might learn that Adam and Eve are buried there, making it very expensive. That is why Abraham sent Sarah to Hebron, since she was very old. Perhaps she will die in Hebron, in the land of Canaan and the cave of Adam and Eve is there. Perhaps Sarah will die in Hebron, in the land of Israel. The cave of Adam and Eve is there, and when Sarah will die I will easily receive the cave from Ephron, since the cave is not worth much. If someone will ask, why does Abraham desire this cave? He will say that he wants a burial place. Therefore, Abraham was clever and did not say explicitly that they should give him the cave. Rather, he said: give me a grave so that I can bury my dead that is lying before me on the ground. Therefore, the verse says, “that I will bury my dead before me” [23:4]. That is to say, my dead is before me. It is just that you should give me a burial place. Therefore, the verse says, “bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places; none of us will withhold his burial place from you for burying your dead” [23:6]. That is to say, you must have a burial place, since your dead lies before you, even if it is our best one. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 23:2.) </p>

              <p>“Abraham came to mourn Sarah and to bewail her” [23:2]. The Toldot Yizhak asks a question. Previously, they used to cry and then to mourn. The explanation is that Abraham was full of joy that he had been protected at the binding of Isaac. He first had to praise Sarah that she was very pious. That is why he had to cry, even though he was very happy and had heard the good news that Rebecca had been born, who his son would marry someone of good family. Thus, he was full of joy, and he could not cry. Therefore, he had to first mention her good deeds and then he cried. That is why the letter kof of “bewail her” [23:2] is smaller than normal. He cried little because she had done good deeds and he was full of joy. (Ibid.)  Ba’al ha-Turim writes. He cried little because she died at an old age and one should cry little. Another explanation is that Sarah caused her own death by being overly anxious over the binding of Isaac and that is why Abraham did not want to cry excessively. (Ba’al ha-Turim, Genesis, 23:2.) </p>

              <p>It is a mitzvah for the relatives who are mourning to eulogize the deceased as appropriate and to mention his or her name, but one must not exaggerate in praise of the dead. In the eulogy, people should say things that arouse the listeners to reflection on the essence of human life and its significance, based on the life and behavior of the deceased. The custom of eulogizing the dead is ancient. Abraham eulogized Sarah (Genesis 23:2). Ya’akov was eulogized at length at the threshing floor of the thornbushes (Genesis 50:10). Customarily, eulogies are recited during the funeral and before burial. During Mishnah and Talmud times, there was a regular location for eulogies located next to the cemetery, called a beit hesped (eulogy house). During the post-biblical era, professional mourners sang laments (Jeremiah 9:16). This custom was popular throughout history until recent generations, particularly in the Eastern communities.</p>

Rabbi Levi began: “I said to the revelers [laholelim]: Do not revel” (Psalms 75:5); laholelim, to the confused, those whose hearts are filled with wicked thoughts. Abraham went on a three-day journey. After three days, he saw a cloud fixed on the mountaintop. He said to [Isaac]: ‘My son, do you see what I see?’ [Isaac] said to him: ‘Yes.’ ‘What do you see?’ He said to him: ‘I see a cloud fixed on the mountaintop.’ He said to Ishmael and to Eliezer: ‘Do you see anything?’ They said to him: ‘No.’ He said to them: ‘Since you do not see anything, and this donkey does not see, “stay here with the donkey [im haḥamor]”’ (Genesis 22:5), [indicating they were] peoples comparable to the donkey [am hadomim laḥamor]. At that moment she cried out six cries, corresponding to six shofar blasts. Abraham came to lament Sarah and to weep over her (Genesis 23:2). He was ruminating in his heart, saying that perhaps, God forbid, some disqualification was found in [Isaac] and [therefore] his offering was not accepted.

Mamre, (See Genesis 13:18.)  Kiryat Arba, Hebron.  Why does it [the Torah] call it Kiryat Arba? It is because four [arba’a] righteous men resided there: Aner, Eshkol and Mamre, and Abraham, and four righteous men were circumcised there: Abraham, Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre. Alternatively, it is because four righteous men, patriarchs of the world, were buried there: Adam the first man, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Alternatively, it is because four matriarchs are buried there: Eve, Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah. And [it is called this also] after its lords, who numbered four, the giant and his three sons. (See Joshua 15:14.)   Rabbi Azarya said: It is [so named] because it was from there that our patriarch Abraham departed when he pursued [the armies of] the four kingdoms, who were world leaders. (See Genesis chapter 14.)  It is [so named also] because it fell by lottery to four parties: Initially to Judah, then to Caleb, then to the Levites, and then to the priests.

Come, listen! (Gen. 23, 2) And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. Now, if this were only an honor for the living, should the body of Sarah have been kept till Abraham came, for his honor? Nay! Sarah herself was pleased that Abraham should be honored because of her. Come, listen! All Israel shall mourn for him and they shall bury him. Now, if it is for the honor of the living, were, then, the people of Jeroboam worthy to be honored? The upright are pleased that any human being should be honored on their account. Come, listen! They shall not be mourned for and buried? It is quite right if we assume it is in honor for the deceased, but if it is in honor of the living why not mourn him to give honor to the living? Because the righteous do not wish that they shall be honored because of the wicked. Come, listen! (Jeremiah 34, 5) Thou shalt die in peace; and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee; and they shall lament thee, 'Ah Lord.' Now if it is to the honor of the living, what good can this do to Zedekiah? The prophet said to him thus: &quot;Israel shall be honored because of thee as they were honored because of thy parents.&quot; (Fol. 47) Come, listen! We are taught (Ps. 66, 4) The despicable is despised; this refers to King Hezekiah, who bore the remains of his father on a bed of ropes. Now, if it is for the honor of the living, why did Hezekiah do so? In order that his father should have an atonement. But has he a right to remove the honor of Israel because of the atonement of his father? The people themselves were pleased to relinquish their honor, because of the atonement of Achaz. Come, listen! Rabbi said [in his will]: &quot;Ye shall not lament me in the small cities, but in the large ones.&quot; Now, if it is for the honor of the living, what is the difference in what town?

(The slaves and children of maidservants are lowly, and in that sense comparable to the donkey.)  Then he took Isaac and took him up mountains, took him down hills, and took him up to the peak of a particularly high and steep mountain. He built an altar, arranged the arrangement of wood, bound him upon it, and took the knife to slaughter him. Had the angel not come and said to him: “Do not extend your hand to the lad” (Genesis 22:12), he would have already slaughtered him. When [Isaac] came to his mother, she said to him: ‘Where were you, my son?’ He said to her: ‘Father took me, and took me up mountains, took me down hills, and took me up to a certain mountain. He built an altar, arranged the arrangement of wood, bound me upon it, and took the knife to slaughter me. Had the angel not come and said to him: “Abraham, Abraham, do not extend your hand to the lad,” I would have already been slaughtered.’ When Sarah heard this, she screamed, and did not manage to complete her cry until her soul departed, as it is written: “Abraham came to eulogize Sarah and to weep for her” (Genesis 23:2). From where did he come? He came from Mount Moriah. Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Abraham was ruminating in his heart: Perhaps there was a defect in my son and he was not accepted. (He was deemed unfit to be sacrificed as an offering.)  A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: ‘Abraham, Abraham, “go, eat your bread joyfully…as God has already accepted your actions,” God has accepted your offering.’ Rabbi Mona of Shaab and Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi interpreted the verse as regarding Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur. This is analogous to a province that owed taxes to the king. The king dispatched a tax collector from the treasury to collect it. [When he was] at a distance of ten mil, the prominent leaders of the province emerged and lauded him, and he forgave one-third for them. At a distance of five mil, the middling ones emerged and lauded him, and he forgave one-third for them. When he neared [and was right outside the province], men, women, and children emerged to greet him, and he forgave it in its entirety. He said, ‘What is past is past, from here onward is a new account.’ So too, on the day before Rosh HaShana, the prominent leaders of the generation fast and the Holy One blessed be He absolves them of one-third of their transgressions, as it is stated: “Yet forgiveness is with You, so You will be feared” (Psalms 130:4). Rabbi Aḥa said: Forgiveness is primed for you from Rosh HaShana, “so You will be feared” – so Your fear will be on Your creations. Those days between Rosh HaShana and Yom Kippur, individuals fast, and the Holy One blessed be He absolves them of another third of their transgressions. On Yom Kippur, all of them fast, and the Holy One blessed be He absolves them of another third of their transgressions. When men, women, and children fast, the Holy One blessed be He forgives them for everything and says: ‘What is past is past, and the new account is from here onward.’ A Divine Voice emerges and says to them: “Go, eat your bread joyfully” – your prayer has already been heard. Abba Taḥana the Pious was entering his city on Shabbat eve at [just before] nightfall, and his bundle was on his shoulder. He found a particular [individual] afflicted with boils lying at a crossroads. [The man] said to him: ‘Rabbi, perform for me a charitable act and bring me into the city.’ [Abba Taḥana] said: If I put down my bundle, how will I and my family earn a living? But if I abandon the man afflicted with boils, I deserve to lose my life. What did he do? He had the good inclination overcome the evil inclination and he took the man afflicted with boils into the city, and [then] came and took his bundle and entered with the light of the [setting] sun. Everyone was astonished and saying: Is this Abba Taḥana the Pious? He, too, ruminated in his heart and said: Would you say that I desecrated Shabbat? At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He caused the sun to shine, as it is written: “The sun of righteousness will shine for you, who fear My name” (Malachi 3:20). At that moment, he ruminated in his heart and said: Would you say that I will not receive reward? (He was concerned that the miracle was reward for his good deed and he would not receive reward in the World to Come.)  A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Go, eat your bread joyfully, and drink your wine goodheartedly, as God has already accepted your actions.” You will receive your reward. Another matter, [the verse] “go, eat your bread joyfully,” is speaking of Daniel, the beloved man, as it is stated: “I was still speaking in prayer, and the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the previous vision, was flying swiftly [mu’af bi’af]” (Daniel 9:21); he flew and flew again. “He explained and spoke with me” (Daniel 9:22). Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Daniel, the beloved man, said: The Holy One blessed be He knows that I finished my prayer and He sent an angel (Gabriel.)  and spoke with me, as it is stated: “He explained and spoke with me.” What did he say to me? He said to me: At the beginning of your supplications a word went forth” (Daniel 9:23). He said to me: I issued a decree that the Temple will be rebuilt. I said your request will be fulfilled at the beginning of your supplications, [but did not tell you until now] “because you are beloved,” (Daniel 9:23), for He desired his prayer. (God desired Daniel’s prayers.)  Rabbi Shmuel bar Onya [said] in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Beloved is written here three times, “beloved” (Daniel 9:23), “beloved” (Daniel 10:11), “beloved” (Daniel 10:19). [Gabriel] said to him: You are very beloved. You are beloved to your Creator, you are beloved to His entourage, and you are beloved to His Torah, as it is written: “For from the first day that you set your heart to understand, and to fast before your God, your words have been heard” (Daniel 10:12), your prayer has been heard. A Divine Voice emerged and said to him: “Go, eat your bread joyfully” – your prayer has already been heard.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>(Lev. 16:1:) NOW THE LORD SPOKE UNTO MOSES AFTER THE DEATH &lt; OF AARON'S TWO SONS &gt;. This text is related (to Ps. 75:5 [4]): I SAY TO THE MERRYMAKERS (la-holelim): DO NOT MAKE MERRY…. &lt; La-holelim means &gt; &quot;to those who create confusion (la-ma'arbavya').&quot; (Tanh., Lev. 6:2; PRK 26(27):3; Lev. R. 20:2.)  These are the ones whose heart is full of evil intrigues (holhaliyot). (Although the main text reads holhaliyot, Buber cites the word in his notes as the more traditional halholiyot. In either case, whatever the spelling, the midrash interprets holelim and holhaliyot as coming from the same root.)  R. Levi called them &quot;Woe-makers.&quot; (Dehonayya’ [zehonayya’]. The word seems coined as a pun on “merrymakers” (holelim). See Jastrow, p. 373, s.v., WYNY’.)  These are the &lt; MERRYMAKERS (holelim) &gt; who bring woe (alelay) into the world. (Ps. 75:5 [4], cont.:) TO THE WICKED, DO NOT LIFT UP THE HORN. The righteous have not been happy in my world, so would you seek to be happy in my world? [The first Adam was not happy in my world, so would you seek to be happy in my world?] R. Levi said in the name of R. Simeon [ben Menasya]: The round of the first Adam's heel outshone (Literally: Made dim &lt; by comparison &gt;.)  the sphere of the sun. (PRK 4:4; 12:1; 26(27):3; PR 14:10; as well as Tanh., Lev. 6:2; Lev. R. 20:2.)  [And do not be surprised at this. According to universal custom, when a person makes two small plates, (Gk.: diskarion.)  one for himself and one for his household, whose does he make the more beautiful? Is it not his own? So the first Adam was created for the service of the Holy One, but the sphere of the sun was created for the service of mortals. Is it not all the more certain that the round of the first Adam's heel outshone the sphere of the sun?] Now if the round of Adam's heel outshone &lt; it &gt;, how much the more &lt; must &gt; the countenance (Gk.: charakter; or possibly krystallos; Lat. crystallum.)  of his face &lt; have outshone it &gt;. R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina: The Holy One set up thirteen canopies for the first Adam in the Garden of Eden, as stated (in Ezek. 28:13): YOU WERE IN EDEN, THE GARDEN OF GOD, EVERY PRECIOUS STONE WAS YOUR COVERING. Then after all this glory, &lt; he was told &gt; (in Gen. 3:19): FOR DUST YOU ARE AND UNTO DUST YOU SHALL RETURN. Abraham was not happy in my world, so would you seek to be happy in my world? Abraham had a son born to him at the end of a hundred years. Then the Holy One said to him (in Gen. 22:2): PLEASE TAKE YOUR SON, YOUR ONLY SON. So he journeyed, as written (in vs. 4): AND ON THE THIRD DAY [ABRAHAM LIFTED HIS EYES] AND SAW. What did he see? He saw a cloud joined to the mountain. He said to his son: My son, what do you see? (See above, Tanh. (Buber), Gen. 4:46, and the note there.)  He said to him: I see a beautiful mountain with a cloud joined to it. He said to his lads: Do you see anything? They said to him: We see a mountain and a hill. He said to them (in vs. 5): STAY HERE WITH ('M) THE DONKEY, &lt; i.e., STAY HERE, YOU &gt; PEOPLE ('M) WHO ARE LIKE THE DONKEY. (So Yev. 62a; Ket. 111a; Qid. 104a; BQ 49a; Nid. 17a; Eccl. R. 9:7:1; PRE 31. See also Gen. R. 56:2; PR 40:6.)  He took his son Isaac and went up to the top of the mountain. Then he built the altar, arranged the wood, bound him upon the altar, and took the knife. If the Angel had not said to him (in vs. 12): DO NOT RAISE [YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD], he would have already been slaughtered. When he came to his mother, she said to him: What did your father do to you. He told her: Daddy took me, brought me up mountains, brought me down valleys, brought me up to the top of a particular mountain, and built an altar. So he told the whole story. If the Angel had not said to him (in Gen. 22:12): DO NOT RAISE [YOUR HAND AGAINST THE LAD], I would have already been slaughtered. She said to him: Woe (vay) to you, &lt; my &gt; poor son! If &lt; the angel &gt; had not said to him (in vs. 12): DO NOT RAISE &lt; YOUR HAND &gt;, you would have already been slaughtered! She did not succeed in finishing the sentence before her breath departed from her. It is so stated (in Gen. 23:2): AND ABRAHAM PROCEEDED TO MOURN FOR SARAH AND WEEP FOR HER. From where had he &lt; just &gt; come? He had &lt; just &gt; come from Mount Moriah. (Eccl. R. 9:7:2.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>[(Gen. 24:1:) NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.] This text is related (to Prov. 31:10): WHO CAN FIND A GALLANT WIFE? (Cf. Tanh., Gen. 4:4.)  About whom were the words spoken? &lt; They were spoken about Sarah &gt; since it is written above (in Gen. 23:2): AND ABRAHAM PROCEEDED TO MOURN FOR SARAH AND WEEP FOR HER, &lt; i.e., &gt; he began to weep and eulogize. So he said: When shall I be able to get &lt; another wife &gt; like you? (The midrash is interpreting Prov. 32:10ff. as Abraham’s eulogy over Sarah.)  (Prov. 31:10:) A GALLANT WIFE. This was Sarah, as stated (in Gen. 12:11): SEE HERE NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL-LOOKING WOMAN. (Prov. 31:10, cont.:) HER VALUE WAS FAR BEYOND THAT OF RUBIES, in that you came from afar. Thus it is stated (in Is. 46:11): SUMMONING A BIRD OF PREY FROM THE EAST, MY CONFIDANT FROM A FAR COUNTRY. (Prov. 31:11:) HER HUSBAND'S HEART HAD CONFIDENCE IN HER: This was Sarah, as stated (in Gen. 12:13): [PLEASE SAY YOU ARE MY SISTER] SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH ME BECAUSE OF YOU. (Prov. 31:11, cont.:) AND HE HAS NO LACK OF PROFIT. This refers to our father Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 13:2): NOW ABRAHAM WAS VERY RICH. (Prov. 31:12:) SHE DID GOOD FOR HIM AND NOT EVIL. This refers to Sarah, since it is stated (in Gen. 12:16): AND BECAUSE OF HER, IT WENT WELL WITH ABRAHAM. (Prov. 31:13:) SHE LOOKS FOR WOOL AND FLAX, &lt; in choosing &gt; between &lt; flaxen &gt; Ishmael and &lt; the pure wool of &gt; Isaac. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:9f.): THEN SARAH SAW THE SON OF HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN … AND SAID TO ABRAHAM: CAST OUT THIS SLAVE WOMAN &lt; AND HER SON &gt;…. (Prov. 31:14:) SHE WAS LIKE THE MERCHANT SHIPS, in that she was moving from place to place and from country to country. Like such a vessel which goes from place to place on the sea (according to Prov. 31:14, cont.): SHE BRINGS HER FOOD FROM AFAR. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 20:16): THEN HE SAID UNTO SARAH: SEE, I HAVE GIVEN YOUR BROTHER A THOUSAND SILVER PIECES. (Prov. 31:15:) SHE ALSO AROSE WHILE IT WAS STILL NIGHT AND GAVE FOOD TO HER HOUSEHOLD. When? (In Gen. 22:3:) SO ABRAHAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING…. (Prov. 31:15, cont.:) AND GAVE FOOD TO HER HOUSEHOLD, EVEN A STATUTE (The usual translation here is PORTION, but STATUTE better fits the Tanhuma context.)  FOR HER YOUNG WOMEN. (Gen. 17:26:) ON THAT VERY DAY ABRAHAM WAS CIRCUMCISED…. Now STATUTE can only mean circumcision, as shown (in Ps. 105:10): AND HE ESTABLISHED IT (i.e., Abraham's covenant) FOR JACOB AS A STATUTE, FOR ISRAEL AS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT. (Of course, Abraham’s EVERLASTING COVENANT meant circumcision.)  (Prov. 31:16:) SHE SET HER MIND ON A FIELD AND BOUGHT IT. Thus, while she was alive, she had her mind on obtaining the cave of Machpelah AND BOUGHT IT, for here she is buried in it (cf. Gen. 23). (Prov. 31:16, cont.:) FROM THE FRUIT OF HER HANDS SHE PLANTED A VINEYARD, as stated (in Gen. 21:33): AND HE PLANTED A TAMARISK TREE. What is the meaning of AND HE PLANTED? &lt; It is &gt; as you say (in Gen. 9:20): AND HE PLANTED A VINEYARD. (Prov. 31:17:) SHE GIRDED HER LOINS WITH VIGOR, when Abraham said to her (in Gen. 18:6): HURRY UP WITH THREE SEAHS OF FINE MEAL…. (Prov. 31:18:) SHE PERCEIVED THAT HER MERCHANDISE WAS GOOD; AND (in Gen. 21:7) SHE SAID: WHO WOULD HAVE SAID TO ABRAHAM THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN? (Prov. 31:18, cont.:) HER LAMP WOULD NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT. When? (In Gen. 14:15:) THEN HE DEPLOYED &lt; HIS FORCES &gt; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT. (The verse assumes that Sarah was waiting up for Abraham to return from battle.)  (Prov. 31:21:) SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID FOR HER HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE OF SNOW. When? When the Holy One showed him Gehinnom (with its snow), she foretold that none of her children would go down into its midst. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 15:17): THERE APPEARED A SMOKING OVEN AND A FLAMING TORCH. Why? Because they fulfilled two commandments, (as shown in Prov. 31:21, cont.): BECAUSE ALL HER HOUSEHOLD ARE CLOTHED TWOFOLD, (The traditional text vocalizes TWOFOLD to mean CRIMSON.)  i.e., with the Sabbath and with circumcision. (Prov. 31:22:) SHE MADE COVERINGS FOR HERSELF. When? When they said to him (in Gen. 18:9): WHERE IS YOUR WIFE SARAH? He said to her: You have received good news that you are to bear &lt; children &gt;, and from them will go forth high priests who will serve in the Tent of Meeting. (Prov. 31:22, cont.:) HER CLOTHING IS LINEN AND PURPLE, as stated (in Exod. 26:31): &lt; AND YOU SHALL MAKE A VEIL OF &gt; {LINEN} [BLUE] AND PURPLE…. (Prov. 31:23:) HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES. When Sarah died, old age sprang upon Abraham and he was called elderly. Now it is stated (in Gen. 23:6, after the report of Sarah's death): HEAR US, MY LORD, YOU ARE A PRINCE OF GOD IN OUR MIDST. Ergo, HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES; &lt; and the verse continues &gt; immediately: AS HE SAT AMONG THE ELDERS OF THE LAND. He had become old; therefore, it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.</p>

              <p>R. Levy opened (with Ps. 75:5), “I say to the merrymakers (la-holelim), ‘Do not make merry;’” [‘la-holelim’ means] those who create confusion (ma'arbavya'). (PRK 26(27):3; Lev. R. 20:2.)  These are the ones whose heart is full of evil intrigues (holhaliyot). (Although the main text reads holhaliyot, Buber cites the word in his notes as the more traditional halholiyot. In either case, whatever the spelling, the midrash interprets holelim and holhaliyot as coming from the same root.)  R. Levi called them &quot;woe-makers&quot;; (Dehonayya’ [zehonayya’]. The word seems coined as a pun on “merrymakers” (holelim). See Jastrow, p. 373, s.v., WYNY’.)  these are the ones who bring woe (alelay) into the world. (Ps. 75:5, cont.:) “To the wicked, do not lift up the horn.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the evil ones, “The righteous have not been happy in My world, so would you seek to be happy in My world? The first Adam was not happy in My world, so would you seek to be happy in My world?” R. Levi said in the name of R. [Simeon] ben Menasya], “The round of the first Adam's heel outshone (Literally: Made dim [by comparison].)  the sphere of the sun.” (PRK 4:4; 12:1; 26(27):3; PR 14:10; Lev. R. 20:2.)  And do not be surprised at this. According to universal custom, when a person makes two small plates, (Gk.: diskarion.)  one for himself and one for his household, whose does he make the more beautiful? Is it not his own? So the first Adam was created for the service of the Holy One, blessed be He, but the sphere of the sun was created for the service of mortals. Is it not all the more certain that the round of the first Adam's heel outshone the sphere of the sun? Now if the round of Adam's heel outshone [it], how much the more [must] the countenance (Gk.: charakter; or possibly krystallos; Lat. crystallum.)  of his face [have outshone it]. R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina, “The Holy One, blessed be He, set up thirteen canopies for the first Adam in the Garden of Eden, as stated (in Ezek. 28:13), ‘You were in Eden, the garden of God, every precious stone was your covering; sapphire, turquoise….’” R. Shimon ben Laquish said, “Eleven.” Our masters said, “Ten.” And they do not disagree. The one that made thirteen of them, makes three out of “every precious stone was your covering”; the one who made them eleven, makes one out of it; and the one that makes ten of them, does not make any from them. Then after all this glory, [he was told] (in Gen. 3:19), “for dust you are and unto dust you shall return.” Abraham was not happy in My world, so would you seek to be happy in My world? Abraham had a son born to him at the end of a hundred years. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Gen. 22:2), “Please take your son….” So he journeyed, as written (in vs. 4), “And on the third day [Abraham] lifted [his eyes and saw]….” What did he see? He saw a cloud joined to the mountain. He said to his son, “My son, do you see what I see…?” (See Tanh. (Buber), Gen. 4:46, and the note there.)  This is that which is written (in Gen. 23:2), “and Abraham come to mourn for Sarah and weep for her.” From where had he [just] come? He had [just] come from Mount Moriah. (Eccl. R. 9:7:2.)  The Holy One, blessed be He, as it were, was not happy in His world, so should people seek to be happy in His world? &quot;The Lord [was] happy in His works&quot; is not written here (in Ps. 104:31), but “let the Lord be happy [in His works].” And when will He rejoice in His works? When He will rejoice in the actions of the righteous in the world to come. (See M. Pss. 75:2.)  Israel was not happy in My world, so would you seek to be happy in My world? &quot;Israel [was] happy in its Maker&quot; is not written here (in Ps. 149:2), but “Let Israel be happy in its Maker,” because it is in the future that they are going to be happy in the Holy One, blessed be He. It is therefore written (in Ps. 75:5), “I say to the merrymakers, ‘Do not make merry.’”</p>

              <p>And Abraham was old, and well stricken in years (Gen. 24:1). Scripture states elsewhere in reference to this verse: A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband (Prov. 12:4). This verse alludes to Abraham, who mourned for Sarah, for it was written previously: And Sarah died (Gen. 23:2). Abraham began to weep for her, saying: A woman of valor who can find? For her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her (Prov. 31:10). When did he demonstrate his trust in her? When he said to her: Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister (Gen. 12:13). She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life (Prov. 31:12). She seeketh between wool and flax (ibid., v. 13) alludes to her decision to separate Isaac and Ishmael when she said to her husband: Cast out this bondwoman and her son (Gen. 21:10). She is like the merchant ships (Prov. 31:14); For the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house (Gen. 12:15), and later Abimelech sent her away. She riseth also while it is yet night (Prov. 31:15). When did that happen? At the time Abraham arose early in the morning (Gen. 22:3). She considereth a field and buyeth it (Prov. 31:16). She thought about the field of Machpelah and acquired it. Ultimately she was buried there, as it is said: And after this, Abraham buried Sarah, his wife (Gen. 23:19). She girdeth her loins with strength (for the birth of Isaac) (Prov. 31:17). When was that? When the angels appeared, as it is said: And Abraham went into the tent unto Sarah (Gen. 18:6).</p>

              <p>Another matter, “after the death [of the two sons of Aaron]” (Leviticus 16:1). Rabbi Levi began: “I said to the revelers [laholelim]: Do not revel” (Psalms 75:5); laholelim, to the confused, (The word laholelim is being interpreted to mean mixed up, as in the verse “mixed [mahul] in water” (Isaiah 1:22) (Etz Yosef). )  those whose hearts are filled with wicked thoughts. Rabbi Levi would call them woe-generators, because they bring woe to the world.   “And to the wicked, do not raise your horn” (Psalms 75:5). The Holy One blessed be He said to the wicked: ‘The righteous did not rejoice in My world, and you seek to rejoice?’ Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya: The ball of the heel of Adam the first man would outshine the sun, all the more so the radiance of his face. (Nonetheless, despite his greatness, Adam did not rejoice, as he sinned almost immediately after his creation. Similarly, no man should rejoice (Maharzu, based on Tanḥuma, Aḥarei, 2). )  Do not wonder, as the way of the world is that if a person crafts bowls, one for himself and one for a member of his household, whose does he craft more beautifully? Is it not his? So too, Adam the first man was created for the service of the Holy One blessed be He, and the sun was created for the service of the creations.  Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: The Holy One blessed be He tied thirteen canopies for him in the Garden of Eden, as it is stated: “You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your canopy: ruby, topaz and clear quartz, beryl, onyx and chalcedony, sapphire, carbuncle, emerald and gold; the craftsmanship of your settings and your sockets was in you, on the day of your creation they were prepared” (Ezekiel 28:13). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said there were eleven [canopies] and the Rabbis said there were ten. But they do not disagree. (They do not disagree about the fact that the number of canopies is derived from the aforementioned verse in Ezekiel. )  The one who considers them thirteen considers “every precious stone was your canopy” as three. (He understands that the words every, precious, and stone allude to an additional three canopies, in addition to the ten types of precious stone listed explicitly in the verse, which each refer to a canopy crafted from that stone. Alternatively, he understands that the term “every” itself indicates three (see Maharzu). )  The one who considers them eleven considers it as one. (The phrase “every precious stone was your canopy” alludes to one additional canopy. )  The one who considers them ten does not consider it as one. After all this praise, “for you are dust and to dust you will return” (Genesis 3:19). (Despite the great glory accorded Adam, God informs him that he is created from dust and will die and return to dust. )   [God said to the wicked:] ‘Abraham did not rejoice in My world and you seek to rejoice?’ A son was born to him at the age of one hundred, and ultimately, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Take now your son…[and offer him up there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains that I will tell you]” (Genesis 22:2). Abraham went on a three-day journey. After three days, he saw a cloud fixed on the mountaintop. He said to [Isaac]: ‘My son, do you see what I see?’ [Isaac] said to him: ‘Yes.’ ‘What do you see?’ He said to him: ‘I see a cloud fixed on the mountaintop.’ He said to Ishmael and to Eliezer: ‘Do you see anything?’ They said to him: ‘No.’ He said to them: ‘Since you do not see anything, and this donkey does not see,  “stay here with the donkey [im haḥamor]”’ (Genesis 22:5), [indicating they were] peoples comparable to the donkey [am hadomim laḥamor]. He took Isaac his son, took him up mountains and took him down hills. He took him up on one of the mountains, built an altar, arranged the wood, set the arrangement, and took the knife to slaughter him. Had it not been that an angel called him from the heavens, he would have already been slaughtered.  Know that it is so, as Isaac returned to his mother and she said to him: ‘Where have you been, my son?’ He said to her: ‘My father took me, took me up mountains, took me down hills…’ She said: ‘Woe unto the son of that woman full of grief, had it not been for the angel you would have already been slaughtered.’ He said to her: ‘Yes.’ At that moment she cried out six cries, corresponding to six shofar blasts. (By Torah law, the mitzva of shofar on Rosh Hashana requires three broken blasts (terua), each preceded and followed by a straight blast (tekia), for a total of nine blasts. The six straight blasts required correspond to Sarah’s six cries (Etz Yosef). )  They say that she did not complete them before  she died. That is what is written: “Abraham came to lament Sarah and to weep over her” (Genesis 23:2). From where did he come? He came from Mount Moriah. Abraham had been ruminating in his heart, saying that perhaps, God forbid, some disqualification was found in [Isaac] and [therefore] his offering was not accepted. A Divine voice emerged and said to him: “Go, eat your bread with joy” (Ecclesiastes 9:7).  ‘Israel did not rejoice in My world.’ It does not say “Israel rejoiced in its Maker,”  but rather: “Israel will rejoice in its Maker” (Psalms 149:2). They are destined to rejoice in the deeds of the Holy One blessed be He in the future. As it were, the Holy One blessed be He did not rejoice in His world. It does not say: “The Lord rejoiced in His works,” but rather: “will rejoice” (Psalms 104:31). The Holy One blessed be He is destined to rejoice in the actions of the righteous in the future.   Elisheva bat Aminadav did not rejoice in the world when she saw five crowns [attained by her relatives] on one day. Her brother-in-law (Moses.)  was king, her brother, (Naḥshon.)  a prince, her husband, (Aaron.)  High Priest, her two sons, (Nadav and Avihu.)  the two deputy priests, her grandson Pinḥas anointed for war. When her sons entered to sacrifice and were burned, her joy was transformed into mourning. That is what is written: “After the death of the two sons of Aaron.”</p>

              <p>It is a great מצוה to bury the dead and to eulogize them, and to take special pains to eulogize a Torah scholar and to weep for his passing. Abraham taught us this as the Torah reports: ויבא אברהם לספוד לשרה ולבכותה, &quot;Abraham arrived to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her&quot; (Genesis 23,2). Even though this commandment is not enumerated as a separate positive commandment in the 613 commandments, it is included in the general commandment והלכת בדרכיו, &quot;endeavor to emulate G–d's ways; just as He buries the dead, (quoting G–d burying Moses in Deut. 34,6) so you too are enjoined to bury the dead,&quot; as we have discussed at the beginning of פרשת וירא.</p>

              <p>The symbolisms expressed by the use of בת-אחות-אם &quot;daughter-sister-mother&quot; relationship between G–d and the Jewish people, or the matriarchs and G–d, which we have described on page 137 and later, may be alluded to in the way the Torah divides the number of years Sarah lived into three distinct periods, i.e. &quot;one hundred years, twenty years and seven years&quot; (Genesis 23,1). Bereshit Rabbah 58,1 explains that Sarah was as beautiful at twenty as she had been at seven years of age, whereas she was as free from sin at a hundred years of age as she had been at twenty. The number seven may allegorically be explained as referring to the seven days of Creation (including the Sabbath) before the original light was withdrawn. This association gives Sarah the אם כל חי, &quot;Mother Superior&quot; image. When the Torah was given to the Jewish people and the serpent's pollutant was neutralised, the world was restored to a state when כתנות אור, garments woven of light, could have been worn. The passage dealing with the creation of light in Genesis 1, 3-5, mentions the word אור, light, five times, an allusion to the five Books of Moses, as pointed out in the Midrash. The Zohar sees in the verse commencing with Hashem Hashem in Exodus 34,6 an allusion to the number twenty, i.e. the Ten Commandments and the ten directives by which the universe was created. These complemented each other. When you spell the two letters Yud as words, i.e. יוד, their combined value is also 20. This idea is reflected in the &quot;twenty years&quot; the Torah here speaks of. Although the universe did not actually revert to the condition it had been in prior to withdrawal of the אור בראשית, the original light, the precondition existed, and, but for the sin of the golden calf, Israel would have achieved that status through Torah study and observance, and the original light would have been revealed to them. At the moment the Torah was revealed, the light appeared to them just as it had been during the seven days of Creation. This is the deeper meaning of Proverbs 7,4: אמור לחכמה אחותי את, &quot;Say to wisdom 'you are my sister.'&quot; Israel, due to the Revelation and Torah study, was on the level we have described as אחות. Afterwards, when the people made the golden calf, they ruined even that level of closeness to G–d with the result that the כ in 23,2 became reduced in size. When the Temple, which was one hundred cubits high, was built, this provided some degree of rehabilitation for the opportunity lost through the golden calf. [The Temple the author refers to must be the one of Herod; Solomon's Temple was only thirty cubits high. Ed.] When Bereshit Rabbah 58,1 on our verse next compares Sarah's innocence at one hundred to her innocence at twenty, this is an allusion to the partial rehabilitation during the period of the second Temple. There were public offerings which achieved atonement for the people. Nonetheless, the people were only on the level of בת, (the lowest of the three levels described on pages 137/138). This is why we find Israel referred to as בת ציון, בת ירושלים in Isaiah, Lamentations and elsewhere. The small letter כ in the word ולבכותה is a clear allusion to the aforegoing. When you remove the letter כ completely, you are left with the word לבתה, &quot;to her daughter,&quot; i.e. the word בת, daughter. When the Temple was destroyed, the letter ק was also reduced in size, as pointed out by the Baaal Haturim in his commentray on Genesis 27,46 where Rebeccah expressed disdain for her own life if Jacob, too, were to marry a Canaanite girl. The cause of Rebeccah's desperate outcry, according to Baa l Haturim, was that in her mind's eye she saw the destruction of the hundred-cubit high Temple. When the Temple was destroyed the Jewish people forfeited even the status of בת in their relationship with G–d. For some time after that the most they could achieve in the way of direct communication with G–d was the בת קול, an echo of their former relationship. Nowadays, due to our sins, we do not even experience that form of communication with G–d. This situation will not improve until the Messiah will come, hopefully very soon. At such a time, אור חדש will shine over Zion.</p>

              <p>The Tziyoni writes in a gloss on פרשת בראשית that the reason we are to be so careful with observing the details of the legislation of צרעת, blemishes of the skin, the clothes, or the house, is that we are dealing here with inner blemishes, i.e. sins, which have become visible externally. G–d has been very kind in externalizing the effect of these sins so as to give the afflicted person an opportunity to repent and rid himself of the pollutant of the serpent which his sins are due to. The priest is the only one who can effect a cure because the priesthood originated in the &quot;right&quot; side of the diagram of emanations in the emanation חסד, whereas the pollutant of the serpent has its origin in the &quot;left&quot; of the diagram of emanations, the side from which Samael originates. Nowadays, when we do not have priests who can perform the steps leading to the rehabilitation of an afflicted person (including the sacrifices he has to bring at the end of the period of his isolation as outlined in Leviticus 14,2-32), repentance is the only instrument by which we can cleanse ourselves. The right hand of G–d is always stretched out to welcome penitent sinners. </p>

                <h4>English Explanation of Pirkei Avot 5:19:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Whoever possesses these three things, he is of the disciples of Abraham, our father; and [whoever possesses] three other things, he is of the disciples of Balaam, the wicked. A good eye, a humble spirit and a moderate appetite he is of the disciples of Abraham, our father. An evil eye, a haughty spirit and a limitless appetite he is of the disciples of Balaam, the wicked. What is the difference between the disciples of Abraham, our father, and the disciples of Balaam, the wicked? The disciples of Abraham, our father, enjoy this world, and inherit the world to come, as it is said: “I will endow those who love me with substance, I will fill their treasuries” (Proverbs 8:21). But the disciples of Balaam, the wicked, inherit gehinnom, and descend into the nethermost pit, as it is said: “For you, O God, will bring them down to the nethermost pit those murderous and treacherous men; they shall not live out half their days; but I trust in You” (Psalms 55:24). This mishnah contrasts those who follow the ways of Abraham with those who follow the ways of Balaam, the wicked prophet who was hired by Balak to curse Israel (Numbers 22-24).  We should note that the rabbis understood Balaam as an archetype of evil, even though in the Torah itself he seems to be more of an ambivalent character, acting as merely a passive messenger of God.  In Sanhedrin 10:2 we learned that Balaam does not have a portion in the world to come.  Balaam is also seen by the rabbis as greedy for he attempted to take a bribe to curse Israel. In contrasting Abraham with Balaam we should note that both saddle their own donkeys in the Torah (Abraham in Genesis 23:2 and Balaam in Numbers 22:21).  Perhaps this similarity led to their comparison in our mishnah, and in several other sources. Abraham is known for three things:  generosity, humility and temperance. He demonstrates his generosity when he brings generous portions of food to the messengers who visit his home (Genesis 18:17).  He is humble when he negotiates the purchase of a grave for Sarah.  He states, “I am a resident alien among you” (Genesis 23:4, see also his words in 18:27).  His temperance in appetite is learned from a midrash on Gen. 12:11, where he states to Sarah, “Behold, I now know that you are a beautiful woman”.  According to the midrash Abraham had not looked at her until that moment. In contrast, Balaam is greedy for he pursues the reward he would have received for cursing Israel.  In Numbers 22:18 he states, “Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold”.  Rashi comments that from here we can see that Balak had already begun to think about the material reward that he might receive.  He is haughty as we can see from his statement, “The word of him who hears God’s speech, who obtains knowledge from the Most High” (Num 24:16).  He has a limitless appetite, for a midrash teaches that after he failed in cursing Israel, he advised Balak to allow the Moabite women to prostitute themselves to Israel, and thereby ensnare them in idol worship (see the beginning of Numbers 25).  He would not have advised such a thing if he himself did not desire such sexual licentiousness. The second half of the mishnah teaches the rewards that will be given to the disciples of Abraham and the punishments that will be given to the disciples of Balaam.  The verse from Proverbs is understood as referring to Abraham’s disciples since “those who love me” is also used in reference to Abraham (Isaiah 41:18).  The verse in Psalms is understood as referring to Balaam since he was murderous, for he advised Balak to seduce Israel and thereby led to the death of 24,000 Israelites (Num 25:9).</p>

              <p>'ישפוט ה, our sages in Rosh Hashanah 16 say that if someone invokes Divine judgment on a fellow Jew, he or she will become subject to such judgment first. They derive this from Genesis 23,2 where Avraham mourned Sarah's death, i.e. she who was 10 years junior to him died first. The Talmud assumes that this rule applies in examples such as ours, when Sarai had no evidence that Avram had been aware of Hagar's insolence toward her. Had he become aware of this firsthand, there is no question that he would not have tolerated such behavior from Hagar against her. It is quite inconceivable that Avram should have remained silent when his wife was being insulted. This was so in spite of the fact that Hagar had been raised in status to be his wife instead of being merely Sarai's slave.</p>

              <p>As with the problematic use of the phrase, “Let Us make man,” the Akeida could not be accomplished without an important trade-off. In Bereshit 23:2, the rabbis tell us that when Sarah heard of the Akeida, her soul flew out of her body. (This is based on the juxtaposition of the story of the Akeida and the account of Sarah’s death and burial (semichat parashiot).)  However we are to understand this, hers is not the portrait of a desirable and timely death. Hearing about Avraham’s intention to kill Yitzchak could well have overtaxed Sarah’s emotional resources and logically led to her demise. The rabbis are telling us that Sarah could have been an inevitable victim of the events that had just transpired.</p>

              <p>It is also possible to explain it in this way: when Abraham was circumcised, God said he was now “blameless” (tamim), (See Exodus 17:1 When God made the covenant with Abraham the Torah says: “When Abram was ninety-nine years old, יהוה appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am El Shaddai.*El Shaddai. Walk in My ways and be blameless (Tamim).)  to inform him that the sins of his father, Terah, would be rectified through Job. The first letters of the statement &quot;God appeared to him at Alonei Mamrei, ” (See Genesis 18:1 וַיֵּרָ֤א אֵלָיו֙ יְיְ בְּאֵלֹנֵ֖י מַמְרֵ֑א This is the statement immediately after Abraham has circumcised himself.)  spell “his father.&quot; (אביו)  They are also the letters that make up the Hebrew name of Job. (איוב)  They hint that Job was reincarnated from Terah to atone for idolatry with which he rebelled against God. Some time later I came across the book, Zera Barekh. (Possibly a work by Rabbi Menachem Manli, died in 1740)  The author writes: the soul of Terah came to be in Job. The gematria of the word Vayera is the same as B’ruach, “Containing the spirit” counting the word. (In HaKollel is a strategy for Gematria in which one counts the word in addition to the numerical value of the letters.)  He also writes that Vayera elav Adonai b’elonei mamre contains the letters oyev (enemy) and Iyov (Job), hinting that the soul of Terah, transmigrated into Job. The name of Job is also alluded to in the expression tiratz oyev, “Adonai shatters foes.” This accords with those who interpret, “Abraham came to mourn Sara and bewail her,” (Gen. 23:2) to mean that he had just come from Terah’s burial and that Terah lived until the binding of Isaac. As long as Terah was alive, Abraham faced suffering and trials to atone for his father. When Terah died he no longer faced the suffering because of his father. Terah's soul was transmigrated to Job to complete the rectification. This is alluded to by the word Vayavo, “And he came,” which is made up of the letters aveev, his father, and oyev, enemy. Implying that there was peace for Abraham after the death of his father since Job would now complete the atonement. That is why the final letters of the “Terah died in Haran,” (Genesis 11:32)  spells nahat, peace. Scripture states, “Abraham was old, advanced in years, and God blessed Abraham with everything,” (Gen. 24:1) because after Terah’s death Abraham did not experience sorrow as a result of his father. In the future Terah would be reincarnated as Job.The gematria of the first letters of the words “Old advanced in years God blessed,” (זקן בא בימים וה' ברך It equals 19.)  has the same gematria as Job. For the sake of his father, Job came, allowing Abraham to live in peace. Later I saw what Rabbi Shapira wrote in, Megaleh Amukot. (Nathan Nata Spira 1585 – 20 July 1633 was a Polish rabbi and kabbalist, who served as Chief Rabbi of Kraków. A student of Meir Lublin, Spira played an important role in spreading Isaac Luria's teachings throughout Poland. Spira was the author of a number of works, most notably the Megaleh Amukot.

Sarai stated that God should judge Abram for his actions. And it is written: “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her” (Genesis 23:2), as Sarah died first. The Gemara comments: And this matter applies only in a situation where he has someone to do judgment for him on earth and has no need to appeal to the heavenly court.</p>

Praying for God to pass judgment on another causes one’s own deeds to be examined and compared with the deeds of the other, as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My anger be upon you; I have given my maid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; let the Lord judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5), and it is written afterward: “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her” (Genesis 23:2).

And if you say that a eulogy is delivered due to the honor of the living, would they have unduly delayed burying Sarah due to Abraham’s honor? The Gemara rejects this argument: It was satisfactory to Sarah herself that her funeral was delayed so that Abraham could be honored by eulogizing her. Since Sarah herself would prefer that Abraham eulogize her, there was no disgrace in waiting for Abraham to arrive.</p>

            <summary>The Ari'zal sees in Genesis 21:12 a reference to the &quot;feminine&quot; side of Yitzchok in the diagram of the 10 emanations, with Sarah being emphasized in Yitzchok's birth. Avraham's contribution to Yitzchok's soul is highlighted, as seen in the repetition of Avraham begetting Yitzchok in the Torah. This interpretation is supported by Bereshit Rabbah 58:5, which suggests that Avraham came from Mount Moriah to bury Sarah, who died from anguish when told Yitzchok was slaughtered. The Midrash also suggests that Avraham &quot;came&quot; to contribute his soul to Yitzchok, as implied in Genesis 21:12.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>Another way of looking at our verse is that of the ‎‎Ari’zal, who sees in the words ‎כי ביצחק‎ in Genesis 21,12 a ‎reference to the “feminine” side of Yitzchok in the diagram of the ‎‎10 emanations, i.e. the earthly element, seeing that the angel had ‎said to Avraham (Genesis 18,10) ‎והנה בן לשרה אשתך‎, “and here ‎your wife Sarah will have a son.” [The angel emphasized Sarah as ‎predominant in Yitzchok’s birth, not his father Avraham. Ed.] ‎However, subsequently he would receive a soul contributed by ‎Avraham, Avraham representing the masculine element of the ‎chart of the emanations. This point is made by the Torah here ‎repeating what otherwise would be assumed, that Avraham begot ‎Yitzchok. The Ari’zal’s comment also coincides with the ‎meaning of Bereshit Rabbah 58,5 in which the Midrash, ‎referring to Genesis 23,3 where Avraham is reported as “arriving” ‎in order to bury Sarah, asks: “where did Avraham arrive from? ‎Where had he been previously?” One of the answers given by the ‎Midrash is that Avraham came from Mount Moriah. The ‎‎Midrash adds that Sarah died as a result of the anguish she ‎experienced when told that Yitzchok had been slaughtered. She ‎had found this incompatible with G’d’s promise to Avraham that ‎ברך אברכך והרבה ארבה את זרעך‎, “I will continuously bless you and ‎greatly multiply your descendants” which G’d had said to ‎Avraham in Genesis 22,17.‎ At this point the author attributes to this Midrash a ‎third answer to the question whence Avraham came to arrange ‎Sarah’s funeral. I have not found this in any of my editions, ‎although this is the answer that would tie in with our verse ‎above. The Midrash supposedly views as Avraham “coming” ‎i.e. contributing the soul to Yitzchok as alluded to in the words ‎‎(Genesis 21,12) ‎כי ביצחק יקרא לך זרע‎.‎</p>

            <summary>Abraham rose from his deceased wife Sarah to speak with the children of Heth, as it is customary to stand when addressing an assembly. The Torah uses the term &quot;dead&quot; to refer to the body, emphasizing the physical aspect of death, and Abraham's actions demonstrate proper etiquette for addressing a group of people. Abraham's request for the cave of Machpelah was not a simple transaction due to the nature of the land, and he wanted witnesses present to ensure the validity of the purchase.</summary>

              <p>ויקם אברהם מעל פני מתו...וידבר אל בני חת, “Avraham rose up from the presence of his dead and he spoke to the Hittites, etc.” The local inhabitants were members of the tribe of the Hittites. The Torah had reported in Genesis 10,15 that Chet (Heth) was one of the sons of Canaan. All of the tribes residing in the land described as the “land of Canaan,” were sons of Canaan, the grandson of Noach.  The Torah taught us something concerning good manners, namely, that if one addresses an assembly of people one needs to be standing upright rather than sitting down. The Torah repeats the formula ויקם אברהם, “Avraham rose, etc.” again in verses 7-8. It appears to have been an established custom that when an individual addressed a community that the individual first rose in order to do so. When he concluded whatever he had to say, he would resume his seat. When Avraham referred to himself as a resident stranger (verse four), he did so while standing up. In verse five he apparently already resumed his seat. Had he not done so, why would verse 7 again mention that Avraham rose, etc.? Whenever Avraham wanted to say something in front of the people assembled at “the gate of the city,” he rose from his seat first. As to the unusual masculine construction in the words מעל פני מתו instead of מתה seeing that Sarah had been a female, the reason for this is that the word גוף, body, is masculine. Now that Sarah had died, she was only a body. The soul of a person does not die. Hence, the word מתו is absolutely appropriate here.</p>

              <p>The claim of the community of Israel to the Land of Israel in its entirety as its historic homeland is predicated upon God's covenant with Abraham (Genesis 15:7-21). However, with regard to three specific geographic areas—the Cave of Machpelah, the Temple Mount and Shechem—title to the land is based upon more conventional grounds. These particular sites are described in Scripture as having become the property of our ancestors by right of purchase long before they acquired title to the rest of the Land of Canaan. The uniqueness of these areas is underscored by the sages of the Midrash. (Bereshit Rabbah 79:7.)  Why, impliedly queries the Midrash, is the narrative concerning Abraham's purchase of the sepulchre in the field of Machpelah spelled out in such minute detail (Genesis 23:3-17)? Why does the Bible so carefully identify the individual from whom David purchased the Temple Mount (II Samuel 24:18-25)? Why does the Torah relate that Jacob pitched his tent in Shechem and that he purchased the plot of land upon which he pitched his tent for the sum of 100 kesita (Genesis 33:19)? Answers the Midrash: &quot;So that the nations of the world will not be able to taunt Israel saying, 'These [lands] are in your possession by virtue of theft.' &quot; These historical facts are recorded for a specific purpose, viz., so that for all of posterity the gentile nations will never be in the position of being able to taunt the community of Israel with the claim that Israel lacks clear title to those historic sites.</p>

            <summary>The term &quot;kam&quot; in Hebrew is a homonym with multiple meanings, including rising physically and confirming or verifying something.

              </summary>
              <p>THE term kam (he rose) is a homonym. In one of its significations it is the opposite of “to sit,” as “He did not rise (kam) nor move for him” (Esth. 5:9). It further denotes the confirmation and verification of a thing, e.g.: “The Lord will verify (yakem) His promise” (1 Sam. 1:23); “The field of Ephron was made sure (va-yakom) as the property of Abraham” (Gen. 23:17). “The house that is in the walled city shall be established (ve-kam)” (Lev. 25:30); “And the kingdom of Israel shall be firmly established (ve-kamah) in thy hand” (1 Sam. 24:21). It is always in this sense that the verb is employed with reference to the Almighty; as “Now shall I rise (akum), saith the Lord” (Ps. 12:6), which is the same as saying, “Now shall I verify my word and my dispensation for good or evil.” “Thou shalt arise (takum) and have mercy upon Zion” (Ps. 102:13), which means: Thou wilt establish what thou hast promised, viz., that thou wouldst pity Zion.</p>

Rather, if they appear to be in dispute, know that they merely are clarifying the judgment, so that justice for the people of the world will be brought to light with true justice.

              <p>“…and they had no children. Elazar and Itamar served as priests.” Rabbi Yaakov bar Aivu in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: If they had sons, they  would have taken precedence over Elazar and Itamar, as whoever takes precedence for inheritance takes precedence regarding honor, provided that he conducts himself in accordance with the custom of his fathers.  “Elazar and Itamar served as priests in the presence of [al penei] Aaron, their father.” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: During his lifetime; Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: After his death. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said during his lifetime, here, it is stated al penei and there it is stated al penei, as it is written: “Haran died al penei Teraḥ his father” (Genesis 11:28). Just as al penei stated there is during his lifetime, so, too, al penei that is stated here is during his lifetime. According to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, who said after his death, here, it is stated al penei and there it is stated al penei, as it is written: “Abraham rose from al penei his dead” (Genesis 23:3). Just as al penei stated there is after death, so, too, al penei that is stated here is after his death. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said during his lifetime, if impurity befell Aaron, Elazar served; if impurity befell Elazar, Itamar served.  There was an incident involving Shimon ben Kimḥit who went out to speak with the king of the Arabs, and a drop of saliva sprayed from his mouth onto his garments and impurified him. Yehuda, his brother, entered and served in his stead in the High Priesthood. That day, their mother saw her two sons as High Priests. The Sages taught: Kimĥit had seven sons, and all of them served in the High Priesthood. The Sages said to her: ‘What good deeds do you have to your credit?’ She said to them: ‘So help me, in all my days, the beams of my house never saw the hair of my head.’ They said: ‘All flour [kimḥa] is flour [kimḥin], but Kimḥit’s flour [kimḥa] is fine flour.’ They read this verse in her regard: “All the glory of the king’s daughter is within” (Psalms 45:14).  According to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba who said: After his death, when Aaron died, Elazar his son served. When Elazar died, Itamar served. That is why it is stated: “Elazar and Itamar served as priests al penei Aaron, their father.”</p>

              <p>“Abraham arose from before his dead, and he spoke to the children of Ḥet, saying” (Genesis 23:3).  “Abraham arose from before his dead” – this teaches (The verse can also be translated: “Abraham arose from before death.” The angel of death was intimidating him and urging him to bury Sarah promptly.)  that he saw the angel of death provoking him.  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where is it derived what we learn in a mishna: One whose dead one [a deceased relative] is lying before him (That is, he is charged with burying the body.)  is exempt from the recitation of Shema, from prayer, and from wearing phylacteries, as well as all mitzvot in the Torah? (Mishna Berakhot 3:1.)  It is from here: “[Abraham] arose…and he spoke.” (He did not engage in any other activity prior to his burying his dead.)  “I am a sojourner and a resident among you: give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” (Genesis 23:4).  “A sojourner [ger] and a resident”; ger means one who dwells as a tenant; toshav means a landlord. [Abraham was saying:] ‘If you prefer, I will act as a tenant, (Humbly beseeching your permission to bury Sarah.)  but if not, I will act as a landlord, (And take it without your consent.)  as this is what the Holy One blessed be He has said to me: “To your descendants I have given this land”’ (Genesis 15:18).  “Give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” – I am requesting [a plot] for only one dead person, as it is stated: “Give me a burial plot with you, [and I will bury my dead].”  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham, saying to him” (Genesis 23:5).  “Hear us, my lord: you are a prince of God in our midst, in our choicest graves bury your dead; none of us shall withhold his grave from you, from burying your dead” (Genesis 23:6).  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham…Hear us, my lord…” – you are king over us, you are prince over us, you are like a god to us. He said to them: ‘Let the world not fail to accept its true King, let the world not fail to accept its true God.’   “In our choicest graves” – in the choicest one of our many graves.   “Bury your dead” – many dead. (Although Abraham had requested a single grave site, for Sarah, the children of Ḥet offered him a site for many burials.)  “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land, the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 23:7.   “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land” (The verse does not say that Abraham bowed “to” the people, but that he bowed “before” them. He bowed to God in their presence, giving thanks for his good fortune in obtaining the permission he had sought.)  – from here we learn that one should give thanks [to God] over hearing good tidings.</p>

Aha, “If they had had children, they would have taken precedence over Eleazar and Ithamar, since whoever takes precedence with respect to inheritance takes precedence with respect to honor, provided that he follows the behavior of his forebears.” (PRK 26(27):10; Lev.

Isaac, who said, “During his lifetime,” 'al-pene is mentioned here, and pene is also mentioned elsewhere (in Gen. 11:28), “And Haran died in the lifetime of ('al-pene) his father Terah.” If pene as used elsewhere (i.e., in Gen. 11:28) [means] during his lifetime, pene as used here (in Numb. 3:4) also [means] during his lifetime. According to the opinion of R. Hiyya bar Abba, who said, “At his death,” pene is used here (in Numb. 3:4) and pene is used elsewhere (in Gen. 23:3), “Then Abraham arose from beside ('al-pene) his dead (i.e., his dead wife).” If pene as used elsewhere (in Gen. 23:3) [means] at his death, pene as used here (in Numb. 3:4) also [means] at his death. Now according to the opinion of R. Isaac, who said, “during his lifetime,” [when] uncleanness befell Aaron, Eleazar ministered; [when] uncleanness befell Eleazar, Ithamar ministered. There is a story about Simeon ben Gimhit, (He was high priest in 17-18 C.E.)  that he went out to speak with the king of the Arabians. (TYoma 4(3):20; yYoma 1:1 (38d); yMeg. 1:12(10) (72a); yHor. 3:3/5(2) (47d): Yoma 47a; ARN, A 35:4.)

Hiyya bar Abba, who said, “At his death,” when Aaron died, Eleazar ministered; when Eleazar died, Ithamar served in his place. R. Abba bar Abbina said, “For what reason is the parashah [about the death of] of Miriam (Numb. 20:1) near the parashah of the ashes of the [red] heifer (Numb. 19:1ff.)? (PRK 26(27):11; Lev. R. 20:12; yYoma 1:1 (38b); MQ 28a.)  Simply to teach that just as the ashes of the [red] heifer atones, so does the death of the righteous atone.” R. Judan said, “For what reason is the death of Aaron (Deut. 10:6) near the breaking of the tablets (Deut. 9:17)? To teach that the death of the righteous is as grievous to the Holy One, blessed be He, as the breaking of the tablets.” R. Hiyya bar Abba said, “The sons of Aaron died on the first of Nisan. (According to Lev. 10:1, they died at the time of the dedication of the Tabernacle; and according to Exod. 40:17, the dedication began with its erection on the first day of the first month, i.e., on the first of Abib, which came to be called Nisan.)  For what reason does it mention their death on the Day of Atonement (in Lev. 16:1)? It is simply to teach that, just as the Day of Atonement atones, so does the death of the righteous atone.” And where is it shown that the Day of Atonement atones? Where it is stated (in Lev. 16:30), “For on this day atonement shall be made for you to cleanse you.” And where it is shown that the death of the righteous atones? Where it is stated (in II Sam. 21:14), “Then they buried the bones of Saul […] and God responded to the plea of the land thereafter.”</p>

At the time Jacob fled to Aram-naharaim, the angels in the land of Israel protected him and guided him—to the border of the Holy Land. When they departed, other angels descended to escort him. Upon his return from Laban’s home, the angels to whose care he had been entrusted accompanied him to the border of the Holy Land, where the angels in the land of Israel, upon perceiving that Jacob had arrived, went out to meet him to escort him, as it is said: And the angels of God met him (ibid., v. 2).

Rabbi Yaakov bar Avin said in the name of Rabbi Avin in the name of Rav Aḥa: If they had sons, they would have taken precedence over Elazar and Itamar, as we learned elsewhere: Anyone who takes precedence for inheritance takes precedence for honor, provided that he conducts himself in the manner  of his ancestors.  “Elazar and Itamar served as priests in the presence of Aaron, their father” (Numbers 3:4). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: During his lifetime. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Upon his death. According to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, who said, upon his death, here it is written: “The presence of [penei],” and there it says: “Abraham arose from the presence of [penei] his dead” (Genesis 23:3); just as there it was upon her death, here, too it was upon his death. According to Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said, during his lifetime, here it is stated: “In the presence of [al penei],” and there it is stated: “Ḥaran died in the presence of [al penei] Teraḥ his father” (Genesis 11:28); just as there it was during his lifetime, so, too, here, it was during his lifetime.   If impurity befell Aaron, Elazar served. If it befell Elazar, Itamar served. There was an incident involving Shimon ben Kimḥit, (A High Priest who served during the Second Temple. )  who went to speak with the Arab king. Spittle sprayed from [the king’s] mouth onto [Shimon’s] garments and impurified him, and Yehuda, his brother, entered and served in the high priesthood in his stead. That day, their mother saw her two sons as High Priests. They said: Kimḥit had seven sons and all of them served in the high priesthood. They sent to her and said to her: ‘What good deeds do you have to your credit?’ She said to them: ‘The beams of my house have never seen the hair of my head and the hem of my robe.’ They said: ‘All the flours are flour, but the flour of Kimḥit is fine flour.’ They read in her regard: “All the glory of the princess is within” (Psalms 45:14). (This is understood to express that modesty brings a woman great honor. )  According to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, who said, upon his death, when Aaron died, Elazar served. When Elazar died, Itamar served.</p>

              <p>A woman is acquired by, i.e., becomes betrothed to, a man to be his wife in three ways, and she acquires herself, i.e., she terminates her marriage, in two ways. The mishna elaborates: She is acquired through money, through a document, and through sexual intercourse. With regard to a betrothal through money, there is a dispute between tanna’im: Beit Shammai say that she can be acquired with one dinar or with anything that is worth one dinar. And Beit Hillel say: She can be acquired with one peruta, a small copper coin, or with anything that is worth one peruta. The mishna further clarifies: And how much is the value of one peruta, by the fixed value of silver? The mishna explains that it is one-eighth of the Italian issar, which is a small silver coin. And a woman acquires herself through a bill of divorce or through the death of the husband. A woman whose husband, who had a brother, died childless [yevama], can be acquired by the deceased husband’s brother, the yavam, only through intercourse. And she acquires herself, i.e., she is released from her levirate bond, through ḥalitza or through the death of the yavam.</p>

              <p>Judaism is the civilisation that did not die because, despite its respect for and loyalty to the past, it is a fundamentally future-oriented faith. We see this in the Torah in a very pointed way in its description of the death of Sarah. Abraham was then 137 years old. He had just lost the woman who had shared his life’s journey and who had twice saved his life. He might have been paralysed by grief. Yet this is what we read: “Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and weep for her. Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife” (Gen. 23:2–3): a mere ten words in Hebrew.</p>

            <summary>The baraita teaches that one is exempt from reciting Shema, Amida prayer, phylacteries, and all other mitzvot mentioned in the Torah when a deceased person is present, but there is a debate on the specific circumstances that qualify for exemption. Rav Pappa suggests that the exemption applies only when the person turns away and eats with the deceased present, while Rav Ashi argues that the exemption applies as long as the person is responsible for burying the deceased, even if the burial has not yet taken place. This interpretation is based on references to Abraham in Genesis.</summary>

              <p>In any event, the baraita teaches that one is exempt from the recitation of Shema, from the Amida prayer and from phylacteries, and from all mitzvot mentioned in the Torah. This is an apparent contradiction of our mishna which states that one is exempt only when the deceased is laid before him. To resolve this contradiction, Rav Pappa said: Explain the baraita as applicable only to the particular case when one turns his face away and eats, with the deceased laid out before him. In the other cases, when he is in a different room, he is obligated in all mitzvot. Rav Ashi says: The phrase: The deceased is laid out before him, is not to be taken literally, but rather, since it is incumbent upon him to bury the deceased, and he is not yet buried, it is as if he is laid out before him, as it is stated: “And Abraham rose up from before his dead” (Genesis 23:3), and when Abraham speaks with the Hittites, it is stated: “So that I may bury my dead from before me” (Genesis 23:4). As long as it is incumbent upon him to bury him, it is as he is laid out before him.</p>

The locals, misunderstanding his request as a gift, offered him any burial ground he desired, recognizing him as a king. Abraham, focused on burying Sarah without delay, proceeded to negotiate the purchase of a suitable plot. The term &quot;possession of a burying place&quot; referred to land for burial purposes.

If you were to point out that according to what Rashi had explained on Genesis 13,7 where the Canaanites are described as the then residents of that land, that had been before he had become a father of children. (Such people cannot claim permanent resident status.) After all, G-d had not promised Avraham that he would inherit this land. He had only promised it to Avraham’s descendants. Now that Yitzchok had been born, he was entitled to inherit part of the Land.</p>

              <p>גר ותושב אנכי. &quot;I am a stranger and resident. Abraham's description of his legal status is based on Maimonides Hilchot Zechiyah U-matanah 3,11: Whereas one must not give a gift to an idolator, one may either give a gift or sell to a resident stranger (גר תושב) because the Torah writes: &quot;the resident stranger let live by your side&quot; (Leviticus 25,35). We need to appreciate that our holy Torah applies reason, and especially so in our conduct on this earth. Just as we Jews are commanded to deal with resident strangers in a humane manner, so reason dictates that people all over the earth should conduct themselves with one another in a like manner. It is a universal obligation to enable resident strangers to live undisturbed and to be able to receive gifts. It is this principle Abraham alluded to when he said: גר ותושב אנכי תנו לי, &quot;since I am a resident stranger, give me, etc.&quot; He made a point of using the word גר, alien, not just תושב, resident, in order to emphasise that though he was an alien, the fact that he resided amongst them entitled him to what he requested. There is a spiritual dimension to Abraham describing himself as an alien. He did not consider it seemly for a human being to describe himself as a &quot;resident&quot; on this earth, seeing that he looked forward to a permanent status in another, higher life.</p>

              <p>ואקברה מתי מלפני, &quot;so I may bury my dead one from before me.&quot; Abraham meant that he wanted to bury Sarah without delay. Furthermore, Abraham knew already that he would have to pay Efron a substantial price for a field not worth a fraction of the asking price, because it contained something he wanted. At the same time, he realised that once the local people would hear of the price he was prepared to pay they would conclude there must be a hidden treasure beneath that field that they did not know about. In order to forestall such speculations by the local population he emphasised already at this stage that he was only concerned with burying Sarah forthwith i.e. מלפני, and that because of the urgency of the matter he could not afford to haggle over the price. Under such circumstances, it did not matter how much he would have to pay, the locals would not mind and would not suspect him of ulterior motives.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>תנו לי אחוזת קבר עמכם, “let me have possession of a burial ground amongst you, etc.” It was the custom for every family to have its own field as a burial ground for its members, whereas they had set aside a special plot of land on which to bury aliens. This is what prompted Avraham to use the preamble: גר ותושב אנכי עמכם, “on the one hand I am an alien, seeing that I have come here from a distant land, and this is why I do not own a burial plot of my own. On the other hand, I have been very willing to become a resident amongst you, etc.”  They answered him: “Listen to us, my lord etc.” On the one hand they addressed him as a group, saying: “listen to us.” On the other hand, they continued with the singular “my lord.” The reason for this was that a single individual was conducting this conversation though he spoke in the name of a multitude. When this individual, i.e. the spokesman, continued by saying: “you are a prince in our midst, choose from the choicest of our burial grounds, etc.,” adding the compliment: “you are a prince of G’d,” he spoke in the name of the people who had made him their spokesman.  The term גר, “stranger, alien,” is demeaning, whereas the expression נשיא אלוהים אתה בתוכנו, “you are a prince of G’d amongst us,” is a compliment, contrasting Avraham’s stature amongst them with that of a stranger. They suggested that they themselves as well as their land was at Avraham’s disposal. (compare Genesis 47,19 where loss of land is equated with the status of subservience). As a result of their considering Avraham as royalty, he had the right to choose whatever piece of land he desired as his burial ground. Nobody would deny him even land he had previously reserved for his own eventual interment. When Avraham heard this, he immediately responded with the words: “if indeed you wish me to bury my dead, etc.” He meant that he had no intention of burying his dead in any unknown field; rather, he had a particular spot in mind for which they needed to speak to Efron son of Tzochar, the owner of that particular piece of property. This is Nachmanides’ version of what transpired here.</p>

              <p>I AM A STRANGER AND SOJOURNER WITH YOU. It was customary for them to have separate burial grounds for each family and one burial ground for the internment of all strangers. Now Abraham said to the children of Heth: “I am a stranger from another land and have not inherited a burial ground in this land from my ancestors. Now I am a sojourner with you since I have desired to dwell in this land. Therefore give me a burying-place for an everlasting possession just as one of you.” However, since Abraham used the word “t’nu (give), [which has the same root as matanah,” (gift)], they suspected that he desired it from them as a gift. They therefore answered him: “You are not regarded by us as a stranger or sojourner. Rather, you are a king. G-d has made you king over us, and we and our land are subservient to you. Take any burial ground you desire, and bury your dead there. It shall be unto you a possession of a burial-place forever since no one of us shall withhold it from you.”</p>

This matter becomes even clearer when Avraham tenders the money for the field and cave to Efron, the former owner, and the Torah goes on to laboriously describe the bureaucratic procedure that had to be followed until Avraham could lay Sarah to rest.

              <p>גור ,גר: bodenlos sein, nicht auf eigenem Boden sein, davon מגורָה, (und vielleicht auch גרֶן wie גרזן von גרז), wo das dem Boden entnommene Getreide aufgenommen wird. גור מפני ,לא תגורו מפני איש, vor jemandem zurückweichen, seinen Stand und Halt vor jemandem verlieren. — גר ותושב: Ich habe kein Recht an eurem Lande, wohne aber bereits lange unter euch. — אְַחוזָה. Wenn man dies gewohnlich als Ausdruck für Besitz erklärt, weil &quot;der Gegenstand gefasst&quot; wird, so ist dies schwerlich zutreffend. אחוזה kommt nur vom Bodenbesitz vor, der ja eben nicht gefasst werden kann, nie aber von beweglichem Eigentum. Ferner wird Besitz nehmen mit אחז immer im Niphal ausgedrückt, והֵאָחזו בה. (Bereschit 34,10) ויֵאָחזו בה (das. 46,27), ונאחזו תבוככם (Bamidbar 32,30). Es wird also nicht der Gegenstand von dem Besitzer, sondern der Besitzer durch den Gegenstand gefasst und festgehalten, und das ist in der Tat beim Landbesitz der Fall. Der Boden trägt den Eigner, der Mensch wird durch ihn gefesselt, deshalb ist auch קרקע Bürgschaft für ihn, deshalb auch wohl z. B. אין נשבעין על הקרקעות. Im Schwur setzt der Mensch sich und alles Seine, alles in seine Persönlichkeit Aufgehende, der strafenden Vernichtung aus, wenn sein Wort nicht wahr ist, oder er sein Wort nicht wahr macht. Nur beweglicher Besitz geht aber in die Person auf, sie kann ihn selbst in jedem Augenblick vernichten. Der unbewegliche Besitz aber überdauert den Menschen, dieser geht in ihn auf, aber nicht umgekehrt. Er kann also nicht die Existenz des Bodens einsetzen für die Wahrheit seines Wortes.</p>

Does this not imply that Avraham did not have a portion in it as yet? The answer is: In the above verse, Avraham did not yet have children, but now he did. This is why Rashi states here that Hashem said to him: “To your descendants I will give this land” — and now he had descendants. Accordingly, [Avraham said to them]: “At least grant me the possession of a grave site, although my descendants are not yet ready to inherit the land, as they are still few.” </p>

But Re’m explains that [Rashi is answering the question:] The word אחוזה applies to land that is at a person’s disposal. How then can it apply to a grave, which is set aside for the dead? Therefore Rashi explains that [Avraham asked] them to give him land for an אחוזה, and he will make graves there.</p>

              <p>גר ותושב אנכי עמכם, “I am both a stranger and a resident amongst you.” What he meant was that as far as not having been born in the land of Canaan he was a “stranger,” so that he did not have a piece of earth that would serve as his burial ground by right. If he were to bury Sarah on a piece of land belonging to someone else, that someone could raise valid objections and even dig up the soil forcing him to rebury Sarah elsewhere.     Nachmanides understands the prevailing custom as each family owning burial plots for members of their respective families, whereas for strangers (not born locally) there was a mass grave where all such people would be interred. Avraham pointed out that as far as local custom was concerned he was indeed a stranger, though he had lived in this land for over 60 years. Still, he had not inherited a burial site from his father as he had not lived in the land of Canaan. He now requested that he be given the benefits of the status of a resident. He did not want to deprive anyone of part of their ancestral holdings, but he required to own in perpetuity, in a manner that could not be challenged, a piece of ground wherein to bury his wife. The local inhabitants were under the mistaken impression that he requested to be given such a piece of land for free, seeing Avraham had used the expression תנו לי, “give me.” This is why they responded that his standing was such that no one would refuse to give him even a site he had earmarked for his own burial in the future. Such a piece of burial ground would indeed be deeded to him in perpetuity.     Other commentators hold that just as Avraham had used the term תנו לי, “give to me,” as a figure of speech, never intending to receive such as a present, so when the locals used the same expression they also did not mean literally   to give him such a burial place. When they used the expression במבחר קברנו, they did not refer to the “choicest,” but to a random grave site belonging to some family without adding anything about the final status of such a piece of land. Avraham paid strict attention to the nuances in the Hittites’ offer and proceeded to offer generous payment. </p>

If you will not give it to me, then I will win it legally. I will consider myself a stranger, since the Holy One has promised this to me. (Rashi, Genesis, 23:4.)  Hizkuni writes. Why did the Torah write about Sarah in which city she died? However, concerning Abraham, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah, the Torah did not write where they died. The explanation is that Abraham had sent Sarah to Hebron in the hope that she would be far from Mount Moriah, so that she should not quickly learn about her son Isaac who would be slaughtered. The Midrash says that the angel Samael came to Sarah and told her how Isaac was slaughtered. Her soul left her and she died. Some say that Sarah became sick and Abraham sent her to Hebron, since the air of Hebron was good, and she died when she heard about her son. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 23:2.) </p>

The biblical commentaries almost without exception struggle with the obvious contradiction inherent in this terminology. If one is a toshav, one is not a ger. If one is a ger, one is not a toshav If a person is a stranger, he is not a permanent resident; if a person enjoys rights of residency, he is not an alien. One may be either a citizen or a foreigner, a national or a stranger, but a person cannot be both at one and the same time.</p>

We believe that while on one hand we must be “residents” and integrate into the economic, scientific, and certain aspects of the cultural life in our country of residence, we also must be “strangers” and form our own “subculture” in order to survive in a country that is hospitable and inviting. Along with the creation of Orthodox shuls, schools, camps, and youth groups, the world of Jewish music has made an enormous contribution to the creation of this Orthodox subculture.</p>

              <p>One who is bereaved of a relative for whom he is obligated to mourn (Leviticus 21:2-3 mentions the six relatives for whom a person is obligated to mourn: a father, a mother, a son, a daughter, a brother, a sister. The Rabbis also added the obligation to mourn for one's wife or husband. See Hilchot Eivel 2:1.)  is exempt from Kri'at Shema (and all the other mitzvot of the Torah (Hilchot Eivel 4:6).)  until he has buried him, (The Mishnah, Berachot 17b, states that one who has his dead one &quot;lying in front of him&quot; is exempt from Kri'at Shema. The Talmud (ibid. 18a) explains that any relative waiting to be buried is considered to be &quot;lying in front of him.&quot; This is derived from Abraham's characterization of Sarah as being in front of him (Genesis 23:4 , even though her body was not physically present.)  because his attention is distracted from reciting [the Shema]. (I.e., even if he is not necessarily involved in dealing with the arrangements for the burial or the burial itself, he is exempt, because his mind is distracted (Kessef Mishneh). The Jerusalem Talmud (Berachot 3:1) derives this halachah from Deuteronomy 16:3: &quot;to remember the day you left Egypt all the days of your life.&quot; This implies &quot;days that you are involved with the living and not days in which you are involved with the dead.&quot; Since the obligation to remember the Exodus (an integral part of Kri'at Shema - see Chapter 1, Halachot 2 and 3) does not apply on those days when one is involved in dealing with the burial of one's loved ones, one is also exempted from reciting the Shema. Sukkah 25a explains that the exemption of a mourner cannot be derived from that of a bridegroom mentioned in Halachah 1. A bridegroom's lack of concentration stems from his involvement with a mitzvah. In contrast, the mourner's inability to concentrate is a personal matter. Rashi elaborates: Though mourning is a mitzvah, the pain associated with mourning is not. The Jerusalem Talmud notes that a mourner should not voluntarily recite the Shema. It is a sign of disrespect to the departed for their relatives to recite the Shema before they have been buried.)  A person who is watching a body (I.e., guarding the body from an animal or other damage. (See Berachot 18a.))  is also exempt, even if it is not the body of a relative. (Since a person involved in one commandment is exempt from another. (See the commentary on Halachah 1.))  When there are two watchers, one should continue watching while the other withdraws and recites the Shema. [When the latter] returns, the other should depart and recite [the Shema]. (As opposed to the actual mourners, the guards are obligated to recite the Shema if they are able to. Their exemption is not based on their distracted condition, but on their involvement in the commandment. Therefore, if another is able to guard the body for a few moments, the guard must recite the Shema. However, if there is no one to relieve the guard, he is not allowed to recite the Shema (Mishnah Berurah on the Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 71:3). The watchers must remove themselves in order not to recite the Shema within 6 feet of the dead person. (See Chapter 3, Halachah 2 and commentary.))  A gravedigger is also exempt from Kri'at Shema. (See Berachot 14b. His exemption is also based on the principle that one involved in a commandment is exempt from another. The Mishnah Berurah (Orach Chayim 71:5) points out that even while he is resting for a few moments, the gravedigger is still exempt, because his resting is also part of the mitzvah, since by resting he gains strength to continue his task.) </p>

              <p>First Jew, First Resident Alien Identity confusion and identity naming begins as early as Genesis 23:4. Abraham, in trying to purchase a plot to bury Sarah, calls himself a “ger vetoshav” among the other residents of the land. It is odd for Abraham to make this identity observation at this juncture. Surely Abraham must have felt his outsider status most profoundly when initially entering Canaan with a mandate from God to start a nation in a land populated by others, as far back as Genesis 12. Yet he pursued God’s command with particular zeal, without hesitation or pause to reflect on the fact that he was a stranger to Canaan. The experience of death, of losing one’s second self and partner in the creation of a national vision, may have precipitated Abraham’s new self-awareness. When a man loses his wife and is living in a country not yet his own, he wants to own a piece of land for eternity. He needs to know that he can always be within proximity of those he has loved and lost. Imagine, and it is not difficult to imagine, that a man buries his wife in a country that soon thereafter exiles him and his community elsewhere. He will say good-bye to all that is familiar to him, but worse, he will say good-bye permanently to his second self. Selecting a family burial plot is a momentous decision with long-term implications for future visitors.</p>

              <p>The fact that Abraham and his descendants were known to others as Ivrim suggests that they too were seen as Habiru, a potential danger to the more settled peoples of the region. Abraham himself, despite his long residence in Canaan, was forced to describe himself as “an alien and a temporary resident” when he came to buy land from the local Hittites as a burial place for his wife, Sarah (Gen. 23:4). Nor did the Egyptians take readily to outsiders. A text of the time complained that “strangers from outside have come into Egypt…. Foreigners have become people everywhere” (Admonitions of Ipuwer Papyrus). So it is altogether likely that, faced with a growing population of Semitic herdsmen from Canaan, the Egyptians would have sensed a potential threat.</p>

Abraham was depicted as a hero who fought off attackers and divided his wealth, while Sarah was praised for her virtues and actions, such as her role in acquiring the field of Machpelah. The text also emphasizes the concept of being a stranger and a sojourner, as seen in the lives of the patriarchs and in the broader context of the righteous being secondary to God.</summary>

              <p>Chapter 34: Torah [1] &quot;And Abraham was old, coming with days&quot; (Genesis 24:1).&quot;The Woman of Valor, who can find? etc.&quot; (Proverbs 31:10) This entire verse is required regarding Sarah, as it is written above, &quot;Afterward, Abraham buried Sarah&quot; etc. (Genesis 23:19) and as soon as Sarah died, old age came upon him and he became elderly. The spirit of prophecy cried out and said, &quot;A capable wife, who can find her...&quot; This can be compared to a skilled ship captain who conquered the waters and winds. Suddenly, pirates attacked him and he fought them off. Later, he came to a treacherous strait and a strong wind shattered his ship. He begged for mercy from the people around him, saying, &quot;Yesterday, I conquered the waters and killed the pirates. Now, I ask others to save me.&quot; They replied, &quot;When your ship was strong, you were a hero and didn't need our help. Now that your ship is broken, you seek our aid.&quot; Similarly, Abraham was a hero and fought off the pirates when they attacked him (Genesis 14:15). He also divided his wealth among himself, Ishmael, and his household of 318 people (Genesis 14:14). He saw his own strength on the day of Isaac's circumcision (Genesis 17:26) and was blessed by God (Genesis 14:19). Now, you say, &quot;I am a stranger and a resident, etc.&quot; He said to them, &quot;What shall I do? My wife has died, as it is written 'And I will bury my dead, etc.' (Genesis 23:4).&quot; Immediately, Abraham grew old. &quot;A woman of valor, who can find her?&quot; (Proverbs 31:10). This is Sarah, for &quot;a woman of beautiful appearance&quot; (Genesis 12:11), her husband trusted in her. &quot;Please say that you are my sister&quot; (Genesis 12:13). &quot;And he had abundant livestock&quot; (Genesis 13:2). His camel was good and not evil, and Abraham treated it well for her (Genesis 12:16). She sought wool and flax, for she also fulfilled the commandments like Abraham. &quot;Whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her voice, for in Isaac shall your offspring be called&quot; (Genesis 21:12). She was like a merchant ship that had been across the river and came to the land of Canaan. &quot;And she rose up in the middle of the night, and Abraham rose early in the morning, etc.&quot; (Genesis 19:27). She planned a field and took it, which was the field of Machpelah, as it is written &quot;So the field and the cave in it were established&quot; (Genesis 23:20). She planted a vineyard with the fruit of her hands, for &quot;the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel&quot; (Isaiah 5:7). She girded her loins with strength when the angels came to eat with Abraham and said to her, &quot;Quickly, make three seahs, etc.&quot; (Genesis 18:6). The reason was that she was a good trader, and to Sarah he said, &quot;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver, etc.&quot; (Genesis 20:16). She sent out her hand with the spindle, etc. (Proverbs 31:19). She drove out this maidservant (Genesis 21:10). &quot;Do not be afraid for your household from snow, for the Holy One, blessed be He, made an agreement with him that in the merit of circumcision and Sabbath, his sons will not descend to Gehenna. For every household that is circumcised has two Sabbath days and clothing. She made coverings for herself when they asked him, &quot;Where is Sarah, your wife?&quot; And he said, &quot;Behold, in the tent&quot; (Genesis 18:9). They said to her, &quot;Behold, you are with child, and your sons are destined to be priests, to wear the priestly garments and to serve in the Tent of Meeting, as it is written 'And they shall make the ephod, etc.'&quot; (Exodus 28:6). When Sarah died, he leapt upon her, old and aged. Immediately, her husband became known in the gates, etc.</p>

This is the way of the righteous, who are the essence of the world and make themselves secondary. This is how Avraham was, who made himself secondary, as it says &quot;I am a stranger and a sojourner among you&quot; (Genesis 23:4). This is how Yaakov spoke to Esau, &quot;I have sojourned with Laban&quot; (Genesis 32:5). Similarly, Israel is written &quot;strangers and sojourners&quot; (Leviticus 25:23), therefore David says &quot;Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear to my cry&quot; (Psalm 39:13), why?

              <p>“Abraham arose from before his dead, and he spoke to the children of Ḥet, saying” (Genesis 23:3).  “Abraham arose from before his dead” – this teaches (The verse can also be translated: “Abraham arose from before death.” The angel of death was intimidating him and urging him to bury Sarah promptly.)  that he saw the angel of death provoking him.  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where is it derived what we learn in a mishna: One whose dead one [a deceased relative] is lying before him (That is, he is charged with burying the body.)  is exempt from the recitation of Shema, from prayer, and from wearing phylacteries, as well as all mitzvot in the Torah? (Mishna Berakhot 3:1.)  It is from here: “[Abraham] arose…and he spoke.” (He did not engage in any other activity prior to his burying his dead.)  “I am a sojourner and a resident among you: give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” (Genesis 23:4).  “A sojourner [ger] and a resident”; ger means one who dwells as a tenant; toshav means a landlord. [Abraham was saying:] ‘If you prefer, I will act as a tenant, (Humbly beseeching your permission to bury Sarah.)  but if not, I will act as a landlord, (And take it without your consent.)  as this is what the Holy One blessed be He has said to me: “To your descendants I have given this land”’ (Genesis 15:18).  “Give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” – I am requesting [a plot] for only one dead person, as it is stated: “Give me a burial plot with you, [and I will bury my dead].”  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham, saying to him” (Genesis 23:5).  “Hear us, my lord: you are a prince of God in our midst, in our choicest graves bury your dead; none of us shall withhold his grave from you, from burying your dead” (Genesis 23:6).  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham…Hear us, my lord…” – you are king over us, you are prince over us, you are like a god to us. He said to them: ‘Let the world not fail to accept its true King, let the world not fail to accept its true God.’   “In our choicest graves” – in the choicest one of our many graves.   “Bury your dead” – many dead. (Although Abraham had requested a single grave site, for Sarah, the children of Ḥet offered him a site for many burials.)  “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land, the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 23:7.   “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land” (The verse does not say that Abraham bowed “to” the people, but that he bowed “before” them. He bowed to God in their presence, giving thanks for his good fortune in obtaining the permission he had sought.)  – from here we learn that one should give thanks [to God] over hearing good tidings.</p>

              <p>(Exod. 23:20:) BEHOLD, I AM SENDING AN ANGEL …. This text is related (to Jer. 3:19): THEN I SAID: HOW WOULD I (This translation fits the context of the midrash.)  PUT (rt.: ShYT) YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN,… ! (Tanh., Exod. 6:17; see below, Tanh. (Buber), Numb. 4a:15.)  R. Eleazar ben Pedat says: What is this : WOULD I PUT (rt.: ShYT) YOU? It had occurred to me that we, I and you, would be &lt; alone &gt; in the world. (Tanh., Exod. 6:17, adds, “I as father and you as children.”)  How did you manage for me to bring the peoples of the world in among you? (Cf. Tanh., Exod. 6:17: “How did you manage to bring the peoples of the world in between me and you?”)  This expression is nothing but an expression of setting apart (as in Gen. 30:40): AND HE PUT (rt.: ShYT) HIS OWN FLOCKS …. R. Hama bar Hanina said: What is the meaning of WOULD I PUT (rt.: ShYT) YOU? (Cf. Exod. R. 32:2.)  There was a great love between me and you. (Below, Tanh. (Buber), Lev. 7:12; Numb. 4a: 15; Exod. R. 32:2.)  How did you manage that I should hate you? (Jer. 3:19:) HOW WOULD I PUT (rt.: ShYT) YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN! This expression is nothing but an expression of hatred, as used (in Gen. 3:15): I WILL PUT (rt.: ShYT) ENMITY . Another interpretation (of Jer. 3:19:) HOW WOULD I PUT (ShYT) YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN ! R. Joshua ben Levi said: I spoke in  defense. (Gk.: synegoria.)  You behaved toward me so that I denounced you and pronounced you guilty (rt.: HYB). The expression (rt.: ShYT) is nothing but an expression of guilt (rt.: HYB), as used (concerning one guilty of negligence in Exod. 21:30): IF A RANSOM IS PUT (rt.: ShYT) UPON HIM, . Another interpretation (of Jer. 3:19:) HOW WOULD I PUT (ashit; rt.: ShYT) YOU AMONG THE CHILDREN! R. Berekhyah the Priest said: You were as dear to me as someone who has a single field, which he fertilizes, cultivates, and weeds. So dear were you to me. Your behavior toward me was for you to commit lawlessness. Now this word (ashit) is nothing but an expression for lawlessness, as used (in Is. 5:6): AND I WILL MAKE (ashit) IT (i.e., the Holy One's vineyard) A DESOLATION. (Jer. 3:19, cont.:) AND GIVE YOU A DESIRABLE LAND, a land that the great ones of the world (i.e., the patriarchs) desired. (Below, Tanh. (Buber), Numb. 4a: 16.)  Abraham said to the Hittites (in Gen. 23:4): GIVE ME A BURIAL SITE. The Holy One also endeared it to {the children of} Isaac, as stated (in Gen. 26:3): RESIDE IN THIS LAND, …. Jacob said (according to Gen. 50:5): IN MY GRAVE WHICH I DUG FOR MYSELF . Ergo (in Jer. 3:19): A DESIRABLE LAND. (Ibid., cont.:)  [BEAUTIFUL HERITAGE] . What is the meaning of  BEAUTIFUL (tsevi) HERITAGE? Just as in the case of a deer (tsevi), when one slaughters it, strips off its hide, and tries to return the flesh into the hide, it does not contain it, so the land of Israel does not contain its produce. What is written (in Is. 30:24)? AS FOR THE OXEN AND ASSES THAT WORK THE GROUND, THEY SHALL EAT FERMENTED FODDER, WHICH HAS BEEN WINNOWED WITH SHOVEL AND PITCH FORK. First they winnow with the SHOVEL and after that with the PITCH FORK. Why? Because there was more grain than straw. Even so there was produce in  winnowing the straw. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (ibid.): FERMENTED MASH, WHICH HAS BEEN WINNOWED WITH SHOVEL AND PITCH FORK. Mashes are from produce. Ergo (in Jer. 3:19): [A DESIRABLE LAND,]  BEAUTIFUL (tsevi) HERITAGE (understood in the sense of THE MOST DEERLIKE HERITAGE), a land which does not contain its produce, a land which was so good that all the kings of the world desired it. It is written (in Josh. 12:9): THE KING OF JERICHO, ONE; THE KING {FOR AI} [OF AI WHICH IS BESIDE BETHEL], ONE. Now there are only three miles (Lat.: mille.)  between Jericho and Ai; yet it says: THE KING OF JERICHO. It is simply that whoever has a possession outside of the land without having a possession in the land of Israel was not called a king. (Sifre, to Deut. 7:12 (37); Gen. R. 85:14.)  Why? Because they longed for the land of Israel. R. {Isaac} [Johanan] said: What is written (in Josh. 7:21): I SAW AMONG THE SPOILS A  SHINAR MANTLE,  a Babylonian (Gk.: Babylonikon; Lat.: Babylonicum.)  robe of royal purple, (Gk.: porphura; Lat.: purpura.)  which the king of Babylon wore to rule in Jericho. Ergo (in Jer. 3:19): THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HERITAGE OF THE NATIONS. (According to this reasoning, the various kingships were so close to each other in Israel because every king needed a seat in Israel in order to be regarded as a king.)  (Ibid., cont.:) AND I SAID YOU SHALL CALL ME FATHER. Just as a father is obliged  for his daughter's enjoyments, so did I bring down rain for you. (Exod. 16:14:) WHEN THE LAYER OF DEW HAD GONE UP, …. (Jer. 3:20:) SURELY AS A WOMAN BREAKS FAITH WITH HER LOVER . R. Judah bar Simon said: Oh that  like an unfaithful wife. This  a woman, who has a lover, gives him food, drink, and love. When his power is diminished, she leaves him and goes away. SURELY AS A WOMAN BREAKS FAITH WITH HER LOVER. I have not done so to you. The manna came down for you, and the well rose up. I did not deprive you of anything when you were unfaithful with me. See, I gave you an angel who watched over you. (Exod. 23:20:) SEE, I AM SENDING YOU AN ANGEL . When you became worthy and received the Torah, I went before you in person. But now, when you have been found guilty, here I am  (ibid.:) SENDING AN ANGEL BEFORE YOU. [Another interpretation:] (Tanh., Exod. 6:18.)  The Holy One said to Moses: I am sending  before you but not before them. He said: If you send  out before me, I do not want ; but Joshua saw the angel and fell down before him. What did he say to him (in Josh. 5:13)? ARE YOU FOR US OR FOR OUR ADVERSARIES? When he said to him: ARE YOU FOR US? he began to cry in great anguish. (Literally: “From under the nails of his feet.”)  (Ibid., vs. 14:) Then he said: NO, BUT [I] AM THE CAPTAIN OF THE LORD'S HOST. NOW I HAVE COME. (Gen. R. 97:3 (traditional text only).)  Here are two times that I have come to give Israel an inheritance. I am the one who came in the days of your master, Moses; but he rejected me. (Ibid., cont.:) NOW I HAVE COME. THEN JOSHUA FELL ON HIS FACE. He saw him and fell on his face, but when Moses saw , he rejected him. The Holy One said (in Exod. 23:20): SEE, I AM SENDING AN ANGEL BEFORE YOU, to you and to whomever observes the Torah [as you . Resh Laqish said: It is written (in Ps. 91:4): HE WILL COVER YOU WITH HIS PINIONS AND YOU WILL FIND REFUGE UNDER HIS WINGS,  all who observe the Torah.] (Ibid., cont.:) HIS FIDELITY IS A SHIELD AND BUCKLER. Therefore (in Exod. 23:20): &lt; I AM SENDING MY ANGEL BEFORE YOU &gt; TO GUARD YOU ON THE WAY….</p>

She is not afraid of the snow for her household (ibid., v. 21); that is, she did not fear Gehenna. And why not? Because her entire household possessed garments (shanim, punning on shnayim, “two”) (ibid.): Sabbath and circumcision. She maketh for herself coverlets (ibid., v. 22): These were the priestly garments. From the fruit of her hand she planted a vineyard (ibid., v. 16). This refers to Israel, as it is said: For a vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel (Isa. 5:7).

              <p>And give thee a pleasant land (Jer. 3:19). It was a land greatly coveted by all the mighty men of the world. Abraham said of it: Give me a possession of a burying-place with you (Gen. 23:4). Similarly, the Holy One, blessed be He, made it precious to Isaac, as it is said: Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee and will bless thee (ibid. 26:3). And Jacob said: In my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me (ibid. 50:5). Hence it says: And give thee a pleasant land, the goodliest heritage of the deer (Jer. 3:19). What is indicated by the use of the word deer? Just as the flesh of a deer cannot be restored into its skin when they attempt to recover it after it has been slaughtered and its skin has been stripped away, so the land of Israel is not able to contain its fruit (when it is worthy). A proof of this is written in the verse: The oxen likewise and the young asses that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan (Isa. 30:24). At first they winnowed the grain with a shovel, but later they winnowed it with a fan. Why? because the grain was more plentiful than the straw, though the grain grows within the straw. Whence do we know this was so? For it is written: Shall eat savory provender. The savory provender was the fruit (of the straw). Hence, And give thee a pleasant land, the goodliest heritage of the deer indicates that like the deer the land of Israel could not contain its fruits.</p>

            <summary>The commentary highlights the importance of Jews not taking for granted their entitlement to the Holy Land, emphasizing the need to remember their status as strangers and settlers in the land. The text warns against treating the Holy Land as merely a secular possession, as this can lead to negative consequences, as seen in the spies' derogatory portrayal of the land. The lesson is to maintain a sense of humility and respect towards the land, recognizing it as a sacred and not simply a material possession.</summary>

              <p>The moral lesson is that just as strangers must not take for granted their right to live in their host country, so Jews must not take for granted their entitlement to the Holy Land not even after they have settled there. When our sages criticise Jacob of whom the Torah said: וישב יעקב בארץ כנען, &quot;Jacob settled down in the land of Canaan,&quot; this is exactly what they had in mind. The fact that the Torah underlines in that very verse that Jacob's fathers had only sojourned there, only reinforces our sages' criticism (compare Genesis 37,1 and Bereshit Rabbah 84,1). An allusion to the fact that the tendency of Jews who display a vested interest in their residence in the Holy land can be counter-productive is found in the description of the land by the spies as ארץ אוכלת יושביה היא, &quot;It is a land that consumes those who settle in it&quot; (Numbers 13,32). This is expressed more forcefully in connection with someone selling his house in the Holy Land permanently. The Torah states clearly that the land cannot be sold permanently by ignoring the laws of return to the original owners in the Jubilee year, when G–d goes on record in Leviticus 25,23: כי גרים ותושבים אתם עמדי, &quot;For you are strangers and settlers with Me.&quot; The moment Jews want to treat the Holy Land as the Gentiles treat their soil, i.e. for merely secular enjoyment, the land is liable to react by &quot;consuming&quot; those who presume to &quot;own&quot; it. The spies portrayed the land of Canaan in a derogatory manner and thus profaned something sacred; their mouthings had no effect on the land. The Torah has seen fit to quote their words in order to instill in us a positive teaching: </p>

                <h4>Divrei Negidim on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, In the Beginning Our Fathers Were Idol Worshipers 3:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Sin and Suffering As it says: “Know for a certainty that your seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they shall enslave and inflict them for four hundred years…and afterwards they shall go forth with great wealth:” (Gen. 15:13) This verse teaches us that God decreed, exile (Exile: the Hebrew word here is geirut. A ger in biblical Hebrew is someone who lives as an outsider and is therefore not protected by the laws of the land. The people of Israel may have lived comfortably in their first years in Egypt but they were still outsiders, gerim, and not considered true citizens in the land. Isaac was born in the land of Canaan but because it was not yet under the authority of Abraham, he and his offspring would have been considered outsiders and strangers. Consider what Abraham says when he buys a burial site for his wife: “I am a stranger (ger) and a resident among you…” (Gen. 23:4)) , enslavement, and oppression on the offspring of Abraham. Exile means they were to live in the domain of others. In addition to living in the land of others, they would be enslaved in the way that a slave must serve his master. And in addition to the subjugation, they would also be oppressed. This is even worse than subjugation since generally speaking, a master does not oppress his servant. It would appear, then, that three decrees were made against the offspring of Abraham, one after the other: exile, enslavement and oppression. With each decree, the exile became worse. From the birth of Isaac until the death of the final sons of Jacob, they were in exile. From the death of the sons until the birth of Miriam they were enslaved. And from the birth of Miriam they were oppressed – this began 86 years before the Exodus. That is why Miriam received her name, from the word mar, bitter. However, why did God make these three decrees? The answer is found in B. Nedarim 32a: Rabbi Abahu said in Rabbi Eleazar's name: Why was our Father Abraham punished and his children doomed to servitude for two hundred and ten years? Because he pressed scholars into his militia service, as it is written, “He armed his dedicated servants born in his own house.”  (Rabbi Abahu understood “dedicated servants” as referring to Abraham’s disciples who came to study with him.)  (Gen 14:14) Samuel said: Because he went too far in testing the promises of God, as it is written, “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? (Gen. 15:8)  (By asking for a sign as reassurance from God, he showed a lack of faith.)  Rabban Jochanan said: Because he prevented men from entering the covenant, as it is written, “And the king of Sodom said it to Abraham, ‘Give me the persons, and take the goods for yourself.’” (Gen. 14:21)  (Rabban Jochanan suggests that by allowing the King of Sodom to keep the people, Abraham missed out on an opportunity to teach all the people he saved about God’s existence.)  There are three explanations for Israel’s exile and all of them are based on Abraham’s sin. Everything extends from the root cause. If there is something faulty in the root, that fault will extend forth to everything that comes from the root. That is why this verse is connected to all the exiles of Israel – not just to Egypt but to all the other nations to which the Jewish people were subjugated. They would not have been possible if it hadn’t been for Abraham’s transgressions. The sages make this point by interpreting the word v’gam – “And also (v’gam)  (In classic midrashic style the word v’gam is interpreted as adding something additional to our understanding because the word is superfluous. It suggests that this is a prophecy not only about Egypt but about all the other oppressive nations as well.)  the nation that you served will I judge.” If Abraham had been among those who went down to Egypt, then it would have been necessary to include Ishmael and Esau among those who are went down to Egypt. Therefore, God enacted that the decree should take place after Ishmael and Esau had been separated from Jacob and his children. Even though the punishment was for Abraham, he could not be among those who went down to Egypt so that eventually the land would only be given to the descendants of Jacob. Rabbi Abahu was of the opinion that Abraham was punished because he did not completely trust God when he pursued the four kings who made war on Sodom and Gomorrah. (Gen. 14) He forced his students to join his militia and brought them to war because he was afraid of being defeated.  (Could it be that Abraham thought that by having God fearing soldiers he was more likely to succeed? He appears to have thought by having his God fearing students with him God was more likely to protect him. Taking unfit soldiers into battle in order to gain God’s protection is showing a lack of trust in God.)  Taking better prepared soldiers (instead of his disciples), would not have been a transgression since one should not depend on miracles when going to war. Abraham should have trusted God to be with him rather than stacking the deck in his favor. That is why his offspring were subjugated for four hundred years so that by seeing God’s might, they would come to have complete faith in God. Samuel was of the opinion that Abraham lacked faith when he questioned whether God will send him an heir. The sin was that he said, “Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? (Gen. 15:8) This, however, was not a lack of trust in God (God forbid), because Abraham knew that he was destined to receive the land from God. Rather he was afraid that he was not worthy of meriting the right to receive the land from the standpoint of justice. Therefore, he asked for a sign from God to prove that he was worthy asking, “Whereby shall I know?” Because of this, his offspring had to spend four hundred years in exile so that they would learn to put their trust in God, as it is written, “They trusted in God and in Moses His servant.” (Exodus 14:31) Rabban Jochanan was of the opinion that it is unseemly to suggest that Abraham did not trust God. What he failed to do is to bring more converts beneath the shadow of God’s wings which would have been the way to honor to God. Abraham was slothful in convincing people to have faith in the Blessed One and he didn’t work hard enough to encourage faith. God wanted the divine name to be known throughout the world so all would believe in God. That is why Abraham’s offspring were enslaved for four hundred years. Afterwards they went forth with miracles and wonders so that people came forward to convert and to believe in God, as is stated: “Jethro heard…” (Ex. 19:1) These three incidents brought Israel to true faith. It is why Abraham’s sin brought so much punishment upon his offspring. It was fitting for Abraham to publicize the existence of God to the world. However it took a transgression to actualize this possibility. For what purpose does the world have if one does not publicize God’s existence in the world? There had to be a sin, even a small one, to bring this about. Also there is no subjugation or suffering without sin. It only took a small transgression to actualize this lesson. Abraham’s three transgressions brought about the three punishments. Abraham’s descendants were exiled because he pressed the students into militia service. Being a stranger in a foreign land and respect for ones students are connected in the following verse, “You shall rise up before…the elder and fear your God, I am the Lord. And if a stranger sojourns with you…” (Lev. 32:33-34) This is also the case in the Amida: “For the elders of Your people, the house of Israel, for the remnant of your scribes, and for the righteous strangers (gerim) and for us…” For not showing proper respect for the students of Torah, a decree of exile was placed upon Abraham’s offspring. “They shall be enslaved,” is a reference to the second sin: Abraham sinned by asking for a sign of God’s promise and presuming that he would be judged unworthy of God’s promise. The oppression came about because Abraham failed to bring more converts to a belief in God. The essence of Israel’s suffering came about because Israel had separated themselves in their faith. This only occurred because they did not bring more people beneath the wings of the Divine Presence and as a result there remained many who opposed Israel.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Whoever possesses these three things, he is of the disciples of Abraham, our father; and [whoever possesses] three other things, he is of the disciples of Balaam, the wicked. A good eye, a humble spirit and a moderate appetite he is of the disciples of Abraham, our father. An evil eye, a haughty spirit and a limitless appetite he is of the disciples of Balaam, the wicked. What is the difference between the disciples of Abraham, our father, and the disciples of Balaam, the wicked? The disciples of Abraham, our father, enjoy this world, and inherit the world to come, as it is said: “I will endow those who love me with substance, I will fill their treasuries” (Proverbs 8:21). But the disciples of Balaam, the wicked, inherit gehinnom, and descend into the nethermost pit, as it is said: “For you, O God, will bring them down to the nethermost pit those murderous and treacherous men; they shall not live out half their days; but I trust in You” (Psalms 55:24). This mishnah contrasts those who follow the ways of Abraham with those who follow the ways of Balaam, the wicked prophet who was hired by Balak to curse Israel (Numbers 22-24).  We should note that the rabbis understood Balaam as an archetype of evil, even though in the Torah itself he seems to be more of an ambivalent character, acting as merely a passive messenger of God.  In Sanhedrin 10:2 we learned that Balaam does not have a portion in the world to come.  Balaam is also seen by the rabbis as greedy for he attempted to take a bribe to curse Israel. In contrasting Abraham with Balaam we should note that both saddle their own donkeys in the Torah (Abraham in Genesis 23:2 and Balaam in Numbers 22:21).  Perhaps this similarity led to their comparison in our mishnah, and in several other sources. Abraham is known for three things:  generosity, humility and temperance. He demonstrates his generosity when he brings generous portions of food to the messengers who visit his home (Genesis 18:17).  He is humble when he negotiates the purchase of a grave for Sarah.  He states, “I am a resident alien among you” (Genesis 23:4, see also his words in 18:27).  His temperance in appetite is learned from a midrash on Gen. 12:11, where he states to Sarah, “Behold, I now know that you are a beautiful woman”.  According to the midrash Abraham had not looked at her until that moment. In contrast, Balaam is greedy for he pursues the reward he would have received for cursing Israel.  In Numbers 22:18 he states, “Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold”.  Rashi comments that from here we can see that Balak had already begun to think about the material reward that he might receive.  He is haughty as we can see from his statement, “The word of him who hears God’s speech, who obtains knowledge from the Most High” (Num 24:16).  He has a limitless appetite, for a midrash teaches that after he failed in cursing Israel, he advised Balak to allow the Moabite women to prostitute themselves to Israel, and thereby ensnare them in idol worship (see the beginning of Numbers 25).  He would not have advised such a thing if he himself did not desire such sexual licentiousness. The second half of the mishnah teaches the rewards that will be given to the disciples of Abraham and the punishments that will be given to the disciples of Balaam.  The verse from Proverbs is understood as referring to Abraham’s disciples since “those who love me” is also used in reference to Abraham (Isaiah 41:18).  The verse in Psalms is understood as referring to Balaam since he was murderous, for he advised Balak to seduce Israel and thereby led to the death of 24,000 Israelites (Num 25:9).</p>

Immediately after the account of his purchase of a burial plot for Sarah, we read: “Abraham was old, well advanced in years, and God had blessed Abraham with everything” (Gen. 24:1). This too is strange. Seven times, God had promised Abraham the land of Canaan. Yet when Sarah died, he did not own a single plot of land in which to bury her, and had to undergo an elaborate and even humiliating negotiation with the Hittites, forced to admit at the outset that “I am a stranger and temporary resident among you” (Gen. 23:4).

              <p>Something like that is the impression we get of Abraham in Parashat Ḥayei Sara. Sarah, his constant companion throughout their journeys, has died. He is 137 years old. We see him mourn Sarah’s death, and then he moves into action. He engages in an elaborate negotiation to buy a plot of land in which to bury her. As the narrative makes clear, this is not a simple task. He confesses to the local people, the Hittites, that he is “an immigrant and a resident among you” (Gen. 23:4), meaning that he knows he has no right to buy land. It will take a special concession on their part for him to do so. The Hittites politely but firmly try to discourage him. He has no need to buy a burial plot: “No one among us will deny you his burial site to bury your dead” (23:6). He can bury Sarah in someone else’s graveyard. Equally politely but no less insistently, Abraham makes it clear that he is determined to buy land. In the end, he pays a highly inflated price (four hundred silver shekels) to do so.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>In the two verses quoted above Solomon informed us of the penalty for stealing from the poor. It is well known that there are four categories of people concerning whom the Torah has expressed especial concern, asking people to be merciful towards them and not to inflict any harm upon them. They are: the poor, the orphans, the widows and the proselytes. Indeed we find that the Torah expresses a warning against discrimination against the aforesaid in one and the same verse in Deuteronomy 16,14 where we read: ושמחת בחגיך, אתה ובנך ובתך ועבדך ואמתך והלוי והגר והיתום והאלמנה אשר בשעריך. “You are to rejoice on your festival, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant and your maid servant, the proselyte, the orphan and the widow in your cities.”   Our sages as quoted by Rashi comment: “these four are Mine (G’d speaking). If you will give joy to those who are Mine, I will provide joy for those that are yours.” Mention of the Levites is equivalent to mentioning the poor as the Levites have no source of income other than the generosity of the Jewish farmer. G’d Himself is their portion as we read in Numbers 18,20 אני חלקך ונחלתך, “I am your share and your inheritance.” When the Torah legislated the treatment of the poor it did so both as a positive as well as a negative commandment. It is written (Deut. 15,10) נתון תתן, “you shall surely give (repeatedly),” (15,8) “and you shall repeatedly open your hand for him (the poor).” The negative counterpart of this commandment is found side by side (15,10), לא ירע לבבך בתתך לו, “your heart must not feel bad when you give him.” We also find another basic aspect of this commandment in Deut. 15,7 לא תאמץ את לבבך ולא תקפוץ את ידך מאחיך האביון, “do not harden your heart or close your hand against your destitute brother.”  Seeing that the Torah legislated against stealing altogether already in the Ten Commandments as well as in Leviticus 19, 19,13, there was no need to stress a prohibition against stealing from the poor. The instruction to give to the poor would have been sufficient to make it plain that it is forbidden to steal from the poor instead of giving to the poor. The fact that the Torah nonetheless writes words prohibiting this prompted Solomon to tell us that the penalty for stealing from the poor is far harsher than that for stealing from ordinary people. It was not Solomon’s habit to repeat commandments which have been spelled out in the Torah already and to simply repeat them in his volume משלי, Proverbs. Whenever he does so, he does so only in order to reveal an additional dimension to such a commandment. After all, who is so great that he could arrogate to himself to add to the Torah something Moses had not already thought of or been told by G’d to write down? Solomon, in common with later sages, only added “fences” to the Torah, i.e. warned against conduct which might lead to infringing Biblical commandments. This is why he said: “do not steal from the poor because he is poor,” i.e. stealing from him is so commonplace seeing that the poor is defenseless, that we must be warned not to exploit his weakness. The poor does not have protagonists such as the rich have. Everybody hates the poor and keeps his distance from him, even his relatives. This is why Solomon emphasises that the temptation to steal from the poor is great precisely “because he is poor.” Solomon therefore warns us not to think that because the poor do not have defenders of flesh and blood that they are without recourse. On the contrary, G’d Himself is their advocate and will see to it that they do not suffer because they are being exploited due to their poverty. He will go out of His way to administer punishment to anyone who steals from the poor. Contrary to the penalty for thieves who do not steal from the poor specifically, whose penalty the Torah expressed in terms of financial restitution and penal charges, someone who steals from the poor will endure chastisement of body and soul. This is the meaning of the words וקבע את קובעיהם נפש, “he will put in their places those who have tried to put the poor in their place.”  The Torah warns us in many places not to disadvantage orphans and widows, i.e. כל אלמנה ויתום לא תענון, ”do not oppress any orphan or widow” (Exodus 22,21). Our sages in the Mechilta comment on this verse: “even the widow of a king (presumably wealthy and influential) is included in this commandment.” The same applies to children of a king left orphaned. The reason is that in spite of their financial resources, the state of mind of such widows and orphans is one of melancholy and they are apt to cry at the slightest provocation. It is unfortunately a fact of life that people do take advantage of orphans and widows. The Torah goes on to say: אם ענה תענה אותם.....והרגתי אתכם בחרב והיו נשיכם אלמנות ובניכם יתומים, “if indeed you will persecute them..then I will kill you and your wives will become widows and your children orphans.” The Torah conditions this harsh punishment on the assumption that the victim cried out to G’d for vengeance. Generally speaking, people faced with unfair treatment put their faith in seeking recourse from a human tribunal. The orphan and widow have no other recourse than G’d Himself. This is why G’d listens specifically to their outcries and fights their battles for them.  Solomon also addresses the plight of orphans and widows in this chapter, and this is why he said (Proverbs 23,10-11) אל תסג גבול עולם, ובשדי יתומים אל תבא. כי גואלם חזק. הוא יריב את ריבם אתך. “Do not remove ancient boundary marks; do not encroach upon the field of orphans. For they have a powerful redeemer; he will fight their battles against you.”  The Torah also takes up the plight of the proselytes (strangers, immigrants to the land of Israel) on many occasions For instance, we find in Exodus 22,20 וגר לא תונה ולא תלחצנו כי גרים הייתם בארץ מצרים. “And do not taunt or oppress a stranger (convert) for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.” The Torah cites an additional reason for treating the proselyte fairly when it writes (Exodus 23,9) כי אתם ידעתם את נפש הגר, “for you are familiar with the mentality of the stranger.” Significantly, the Torah did not speak of your “knowing the stranger,” but of your being familiar with נפש הגר, the soul, the mentality of the stranger. You know that the mentality of strangers is one of feeling subdued, humbled, etc., so that his eyes are constantly turned towards G’d seeing he lacks in self-confidence.  The Talmud (Baba Metzia 58) speaks of the prohibition of reminding a proselyte or even his son of his former deeds or the deeds of his father. When such a proselyte comes to study Torah one is not to say to him: “ how can the mouth which used to enjoy all manner of forbidden foods presume to qualify to study the holy Torah.” The reminder of the Torah that when the Jewish people were still enslaved in Egypt their status was not superior to the recent proselyte is an example of the Rabbinic dictum מום שבך אל תאמר לחברך, “do not speak to your fellow man about a blemish as long as you yourself are afflicted with a similar blemish.” (Baba Metzia 59). In fact we find that the righteous themselves are referred to as גרים, strangers, the expression גר being derived from גרגיר, something that has been separated from its origin. The righteous is in the habit of viewing himself as distinctive, a loner, in the sense that he is different from the majority. For instance, he does not view his residence on this earth as something other than temporary. This is what King David had in mind when he said (Psalms 119,19) “I am only a stranger on earth, do not hide Your commandments from me.” He viewed himself as a tourist who has already been invited to commence a journey though he does not know the time of departure. Seeing that he does not know when he will depart, he must accumulate provisions for his journey to guard against a sudden and unprepared departure. What do these “provisions” consist of? The observance of G’d’s commandments. This is what David meant when he asked G’d not to hide His commandments from him. We also note that all of the patriarchs have been referred to as גרים on different occasions. Avraham said of himself (Genesis 23,4) “I am a stranger or a resident stranger amongst you” when he prepared to buy a burial ground for Sarah. Yitzchak was commanded by G’d to remain in the land of Canaan during the famine, albeit as a stranger. The wording is גור בארץ הזאת, “sojourn in this land on a temporary basis” (Genesis 26,3). Yaakov is referred to as a stranger in our verse (first verse of our portion וישב) as well as in Genesis 47,4 and when he described his long stay at Lavan’s as that of a stranger in Genesis 32,5.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>A Midrashic approach to our verse (Shemot Rabbah 32,2). From the words: “Here I am about to send an angel ahead of you,” we learn that G’d meant that had the Israelites been worthy He Himself would have continued to be at their head as He had been at the Exodus when the Torah testified “and the Lord Himself was walking ahead of them by day,” etc., (13,21). Now that they had proven unworthy G’d handed them over to an agent. This is the meaning of: “Here I am sending an angel ahead of you.” You will observe that as soon as the Jewish people had said כל אשר דבר ה’ נעשה ונשמע, “all that G’d has said we shall do and we shall hear (learn it)” in 24,7, G’d responded by saying: “I granted Adam eternal life for performing the single commandment I had given him not to eat from the tree of knowledge.” This is the meaning of Genesis 3,22: “here this Adam who had been just like one of Us, (i.e. immortal celestial being).” “These Jewish people who have undertaken to observe 613 of My commandments are surely entitled to eternal life!” The Midrash derives this from the words חרות על הלוחות, “freedom on the tablets” instead of reading it merely as “engraved on the Tablets” (32,16). We find a disagreement between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Nechemyah in the above quoted Midrash as to the precise meaning of the word חרות if read as meaning “freedom.” Rabbi Yehudah understands it as freedom from the oppression of mortal rulers, i.e. exile, whereas Rabbi Nechemyah understands it as freedom from the authority of the angel of death. He bases this on Numbers 21, 18-19 וממדבר מתנה, וממתנה נחליאל, ומנחליאל במות, “and from the wilderness- a gift. From “the gift”- my heritage became G’d. From the heritage called G’d- elevated heights.” Rabbi Nechemyah understands the verse not as describing physical landmarks describing where the Israelites rested on the way, but as spiritual landmarks and the gradual recapture by the entire people of Adam’s spiritual stature before the sin when he had still been immortal. The progression was as follows: through the experience of marching in the desert the Israelites merited the gift (מתנה) of Torah. Through the gift of Torah they inherited a relationship to divinity אל)) forever. Through this relationship they acquired immortality. After they had said to the golden calf: “these are your gods O Israel,” they again forfeited this new-found immortality. G’d said to them: ”you followed the same foolishness that Adam was guilty of who had proven unable to resist the temptation of the tree of knowledge for more than three hours. I had said: ‘you are divine (Psalms 82,6-7)-however you will have to die like humans.” In the past you were able to experience the Holy Spirit directly through Me. From now on you will be able to experience it only through the intermediary, the angel.” This is the meaning of “here I will send My angel ahead of you.” This is reflected in what Jeremiah 3,19 had in mind when he said: “I had resolved to adopt you as My child, and I gave you a desirable land- the fairest heritage of all nations; and I thought you would surely call Me “Father,” and never cease to be loyal to Me. Instead, you have broken faith with Me, as a woman breaks faith with a paramour, O House of Israel- declares the Lord.” G’d laments the fact that the Israelite people allowed Him to interpose the Gentile nations between Himself and the Jewish people. The words איך אשיתך mean a separation being established. The word is used in that sense in Genesis 30,40: “he set a separation between each flock.” When G’d referred to the “desirable land,” ארץ חמדה, He meant that it is a land which the great men of the world (the patriarchs) expressed a desire for. Avraham had pleaded with the sons of Chet to sell him a burial plot (Genesis 23,4). G’d had told Yitzchak: “reside in this land” (Genesis 26,3). Yaakov had expressed the wish to be buried in that land and claimed to have dug it with his own hands (Genesis 50,5). The reason Jeremiah quoted G’d as referring to the land of Israel as נחלת צבי, is that just as the skin of a deer shrinks after it has been removed from its carcass so that it does not cover it anymore, so the land of Israel displays similar lack of elasticity, not being able to accommodate itself to G’d’s bountiful harvests but flowing over with it. The expression צבאות גויים, “of the hosts of the world,” is a reference to the fact that all the kings on earth expressed a desire for this land. How do we know this? We find that the city of Jericho had its own king and that the town of Ai less than three miles removed also had its own king. The kingdoms in the land of Canaan each covered very small amounts of territory. In fact if a king ruled over a vast tract of land outside of the land of Israel but did not have a small kingdom inside the boundaries of the land of Israel he was not even considered as entitled to describe himself as “king.” [Proof of the truth of this is the fact that Joshua made war against and defeated no fewer than 31 Kings all in the narrow land called “the land of Israel,” not even including the coastal areas inhabited by the Philistines. Ed.]   There is an interesting comment by Rabbi Parnach in the name of Rabbi Yochanan (Tanchuma Mishpatim 17). The words spoken by Achan ben Carmi in Joshua 7,21: וארא בשלל אדרת שנער, “I have seen amongst the loot (of the city of Jericho) a cloak from Shinor.” He understands the words literally as a cloak belonging to the King of Babylon (Shinor). He considered it as so valuable that he wore it only in Jericho.   When Jeremiah 3,19 continues: “I had hoped you would call Me father,” he referred to G’d thinking that seeing He had taken the Israelites out of Egypt, and split the sea for them that surely He was entitled to the respect of a father. Instead, they had made the golden calf. Considering further that G’d had provided the Israelites with all their needs in the desert, they in turn had been unfaithful to him. When the Gentile nations had become unfaithful to G’d, He had appointed agents to look after their welfare instead of doing so Himself. Similarly, with the Jews. Now that they had become unfaithful, He would appoint this angel to look after them instead of continuing to do so Himself. This then is the meaning of the words: “Here I am going to send an angel ahead of you.”</p>

              <p>In any event, the baraita teaches that one is exempt from the recitation of Shema, from the Amida prayer and from phylacteries, and from all mitzvot mentioned in the Torah. This is an apparent contradiction of our mishna which states that one is exempt only when the deceased is laid before him. To resolve this contradiction, Rav Pappa said: Explain the baraita as applicable only to the particular case when one turns his face away and eats, with the deceased laid out before him. In the other cases, when he is in a different room, he is obligated in all mitzvot. Rav Ashi says: The phrase: The deceased is laid out before him, is not to be taken literally, but rather, since it is incumbent upon him to bury the deceased, and he is not yet buried, it is as if he is laid out before him, as it is stated: “And Abraham rose up from before his dead” (Genesis 23:3), and when Abraham speaks with the Hittites, it is stated: “So that I may bury my dead from before me” (Genesis 23:4). As long as it is incumbent upon him to bury him, it is as he is laid out before him.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Beloved are proselytes [by God], for [Scripture] everywhere uses the same epithets of them as of Israel; [61b] as it is stated, But thou, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen. (Isa. 41, 8. Jacob is here interpreted as ibid. XLIV, 5, And another shall call himself by the name of Jacob—these are the proselytes of righteousness (cf. towards the end of this tractate). The order of the quotations in V is confused.)  The term ‘love’ is applied to Israel, as it is stated, I have loved you, saith the Lord, (Mal. 1, 2.)  and the term ‘love’ is applied to proselytes, as it is stated, And He loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. (Deut. 10, 18.)  Israel are called ‘servants’, as it is stated, For unto Me the children of Israel are servants, (Lev. 25, 55. V omits the quotation.)  and proselytes are called ‘servants’, as it is stated, To be His servants. (Isa. 56, 6.)  The term ‘acceptable’ is used of Israel, as it is stated, And it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord, (Ex. 28, 38.)  and the term ‘acceptable’ is used of proselytes, as it is stated, Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar. (Isa. 56, 7.)  The term ‘keeping’ is applied to Israel, as it is stated, The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand, (Ps. 121, 5.)  and the term ‘keeping’ is applied to proselytes, as it is stated, The Lord preserveth the strangers. (ibid. CXLVI, 9.)  The term ‘ministering’ is applied to Israel, as it is stated, But ye shall be named the priests of the Lord, men shall call you the ministers of our God, (Isa. 61, 6.)  and the term ‘ministering’ is applied to proselytes, as it is stated, Also the aliens, that join themselves to the Lord, to minister unto Him. (ibid. LVI, 6.)  Beloved are proselytes seeing that our father Abraham did not circumcise himself when he was twenty or thirty years of age, but when he was ninety-nine years old; (Cf. Gen. 17, 24.)  since if he had circumcised himself when he was twenty or thirty years old, no Gentile would have become a proselyte when he had passed the age of twenty or thirty. The Holy One, blessed be He, kept putting it off (The verb has fallen out of V.)  until he had reached ninety-nine years, so as not to close the door in the face of proselytes, [and to allow more days and years so as to increase the reward of those who do His will, as it is stated, The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, to make the teaching great and glorious]. (Isa. 42, 21. The passage within brackets is added by MS.K. and H.)  Our father Abraham called himself a ger, as it is stated, I am a stranger [ger] and a sojourner with you. (Gen. 22, 4.)  Similarly David, king of Israel, called himself a ger, as it is stated, For I am a stranger [ger] with Thee, (Ps. 39, 13.)  and likewise it states, For we are strangers before Thee. (1 Chron. 29, 15.)  Beloved is the Land of Israel because it makes proselytes fit [to be received]. If a man says in the Land of Israel, ‘I am a proselyte’, he is accepted at once, but outside the Land of Israel he is not accepted unless his witnesses are with him. Beloved is the Land of Israel because it atones for iniquities and transgressions, as it is stated, And the inhabitant shall not say: ‘I am sick’, the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. (Isa. 33, 24.)  And so you find in the four classes that stand before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated, One shall say: ‘I am the Lord’s’; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel. (ibid. XLIV, 5.)  One shall say: ‘I am the Lord’s’—this alludes to one who belongs wholly to the Omnipresent and has no admixture of sin. Another shall call himself by the name of Jacob—this alludes to the proselytes of righteousness. (A term to denote the genuine and complete convert.)  Another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord—this alludes to those who repent. And surname himself by the name of Israel—this alludes to those who fear Heaven.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויענו בני חת, “the members of the tribe of the Hittites, replied;” on these words Rabbi Elazar commented that untold numbers of pens have been broken and untold amounts of ink have been used up for the Torah to repeat the expression בני חת, “the members of the tribe of the Hittites, in this paragraph no fewer than ten times. Our sages say that we learn from here that anyone who assists a righteous person to receive his due share is viewed as if he had observed the commandments in all the Five Books of Moses. We find in Kings II 4,42, as similar –apparently unnecessary repetition- when told: ואיש בא מבעל שלשה ויבא לאיש האלוקים לחם, בכורים, עשרים לחם שעורים וכרמל בצקלו ויאמר: תן לעם ויאכלו. “A man came from Baal-shalisha and he brought the man of G–d some bread from the first reaping- twenty loaves of barley bread and some fresh grain, in his sack; and Elisha said: give it to the people to eat.” (The prophet in this paragraph was Elisha) Anyone reading this paragraph must wonder was Elisha then a priest that the bikkurim would be brought to him? The answer given is that when someone brings a Torah scholar a gift it is considered by our sages as if that person had personally erected the Temple and had offered the first fruit, bikkurim, therein (Talmud tractate Ketuvot folio 105). We find a third occasion when unnecessary repetition seems to occur in the Bible in the Book of Joshua (Joshua 7,10) in connection with Achan who had stolen from the loot of Jericho; in that report the word גם is repeated five times, though it could easily been avoided. On that occasion our sages interpret the constant repetition of the word גם by saying that it teaches that if someone steals property belonging to the Temple treasure it is considered as if he had transgressed all the commandments of the Five Books of Moses. Another way of looking at this particular example: If you take the respective first and last letters in the last letter of each of the five Books of Moses, i.e. the letters ב-ם from the last word in the Book of Genesis במצרים, plus the letters מ-ם in the word מסעיהם at the end of the Book of Exodus, plus the letters ס-י from the word סיני at the end of the Book of Leviticus, plus the two letters י-ר of the word יריחו at the end of the Book of Numbers, i.e. ס-י from the word סיני at the end of the Book of Numbers, plus the letters י-ל from the word ישראל at the end of the Book of Deuteronomy you will have the numerical value of the word חרם=248. The sin of Achan was stealing from חרם, from what belongs to G–d. (Attributed to Sefer Chassidim page 106, (in the edition with Rabbi Price’s commentary)</p>

              <p>“Abraham arose from before his dead, and he spoke to the children of Ḥet, saying” (Genesis 23:3).  “Abraham arose from before his dead” – this teaches (The verse can also be translated: “Abraham arose from before death.” The angel of death was intimidating him and urging him to bury Sarah promptly.)  that he saw the angel of death provoking him.  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where is it derived what we learn in a mishna: One whose dead one [a deceased relative] is lying before him (That is, he is charged with burying the body.)  is exempt from the recitation of Shema, from prayer, and from wearing phylacteries, as well as all mitzvot in the Torah? (Mishna Berakhot 3:1.)  It is from here: “[Abraham] arose…and he spoke.” (He did not engage in any other activity prior to his burying his dead.)  “I am a sojourner and a resident among you: give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” (Genesis 23:4).  “A sojourner [ger] and a resident”; ger means one who dwells as a tenant; toshav means a landlord. [Abraham was saying:] ‘If you prefer, I will act as a tenant, (Humbly beseeching your permission to bury Sarah.)  but if not, I will act as a landlord, (And take it without your consent.)  as this is what the Holy One blessed be He has said to me: “To your descendants I have given this land”’ (Genesis 15:18).  “Give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” – I am requesting [a plot] for only one dead person, as it is stated: “Give me a burial plot with you, [and I will bury my dead].”  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham, saying to him” (Genesis 23:5).  “Hear us, my lord: you are a prince of God in our midst, in our choicest graves bury your dead; none of us shall withhold his grave from you, from burying your dead” (Genesis 23:6).  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham…Hear us, my lord…” – you are king over us, you are prince over us, you are like a god to us. He said to them: ‘Let the world not fail to accept its true King, let the world not fail to accept its true God.’   “In our choicest graves” – in the choicest one of our many graves.   “Bury your dead” – many dead. (Although Abraham had requested a single grave site, for Sarah, the children of Ḥet offered him a site for many burials.)  “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land, the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 23:7.   “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land” (The verse does not say that Abraham bowed “to” the people, but that he bowed “before” them. He bowed to God in their presence, giving thanks for his good fortune in obtaining the permission he had sought.)  – from here we learn that one should give thanks [to God] over hearing good tidings.</p>

            <summary>Avraham represents the intellect, which is hindered by physical powers similar to a donkey; when he removes these physical powers, he is able to serve God fully. The separation of the lads from Avraham symbolizes the separation of the intellect from the physical body, allowing the intellect to reach its highest stature and cleave to God.</summary>

              <p>And note that the lads were with Avraham until he saw the place from afar. And then he said to them (Genesis 23:5), &quot;abide here with the donkey.&quot; But the whole time that he did not see the place from afar, the lads were with him. And this thing indicates to you that the separated faculty riding is the one that rides upon the body, he is the one that leads these two faculties - and they are with him to the extent that these two faculties absorb from the holiness and virtue of the one riding on the donkey. It is only when the separated faculty comes to cling to the highest stature - with his separated stature that is separated from the physical beings - that they are then unable [to remain with it] and they stay with the body. And therefore when Avraham saw the place in which Avraham would cleave to his highest stature, he said to his two lads (Genesis 23:5), &quot;abide here with the donkey.&quot; But all the time that he was not cleaving to this stature, his lads were with him and they were cleaving to him then. </p>

                <h4>Derekh Chayyim 5:19:5</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>And you should know that from this angle, Avraham - and likewise Bilaam - is similar to man. For the intellect that this man has rides upon the bodily substance; and there are two powers that serve the intellect - and this has been explained earlier (Derekh Chaim 2:9). And there is no doubt that Avraham is similar to the intellect, since Avraham fulfilled the whole Torah from his [own] intellect. And that [is the meaning of that] which it states (Genesis 22:3), &quot;and his two lads were with him,&quot; and he said to his two lads (Genesis 23:5), &quot;abide here with the donkey (im hachamor)&quot; - a people that is similar to a donkey (am hadomeh lechamor) (Yevamot 62a). For these powers - which are physical powers - are a people that is similar to a donkey. And when Avraham went to serve God, may He be blessed, to sacrifice his son - to overcome his [evil] impulse, which is with the body - he then removed the physical and the physical powers from himself. So he said to them, &quot;Abide here with the donkey&quot; - a people that is similar to a donkey - &quot;and the lad and I, we will go to there, bow down and return.&quot; For the whole time that the physical powers are with the intellect, they impede the bowing down to God, may He be blessed - to be humbled in front of God, may He be blessed. But when he removes the physical and the faculties, he goes to serve God, may He be blessed. Yet he nevertheless said, &quot;and we will return to you.&quot; For man cannot become totally separated. Rather he serves God, may He be blessed; and afterwards he goes back to his needs, so he returns to his body and his faculties.</p>

            <summary>In Kedushat Levi, it is explained that the influence of righteous individuals, such as Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Avraham, can have a profound impact on their environment, even affecting the spiritual wisdom of children. The immaculate birth of Rivkah is attributed to the overflow of Avraham's good deeds. In Mei HaShiloach, it is discussed how God uses nations to rule over Israel as a means of inspiring teshuva, with Yitzchak's banishment by Avimelech serving as a lesson in recognizing deficiencies and fostering a desire for Torah study. This is compared to Shlomo HaMelech's experience with silver and Torah study before and after marrying Pharaoh's daughter.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>Genesis ‎24,14. “and through her I shall know that You have done a ‎kindness with my master.” These words of Eliezer have been ‎explained in the Zohar where the author states that in the ‎time of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai even small children possessed ‎some special wisdom that enabled them to know what other ‎adults do not know. [The children being innocent. Ed.] They were ‎endowed with this superior wisdom as part of the spiritual rays ‎radiating from the saintly personality of Rabbi Shimon bar ‎Yochai. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is quoted as an example of the ‎influence exerted on his environment by every righteous person, ‎each one in varying degrees according to his spiritual stature. ‎They are to be perceived as a microcosm of Hashem, Who as ‎the macrocosm, disseminates spiritual influence throughout His ‎universe through His very existence. There is no question but ‎that Avraham’s major attribute was ‎חסד‎ and that he had a ‎profound influence on his immediate environment, not only ‎recognized but paid tribute to, by the people of Kiryat Arba, ‎when they described him as a “prince of G’d” in their midst. ‎‎(Genesis 23,6) Avraham personified on earth, what the Creator ‎personifies in the entire universe, i.e. the dispensing of ‎largesse. The expression ‎ילדה‎ is not appropriate for males, as ‎they only ‎הוליד‎, beget, plant seed, but do not bring it to gestation. ‎The proper meaning of the word “yuldah” as it appears ‎here suggests an immaculate birth, a birth that had not been ‎preceded by insemination. Seeing that this is a difficult process ‎for us to grasp, the idea that Avraham’s good deeds “spilled over” ‎even to people such as Betuel, is meant to set our mind at ‎rest over the fact that Rivkah, with a father such as Betuel, and a ‎brother such as Lavan, could have been such a righteous ‎matriarch as she clearly was. During the meal, Eliezer recounts ‎what had occurred at the well, and anyone who has read the ‎Torah’s report of what transpired is aware that Eliezer rewrote ‎some of this “history,” i.e. the sequence of events. Rashi ‎points this out (in his commentary on Genesis 24,47) implying ‎that during the meal, in the presence of Betuel, Eliezer could not ‎bring himself to imply that this man had been endowed with part ‎of Avraham’s soul. [Perhaps the fact that if even a Betuel could ‎exclaim that this match had been made in heaven (Genesis 24,50) ‎is the best support for our author’s theory that some of ‎Avraham’s spirit had spilled over even into the soul of a Betuel. ‎Ed.]‎</p>

              <p>“And Yitzchak returned and digged the wells of water ….” (Bereshit, 26:18) It is written (Tehilim, 147:17), “He sends His ice like crumbs … He causes the wind to blow and the waters to flow.” “He sends His ice like crumbs,” meaning that God gives the nations the power to rule over Israel. “He causes the wind to blow,” that is to say that afterwards the Holy One, blessed be He, is reconciled with Israel, for “blows” is a term denoting meshivat nefesh, “restoring the soul.” Then sweetened waters will flow. “He speaks His word to Yaakov,” meaning that He tells them the sin and deficiency that exists within them, by means of which the nations have the power to rule over them, and then they immediately return in teshuva. “He did not do this to every nation,” for He does not reveal His intention to them at all. And so it was here, when Yitzchak saw that Avimelech said to him, “go away from us,” since he thought that Yitzchak was feeling superior over them. Truly, Yitzchak’s feelings of superiority over Avimelech was not at all considered a deficiency, for it was as if a man felt superior to an animal, and it is simply the order of creation that man is greater than the animal. Therefore Avimelech’s response was very evil in his eyes, since he was the son of Avraham Avinu, who was a king in the world, as it was said (Bereshit, 23:6), “a prince of E-lohim.” Avraham’s prestige was widespread, and his nature well known, so why did they have to antagonize his son until he had to be banished from Gerar? Once he had regained composure, he realized that certainly he was blemished and lacking in the way of service of his father, meaning the attribute of love, which is desire and longing for words of Torah. Avimelech was but an instrument to insure that Yitzchak would take this to heart. Avimelech himself did not at all understand how God was conducting affairs through him, for (Tehilim, 147), “they have not known His judgments.” Once Yitzchak understood this, it says immediately (Bereshit, 26:18), “and Yitzchak returned to dig the wells of water that the servants of his father had dug.” That is to say, by means of this he arrived at the attribute of love, seeing the deficiency in himself, and then of itself a new desire for words of Torah came to him (water and wells are often a symbol for Torah). We find this concerning Shlomo haMelech. It is written in the Gemara (Sanhedrin, 21b), “silver was considered as nothing in the days of Shlomo” (Divrei HaYamim 2, 9:20), and it is written, “Shlomo gave out his silver in Jerusalem like stones” (Kings 1, 10:27). But there is a difference. The first verse refers to before he married Pharaoh’s daughter (and then silver was as having no value); the second is after he married Pharaoh’s daughter (and had the value of a stone, i.e., “shave pruta.” Rashi). At first, when he had great influence in Torah, then therefore he had less desire for words of Torah, which is called cessef, “silver.” Cessef, silver, is related to Cisuf, longing. Then after he married Pharaoh’s daughter, which was considered a deficiency, then of itself a new desire materialized within him. This is why after he married Pharaoh’s daughter it does not say, “considered as nothing,” regarding money (i.e., longing), for afterwards the desire had taken hold within him.</p>

            <summary>The Children of Heth addressed Abraham as &quot;my lord&quot; instead of &quot;our lord&quot; because one man spoke on behalf of all, showing respect as a subordinate. The term &quot;mighty prince&quot; was used to describe Abraham due to his status as a prophet. The word &quot;yikhleh&quot; in Hebrew means &quot;shall withhold,&quot; and can be spelled with either a heh or an alef. The locals declared that Abraham could bury Sarah in the choicest burial place and that none would withhold their graves from him, giving him informal rights to their land.</summary>

They considered him as if G-d Himself had sent him. As far as his second request was concerned that he needed to acquire ancestral rights to any burial plot so as to safeguard it to being ploughed over in the future by its previous owner, every one of them would be willing to deed to him the plot that he had already chosen for himself his own future burial plot. He should meanwhile proceed to bury his dead and they would it consider an honour to have Sarah buried in a plot that had once belonged to one of them. איש את קברו, even if Avraham, by chance would select a plot that one of them had already earmarked as his own future burial ground.</p>

Since they apparently all spoke we would expect the use of the term our lord.)  One man spoke. He employed the term my lord because it is impolite to include others when one is speaking as a subordinate. (In other words, And the children of Heth answered does not mean they all spoke in unison. One man spoke on behalf of all. Had they all spoken, Scripture would have read adonenu. It should be noted that the entire verse, with the exception of adoni, is in the plural.) </p>

              <p>“You are the elect of God among us” [23:6]. The children of Heth responded to Abraham: you are an important lord among us. Do not make yourself humble, like a stranger. Choose for yourself the best field, nobody will deny it to you. (Ibid.)  “Intervene for me with Ephron son of Zohar. Let him sell me the cave of Machpelah” [23:8–9]. Abraham said to the children of Heth. Ask Ephron that he should give me the two-story cave. It was called Machpelah; This means, two-story. That is, it had two levels, one on top of the other. Another explanation is that only couples lay in the cave, Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Leah. (Rashi, Genesis, 23:9.)  It was also called Machpelah because of the height of Adam, who was doubled over in the cave. (Bahya, Genesis, 23:9.)  Abraham said: I will give good silver for the cave. Ephron responded: four hundred weight of silver. What is that between us? Bury your dead.</p>

              <p>In a number of places, the Torah presents us with the mission of serving as a role model for other nations. (See Shemot 19:6, Seforno’s comments ad. loc., and Devarim 4:6.)  Indeed, part of every Jew’s role is to emulate the kiddush Hashem created by Avraham Avinu, who is referred to by his Hittite neighbors as “a prince of God amongst us” (Bereishit 23:6). Chazal regard a chillul Hashem as such a major infraction (see, for example, Yoma 86a) because setting a positive example for others is at the core of the mission of the Jewish people.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Chapter (55) 56: Prophets. [1] The vision of Obadiah (Obadiah 1). May the memory of the righteous be for a blessing. When Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said (Job 4:1), Rabbi Berachiah said, &quot;Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, exact punishment from Esau in a vision? Rather, it was to teach us how God repays both a hater and a lover according to their deeds. When Job was afflicted, Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau, was his friend, and Eliphaz was righteous and rebuked Job only in a vision. The verse says, &quot;Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 'If one ventures a word with you, will you be offended? But who can keep from speaking?'&quot; (Job 4:2). It is like a parable of a man who had two wives, one whose dowry was ten thousand and one whose dowry was four thousand. The one whose dowry was four thousand said to him, &quot;Why don't you treat me with the same respect as your other wife?&quot; He said to her, &quot;Your dowry is four thousand, and your friend's dowry is ten thousand.&quot; Similarly, Job said, &quot;Why don't you treat me with the same respect as Abraham?&quot; He said to him, &quot;Have you been tested like Abraham?&quot; He who is tested will be afflicted by what is said to him. And only Abraham was tested, as it says, &quot;God tested Abraham&quot; (Genesis 22:1). He said to them, &quot;But I did not bring in four wreaths.&quot; &quot;He was whole-hearted and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil&quot; (Job 1:1). They said to him, &quot;Abraham was tested with ten, and he had ten wreaths.&quot; He was called Ethan, as it says, &quot;A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite&quot; (Psalms 89:1), and similarly, &quot;The mighty men are foundations of the earth&quot; (Micah 6:2). And why was he called Ethan? Because he strengthened himself to do the will of his Creator. He who believed in God was called Heman, as it says, &quot;And he believed in the Lord&quot; (Genesis 15:6). And why is Eitan called Heman, who strengthened himself to do the will of his Creator, called Heman, because he believed in the Almighty, as it says &quot;And he believed in the Lord&quot; (Genesis 15:6). Abram was originally called Abram, and then the Lord added to his name, and he became Abraham. Why did the Lord add to his name? Because he fulfilled the five books of the Torah even before they were given, as it says &quot;Because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws&quot; (Genesis 26:5). Therefore, he is called Abraham. He is also called &quot;Ayit&quot; (Falcon), as it says &quot;One calls from the east a bird of prey&quot; (Isaiah 46:11), referring to the hen that protects her chicks from the wolves and the ravens. Similarly, Abraham risked his life by being thrown into the furnace for his beliefs. He is called &quot;Tzur&quot; (Rock), as it says &quot;Look to the rock from which you were hewn&quot; (Isaiah 51:1). Just as a rock has no [עיים ruins or eyes], so Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac when commanded to do so. He is called &quot;Nasi&quot; (Prince), as it says &quot;For thus says the High and Lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: 'I dwell in the high and holy place, with him who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones'&quot; (Isaiah 57:15). He is called &quot;Adon&quot; (Lord), as it says &quot;And he said, 'Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham'&quot; (Genesis 24:27). And if you ask why he was called Adon, was it not because he was his servant? Others also called him Adon, as it says &quot;And we said to my lord&quot; (Genesis 44:19), because he made the Almighty Lord over all of His creatures. He is called &quot;Elohim&quot; (God), as it says &quot;The prince of God&quot; (Genesis 23:6). This is because he made known the fear of the Almighty in his world, as it says &quot;You are God-fearing&quot; (Genesis 22:12). He is called &quot;Navi&quot; (Prophet), as he first revealed the power of the Holy Spirit, as it says &quot;And you return the wife of the man, for he is a prophet&quot; (Genesis 20:7). &quot;And he shall be called a God-fearing man, as it is said, 'Now I know that you are a God-fearing man' (Job 22:12), for he was in awe of the Lord and called a lover, as it is said, 'the seed of Abraham, my friend' (Isaiah 41:8). Behold, ten trials were given to correspond to the ten qualities. Eliphaz said to him, 'Do you possess these qualities? If so, then trouble will come upon you. Behold, you have comforted many' (Job 4:3-4). Those who suffer came to you, and you comforted them. The blind one came and said to you, 'God already knows what I am going to do, for He made me blind from my mother's womb.' And you said to him, 'Do not say that.' And you said to him, 'My son, if you built a house and did not want to make windows, who would have forced you?' You are a linchpin of the Almighty, and He did not do this out of hatred, but to praise you in the future, as it is said, 'Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened' (Isaiah 35:5). &quot;So shall Hashem of Hosts be a protecting wall to the remnant of Israel; to them shall they deliver from captivity and return. And the Passover [Haggadah] says, 'Do not say thus, &quot;If I were there, I would have built pillars for myself.&quot; Whoever says this, God praises him for the future, as it says, &quot;Then shall leap as a hart the lame&quot; (Zechariah 8:4). And also, the [Haggadah] says, 'The deaf-mute one says to him, &quot;If you were a skilled craftsman and did not want to make ears for your friend, who could compel you?&quot; Thus, God praises you for the World-to-Come, as it says, &quot;And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped&quot; (Isaiah 35:5). You comforted all who were afflicted, &quot;The tottering one will be restored by you&quot; (Job 4:4). And now, when afflictions have befallen you, you are confused, as it says, &quot;Now it shall come upon you and you will be broken&quot; (Job 4:5). &quot;Is not your fear of God your confidence?&quot; (Job 4:6) Because you said, &quot;I am pure and upright,&quot; if not for the fact that God acted towards you as one does towards a human being, and brought the Flood, your righteousness would have been before you. Remember now, who being innocent has ever perished?&quot; (Job 4:7). Eliphaz said to Job, &quot;Even if Abraham the righteous had been in your place, he would not have been spared,&quot; as it says, &quot;I am the Lord Who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans&quot; (Genesis 15:7). &quot;If you are righteous, He will have mercy upon you, for He does not destroy the righteous, as it is said, 'Remember now, who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?' (Job 4:7-8). When I saw those who plow iniquity (Job 4:8), I envied the wicked who were at ease, who sow mischief and reap calamity. But lo, the day comes, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble; the day that comes shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. (Malachi 3:19) He who roars like a lion and the voice of the fierce lion is heard no more (Isaiah 31:4), it was said to him, 'Israel will eventually sin before the Lord who is called a lion, as it is said, 'The lion has roared, who will not fear?' (Amos 3:8). He elevated them to Nebuchadnezzar who was called a lion, as it is said, 'The lion has come up from his thicket' (Jeremiah 4:7), and in the month of Tammuz, whose sign is the lion, he destroyed the Temple, which is called the lion, as it is said, 'Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt' (Isaiah 29:1), and he who rules over Judah is called a lion, as it is said, 'Judah is a lion's whelp' (Genesis 49:9). Here, he explains five names, all of them called a lion. The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the two young lions have been silenced. The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. (Job 4:10-11) Elihu said to him, 'It was not I who spoke, but the Spirit of God who dwells in me' (Job 32:8). And how were all of these proven in a vision? As it is said in the visions of the night (Job 4:13), the Lord said to him, 'You have proved My servant Job in a vision; even so I will send a prophet who will prove and punish the house of your father in a vision, as it is said, 'The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord God concerning Edom: We have heard tidings from the Lord, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: &quot;Rise up! Let us rise against her for battle!&quot; (Obadiah 1:1) Why should you serve us? Even I will unsheathe My sword and come down upon him, as it is said, 'For My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; behold, it descends for judgment upon Edom, upon the people I have doomed to destruction' (Isaiah 34:5).</p>

(He would interpret the meaning of people’s names to uncover something about their inner nature.)  Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa would [also] expound names. “Bera” – as he was a wicked son [ben ra]; “Birsha” – as he was an evil son [ben rasha]; “Shinav” – as he aspired [shoev] to wealth; “Shemever” – as he would fly off (Sam ever – he would spread his wings to fly, i.e., he would travel far and wide in search of money. )  to bring wealth; “and the king of Bela, which is Tzoar” – as its residents were swallowed up [nitbale’u].  “All these joined forces at the valley of Sidim, which is the Dead Sea” (Genesis 14:3).  “All these joined forces at the valley of Sidim” – it was called three names: The valley of Sidim, the valley of Shaveh, (Genesis 14:17.)  and the valley of Sukkot. (Psalms 60:8.)  The valley of Sidim – because it grew [wood used for] chopping blocks [sedanim]. Alternatively, it is because it was divided into many fields [sadim] with plowed furrows. Alternatively, it is because it nourished its offspring (Those who resided in that land.)  like breasts [shadayim].  Valley of Shaveh – Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Ḥelbo in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Because there all the idolaters came to a consensus [hushvu], chopped down cedars, constructed a large platform, seated him [Abraham] atop it, and lauded him, saying: “Hear us, my lord: you are a Godly ruler in our midst” (Genesis 23:6). They said to him: ‘You are king over us, you are ruler over us, you are a god over us.’ He said to them: ‘Let the world not lack its [true] King, and let the world not lack its [true] God.’ (You should realize that God, not I, is the true king and God.)   Valley of Sukkot – because it was covered with trees. (Sukkot means something that provides shade.)  Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Grapevines, fig trees, pomegranate trees, walnut trees, almond trees, apple trees, and peach trees.  “Which is the Dead Sea” – Rabbi Aivu said: There were [originally] only channels of rivers, that broke open and became a sea. That is what is written: “He breaks channels through the rocks” (Job 28:10).</p>

              <p>God tested [nisa] Abraham” – Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: He exalted him like the ensign [nes] on a ship. Rabbi Akiva says: He tested him in the literal sense, so that people should not say: He stunned him and confused him and he did not know what to do. (That is why the journey to Mount Moriah took three days, to give Abraham time to consider whether or not to sacrifice his son.)    “He said: Here I am” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: In two places Moses likened himself to Abraham. (“God called out to him from amidst the bush and said: Moses, Moses. And he said: Here I am” (Exodus 3:4).)  The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Do not glorify yourself before a king, and in the place of the great do not stand” (Proverbs 25:6). (Do not presume to compare yourself to Abraham.)  Abraham said: “Here I am” – here I am [ready] for priesthood, here I am [ready] for kingship. And he in fact merited priesthood and merited kingship. He merited priesthood, [as it is stated regarding Abraham] – “The Lord has sworn, and He will not renounce it; you are a priest forever (Psalms 110:4); [and] kingship [as the Hittites said to Abraham] – “you are a prince of God in our midst” (Genesis 23:6). Moses [also] said: “Here I am” (Exodus 3:4) – here I am [ready] for priesthood, here I am [ready] for kingship. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Do not approach [tikrav] here [halom]” (Exodus 3:5). Kerav is specifically a reference to the priesthood, just as it says: “The stranger who approaches [karev] shall be put to death” (Numbers 1:51). Halom is specifically a reference to kingship, just as it is stated [that David said]: “That You have brought me to here [halom]” (II Samuel 7:18). (But in fact Moses received neither priesthood not kingship. The Midrash elaborates on only one of the two ways in which Moses compared himself to Abraham. For the other, see Devarim Rabba 2:7.) </p>

Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where is it derived what we learn in a mishna: One whose dead one [a deceased relative] is lying before him (That is, he is charged with burying the body.)  is exempt from the recitation of Shema, from prayer, and from wearing phylacteries, as well as all mitzvot in the Torah? (Mishna Berakhot 3:1.)  It is from here: “[Abraham] arose…and he spoke.” (He did not engage in any other activity prior to his burying his dead.)  “I am a sojourner and a resident among you: give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” (Genesis 23:4).  “A sojourner [ger] and a resident”; ger means one who dwells as a tenant; toshav means a landlord. [Abraham was saying:] ‘If you prefer, I will act as a tenant, (Humbly beseeching your permission to bury Sarah.)  but if not, I will act as a landlord, (And take it without your consent.)  as this is what the Holy One blessed be He has said to me: “To your descendants I have given this land”’ (Genesis 15:18).  “Give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” – I am requesting [a plot] for only one dead person, as it is stated: “Give me a burial plot with you, [and I will bury my dead].”  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham, saying to him” (Genesis 23:5).  “Hear us, my lord: you are a prince of God in our midst, in our choicest graves bury your dead; none of us shall withhold his grave from you, from burying your dead” (Genesis 23:6).  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham…Hear us, my lord…” – you are king over us, you are prince over us, you are like a god to us. He said to them: ‘Let the world not fail to accept its true King, let the world not fail to accept its true God.’   “In our choicest graves” – in the choicest one of our many graves.   “Bury your dead” – many dead. (Although Abraham had requested a single grave site, for Sarah, the children of Ḥet offered him a site for many burials.)  “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land, the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 23:7.   “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land” (The verse does not say that Abraham bowed “to” the people, but that he bowed “before” them.

              <p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22): AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH. This was Ephron the Hittite. (See above, Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; and the parallels listed there; below, Tanh. (Buber), Deut. 4:4.)  When Abraham's wife Sarah died, Abraham went to Ephron for him to sell him the cave. Ephron said to him: Give me its price. He said to him (in Gen. 23:15): WHAT IS A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER BETWEEN YOU AND ME? SO BURY YOUR DEAD. Abraham began piling up the silver for Ephron, as stated (in Gen. 23:16): SO ABRAHAM HEEDED EPHRON, AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE SILVER FOR EPHRON…. Ben Ma'ma said: Although R. Hanina has said: All the shekels in the Torah are sela'im, these &lt; shekels &gt; are an exception, since they are centenaria. (The word is Latin. One centenarium was worth 100,000 sesterces. According to a fourth-century inscription of northern Africa, a centenarium was a hundred pieces (e.g., of gold). See A. Souter, A Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A.D. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1957). s.v.)  &lt; It was &gt; four hundred centenaria &lt; that &gt; Abraham piled up before Ephron. When Ephron saw the silver, he moved quickly and was persuaded, as stated (in Gen. 23:6): BURY YOUR DEAD IN THE CHOICEST OF OUR TOMBS. The Holy One said to him: You have moved quickly after money. (Prov. 28:22): AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter. (Prov. 28:22, cont.): AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY (HSR) WILL COME TO HIM. And what was his loss (rt.: HSR)? R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: Every EPHRON which is written here &lt; in Scripture &gt;, before he took the silver from Abraham, is written plene as 'PRWN (i.e., with the vowel O represented by the Hebrew consonant W); but this &lt; usage &gt; (in Gen. 23:6) is deficient (HSR): AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE SILVER FOR EPHRON ('PRN). It is written with the W missing (HSR).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>[(Gen. 24:1:) NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.] This text is related (to Prov. 31:10): WHO CAN FIND A GALLANT WIFE? (Cf. Tanh., Gen. 4:4.)  About whom were the words spoken? &lt; They were spoken about Sarah &gt; since it is written above (in Gen. 23:2): AND ABRAHAM PROCEEDED TO MOURN FOR SARAH AND WEEP FOR HER, &lt; i.e., &gt; he began to weep and eulogize. So he said: When shall I be able to get &lt; another wife &gt; like you? (The midrash is interpreting Prov. 32:10ff. as Abraham’s eulogy over Sarah.)  (Prov. 31:10:) A GALLANT WIFE. This was Sarah, as stated (in Gen. 12:11): SEE HERE NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL-LOOKING WOMAN. (Prov. 31:10, cont.:) HER VALUE WAS FAR BEYOND THAT OF RUBIES, in that you came from afar. Thus it is stated (in Is. 46:11): SUMMONING A BIRD OF PREY FROM THE EAST, MY CONFIDANT FROM A FAR COUNTRY. (Prov. 31:11:) HER HUSBAND'S HEART HAD CONFIDENCE IN HER: This was Sarah, as stated (in Gen. 12:13): [PLEASE SAY YOU ARE MY SISTER] SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH ME BECAUSE OF YOU. (Prov. 31:11, cont.:) AND HE HAS NO LACK OF PROFIT. This refers to our father Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 13:2): NOW ABRAHAM WAS VERY RICH. (Prov. 31:12:) SHE DID GOOD FOR HIM AND NOT EVIL. This refers to Sarah, since it is stated (in Gen. 12:16): AND BECAUSE OF HER, IT WENT WELL WITH ABRAHAM. (Prov. 31:13:) SHE LOOKS FOR WOOL AND FLAX, &lt; in choosing &gt; between &lt; flaxen &gt; Ishmael and &lt; the pure wool of &gt; Isaac. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:9f.): THEN SARAH SAW THE SON OF HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN … AND SAID TO ABRAHAM: CAST OUT THIS SLAVE WOMAN &lt; AND HER SON &gt;…. (Prov. 31:14:) SHE WAS LIKE THE MERCHANT SHIPS, in that she was moving from place to place and from country to country. Like such a vessel which goes from place to place on the sea (according to Prov. 31:14, cont.): SHE BRINGS HER FOOD FROM AFAR. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 20:16): THEN HE SAID UNTO SARAH: SEE, I HAVE GIVEN YOUR BROTHER A THOUSAND SILVER PIECES. (Prov. 31:15:) SHE ALSO AROSE WHILE IT WAS STILL NIGHT AND GAVE FOOD TO HER HOUSEHOLD. When? (In Gen. 22:3:) SO ABRAHAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING…. (Prov. 31:15, cont.:) AND GAVE FOOD TO HER HOUSEHOLD, EVEN A STATUTE (The usual translation here is PORTION, but STATUTE better fits the Tanhuma context.)  FOR HER YOUNG WOMEN. (Gen. 17:26:) ON THAT VERY DAY ABRAHAM WAS CIRCUMCISED…. Now STATUTE can only mean circumcision, as shown (in Ps. 105:10): AND HE ESTABLISHED IT (i.e., Abraham's covenant) FOR JACOB AS A STATUTE, FOR ISRAEL AS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT. (Of course, Abraham’s EVERLASTING COVENANT meant circumcision.)  (Prov. 31:16:) SHE SET HER MIND ON A FIELD AND BOUGHT IT. Thus, while she was alive, she had her mind on obtaining the cave of Machpelah AND BOUGHT IT, for here she is buried in it (cf. Gen. 23). (Prov. 31:16, cont.:) FROM THE FRUIT OF HER HANDS SHE PLANTED A VINEYARD, as stated (in Gen. 21:33): AND HE PLANTED A TAMARISK TREE. What is the meaning of AND HE PLANTED? &lt; It is &gt; as you say (in Gen. 9:20): AND HE PLANTED A VINEYARD. (Prov. 31:17:) SHE GIRDED HER LOINS WITH VIGOR, when Abraham said to her (in Gen. 18:6): HURRY UP WITH THREE SEAHS OF FINE MEAL…. (Prov. 31:18:) SHE PERCEIVED THAT HER MERCHANDISE WAS GOOD; AND (in Gen. 21:7) SHE SAID: WHO WOULD HAVE SAID TO ABRAHAM THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN? (Prov. 31:18, cont.:) HER LAMP WOULD NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT. When? (In Gen. 14:15:) THEN HE DEPLOYED &lt; HIS FORCES &gt; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT. (The verse assumes that Sarah was waiting up for Abraham to return from battle.)  (Prov. 31:21:) SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID FOR HER HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE OF SNOW. When? When the Holy One showed him Gehinnom (with its snow), she foretold that none of her children would go down into its midst. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 15:17): THERE APPEARED A SMOKING OVEN AND A FLAMING TORCH. Why? Because they fulfilled two commandments, (as shown in Prov. 31:21, cont.): BECAUSE ALL HER HOUSEHOLD ARE CLOTHED TWOFOLD, (The traditional text vocalizes TWOFOLD to mean CRIMSON.)  i.e., with the Sabbath and with circumcision. (Prov. 31:22:) SHE MADE COVERINGS FOR HERSELF. When? When they said to him (in Gen. 18:9): WHERE IS YOUR WIFE SARAH? He said to her: You have received good news that you are to bear &lt; children &gt;, and from them will go forth high priests who will serve in the Tent of Meeting. (Prov. 31:22, cont.:) HER CLOTHING IS LINEN AND PURPLE, as stated (in Exod. 26:31): &lt; AND YOU SHALL MAKE A VEIL OF &gt; {LINEN} [BLUE] AND PURPLE…. (Prov. 31:23:) HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES. When Sarah died, old age sprang upon Abraham and he was called elderly. Now it is stated (in Gen. 23:6, after the report of Sarah's death): HEAR US, MY LORD, YOU ARE A PRINCE OF GOD IN OUR MIDST. Ergo, HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES; &lt; and the verse continues &gt; immediately: AS HE SAT AMONG THE ELDERS OF THE LAND. He had become old; therefore, it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.</p>

              <p>(Lev. 25:14:) “When you sell property to your kinsman.” This text is related (to Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth, [and he does not know that loss will come to him].” This verse speaks about many people. “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth.” This was Cain. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “You moved quickly to inherit the world. By your life, you shall have a loss [in the matter].” Ergo (in Prov. 28:22), “and he does not know that loss will come to him.” And what happened to him? That he wandered about the world, as stated (in Gen. 4:12), “you shall become a ceaseless wanderer on the earth.” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This was Ephron the Hittite. (See Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; and the parallels listed there; and Tanh. (Buber), Deut. 4:4.)  When Abraham's wife Sarah died, Abraham went to Ephron for him to sell him the cave. Ephron said to him, “Give me its price.” He said to him (in Gen. 23:15), “What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between you and me?” Abraham began piling up the silver for Ephron, as stated (in Gen. 23:16), “So Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed out […].” Ben Ma'ma said, “Although R. Hanina has said, ‘All the shekels in the Torah are sela'im,’ these [shekels] are an exception, since they are centenaria. (The word is Latin. One centenarium was worth 100,000 sesterces. According to a fourth-century inscription of northern Africa, a centenarium was a hundred pieces (e.g., of gold). See A. Souter, A Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A.D. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1957).)  [So it was] four hundred centenaria [that] Abraham piled up before Ephron.” When Ephron saw the silver, he moved quickly and hastily, as stated (in Gen. 23:6), “bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You have moved quickly after money. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” And what was his loss? R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said, “Every [mention of] Ephron which is written here [in Scripture], before he took the silver from Abraham, is written plene as 'prwn (i.e., with the vowel o represented by the Hebrew consonant w); but this [usage] (in Gen. 23:16) is deficient (hsr), ‘and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron ('prn). It is written with the w missing (hsr).” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This is the one who lends at interest, because he is anxious to become wealthy. He lends in order to receive interest from the borrower and becomes wealthy from the interest. But a curse is given through his riches, as stated (ibid., cont.), “and he does not know that loss will come to him.” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This represents those who engage in business in the sabbatical year, in that they move quickly to become rich. They do not observe the sabbatical year, and think they will become rich. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” Since he did not observe the sabbatical year, the curse began entering into his money, and he sells [all that he had]. What is written above the matter (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord.” And after that it is written (in vs. 14), “When you sell property.” R. Eleazar Haqappar said, “It is written (in Cant. 5:15), ‘His legs are pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold.’ This column has a capital above and a pedestal (Gk.: basis.)  below.” (See Lev. R. 25:8.)  R. Samuel ben Guriah said, “You have no section in the Torah which does not have a capital above and a pedestal below. (The parallel in Lev. R. 25:8 explains that each section can be expounded with reference to what precedes and follows it.)  What is written above of the matter (in Lev. 25:1-2)? ‘Then the Lord spoke unto Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, “Speak unto the Children of Israel [….] ‘the land shall observe [a Sabbath for the Lord].’”’ Then after that [comes] the section on the jubilee (in vs. 8), ‘And you shall count seven [Sabbaths of years].’ If one has not observed the sabbatical year and the jubilee, or [even] one of them, in the end, I will make it that he will sell his land, [as stated] (in vs. 14), ‘When you sell property to your kinsman.’ (T’Arakh. 5:9; below, 9:8.)  [If] he repents, [all] is well; but if not, he will end up selling his field, as stated (in vs. 25), ‘When your relative becomes poor and sells some of his property.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up selling his house, as stated (in vs. 29), ‘And when someone sells a dwelling house.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up going around [begging] at doorways, as stated (in vs. 35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor [… you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you].’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to you, as stated (in vs. 39), ‘And when your relative becomes poor] near you and is sold to you.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to the gentiles, as stated (in vs. 47), ‘And when a foreigner and a sojourner near you becomes wealthy, [while your relative near him becomes poor and is sold to a sojourning foreigner near you….].’ Now it is not merely the individual himself [at issue here], but that person and all Israel; for so you find in the days of Jeremiah, because they profaned the sabbatical year, they were sold to the gentiles, as stated (in II Chron. 36:17-18), ‘So He brought up the king of the Chaldeans upon them [….] And all the vessels of the house of God […] and the treasures of the house of the Lord […].’ Behold the case of [all] Israel.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “See how they will be sold to the gentiles because they profaned the sabbatical year.” He said to him, “Master of the world, did You not say this (in Lev. 25:35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you, [you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you]?’ Fulfill what You said to them and called them, ‘My relatives (ah) and friends,’ as stated (in Ps. 122:8), ‘For the sake of My relatives (ah) and friends’: (Lev. 25:35:) ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you,’ [i.e.,] when their strength fails before Nebuchadnezzar, the Divine Presence, as it were, will be with them. It is so stated (in Is. 43:14), ‘for your sake I have sent to Babylon.’ (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘You shall maintain (literally, hold on to) him.’ Hold them (i.e., Israel), lest they perish. But how? (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘As a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you.’ Although they became foreigners and sojourners in Babylon, if You do not give them grace, they will perish, [so just] ‘let him live near You.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Because of their sins I have sold My house to the Chaldeans.” It is so stated (in Lev. 25:29), “And when someone sells a dwelling house.” This is the house of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Ps. 132:13), “For the Lord has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling.” And what happened [to it]? (II Kings 25:9 = Jer. 52:13:) And he burned the house of the Lord [...].” (Lev. 25:29, cont.:) “A walled city.” This is the city of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated] (in II Chron. 36:19), “and they broke down the wall of Jerusalem […].” That is what the Holy One, blessed be He, says (in Lev. 25:47), “And when a foreigner and a sojourner [near you] becomes wealthy.” This wealthy foreigner is Nebuchadnezzar, and this sojourner is the Median Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “And is sold to a sojourning foreigner.” This [sojourning foreigner] is the Greek Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “Or to a foreigner's family.” This is the Edomite Empire (i.e., Rome). Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, why were they sold to these empires?” He said to him, “Because they profaned the sabbatical year.” It is so stated (in II Chron. 36:20–21), “Then he carried off unto Babylon those left from the sword,” and the end of the Scripture is “[until the land made up] its Sabbaths; as long as it lay desolate, it observed Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses at the end of all of these sections, “Is it your wish that they do not go into exile? [Then] warn them concerning the sabbatical years and the jubilees.” That is what He has said at the end of all the sections (in Lev. 26:2), “You shall observe My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord.” What is the meaning of “I am the Lord?” I am the one who is going to give you a good reward, if you observe them; but if not, I am going to exact retribution from them through the Empires. Therefore, say to them to be careful about the sabbatical year. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord,” so that they do not attain [the punishments in] those sections written below (in Lev. 26:14-45). (Lev. 25:14:) “When you sell property to your kinsman or buy from your neighbor's hand, do not deceive.” [Thus] you shall not deceive one another. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “For I also sold the whole world to Abraham and did not deceive him. He [then went back and sold it to Me,” as stated (Genesis 14:19), “the Buyer (Qoneh. A more traditional rendering of this word here would be MAKER.)  of heaven and earth.” When? When Abraham observed the commandments of the Holy One, blessed be He. Before the Torah was given to Israel, our father Abraham kept it [and observed all the commandments that are in the Torah]. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Alexandra, “Abraham even observed the [rabbinic precept of] eruvim of cooked foods.” (See Tanh. (Buber), Gen. 3:1, and the notes there.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5), “Because ('qb 'shr) Abraham heeded [My voice and kept My charge: My commandments, My statutes, and My Torahs].” What is the meaning of 'qb? (Gen. R. 95:3; Cant. R. 5:16:1; PR 21:12; cf. Ned. 32a.)  R. Simeon ben Laqish said, “At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He.” (So also Numb. R. 18:21. According to other traditions Abraham recognized his creator at the age of forty-eight (Gen. R. 30:8; 46:2; Cant. R. 5:16:1), at the age of fifty (PR 21:12), or at the age of one (Gen. R. 95:3).)  How is this shown? 'Qb is a number. (I.e., 'ayin) is seventy, q (i.e., qof) is one hundred, [and] b (i.e., bet) is two, for a total of one hundred seventy-two. Now (according to Gen. 25:7) Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five [years]. Deduct from them. [The result is] three, when he was little. Ergo, at the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He. When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw how Abraham loved the commandments, He began buying heavenly and earthly [places] for him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19), “Blessed be Abram of God most high, Buyer of heaven and earth.” So also it says (Gen. 13:15), “For all the land (or earth) which you see, to you I will give it.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “All the world is wholly Mine; and I bought it for Abraham, because he has observed My commandments. But you, through your sins, have caused him to be [like] an alien who rents a house from its owners, for so Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 14:8), ‘why are you like a foreigner in the land […]?’ When you sinned before Me, I sold you, as stated (in Ps. 44:13), ‘You shall sell Your people for no money […].’ For that reason, if someone has to sell a house, a field, or [some] article, you shall not deceive one another.” It is therefore written (in Lev. 25:14), “shall not deceive his brother.” (Lev. 25:15-18:) “According to the years after the jubilee […]. According to the multitude of years, you shall increase […]. A man shall not deceive his brother […]. So you shall carry out my statutes and judgements.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Just as I sold my people and returned again to reinstate them, as stated (Jer. 3:14), ‘”Turn back, faithless children,” says the Lord; “for I am a master to you.”’ It is also written (in Is. 52:3), ‘For thus says the Lord, “You were sold for free, and you shall be redeemed for no money.”’ So too you should not sell the land absolutely, as stated (in Lev. 25:23), ‘[it] shall not be sold permanently.’ The Land [of Israel] is dear to me because I have made it holier than all the [other] lands in the world.” You yourself know, when the Land of Israel was distributed to the tribes, it did not pass from tribe to tribe. Rather [it was distributed] to each tribe separately. You yourself know. Look at how many lawsuits the daughters of Zelophehad brought, so that their inheritance would not pass from one tribe to another. Moreover the Holy One, blessed be He, conceded to their words, as stated (in Numb. 27:7), “The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right.” (Numb. 36:9:) “Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another.” Therefore, if a redeemer is found for it, fine; but if not, whoever buys it acquires it until the jubilee. Then on the jubilee he releases it. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:41), “Then he shall depart from you, he and his children with him and he shall return to his family.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “When the year of the redemption draws near, I will redeem you, as stated (in Is. 63:4), ‘For a day of vengeance was in My heart, but there came My year of redemption.’”</p>

              <p>Another interpretation of &quot;Happy is the man&quot; (Psalm 1:1): This refers to the righteous men. The prophets are happy because they give form to the image of God, and to the one who plants the tree. This is what the scripture means by &quot;For the Lord God is a sun and shield&quot; (Psalm 84:12). Rabbi Chiya bar Abba said: &quot;Happy are they who are like the sun, which shines forth, and like a shield, which protects.&quot; Another interpretation of &quot;shield&quot;: This refers to the Persian Targum for a curtain that surrounds a person, protecting them from the four winds. And how do we know that it includes the fourth wind? It is written, &quot;You crown us with loving-kindness&quot; (Psalm 5:13). Another interpretation of &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;shield&quot;: This refers to Abraham, our forefather. &quot;Sun&quot; refers to Abraham, as it is written, &quot;Who raised up righteousness from the east&quot;  (Isaiah 41:2) The shield represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;I am your shield&quot; (Genesis 15:1). The God represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;You are a prince of God in our midst&quot; (Genesis 23:6). Grace and glory God gives represent Abraham, as it is written, &quot;And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold&quot; (Genesis 13:2). &quot;He does not withhold good from those who walk with integrity&quot; represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;Walk before me, and be blameless&quot; (Genesis 17:1). If Scripture speaks of Abraham in this way, then when it says, &quot;He does not withhold good from those who walk with integrity,&quot; what does it mean to walk with integrity? Rather, just as Abraham, who walked with integrity before the Holy One, Blessed be He, had a shield, so too anyone who walks with integrity before Him has a shield. After him, what is written? &quot;Happy is the man who trusts in You&quot; (Psalms 84:13). Abraham is not written here, but rather &quot;man,&quot; meaning all people. David said, &quot;Happy is the man whom You discipline, Lord, and whom You teach from Your law&quot; (Psalms 94:12). Rabbi Yudan opened by saying, &quot;Do not boast before the king, and do not stand in the place of great men&quot; (Proverbs 25:6). Rabbi Yudan read it from the place where this section was closed and from the place where the previous section was opened. Rabbi Pinchas worked an extended passage from Psalms 119:100, &quot;I understand more than the aged.&quot; At first, the Holy One, Blessed be He, blessed His world, as it says, &quot;And God blessed them&quot; (Genesis 1:28). Once Noah stood, He blessed him, as it says, &quot;And God blessed Noah and his sons&quot; (Genesis 9:1). Once Abraham stood, He blessed him, as it says, &quot;And God blessed Abraham in everything&quot; (Genesis 24:1). What is the meaning of &quot;it will be a blessing&quot;? Rav Nachman said that He handed the blessings over to him and said, &quot;Until now, I have been required to bless the world, but from now on, the blessings are in your hands, and whomever you bless will be blessed.&quot; Once Isaac stood, he blessed him, as it says, &quot;And Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac&quot; (Genesis 25:5). What did he give him? Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Nechemia, and the Rabbis (said): Rabbi Yehuda said it was the firstborn. Rabbi Nechemia said it was a blessing. And the Rabbis said it was burial and a deed of inheritance. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Chama: they only gave him gifts. And why didn't they give him a blessing? It is like a king who had a garden and gave it to a tenant, and in it were all kinds of trees intertwined with each other, one of the Tree of Life and one of the Tree of Death. The tenant said, &quot;If I water the Tree of Life, the Tree of Death will live with it. And if I do not water it, how will the Tree of Life live?&quot; The tenant returned and said, &quot;This year I will complete my tenancy and go, and what do I care about the king's garden?&quot; Abraham said, &quot;I will not bless Isaac now because the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah are now being blessed.&quot; I am flesh and blood today, but tomorrow I will be in the grave, and what needs to be done in his world will be done. When Abraham died, God revealed Himself to Isaac and blessed him, as it says, &quot;After Abraham's death, God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). And so He did to Jacob, as it says, &quot;God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan Aram, and He blessed him&quot; (Genesis 35:9). And Isaac stood and blessed Jacob with giving, as it says, &quot;May God give you of the dew of heaven&quot; (Genesis 27:28), and he sealed it with a call, &quot;And Isaac called Jacob, and he blessed him&quot; (Genesis 28:1). Jacob stood to bless the tribes and began with what Isaac had sealed. This is what is written, &quot;And Jacob called to his sons and said&quot; (Genesis 49:1), and he sealed it with this, as it says, &quot;And this is what their father said to them&quot; (Genesis 49:28). Moses stood to bless Israel, and said, &quot;Jacob is the firstborn of the Holy One, blessed be He,&quot; and he began with a call and sealed it with &quot;And this is the blessing&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:1), and he sealed it with &quot;Happy are you&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:29). When David stood, he opened with &quot;God is my Lord,&quot; and sealed it with &quot;Blessed are You, God&quot; (Psalms 118:27).</p>

            <summary>Abraham's presence purified and elevated those around him, as seen in the reaction of the people of Ephron and the sons of Chet calling him a prince of God. Abraham represented the essence of good, while Ishmael and Esau represented negative forces. Isaac had Esau attached to him, while Jacob was free of any negative forces, representing the tree of life. Abraham's spiritual level was higher than the other patriarchs, as indicated by his name Israel and his ability to penetrate Celestial Regions. The birth of Isaac and Esau further reinforced Abraham's role as the father of many nations and his ability to overcome negative influences.</summary>

              <p>Ephron, or rather the people of his town also hinted at that fact when they said in 23,15 נשיא אלוקים אתה בתוכנו, &quot;you are a prince in our midst.&quot; They realized that while Abraham represented the essence of what was good, Ishmael represented the קליפה on the &quot;right,&quot; Esau that on the &quot;left.&quot; We here view grandchildren as being in the same class as children. Isaac, who is described in the grace after meals as the recipient of the blessing מכל, has only one קליפה, Esau attached to him. Jacob, on the other hand, is totally free of any קליפה sticking to him. He represents the tree of life in the centre of the garden.</p>

              <p>When the sons of Chet addressed Abraham by saying: &quot;You are a prince of G–d in our midst&quot; (Genesis 23,7), what they meant was that the personality of Abraham had made a deep impression on their תוכיות, internality. They felt that their own spiritual roots had become purified through having an Abraham in their proximity. They were convinced that this augured well for their future and eventual salvation, and they thanked Abraham. When our Bereshit Rabbah 43,5 explains the words עמק שוה in Genesis 14,17, by saying that all the nations agreed (השוו) to crown Abraham there as their king, this describes Abraham as being freed, set apart from the קליפות. Abraham personally represents the spiritual level of ישראל; he achieved a higher level than all the other patriarchs. The statement that his name was ישראל indicates his spiritual level as being on a very high plateau enabling him to penetrate to the most rarefied Celestial Regions. The name אברהם, on the other hand, describes his being the (spiritual) father of a multitude of nations, כי אב המון גוים נתתיך, something that was acknowledged when the sons of Chet said שמענו אדני, נשיא אלוקים אתה in 23,6. He had also been called Abram, for it was still at that time that Ishmael issued from him. We see that the dimension of אב המון already began to take practical form while Abraham was still Abram. This dimension was reinforced with the birth of Isaac, who in turn produced an Esau who incorporates all the קליפות.</p>

            <summary>The verse &quot;And the land had respite from war&quot; in Joshua 14:15:2 refers to the Emorites being humbled after seven years of conquest, with the Midrash Aggadah linking it to Avraham bringing peace to the land in Genesis 23:6. In Genesis 12:2:3, Radak connects Avram's renown to his victories, while Sforno sees Avram as a prince of God. Ramban explains the term &quot;Hebrew&quot; in Genesis 40:15:1 as a name for all of Israel's seed. Ibn Ezra discusses the grammatical nuances of &quot;mi-mennu&quot; in Genesis 3:22:2. The commentary on Yonah 3:3:11 connects spiritual authenticity to making a deep impression, referencing Avraham's recognition as a prince of God. Finally, the essay on Emor emphasizes the importance of sanctifying God's name through acts of justice and compassion to maintain the connection to Judaism.</summary>

              <p>Similarly, Yonah was so sincere and so authentic that his words and persona made a deep impression on the people of Nineveh. Truly spiritual individuals make an impression even on those who are not tuned in to Jewish spirituality. I recall a relative who was not observant tell me of the deep impression made on him by the following deeply spiritual giants - Rav Yitzchok Cohen shlit”a of Yeshiva University, Rav Aharon Lichtenstein zt”l of Yeshivat Har Etzion, and Rav Yosef Singer zt”l of the Lower East Side. Indeed, the Bnei Chet recognized Avraham Avinu as “Nesi Elokim Ata BeTocheinu,” “you are a prince of God among us” (Bereishit 23:6). Bat Paroh recognized that the Shechinah (Heavenly presence) was with baby Moshe (Rashi to Shemot 2:6).</p>

              <p>That is what led the Hittites to call Abraham “a prince of God in our midst” (Gen. 23:6). It is what leads Israel to be admired when it engages in international rescue and relief. The concepts of kiddush and ḥillul Hashem forge an indissoluble connection between the holy and the good. Lose that and we betray our mission as “a holy nation.” The conviction that being a Jew involves the pursuit of justice and the practice of compassion is what led our ancestors to stay loyal to Judaism despite all the pressures to abandon it. It would be the ultimate tragedy if we lost that connection now, at the very moment that we are able to face the world on equal terms.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>The word mi-mennu can be rendered of us or of him. as in ish mi-mennu (none of us) (Gen. 23:6). I have already explained in The Book of Foundation why the nun of mi-mennu receives a dagesh when in the plural. (The word mi-mennu should have been spelled with two nuns. The dagesh makes up for the missing nun (Weiser). I.E. makes this point here because the word mi-mennu has a dagesh. He does not want one to think mistakenly that it is a singular because of this dagesh. See next note.)  The Babylonian grammarians who do not place a dagesh in it are in error. (The Babylonian grammarians, in contradistinction to the Palestinian grammarians, place a dagesh in mi-mennu when it is singular and omit the dagesh when it is plural. I.E. says that the Palestinians who place a dagesh in both instances are correct.)  The meaning of the verse (v. 22) is the same as ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil (v. 5). (Man has become like an angel. See I.E.’s comments on verse 5.)  On the other hand, God might be saying what was in Adam’s mind. (Adam now thinks that he has become as one of us.)  The use of the term of us presents no problem. It is similar to Let us make man in our image (Gen. 1:26) and Come, let us go down (Gen. 11:7). God in all these cases is addressing the angels.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>A Midrashic approach: the word לראות, “to see,” means “to see and to be seen.” We read in verse six: ויצא חמור אבי שכם אל יעקב לדבר אתו, Chamor the father of Shechem went out to Yaakov to speak with him.” About this the Tanchuma 7 Vayishlach writes: He said to him: ‘I know that your grandfather Avraham was a prince as the Hittites had acclaimed him as: “you are a prince in our midst” (23,6). I, however, am a prince in the land also. Give the daughter of a prince to a prince (my son) as a wife.” Upon hearing this Yaakov replied: “The title ‘prince’ is applicable only to a שור, ox” (not to a donkey, meaning of the name Chamor.) The Torah had written that Avraham ran to the cattle, (ox) (18,7) and it is written in Proverbs 14,4: ורב תבואות בכח שור, “a bountiful harvest is due to the strength of the ox.” An ox and a donkey cannot mate together. The Torah writes expressly: “you shall not plough with an ox and a donkey together.” In the Book of Prophets (Kings II 14,9) we find the following statement: “The thistle in Lebanon sent the following message to the cedar in Lebanon. ‘give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ But a wild beast in Lebanon went by and trampled down the thistle.” The wild beasts in that parable are the sons of Yaakov who have been compared to wild beasts. In the blessings bestowed on Yaakov’s sons by their father, Yehudah is compared to a lion (49,9); Dan is compared to a snake (49,17); Binyamin is compared to a wolf (49,27); Naftali to a gazelle (49,21). When the Book of Kings spoke about the wild beasts trampling the thistle, the reference was to the sons of Yaakov Shimon and Levi killing the male inhabitants of Shechem. The prophet Hoseah also complains about a similar occurrence in Hoseah 6,9 where he wrote about what would happen to the people of Shechem in his own time because they encouraged depravity. The people would be murdered because they had been guilty of sexual misconduct.</p>

Examples were Avram’s defeat of the four most powerful kings on earth at that time, when he freed Lot and the King of Sodom. The Canaanites (בני חת) said to him when he wanted to buy a burial plot for Sarah “you are a prince in our midst” (Genesis 23,6). We find a similar statement which G’d made to David in Chronicles I 17,8 ועשיתי לך שם בשם הגדולים אשר בארץ, “I will  make you as renowned as the greatest men on earth.”  This is part of the good that G’d does for people.</p>

              <p>THE LAND OF THE HEBREWS. This means the land of Hebron, wherein dwelt Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Abraham, the head of the lineage, was called “Abraham the Hebrew” (Above, 14:13.)  since he came from across the River Euphrates, and he was honored among the nations for in him was fulfilled the blessing, And I will make thy name great. (Ibid., 12:1.)  It is for this reason that all of his seed are called Ivrim (Hebrews). They hold on to this name in order not to intermingle with the various peoples in the Canaanite lands, and this name has been established as the name for all Israel’s seed forever. This is the meaning of the verse, He hath brought in a Hebrew unto us, (Ibid., 39:14.)  since Joseph told them “I am a Hebrew,” and he did not want them to take him as a Canaanite. And the land where they resided was called “the land of the Hebrews,” that is to say, the land in which the Hebrews are. (But not that it is theirs.)  It may be that it was so called because they were its leaders and nobles, even as it says, Thou art a prince of G-d in the midst of us, (Above, 23:6.)  and it is further written, Touch not My anointed ones.

Rashi, therefore comments that indeed, it refers to the earlier topic discussed in the previous chapter.)  After the seven years of conquest, the Emorites were humbled and they no longer gathered for war against them. Therefore they began to be occupied in the division of the land [among the tribes] the Midrash Aggadah comments that the greatest man among giants refers to our father, Avrohom. Because of him, the land [of the Canaanite people,] had respite from war during the forty years [that Bnei Yisroel] lingered in the wilderness. They were so rewarded because they honored the Patriarch in Kiryas-arba, when they said to him, “You are a prince of God in our midst.” (Bereishis 23:6.) </p>

        <summary>Abraham bowed down to the children of Heth as a sign of respect and gratitude, not to God, as clarified by various commentators. The children of Heth offered Abraham a burial plot for many burials, showing respect by calling him a prince of God. The sons of Chet acknowledged Abraham as a spiritual leader who purified their own roots, leading to their eventual salvation. Rashi explains that the word &quot;stopped&quot; in I Samuel 25:33 refers to preventing someone from doing something, as seen in other biblical verses like Tehillim 40:12 and Bereishis 23:6. In Genesis 23:7, Onkelos translates the people of the land as the sons of Cheis, while Targum Jonathan translates it as the sons of Hittah.</summary>

              <p>“Avraham stood up and prostrated himself;” Avraham was dependent on the goodwill of everyone in that town; even if Efron had been willing to sell his field or plot Avraham would have needed all the townspeople’s permission to convert it into a burial site. Avraham had to first arise in order to prostrate himself in the appropriate manner to all of them, even to the one sitting behind him. But for a single individual such as Efron he was not required to rise, he just prostrated himself before him.</p>

              <p>HE PROSTRATED - according to Ibn Ezra prostration is bowing the head, and this is an expression of giving honor to another person, and so Yitro does it for Moshe. However, Rashi (parashat Miketz, Genesis 42:6; Genesis 43:26) sees prostrating as extending oneself on the earth, with hands and feet extended. And it seems that the difference between a simple prostration and the prostration on the earth is that if it is on the earth obviously implies the extending of hands and feet.

              <p>[AND BOWED DOWN.] I have given the grammatical explanation of this word in The Book of Foundation. (See I.E.’s comments on Gen. 2:17 and the notes thereto.)  Those who say that Abraham bowed down to God speak nonsense. (They are troubled by Abraham bowing before another human being.)  Scripture explicitly states that Abraham bowed to the children of Heth. Bowing means a bending of the head. (Abraham did not prostrate himself. The latter is done in prayer and only before God. He merely bowed his head as a sign of respect.)  It is a way of showing reverence. Moses also bowed before his father-in-law. (Ex. 18:7.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>“Abraham arose from before his dead, and he spoke to the children of Ḥet, saying” (Genesis 23:3).  “Abraham arose from before his dead” – this teaches (The verse can also be translated: “Abraham arose from before death.” The angel of death was intimidating him and urging him to bury Sarah promptly.)  that he saw the angel of death provoking him.  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where is it derived what we learn in a mishna: One whose dead one [a deceased relative] is lying before him (That is, he is charged with burying the body.)  is exempt from the recitation of Shema, from prayer, and from wearing phylacteries, as well as all mitzvot in the Torah? (Mishna Berakhot 3:1.)  It is from here: “[Abraham] arose…and he spoke.” (He did not engage in any other activity prior to his burying his dead.)  “I am a sojourner and a resident among you: give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” (Genesis 23:4).  “A sojourner [ger] and a resident”; ger means one who dwells as a tenant; toshav means a landlord. [Abraham was saying:] ‘If you prefer, I will act as a tenant, (Humbly beseeching your permission to bury Sarah.)  but if not, I will act as a landlord, (And take it without your consent.)  as this is what the Holy One blessed be He has said to me: “To your descendants I have given this land”’ (Genesis 15:18).  “Give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” – I am requesting [a plot] for only one dead person, as it is stated: “Give me a burial plot with you, [and I will bury my dead].”  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham, saying to him” (Genesis 23:5).  “Hear us, my lord: you are a prince of God in our midst, in our choicest graves bury your dead; none of us shall withhold his grave from you, from burying your dead” (Genesis 23:6).  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham…Hear us, my lord…” – you are king over us, you are prince over us, you are like a god to us. He said to them: ‘Let the world not fail to accept its true King, let the world not fail to accept its true God.’   “In our choicest graves” – in the choicest one of our many graves.   “Bury your dead” – many dead. (Although Abraham had requested a single grave site, for Sarah, the children of Ḥet offered him a site for many burials.)  “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land, the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 23:7.   “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land” (The verse does not say that Abraham bowed “to” the people, but that he bowed “before” them. He bowed to God in their presence, giving thanks for his good fortune in obtaining the permission he had sought.)  – from here we learn that one should give thanks [to God] over hearing good tidings.</p>

                <h4>Midrash Tanchuma, Pinchas 3:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(Numb. 25:16-17:) “Then the Lord spoke [unto Moses], saying, ‘Harass the Midianites […].’” Why? (Numb. R. 21:4.)  (Numb. 25:18:) “Because they are harassing you.” Hence the sages have said, “If someone comes to kill you, act first to kill him.” (Ber. 62b; Sanh. 72a.)  R. Simeon says, “Whoever causes a person to sin is worse than the one who kills him. Because whoever kills [a person] kills him in this world, but he [still] has a share in the world to come. However, the one who causes him to sin kills him in this world and for the world to come. Two peoples encountered Israel with the sword, the Egyptians and the Edomites. Thus it is stated (of the Egyptians that they said (in Exod. 15:9), “I will pursue, I will overtake, [I will divide the spoil…].” And Edom [did the same], as stated (in Numb. 20:18), “But Edom said unto him, ‘You shall not pass through me, or else I will come out to meet you with the sword.’” Moreover, two [peoples encountered them] with sin, Moab and the Ammonites. Concerning the ones who encountered them with the sword, it is written (in Deut. 23:8), “You shall not abhor an Edomite …; you shall not abhor an Egyptian.” But concerning the ones who encountered them with sin to cause Israel to sin, it is stated (according to Deut. 23:4), “No Ammonite or Moabite shall come into the assembly of the Lord […].” And in this world you have not [yet] fulfilled your obligation, as stated (in Numb. 25:17), “Harass the Midianites.” (Numb. 25:17:) “Harass the Midianites.” What is the meaning of “Harass the Midianites?” Even though it is written in the Torah (in Deut. 20:10), “When you draw near unto a city to fight against it, you shall offer terms of peace (shalom) unto it”; however, in regard to these [peoples] you shall not do this; (according to Deut. 23:7), “You shall not seek their welfare (shalom) and benefit all your days forever.” (Numb. R. 21:5.)  You find that the one who came to them with the trait of mercy, in the end came to disgrace, war and distress. And who [was that]? David, as stated (in II Sam. 10:2), “David said, ‘I will do kindness with Hanun son of Nahash.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You are transgressing My word, as I wrote (in Deut. 23:7), ‘You shall not seek their welfare and benefit,’ and you are doing acts of kindness with them? (Eccl. 7:12:) ‘Do not be greatly righteous,’ such that a man should not forego [what is written in] the Torah. And this one is sending [word] to console the Children of Ammon and to do kindness and good to him?” And in the end, he came to disgrace [as stated] (in II Sam. 10:4), “So Hanun seized David’s courtiers, clipped off one side of their beards [and cut away half of their garments at the buttocks, and sent them off].” And he came to disgrace, and afterwards to war with four nations: Aram-Naharayim, with the kings of Zova, with the kings of Maakha and with Children of Ammon. And it is written (about this in II Sam. 10:9), “Joab saw that there was a battle line against him both front and rear.” What caused him [this]? That he sought to do good to those about whom the Holy One, blessed be He, told him, “You shall not seek their welfare and benefit.” Hence it is written (Numb. 25:17), “Harass the Midianites.” Another interpretation (of Numb. 25:17), “Harass (tsrwr) the Midianites.” Even though I have written (in Deut. 20:19), “When you besiege (rt. tswr) a city a [long time] […], you shall not destroy its trees,” (Numb. R. 21:6.)  in the case of these (i.e., Moab and the Ammonites) you shall not do so. On the contrary, their trees you shall destroy. And so you find that when Joram king of Israel, Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and the king of Edom went to fight with Moab, (according to II Kings 3:9) “they circled around on a seven-day march, so that there was no water for the army or for the animals that were with them.” They began to weep, and (according to vs. 10) “The king of Israel said, ‘Alas, for the Lord has summoned these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab.’” Jehoshaphat answered (in vs. 11), “Is there no prophet of the Lord here through, who we may inquire of the Lord…?” [This passage is] to make known the wickedness of Joram, in that he did not acknowledge Him. (Vs. 12:) “Then Jehoshaphat said, ‘the word of the Lord is with him’; so the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down unto him.” Why is Jehoshaphat not called a king here? In order to make known the humility of that righteous man, in that he did not want to go down before the prophet in royal garb, but as a commoner. (Gk.: idiotes.)  But some say, “[It was] because an edict had been decreed that he would be killed with Ahab that the scriptural text has reckoned [the reign of] his son from that hour. For that reason ‘king’ was not written.” But as a reward for their going down to the prophet, they attained the right to see all those miracles. When the king of Israel saw Elisha, Elisha said to the king of Israel (according to vs. 13,) “What have I to do with you; go unto the prophets of your father and unto the prophets of your mother.” He began to implore him. (Ibid., cont.:) “And the king of Israel said to him…,” as he had never asked him [anything] in his life. (Vss. 14-15:) “Elisha said, ‘As the Lord of hosts lives…Now then get me a musician….” And the rest of the whole parashah. Moreover, he said to them “The Moabites shall fall into your hands, (in vs. 19) ‘thus you shall smite every fortified city and every choice city, [you shall also fell every good tree].’” They said to him, “[But] the Holy One, blessed be He said (in Deut. 20:19), ‘You shall not destroy its trees’; yet you are saying [to do] so.” He said to them, “He gave the command with reference to the rest of the nations, but this one is insignificant and contemptable,” as stated (in II Kings 3:18), “This one is insignificant in the eyes of the Lord, so He will give Moab into your hands.” It is [also] stated (in Deut. 23:7), “You shall not seek their welfare and benefit (literally, their good).” [That is referring to] the good trees. It is therefore stated (in Numb. 25:17), “Harass the Midianites.”</p>

              <p>When the sons of Chet addressed Abraham by saying: &quot;You are a prince of G–d in our midst&quot; (Genesis 23,7), what they meant was that the personality of Abraham had made a deep impression on their תוכיות, internality. They felt that their own spiritual roots had become purified through having an Abraham in their proximity. They were convinced that this augured well for their future and eventual salvation, and they thanked Abraham. When our Bereshit Rabbah 43,5 explains the words עמק שוה in Genesis 14,17, by saying that all the nations agreed (השוו) to crown Abraham there as their king, this describes Abraham as being freed, set apart from the קליפות. Abraham personally represents the spiritual level of ישראל; he achieved a higher level than all the other patriarchs. The statement that his name was ישראל indicates his spiritual level as being on a very high plateau enabling him to penetrate to the most rarefied Celestial Regions. The name אברהם, on the other hand, describes his being the (spiritual) father of a multitude of nations, כי אב המון גוים נתתיך, something that was acknowledged when the sons of Chet said שמענו אדני, נשיא אלוקים אתה in 23,6. He had also been called Abram, for it was still at that time that Ishmael issued from him. We see that the dimension of אב המון already began to take practical form while Abraham was still Abram. This dimension was reinforced with the birth of Isaac, who in turn produced an Esau who incorporates all the קליפות.</p>

                <h4>Kedushat Levi, Exodus, Yitro 25</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Careful analysis of ‎Yitro’s words will show that he spoke of two separate acts of ‎‎“saving” the Jewish people. Yitro had heard not only about the ‎physical salvation the Israelites had experienced but also about ‎the manner in which the spirit of the Jewish people, a people ‎downtrodden by many years of slavery, had been transformed in a ‎short space of time to being the most steadfast people, afraid of ‎no human force on earth.‎ This brings us to another nuance in the exegesis in Shabbat ‎‎105 according to which the word ‎אנכי‎ is an acronym for the words ‎אנא נפשי כתבית יהבית‎, “I Myself have written it and handed it ‎over.” We know that another meaning of the word ‎נפש‎ is ‎רצון‎, ‎will, desire, as in Genesis 23,8: ‎אם יש את נפשכם‎, “if it is your desire, ‎etc.” The word ‎אנכי‎ accordingly sums up G’d’s message that by ‎committing the Torah to writing, He had expressed His will, and ‎desire. By handing over this document to the Jewish people, He ‎had authorized them to interpret it and to guide their lives by ‎means of these interpretations. Upon hearing this daring exegesis some people might ‎consider that G’d had taken a great chance that His people would ‎exploit this authority to pervert the Torah by “being victorious” ‎over Him. The reverse is true, however. G’d is pleased when as a ‎result of our delving more deeply into the hidden parts of the ‎Torah we discover heretofore unknown aspects of it. We have it ‎on the authority of Baba Metzia 59 where in a halachic ‎discussion among the various sages one of them called upon G’d ‎to demonstrate that his opinion was the correct one, and he ‎wanted the wall to collapse to prove this and the wall really began ‎to bend, that the opposing scholar quoted Deuteronomy 30,12 ‎where the Torah is described as not being a possession of heaven, ‎i.e. ‎לא בשמים היא‎, to stop the wall from falling. A heavenly voice ‎was heard by the people present exclaiming that ‎נצחוני בני מצחוני‎, ‎‎“My children have triumphed over Me, My children.” [Students ‎of that episode in the Talmud will find that that there are also ‎other interpretations of that episode. Ed.] Another quotation ‎from the Talmud Pessachim 119 reads as follows: the ‎opening words in psalms 4 ‎למנצח בנגינות מזמור לדוד‎, translated ‎literally, as “a psalm to the victor by David,” that the point David ‎is making is that whereas in interpersonal relations the loser in a ‎competition is downcast, not so when the contestants are man ‎and G’d respectively. It is G’d’s nature to rejoice in His children ‎having prevailed over Him.” As proof of this interpretation the ‎Talmud there quotes: psalms 106,23 ‎ויאמר להשמידם לולי משה בחירו ‏עמד בפרץ לפניו להשיב חמתו מהשחית‎, “He had already said that he ‎would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen, confronted Him ‎in the breach to avert His destructive wrath.” This reflects ‎another interpretation on Shabbat 105 where the introductory ‎words of the Ten Commandments are described as ‎אמירה נעימה ‏כתיבה יהבה‎, (compare page 431) When a son wins a game of chess ‎against his father for the first time, the father derives great ‎satisfaction of having taught his son so well. Similarly, if during a ‎discussion on the meaning of a certain verse in the Torah, the ‎‎“son,” i.e. one of the Torah scholars, has shown outstanding skill ‎and understanding of the Torah’s deeper meaning, the author, ‎G’d, derives great satisfaction from this.‎ Coming back to why G’d did not introduce the Ten ‎Commandments with reminding the listeners that He was the ‎Creator and therefore had preceded every other phenomenon in ‎the universe, but stressing that He had taken the Israelites out of ‎slavery in Egypt, G’d did so because he wanted to be on record ‎concerning His love for His people. He was certain that by doing ‎this He would reinforce the people’s enthusiasm to serve Him ‎rather than any other so-called deities. By using a play on words ‎‎[in the Hebrew language, Ed.] our author ‎considers the whole episode between slavery-physical ‎redemption, and now spiritual redemption of the Jewish people, ‎as turning ‎צרה‎ into ‎רצה‎, “suffering and distress into joy and ‎happiness.” Henceforth the Jewish people are always referred to ‎as G’d’s children [even when errant children, Ed.] ‎This factor is an overriding consideration in our relationship to ‎G’d. This also explains that G’d chooses to “live,” i.e. be at home ‎among the Jewish people after they build a Sanctuary for Him ‎here on earth. If, in spite of this, the Israelites were ever to turn ‎to idolatry, this sin would be ever so much harder to atone for.‎ ‎</p>

              <p>The verse “And Avraham took…the ‘nefesh’ souls that he made in Charan” (Bereishis 12:5) is translated by Onkelos as “The souls that they subjected to the Torah.” The term &quot;nefesh&quot; refers to one's desire, as seen in the verse “If it appeals to your nefesh” (Bereishis 23:8), indicating desire. In this context, it means that Avraham gathered and directed all his worldly desires towards serving Hashem. The word עשו (made) also implies forced, as in a forced bill of divorce (גט מעושה). Hashem's command to Avraham to leave his land, birthplace, and father's house symbolizes redirecting all earthly desires to serve Hashem with all one's heart, soul, and possessions. “From your land” corresponds to serving with all one's heart, as thoughts are influenced by one's surroundings. “With all one’s soul” relates to one's birthplace, as the soul is drawn to family influences. “From your father's house” parallels serving with all one’s possessions, as Avraham left the security and abundance of his father's home for Hashem's honor. Avraham’s journey was motivated solely by the desire to fulfill Hashem's will, not for the promise of blessings.</p>

            <summary>Abraham requests the Hittites to intercede with Ephron on his behalf to purchase a burial site for his wife, as it would not be honorable for Ephron to sell his ancestral land. The Hittites acknowledge Abraham's status and righteousness, offering him a burial plot, but Abraham insists on purchasing a separate plot. The term &quot;נפשכם&quot; is understood to mean &quot;your will,&quot; and &quot;ופגעו לי&quot; signifies entreaty. The Hittites acknowledge Abraham's superior force and righteousness, leading Abraham to request their assistance in negotiating with Ephron.</summary>

He said: &quot;If it be your desire, etc.&quot; This may be understood similarly to what we are taught in Baba Batra 36: Members of the exilarch's household were not permitted to keep land merely as a result of having occupied it although no protest had been registered as the true owners were afraid to do so. The latter were advised to retain their documents proving their title to those lands. On the other hand, landowners were not in the habit of immediately protesting when rich people squatted on their land as they hoped the improvements made by the illegal squatters would eventually benefit them when they reclaimed their property.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>When the Hittites addressed Abraham as &quot;a prince of G'd,&quot; claiming that not one of them would deny Abraham his own burial plot, they could have alluded to either of two scenarios. 1) They described him as a great and powerful individual who was able to impose his will on the local population. They indicated that Abraham was aware that no one would dare protest what he set out to do. Just because he was a man of such calibre the usual practice of acquiring land by occupying it and no one protesting did not apply to him. As soon as they would feel powerful enough they would feel free to remove the body Abraham had buried on that land. What they conveyed was that their approval was only due to Abraham representing superior force. 2) A second way of interpreting the Hittites' response is as follows: Inasmuch as you are &quot;a prince of G'd,&quot; you need not fear that we look upon you as a person who throws his weight around such as in the example quoted from the Talmud. Whereas the people in the household of the exilarch were suspected of robbery, no such motive would ever be attributed to Abraham. Abraham's righteousness was beyond question. Perhaps they used the word שמענו, &quot;listen to us,&quot; in order to underline that they considered Abraham beyond reproof. Hearing this, Abraham responded: &quot;if you truly wish me to bury my dead, etc.&quot; please act as brokers between me and Efron. Had it not been for the latter words of Abraham we would have been forced to conclude that the Hittites' offer was something based on duress.</p>

              <p>IF IT BE YOUR MIND TO BURY MY DEAD FROM BEFORE ME. The intent thereof is: “I will not bury my dead in another burial ground. However if it be your desire that I bury my dead, entreat for me to Ephron who has a cave at the end of his field, which is not used as his family burial-place but as a field.” The meaning of the word milphanai, (from before me), is that if you will not do so I will entomb her in a casket. It may be that it means “my dead wife who is before me, and as an obligation I must hurry to bury her.” The reason Abraham requested, and entreat for me, is that Ephron was a rich and distinguished person, as is indicated by his saying, What is that between me and thee? (Verse 15: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver — what is that between me and thee?)  It would therefore not be to his honor to sell his ancestral inheritance, as was the case with Naboth of Jezreel. (I Kings, Chapter 28.)  It was for this reason that Abraham did not go to Ephron to offer him an inflated price for the field, but instead he asked of the people of the city to entreat to him [Ephron] on his behalf in an honorable way.</p>

                <h4>Guide for the Perplexed, Part 1 41:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>THE Hebrew nefesh (soul) is a homonymous noun, signifying the vitality which is common to all living, sentient beings. E.g. “wherein there is a living soul” (nefesh) (Gen. 1:30). It denotes also blood,” as in “Thou shalt not eat the blood (nefesh) with the meat” (Deut. 12:23). Another signification of the term is “reason,” that is, the distinguishing characteristic of man, as in “As the Lord liveth that made us this soul” (Jer. 38:16). It denotes also the part of man that remains after his death (nefesh, soul) comp. “But the soul (nefesh) of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life (1 Sam. 25:29). Lastly, it denotes “will”; comp. “To bind his princes at his will” (be-nafsho) (Ps. 105:22); “Thou wilt not deliver me unto the will (be-nefesh) of my enemies” (Ps. 41:3); and according to my opinion, it has this meaning also in the following passages, “If it be your will (nafshekem) that I should bury my dead” (Gen. 23:8); “Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my will (nafshi) could not be toward this people” (Jer. 15:1), that is, I had no pleasure in them, I did not wish to preserve them. When nefesh is used in reference to God, it has the meaning “will,” as we have already explained with reference to the passage, “That shall do according to that which is in my will (bi-lebabi) and in mine intention (be-nafshi)” (1 Sam. 2:35).</p>

(The word pigu can connote all of these meanings.)  “Ephron was sitting among the children of Ḥet and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, of all those coming to his city gate, saying” (Genesis 23:10).  “Ephron was sitting [yoshev] among the children of Ḥet” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Yashav is written; (Yoshev, “was sitting,” is usually spelled with a vav, but here the vav is missing, so that the word could be read yashav, “he sat.” If the verse is saying that “he sat,” it means that at that point in the narrative he sat down among the children of Ḥet, meaning that he assumed a position of honor among them.)  on that day they appointed him chief officer [over them], so that there would not be [a situation in which] a person of great stature [Abraham] would be purchasing from a person of low stature.  “Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, [of all those coming to his city gate]” (The implication is that all the people of the city were present.)  – Rabbi Pinḥas said: This teaches that they all locked their doors and went out to show kindness towards Abraham [by attending Sarah’s funeral].  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave that is in it, I have given it to you; before the eyes of my people I have given it to you; bury your dead” (Genesis 23:11).  “He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: But if you please, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it from me, and I will bury my dead there” (Genesis 23:13).   “And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him” (Genesis 23:14).  “My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver, between me and you, what is it? Bury your dead” (Genesis 23:15).  “Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he spoke in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” (Genesis 23:16).  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave…My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: All the shekels that are stated in the Torah refer to sela’im; in the Prophets, litrin; (A litra being equal to twenty-five sela’im.)  and in the Writings, centenaria. (A centenarium being equal to one hundred sela’im.)  Rabbi Yudan said: The exception is the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. That is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth, and he does not know that diminishment will befall him” (Proverbs 28:22). “A greedy man rushes after wealth” – this refers to Ephron, who cast a greedy eye upon the wealth of the righteous man [Abraham]. (By demanding an exorbitant price for his field.)  “And he does not know that diminishment will befall him” – as the Torah diminished the letter vav from him. (Throughout the narrative, Ephron’s name is written with a vav, but here, where he overprices his field, his name is spelled without the vav. Thus, because of his greediness, diminishment befell him.)  That is what is written: “Abraham heeded Ephron and Abraham weighed for Ephron [the silver…]” – Ephron is written without a vav.  “Four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” – Rabbi Abba bar Bizna said: It was usable for all merchandise. (Abraham gave the highest quality of coin, acceptable to all merchants for all kinds of merchandise.) </p>

How so? When he was with his brother, as it is stated: “It was when they were in the field” (Genesis 4:8), they said one to the other: ‘Come, let us divide the world.’ Cain said: ‘You take the movable property, and I [will take] the land.’ They divided it between them. Abel took the movable property and Cain [took] the land. [Cain] plotted to oust [Abel] from the world. Abel was walking on the earth and Cain was pursuing him. He said to him: ‘Leave what is mine.’ [Abel] went to the mountains, and [Cain] said: ‘Leave what is mine,’ until he stood over him and killed him. That is, “a greedy man rushes after wealth.” This is Cain, who was greedy toward his brother.  “And does not know that lack will come upon him” (Proverbs 28:22). What lack befell [Cain]? It is that the Holy One blessed be He said: “Restless and wandering you shall be on the earth” (Genesis 4:12). What is that? It is that every place that he went, the Holy One blessed be He would bring trouble along with him and they would strike him and pursue him until they would drive him away. Solomon proclaimed in his regard: “If a man would beget one hundred” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); this is Cain who begot one hundred children, “and would live many years” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); he lived as long as Adam lived, “and the days of his years would be numerous” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); he lived seven hundred and thirty-six years longer than his father, “but his soul will not be sated from the goodness” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); as his soul would not be sated with his money, as it is stated: “Restless and wandering you shall be on the earth” (Genesis 4:12). “And moreover, he has no burial” (Ecclesiastes 6:3), as he was in abeyance, gradually weakening until the flood came and swept him away. “I say: A stillborn is better than he” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); this is Abel, his brother, as [Cain] rose up and felled him, [leaving him] dead in the field.  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is Ephron. When Sarah died and Abraham was seeking a place to bury her, he said to them [the Hittites]: “Heed me, and intercede for me with Ephron, son of Tzohar” (Genesis 23:8). Immediately, they went and appointed [Ephron] prefect over them that very day. They said to him: ‘Sell the cave to Abraham.’ He said to them: ‘I will not sell it to him.’ They said to him: ‘If you do not do so we will remove you from your prefecture.’ Immediately, Abraham arose and weighed the silver for him. Rabbi Ḥama said: Every shekel stated in the Torah is a sela, (When the Torah mentions a shekel it refers to the coin known in the Mishna as a sela.)  in the Prophets is a litra, (Twenty-five sela.)  and in the Writings is a centenarium. (One hundred litra.)  Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: Except for the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. What did Ephron say to Abraham? If you give me four hundred shekel, from the merchandise of your house you will give it to me. (This sum is insignificant to a man as wealthy as you (Matnot Kehuna).)  Because he was greedy regarding Abraham’s money, the verse subtracted a vav from him. (In the verse that states that Abraham paid the money to Ephron, Ephron’s name is spelled without a vav (Genesis 23:16). This symbolizes the fact that Ephron would experience financial setbacks. )  That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” The verse subtracted a vav from the person who was greedy. Moreover, the cave was not called by his name, but rather, by the name of the children of Ḥet, as it is stated: “That Abraham purchased from the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 25:10); it does not say from Ephron, but from the children of Ḥet.  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is Esau. When Isaac died, Jacob and Esau came and divided everything. Jacob said: ‘Shall this wicked be destined to enter, he and his children, the Cave of Makhpela, and he will have a portion and residence with the righteous buried in it?’ Immediately, he took all the money in his possession and made it into a pile and said to Esau: ‘My brother, do you want the portion you have in this cave, or this silver and gold?’ At that moment, Esau said: ‘This kind of burial place is found everywhere. For one grave that I have in the cave, will I lose all this money?’ Immediately, he rose and took all the money and gave him his portion. That is what Jacob says to Joseph: “In my grave that I excavated [kariti] for me” (Genesis 50:5). “I purchased,” is not written, but rather kariti. He said to them: ‘I gave Esau a pile [keri] of dinars.’ That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” What is the lack? It is that he did not enter the Cave of Makhpela.  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is the borrower who was too miserly to rent two cows, and he borrows one and rents one. Because he rented only one, if it [the borrowed cow] dies or is injured, he pays. If he rented and it dies, the Torah says: “If he is a renter, it goes for his rent” (Exodus 22:14). (The owner does not receive payment beyond the rent.)  That is, “a greedy man rushes after wealth,” as he was too miserly to rent [both cows], the result is “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” That is what is written: “[If a man borrows from his neighbor and it is injured or dies,] its owner is not with it, he shall pay” (Exodus 22:13).  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” Rabbi Levi said: This is one who does not separate his tithes properly. There was an incident involving one who would separate his tithes properly, and he had one field that would produce one thousand measures, and he would separate from it one hundred measures as tithe. From the remainder, he and the members of his household supported themselves. At the time of his death, he called his son and said: ‘My son, pay attention to this field, such and such measures it produces, such and such measures for tithe, and from it I supported myself all my days.’ When he passed from the world, the first year, the son sowed it, and it produced one thousand measures and he separated from it one hundred as tithe. The second year, miserliness overcame him and he deducted ten, (He separated only ninety measures as tithe.)  and it deducted one hundred; (The next year, the field produced only nine hundred measures.)  likewise the third, likewise, the fourth, likewise, the fifth, until it reached the total of its tithes. (Each year, he deducted ten measures from the tithe and the field produced one hundred measures fewer, until ultimately, the field produced only one hundred measures.)  When his relatives saw that it was so, they rose, donned white garments and wrapped themselves in white outer garments and came to him. He said to them: ‘Have you come to rejoice over my [troubles]?’ They said: ‘Heaven forbid, we came only to rejoice with you.’ In the past, you were the landowner and the Holy One blessed be He was the priest. Now, you have become the priest and the Holy One blessed be He has become the landowner. That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.”  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is one who would lend with interest, because he was too miserly to lend to Israelites without interest. “And does not know that lack will come upon him,” as it is written: “He who increases his wealth through usury and interest amasses it for one who cares for the poor” (Proverbs 28:8). Who is “one who cares for the poor”? This is Esau. Is Esau one who cares for the poor? Is he not one who exploits the poor? Rather, he was like generals, commanders, and governors who invade cities, rob, and plunder, and when they return they say: ‘Bring us the poor and we will support them.’ The folk proverb says: She prostitutes herself for apples and distributes them to the ill.  Another matter, what is: “Amasses it for one who cares for the poor”? Everything that the Babylonian kingdom gathers in this world, the Holy One blessed be He gives it to Israel in the future, as it is stated: “Its merchandise and its fee will be sacred to the Lord” (Isaiah 23:18).  Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you lend money and do not take interest from him, you are My people. Just as I will never stumble, so, too, you will never stumble,’ as it is stated: “He does not lend with usury” (Psalms 15:5) and it is written: “One who performs these will never stumble” (Psalms 15:5).</p>

            <summary>Ibn Ezra explains that the word &quot;שְׁאׇלוּגׅי&quot; in Isaiah 45:11 is imperative, with the kamez substituted for zeré due to the guttural letter (א). Rashi interprets the word &quot;נפש&quot; in Job 6:11 and Proverbs 13:2 as desire, citing examples from Genesis 23:8 and Psalms 27:12. Ibn Ezra clarifies that &quot;אַל תְּפְגָע בִּי&quot; in Ruth 1:15 means to pacify, citing Genesis 23:8 as a similar usage. Additionally, Ibn Ezra discusses the misunderstood meaning of &quot;generation&quot; in Genesis 15:16, arguing that it refers to a person's lifespan rather than a fixed number of years, with examples from Job 42:16 and Deuteronomy 7:9.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>AND IN THE FOURTH GENERATION THEY SHALL COME BACK HITHER. Many of the commentaries misunderstood the meaning of the word dor (generation). (They explain generations as a specific number of years. Cf. I.E.’s commentary on Job 42:16 in which he notes, Isaac the windbag erred in saying that a generation spans 35 years. In Deut. 7:9 he quotes an opinion that a generation is 36 years.)  The sages of the Talmud said there were ten generations from Adam to Noah. (Avot 5:2. The sages speak of generations in terms of people, not years. Each one of those mentioned had a life span that differed from the other. Hence dor cannot refer to a fixed number of years.)  We also find, to a thousand generations (If a generation is a fixed number of years then a thousand generations is a thousand times that number. In Deut. 7:9, I.E. argues that it cannot be so. Cf. I.E.’s comments on Deut. 7:9.)  (Deut. 7:9) and Job speaks of four generations (Job 42:16). (In Job the four generations come to 140 years. We thus see that a generation is not a fixed number of years, for each time it is encountered it does not refer to the same number of years.)  In my opinion the meaning of dor (generation) is dwells. Compare dur (dwell) in Than to dwell (mi-dur) in the tents of wickedness (Ps. 84:11). A generation is measured by a person’s life span. Some are long and some are short. Our verse refers to the fourth generation starting from the first that lived as strangers in Egypt. Thus it is written, thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land (Deut. 23:8). (This verse spells out that the Hebrews were strangers in Egypt.)  And so it was: Kohath, Amram, Moses and Aaron were strangers in Egypt. Their children, who were the fourth generation, returned to the land of Canaan.</p>

              <p>ויתן לי את מערת המכפלה, So that he may give me the cave of Machpelah. Abraham made a point of describing the transaction as a gift though perfectly aware that money would be changing hands, as indicated by the words &quot;for full monetary value.&quot; Abraham was astute enough to purchase the cave in such a way that any future complaint was out of the question. He was also careful to add the words: &quot;in your midst.&quot; The Zohar 1,128 points out that Efron never saw anything in that cave except darkness and calamity. This being so, Efron could have claimed later that in view of his having been unaware of the true value of the cave, his consent to sell it was based on a false premise, and he could have reversed the sale. This in spite of the rule that there is no validity to a claim of land having been over or underpriced at the time of sale. Abraham still worried about an idea expressed in the Jerusalem Talmud (compare Tossaphot Kidushin 42) that if the undercharge was 50% or more the sale is reversible although it is not reversible when the amount of the undercharge was between 15% and 50%.</p>

              <p>There was also the concern that landowners of the adjoining property could claim that the land should have been sold to them in preference to an outsider, something known in Jewish law as דין המצר. Another consideration of Abraham was that after the transfer of the cave someone might present a lien dated prior to the transaction which would require him to give up his claim. For all these reasons Abraham used both the expression of &quot;gift&quot; and &quot;sale&quot; when referring to the way he wanted to acquire the cave. This would protect his claim also under the heading of what is known in Jewish law as דין חליפין, i.e. acquisition by means of a symbolic transfer. Under this heading there is no such law as אונאה, reversal of the sale due to unfair pricing. This דין חליפין applies to transactions involving either real estate or chattels whereas such acquisition by a symbol representing the ultimate object does not apply to money, i.e. coins. Hence Abraham's reference to receiving the land as a gift. Our sages in Bechorot 50 phrased it thus: Rabbi Chaninah stated that every time the word &quot;כסף&quot; i.e. silver or money appears in the Torah, the meaning is &quot;סלעים&quot;, 25 silver coins of a standard denomination; the exception is the use of the word &quot;shekel&quot; in connection with the transaction involving Abraham and Efron. In that instance the meaning is קנטרין, a coin weighing four times the usual weight of the &quot;shekel.&quot; This is the meaning of the Torah (Genesis 23,15) defining the &quot;shekel&quot; as being &quot;four hundred shekel acceptable at any merchant.&quot; The fact that Efron arbitrarily changed the usual definition of the value of the &quot;shekel,&quot; made the transaction unassailable in the future seeing he himself had set the terms of the sale. Concerning Abraham's fear that the דין מצר might be invoked by a neighbour in the future, Abraham ensured the presence and consent of all the local populace who would jointly act as his broker in the transaction. This would preclude any claim at a later date. It also demonstrated that there was no outstanding lien against the property as any such lienholder should have spoken up at that time, seeing he was present.</p>

              <p>ויתן לי את מערת המכפלה, “so that he may give me the cave Machpelah which adjoins his field.” The reason it was called מכפלה is related to the expression כפל, “double.” Apparently G’d had “doubled” the height of the cave in order to bury Adam’s remains inside it. The local residents had been unaware of this. Efron himself was also unaware of any special significance of the cave in spite of its name. He had had no reason to suspect who, if anybody, had previously been buried inside that cave. [Seeing that this had occurred before the deluge, how could anybody have been aware, unless Noach had found the land of Israel intact after the deluge. Ed.]   When Avraham repeatedly spoke about Efron “giving” him the cave, he did not mean that he was unwilling to pay for it. He meant that he would consider transfer of the title to that cave to him as a gift, regardless of any commercial transaction they would conclude concerning it. In order not to be misunderstood, Avraham added the words (verse nine) בכסף מלא יתננה לי, “in return for full monetary compensation he shall give it to me.” Avraham neither asked for a gift, nor even for the field (which would have meant a loss to Efron, [seeing he could no longer till it. Ed.] All he asked for was the cave at the edge of Efron’s field.  Efron’s answer was couched in ethical/moral terms. “I have donated the field to you as well as the cave which is situated on it; it would not be fitting for someone of your stature to own merely the cave and not the field of which it is part.” He continued: “this is why I have given you the whole package as a gift, field as well as cave.” When Efron used the expression “I have given,” he meant “it is equivalent to a gift.” Avraham took him up on this expression and that is why he said: “I have given the money for the field, take it from me,” although Efron had not even named his price yet (verse thirteen). The entire transaction was intended to create the impression that Avraham had received a tremendous bargain by being allowed to pay an outrageous price.</p>

Our sages disagree concerning the meaning of the word מכפלה. Some think that it describes a cave above another cave, (root כפל, double) others claim it means a cave within another cave. Alternately, the word describes this particular location, i.e. that the whole cave was known as the “cave machpelah” on account of the dual cave contained in that field; this is also why the field itself was considered as almost subordinate to the cave in question.</p>

              <p>THE CAVE OF MACHPELAH. Rashi comments: “It had a lower and an upper cave. Another explanation [of why it was called Machpelah — the root of which is keiphel (double)] — is that it was ‘doubled’ on account of the four couples who were buried there: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah”. But this is incorrect since Scripture states, the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah. (Verse 17 here.)  Thus we see that it is the name of the place in which the field was located, and there is no need to search for a reason for the names of places. In Bereshith Rabbah, the Sages have said: (55:10.)  “The Holy One, blessed be He, bent double the stature of the first man and He buried him there.” In their opinion, this entire place was always called Machpelah though the people did not know the reason for it for Ephron sold him everything for the price of the field unaware that there was a grave in it. Abraham, on the other hand, desired only that he should sell him the cave which was in the end of the field, and the field might be retained by Ephron. But Ephron by way of good conduct or trickery, [possibly hoping to receive a higher price for the larger transaction], said that he would give him the field and the cave which was in it since it would be unbecoming for such an honorable person to own the cave as a possession for a burial-place while the field belonged to another. Abraham rejoiced at this suggestion, and he purchased it in its entirety for the price that Ephron mentioned.</p>

              <p>Another explanation: It is doubled with couples. [You might ask: Why did Rashi need to bring two explanations? The answer is:] These two explanations reflect two opinions in Eiruvin 53a. They are telling us not to mistakenly think that the cave itself was double—one cave within the other, or one cave on top of the other—for then it should have said מערה הכפולה, “the double cave.” Since מערה lacks the ת of the construct state, כפולה [would consequently be an adjective and] its feminine ה would refer back to [the feminine] מערה. But with מערת in the construct state, המכפלה is a noun meaning “doubleness.” Thus, מערת המכפלה denotes “a cave of some other doubleness.” One opinion is that it was so named for the doubleness of the building (a house with an upper level above it) and the other opinion is that it was so named for the doubleness of the couples. And since Rashi does not decide which is closer to the plain meaning of Scripture, he cites both; they are equally good. A further answer: Rashi held that each explanation on its own raises the question: Why was the cave called מכפלה, after its doubleness, thereby omitting the main reason for its name? It should have been called after the main reason: according to one opinion, “Cave of House and Upper Level” or “Cave of Double Building”. And according to the other opinion, “Cave of Couples” or “Cave of Doubled Couples.” This is why Rashi brings both explanations—to say that it was called after the fact that it has certain things which relate to doubleness. These are: building and couples. But it was not called so for relating to only one matter. Alternatively, it was [so called] for the sake of brevity, to include two things in the word מכפלה. [Since both are equally hinted to,] both are included. We explained the name “Kiryas Arba” along similar lines. </p>

Nachmanides disagrees seeing that the Torah described it as שדה עפרון אשר במכפלה, “the field of Efron situated at Machpelah.” The phrasing makes it clear that “Machpelah” is the name of a location that contained the cave. There is no need to investigate why certain locations had been named in a certain manner by the locals of the time     In Bereshit Rabbah, 23,8 we are told that G’d miraculously reduced the size of Adam’s body when he died so, that the cave could accommodate his earthly remains. If so, the name Machpelah dates back to the time of Adam’s burial in that cave. Clearly, this had not been known to Efron as he would have multiplied the amount he asked for that cave from Avraham had he known that the first human being had been buried in that cave. </p>

Avraham requested to purchase only the cave from Efron, leaving him in possession of the adjoining field. Efron, ingeniously, implying that it would be unseemly for a distinguished personage such as Avraham to bury his dead in a cave without having title to the adjoining land, suggested that he would deed to him both cave and field. Avraham replied that he had already set aside the money required to purchase the entire field. [He had realised that the price was likely to be sky high. Ed.] </p>

              <p>(Deut. 14:22:) “You shall surely tithe.” This text is related (to Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person (i.e., a miser) moves quickly after wealth; [and he does not know that loss will come to him].” R.

This is what is written (in Gen. 23:15), “My lord, listen to me, what is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between you and me?” He said to him, “If you want to give me four hundred centenarii of silver from the goods of your house, you can give it to me.” Because he brought in an evil eye (i.e., of greed) into Abraham's wealth, [his name] is lacking the letter waw, where it is stated (in Gen. 23:16), “So Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron. It is the second Ephron that is written deficient. R. [Ammi] interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to one who borrows a cow. Since he was too miserly to rent two cows, he borrowed one and rented one. And (according to Prov. 28:22) “he does not know that loss will come to him”; that it is written (in Exod. 22:13), “[When someone borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies,] and its owner is not with it, he shall surely pay.” R. Isaac interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to the one who lends to an Israelite at interest and is too miserly to lend it without interest, and (Prov. 8:22) “he does not know that loss will come to him”; that it is written (in Prov. 28:8), “The one who augments his wealth by interest and usury amasses it for one who is generous to the poor.” Who is the one that is generous to the poor? This is Esau the wicked. Is Esau the wicked generous to the poor? Rather does he not oppress the poor? He is like those procurators who go out to the villages and plunder tenants. Then they go back to the capital and say, “Gather the poor, because we want to perform a good act for them.” The [Aramaic] adage says, “[She commits adultery] for apples, and distributes [them] to the sick.” R. Levi interpreted the verse (i.e., Prov. 28:22) with reference to the person who does not take out his tithes properly. To this end R. Levi told a story about someone who did take out his tithes properly: Now he had a certain field that produced a thousand measures every year. So he took a hundred measures from it for his tithes; and from the remainder he and the children of his household sustained themselves all of his days. At the time of his death, he summoned his son. He said to him, “My son, give your attention to this field. It yields such and such [a number of] measures, and I take out such and such a tithe. From it I have sustained myself and my household all my days.” When that son planted it the first year, it produced a thousand measures, and he took out a hundred measures from it for the tithe. For the second year, an evil eye (i.e., of greed) entered within him. So he subtracted ten [measures from the tithe], but [the field] subtracted one hundred [measures from its yield]. Similarly also [on the third, fourth, and fifth [years], until it was reduced to its tithes. When kinfolk and friends saw [what was happening], they put on white (i.e., festive) [tunics] and wrapped themselves in white [mantles]. [When] they came to him, he said to them, “Why have you come? To rejoice over the very one who has been excommunicated [by the Heavens]?” They said to him, “God forbid! We have only come to rejoice with you. In the past you were the owner of the house, and the Holy One, blessed be He, was the priest; but now the Holy One, blessed be He, has become the owner of the house, and you are the priest.” For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22), “You shall surely tithe.”</p>

              <p>AND THOU SHALT ANOINT THEM ‘UMILEITHA ETH YADAM’ [literally: “and fill their hands”]. “Every expression of ‘filling the hand’ denotes installation, when one enters for the first time into an office which one is to hold from that day onwards.” This is Rashi’s language. But I have not understood his words. How does the expression of “filling the hand” come to mean “installation?” And as to that which the Rabbi said that “in the [old] French language — when a person is appointed to be in charge of any matter, the ruler puts into his hand a leather glove which they call gant, and by means of that glove gives him the right to that matter, and it is this which is called ‘filling the hand,’” — I do not know whether the Rabbi’s intent is to state that because of that glove the installation is called “filling the hand,” and to this he brought proof from a custom [in France]! Know that this custom they derived from the Torah, as to them this form of taking possession is [what is meant by] the acquisition by exchange mentioned in connection with Boaz, for so they translated: [Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging…] a man drew off ‘na’alo’ (his shoe) (Ruth 4:7.)  — “a man drew off his gant,” and they say (Our accepted law is that acquisition by exchange is accomplished with something that originally belongs to the buyer. Hence it was Boaz [the buyer] who “drew off his shoe” and gave it to the near kinsman. But “they say” differently, that it was the near kinsman [the seller] that gave it to Boaz. Hence they derived the custom that it is the prince [who is in the position of the bestower or seller] who pulls off his gant and gives it to the recipient.)  that it was the near kinsman that gave it to Boaz. This custom of theirs is mentioned in the books of their scholars. Thus we have engaged in vain talk! The correct interpretation of milui yadayim in the Torah is that it is an expression of perfection, similar in usage to these verses: ‘ki malu yamai’ (for my days are completed); (Genesis 29:21.)  ‘ubimloth’ hayamim ha’eileh’ (and when these days were fulfilled); (Esther 1:5.)  until the days ‘m’loth’ (Leviticus 8:33.)  — be fulfilled. Similarly, ‘b’keseph malei’ (Genesis 23:9.)  means “for the full price.” And the reason for this expression is that one might say of a stranger [i.e., a non-priest] who cannot perform the offering for his cleansing, or of any person who is not empowered to perform some royal service, that his hand misses that function; and when he becomes empowered to do it, his hand has thereby been perfected and made fit for all kinds of work and service. Thus, ‘milu yedchem hayom’ (Further, 32:29.)  [generally translated: consecrate yourselves today] means that: “now your hands are full with the whole service of G-d, for even every man upon his son, and upon his brother (Further, 32:29.)  have you served Him [that day].” Or it may be that Moses was hinting to the sons of Levi that by virtue of this merit they would be chosen to perform the Divine Service in the Tabernacle, as it is said, At that time the Eternal separated the tribe of Levi. (Deuteronomy 10:8.)  Similarly King David said to Israel on the occasion of the donations for the House [of G-d], Because I have set my affection on the house of my G-d, seeing that I have a treasure of mine own of gold and silver, I give it into the house of my G-d, (I Chronicles 29:3.)  and then he continued saying, Who then offereth willingly ‘l’maloth yado’ this day unto the Eternal? (Ibid., Verse 5.)  — meaning “to perfect his hand [this day unto the Eternal],” for by doanting towards the building of the House [of G-d] their hands become full with all the sacrifices and all manner of services, for Israel’s worship of G-d is only a complete one in the Sanctuary. Similarly, the ram of ‘milu’im’ mentioned in this section (Further, 29:22.)  is so called because the filling of the priests’ duties was accomplished through this offering, for the sin-offering and the burnt-offering (Ibid., Verse 5.)  were to effect atonement, and this ram was to fill the priest’s hand with [the right to] sacrifice. I have also found that in Targum Yerushalmi the ram of ‘milu’im’ is translated: d’ashlamutha, (of perfection); (This translation I found in Targum Yonathan ben Uziel to Leviticus 8:22.)  similarly also in all expressions of milui yadayim it translated “perfection.” Onkelos, however, [in translating umileitha eth yadam — ‘and you will bring their sacrifices’ (On the seven days of installation it was Moses who acted in the role of the priest and performed the rites of the sacrifices. Hence Onkelos’ translation: “and you [i.e., Moses] will bring their sacrifices,” as during these seven days of installation you will be the priest to offer their sacrifices.) ] followed the sense of the subject and was not pedantic as to the literal language, as is his custom in many places. Some scholars (Found in R’dak’s Sefer Hashorashim, root male.)  explain umileitha eth yadam as meaning that he will fill their hands [with the gifts] from the sacrifices. Similarly: whosoever would, he [Jeroboam] ‘yemalei eth yado’ (I Kings 13:33.)  means that he could fill his hands at will from the sacrifices. But the correct interpretation [of the term milui yadayim] is as I have explained. And the meaning of the expression, whosoever would, ‘yemalei eth yado’ that he might be one of the priests of the high places (I Kings 13:33.)  is that he would bring for himself an offering of installation as he devised of his own heart, (Ibid., 12:33.)  in order to initiate himself into his office, and thereby he became one of the priests of the high places, for they acted in a manner similar to the ways of the Torah. (See Leviticus 6:13. This is also applied to the ordinary priest who brought a meal-offering when he officiated for the first time. Ramban’s intent is thus that in the days of Jeroboam when the king installed a new group of priests in the kingdom of Israel to officiate at the sacrifices on the Bamoth (high places) he adopted the ways of the Torah as explained, in order to give the appearance of his remaining loyal to the commandments of the Torah.) </p>

What is the reason? “Fields will be bought by money (Anything less than the smallest coin is not money.) .” This disagrees with what Rebbi Ḥanina said (Babli Bekhorot 50a. There, the statement of R. Jehudah bar Pazi is ascribed to R. Ḥanina. In Gen.rabba58(9), the statement of R. Jehudah bar Pazi is in the name of R. Yudan.) : Any šeqalim mentioned in the Torah are tetradrachmas (Mishnah ‘Arakhin 7:1. If somebody dedicates his field to the Temple, Scripture prescribes that he redeem it proportional to the numbers of years to the next Jubilee. The full rate, for the entire 49 yars of a Jubilee cycle, is 50 šeqel for a field on which a ḥomer (or kur, 30 se’ah) of barley can be sown (75’000 square cubits). Talmudic theory identifies the biblical šeqel with the Roman tetradrachma, which is slightly more than the standard šeqel documented from First Kingdom times, 11.4 g. Since in the vernacular the zūz, the Babylonian half-šeqel, was identified with the Roman denarius, the “sheqel” was identified as two denar. This gave rise to the theory that the biblical “holy šeqel”, which simply was “the king’s weight” and still the Tyrian šeqel in Roman times, was twice the profane šeqel. The rate to be paid for the standard field per year therefore was 50/49 = 1 1/49 tetradrachma. The rate stated in the Mishnah is 1 1/48 tetradrachma. The small difference, 1/48 - 1/49 is qolbon (κόλλυβος, Latin collybus,collubus, “exchange of coins; rate of exchange”), the small coin paid as agio to the money-changer to convert the sum into actual coin. The Mishnah shows that a dupondius was 1/48 of a tetradrachma or half an obolus.) , in the Prophets pounds340 (A Roman libra, Greek λίτρα, of 96 denarii or 24 tetradrachmas.) , and in the Hagiographs centenarii (A noun, meaning “100 pieces” formed in vulgar Latin from the classical adjective centenarius, “consisting of a hundred”, in this case 100 librae. The same meaning, 100 lb., is found in Middle High German zëntenaere,zëntner.) . Rebbi Jehudah bar Pazi said, except for the šeqalim paid to Ephron (Paid by Abraham for the Makhpela cave, Gen. 23:9.) , which were centenarii. What is the reason? “For full money he shall give it to me.” There is no comparison since here it is written “money” but there “šeqalim”. They objected, is there not the rapist (Deut. 23:29; the extra fine the rapist of a virgin pays is “50 silver pieces”; cf. Ketubot 3:1, Note 1.) , for whom “money” is written and you say “šeqalim”?</p>

Abraham wanted all the people of Efron's city to witness the request for a burial ground, including residents and outsiders. Efron was appointed an officer over the citizens on that day, and everyone left their work to pay respects to Sarah. Efron was sitting among the Hittites as if he were one of them.</summary>

(A centenarium being equal to one hundred sela’im.)  Rabbi Yudan said: The exception is the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. That is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth, and he does not know that diminishment will befall him” (Proverbs 28:22). “A greedy man rushes after wealth” – this refers to Ephron, who cast a greedy eye upon the wealth of the righteous man [Abraham]. (By demanding an exorbitant price for his field.)  “And he does not know that diminishment will befall him” – as the Torah diminished the letter vav from him. (Throughout the narrative, Ephron’s name is written with a vav, but here, where he overprices his field, his name is spelled without the vav. Thus, because of his greediness, diminishment befell him.)  That is what is written: “Abraham heeded Ephron and Abraham weighed for Ephron [the silver…]” – Ephron is written without a vav.  “Four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” – Rabbi Abba bar Bizna said: It was usable for all merchandise. (Abraham gave the highest quality of coin, acceptable to all merchants for all kinds of merchandise.) </p>

            <summary>Yehuda ben Tabai warns against becoming like the judges' advisers who reveal legal opinions to others, leading them to seek judgment elsewhere based on your advice. Rambam adds that it is wrong to organize legal claims for others, as this may lead to suspicion and negative talk. This is illustrated by Rabbi Yochanan's story in Tractate Ketuvot 52b.</summary>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Yonah on Pirkei Avot 1:8:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Yehuda ben Tabai says, &quot;Do not make yourself like the judges' advisers (orkhei)&quot;: He means to say a head, as it is stated in Bereshit Rabbah 23:10, &quot;'And Efron was sitting among the children of Chet' (Genesis 23:10) - on that very day, they appointed him arkhi,&quot; meaning to say the head of the judges. And also in the section of &quot;Yaakov sent messengers&quot; (Parshat Vayishlach, Bereshit Rabbah 75:3), &quot;arkhi&quot; is the head of the thieves. And also in Arukh, you will find that arkhi is explained like this there. And the explanation of this is, do not make yourself like the judge's advisers, that [people] should ask you and you tell them the laws; and after they hear it from you, they go to other judges for judgment and they say to them, &quot;The head of the judges has already told us that this is the law.&quot; Do not make yourself like them. And from Rambam there is another explanation: &quot;Do not make yourself like the judges' advisers&quot; - He did (not) speak here about someone who teaches false claims to his friend and how to present them, since such a person is completely evil. And it is not necessary to say that a person not do this on account that they will suspect him and speak badly about him, as this is a great sin [and nothing more need be said about it]. Rather, [it is one] that organizes the claims [of someone] and arranges the laws and reveals the verdict [of a case] to an individual - as it is not fitting to do this since they will suspect him and speak badly about him. This [is] like that story of Rabbi Yochanan in Tractate Ketuvot 52b, wherein at the beginning he reasoned, &quot;do not ignore your flesh&quot; (Isaiah 58:7), and at the end he reasoned, it is different with an important man.</p>

            <summary>Rabbi Ḥanina explains that any unspecified silver shekel in the Torah is one sela, in the Prophets is a silver litra, and in the Writings is in centenaria. However, the silver of Ephron is an exception, as it is considered a centenaria even though it is referred to as shekels in the Torah, as indicated by the verse in Genesis 23:16.</summary>

              <p>§ The Gemara continues to discuss the value of coins. Rabbi Ḥanina says: Any silver shekel that is stated in the Torah but which is unspecified is referring to one sela. Additionally, any unspecified silver shekel mentioned in the Prophets is a silver litra, weighing twenty-five sela, and any unspecified silver shekel mentioned in the Writings is in centenaria [kintarin], silver weighing one hundred sela. This is the case throughout the Bible except for the silver of Ephron, where even though it is written in the Torah: “Shekels of silver,” without specification, it is in centenaria, as it is written: “Four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant” (Genesis 23:16). This means that the silver was acceptable as shekels everywhere, and there is a place where they call a centenarius a shekel.</p>

Midrash highlights Ephron's initial promise and later demand for payment, illustrating the wicked's lack of follow-through.

              </summary>
              <p>In order to achieve maximum impact by His revelation at Mount Sinai, G-d resorted to extraordinary phenomena both before, during and after matan Torah, the presentation of the Torah to the people. This becomes evident when one studies the story of the Jewish people's arrival in the desert of Sinai. First we are told that they arrived in Sinai on the first day of the third month. Next, though we know that their last stop had been Refidim, the fact that they set out from Refidim and arrived in Sinai is repeated. Next it says that Moses ascended to G-d and called to Him from the Mountain. The order really should have been &quot;G-d called to Moses and the latter ascended.&quot; From the manner of the text, it appears as if Moses was on a higher level than the one calling to him. Next we have the emphasis on the order of addressing Israel, &quot;thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;these are the words you shall speak to the children of Israel.&quot; This suggests that Moses had no latitude in the words he could use. However, it is worth noting that anyone who has a major request of his fellow man would do well to pay attention to the following prerequisites in order to assure himself of an optimal chance of success. He must watch (a) timing, (b) place, (c) method of presentation of the request, (d) the ability of the party petitioned to grant the petition, (e) explain the advantages accruing to the petitioned party if he grants the petition. He must also bear in mind the position in society of the party petitioned. Queen Esther is a prime example of how all these points need to be heeded when she petitioned king Ahasverus. She chose the timing very carefully, saying &quot;tomorrow I shall do what the king says.&quot; She chose the place, inviting him to lunch at her palace, so as to be undisturbed. She chose the method, i.e. wine, in order to put the king into a good frame of mind, and at the same time to make Haman relaxed and careless. She adhered to the order of priorities by begging for her own life first. Concerning the king's ability to deliver, and the advantage to him by granting her request, she said &quot;we have been sold, and the king stands to lose heavily financially.&quot; In our situation, G-d demonstrates the same care in His request from Israel. The time chosen, the third month after the Exodus, allowed Israel to have recovered from the slavery experienced.They had been given ample opportunity to observe the way in which G-d had looked after their needs thus far. The mountain, frequently referred to as &quot;the mountain of G-d&quot;, was meant to impress itself on those who beheld it. (by far the highest mountain in that part of the world). When one contrasts unpleasant memories with pleasant experiences, the latter seem much more impressive than when contrasted with everyday events. Since the events in Refidim had been exceptionally upsetting, mentioning the contrast of their departure from there with the arrival at Sinai, left an especially favourable impression. The site was well chosen, therefore. As far as how G-d’s request was related to the Jewish people, this was accomplished through the good offices of Moses who was the most suitable instrument, being someone who had reached the highest level of humanity without the benefit of Torah legislation. Concerning the exact formulation of the request, the word &quot;thus&quot; indicates that Moses indeed was not given any leeway in the precise wording he had to employ. The content of the message concentrated on reminding the addressee of prior events which have a bearing on his attitude. In this case, these would be G-d’s actions against Egypt, which form the background for His present request. There follows the purpose of the request, namely that Israel become a holy nation, a nation of priests, precious to the Lord etc. That such a carefully planned scenario elicited a favourable response from Israel is hardly surprising then. Although Moses relayed G-d’s request only to the elders, fearing that the nation as a whole might not be so responsive, the nation's response shows how effective G-d’s planning of this event had been. The wonderfully effective things G-d was going to do during the actual revelation is introduced by His saying to Moses &quot;here I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people will hear Me talk to you and will also believe in your leadership forever more&quot;. The objective of becoming a &quot;holy nation&quot; by means of the mitzvot is described in Deuteronomy 30,11, as a very easily attainable goal. &quot;For this commandment is not so wonderfuL.it is easily achievable..up to your mouth and your heart to implement&quot;. Our sages tell us that the Torah is so structured that even &quot;the empty ones among you are as full of mitzvot as pomegranates are full of pips&quot;. This is so, because the mitzvot apply to our body's activities and do not require intellectual brilliance in order to be performed. </p>

Rabbi Huna avoided danger by engaging in discussion with R. Ada b. Ahaba until his men removed the wine from a room about to collapse. Ada b. Ahaba lived a long life by following various ethical principles, such as never being angry in his house or rejoicing in his neighbor's misfortune. Ephron's greediness led to diminishment, as seen in the changing spelling of his name in the Torah.</summary>

              <p>“He spoke with them, saying: If you are willing to bury my dead from before me, heed me, and intercede for me with Ephron, son of Tzoḥar” (Genesis 23:8).  “He spoke with them, saying: If you are willing…[intercede [pigu] for me]” – prevail upon him for me, mediate on my behalf; and if that is not [sufficient], entreat him on my behalf. (The word pigu can connote all of these meanings.)  “Ephron was sitting among the children of Ḥet and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, of all those coming to his city gate, saying” (Genesis 23:10).  “Ephron was sitting [yoshev] among the children of Ḥet” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Yashav is written; (Yoshev, “was sitting,” is usually spelled with a vav, but here the vav is missing, so that the word could be read yashav, “he sat.” If the verse is saying that “he sat,” it means that at that point in the narrative he sat down among the children of Ḥet, meaning that he assumed a position of honor among them.)  on that day they appointed him chief officer [over them], so that there would not be [a situation in which] a person of great stature [Abraham] would be purchasing from a person of low stature.  “Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, [of all those coming to his city gate]” (The implication is that all the people of the city were present.)  – Rabbi Pinḥas said: This teaches that they all locked their doors and went out to show kindness towards Abraham [by attending Sarah’s funeral].  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave that is in it, I have given it to you; before the eyes of my people I have given it to you; bury your dead” (Genesis 23:11).  “He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: But if you please, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it from me, and I will bury my dead there” (Genesis 23:13).   “And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him” (Genesis 23:14).  “My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver, between me and you, what is it? Bury your dead” (Genesis 23:15).  “Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he spoke in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” (Genesis 23:16).  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave…My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: All the shekels that are stated in the Torah refer to sela’im; in the Prophets, litrin; (A litra being equal to twenty-five sela’im.)  and in the Writings, centenaria. (A centenarium being equal to one hundred sela’im.)  Rabbi Yudan said: The exception is the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. That is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth, and he does not know that diminishment will befall him” (Proverbs 28:22). “A greedy man rushes after wealth” – this refers to Ephron, who cast a greedy eye upon the wealth of the righteous man [Abraham]. (By demanding an exorbitant price for his field.)  “And he does not know that diminishment will befall him” – as the Torah diminished the letter vav from him. (Throughout the narrative, Ephron’s name is written with a vav, but here, where he overprices his field, his name is spelled without the vav. Thus, because of his greediness, diminishment befell him.)  That is what is written: “Abraham heeded Ephron and Abraham weighed for Ephron [the silver…]” – Ephron is written without a vav.  “Four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” – Rabbi Abba bar Bizna said: It was usable for all merchandise. (Abraham gave the highest quality of coin, acceptable to all merchants for all kinds of merchandise.) </p>

              <p>R. Huna had wine in a room which was in an unsafe condition, and the walls of which were momentarily expected to fall. He wished to remove the wine, [but was afraid to enter the room]. So he got R. Ada b. Ahaba to enter the room with him and engaged him there in a discussion of an Halacha, until his men removed the wine. After they had left, the walls of the room caved in. When R. Ada realized how he had been used, he became angry, for he agreed with R. Janai, who said: &quot;A man should never expose himself to danger expecting that a miracle will be wrought for him; for it may be that such a miracle will not be wrought, and even if a miracle be wrought for him, it will be deducted from the rewards due him for his merits.&quot; R. Chanin said: &quot;What is the Biblical passage for this? (Gen. 23, 11) I am not worthy of all the kindness, etc.&quot; Wherein lay the greatness of Ada b. Ahaba? As we are taught: The disciples of R. Ada b. Ahaba asked him: &quot;Why have you lived so long?&quot; He replied: &quot;I was never angry in my house; I never superseded a superior; I never thought of Divine subjects in unclean alleys; I never walked four cubits without studying the Torah or without Phylacteries; I never slept in the house of study, neither regularly nor took a nap; I never rejoiced when my neighbor was in misfortune, and I never called my fellow man by a nickname.&quot; </p>

              <p>“Abraham arose from before his dead, and he spoke to the children of Ḥet, saying” (Genesis 23:3).  “Abraham arose from before his dead” – this teaches (The verse can also be translated: “Abraham arose from before death.” The angel of death was intimidating him and urging him to bury Sarah promptly.)  that he saw the angel of death provoking him.  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where is it derived what we learn in a mishna: One whose dead one [a deceased relative] is lying before him (That is, he is charged with burying the body.)  is exempt from the recitation of Shema, from prayer, and from wearing phylacteries, as well as all mitzvot in the Torah? (Mishna Berakhot 3:1.)  It is from here: “[Abraham] arose…and he spoke.” (He did not engage in any other activity prior to his burying his dead.)  “I am a sojourner and a resident among you: give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” (Genesis 23:4).  “A sojourner [ger] and a resident”; ger means one who dwells as a tenant; toshav means a landlord. [Abraham was saying:] ‘If you prefer, I will act as a tenant, (Humbly beseeching your permission to bury Sarah.)  but if not, I will act as a landlord, (And take it without your consent.)  as this is what the Holy One blessed be He has said to me: “To your descendants I have given this land”’ (Genesis 15:18).  “Give me a burial plot with you, and I will bury my dead from before me” – I am requesting [a plot] for only one dead person, as it is stated: “Give me a burial plot with you, [and I will bury my dead].”  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham, saying to him” (Genesis 23:5).  “Hear us, my lord: you are a prince of God in our midst, in our choicest graves bury your dead; none of us shall withhold his grave from you, from burying your dead” (Genesis 23:6).  “The children of Ḥet answered Abraham…Hear us, my lord…” – you are king over us, you are prince over us, you are like a god to us. He said to them: ‘Let the world not fail to accept its true King, let the world not fail to accept its true God.’   “In our choicest graves” – in the choicest one of our many graves.   “Bury your dead” – many dead. (Although Abraham had requested a single grave site, for Sarah, the children of Ḥet offered him a site for many burials.)  “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land, the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 23:7.   “Abraham prostrated himself before the people of the land” (The verse does not say that Abraham bowed “to” the people, but that he bowed “before” them. He bowed to God in their presence, giving thanks for his good fortune in obtaining the permission he had sought.)  – from here we learn that one should give thanks [to God] over hearing good tidings.</p>

When the angels were revealed unto him, he thought that they were travellers (from among) the people of the land, and he ran to meet them, and he wished to prepare for them a great banquet, and he told Sarah to prepare cakes for them. When Sarah was kneading, she perceived that the manner of women was upon her, therefore he did not hand them any of the cakes. He ran to fetch a calf. But the calf fled from before him, and went into the Cave of Machpelah, and he went in there after it, and he found Adam and his help-meet lying there upon their beds, and they slept, and lights were kindled above them, and a sweet scent was upon them like a sweet savour, therefore he desired to have the Cave of Machpelah as a burial possession. He spoke to the sons of Jebus, in order to purchase from them the Cave of || Machpelah by a purchase with gold, and by a perpetual deed for a possession of a burying-place. Were they Jebusites? Were they not Hittites? But they were called Jebusites according to the name of the city of Jebus. The men did not accept (this request). He began to bow down and prostrate himself unto them, as it is said, &quot;And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land&quot; (Gen. 23:12).</p>

        <summary>Chasidut explains that Noach's saving of animals during the flood gave him ownership of the animal kingdom, allowing him to use some for food without causing pain. Avraham learned the term &quot;קח&quot; from Noach's actions to acquire animals for the ark, enabling him to use animals as beasts of burden. In the commentary, Abraham emphasizes his desire for Efron to accept payment for the burial plot for Sarah, using specific language to convey his intent. The Mishnah outlines transgressions punishable by stoning, including incest, bestiality, and idol worship, with distinctions made for unintentional sins. The Talmud discusses betrothal through money, drawing parallels between acquiring a wife and purchasing land. Abraham offers to pay Ephron for the burial plot in front of the people of the land.</summary>

              <p>‎Genesis 6,21. ‎“and you are to take ‎for yourself some of everything that serves as food, etc;” here ‎the Torah alludes to the reason why until the deluge man was ‎forbidden to eat animals, (according to Nachmanides). Noach ‎saved the animals from extinction during the deluge; he ‎therefore- as representative of the human race- became the ‎‎“owner” of the animal kingdom, and as such entitled to use some ‎of the animals, after due preparation  without causing pain  to ‎the animals, as food for himself. When Avraham, in Genesis 23,13 ‎urged Efron to accept the money he had readied for the purchase ‎of the cave of Machpelah wherein he planned to bury Sarah, the ‎word ‎קח‎ is used as denoting the acquisition of something. ‎Avraham had learned this expression and its meaning from our ‎verse where it is used in this sense for the first time. Noach made ‎an additional acquisition when taking the animal into the ark ‎with him. [He had previously been permitted to use the animals ‎as beasts of burden, etc. Ed.]‎</p>

              </summary>
              <p>‘LU’ (IF) THOU WILT HEAR ME. This is equivalent to saying, “If you, if you will hear me,” and the purport thereof is like, “if you, if you would hear me,” the redundancy being for the purpose of emphasizing the matter. Similar cases are found in these verses: Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; (Judges 4:18.)  Art thou any better, better than Balak? (Ibid., 11:25.)  And to speak against him, saying; (II Chronicles 32:17.)  And as for me, whither shall I go?; (Further, 37:30.)  And I turned myself; (Ecclesiastes 2:12.)  And I saw myself; (Ibid., Verse 13.)  Seeing all the congregation are all holy. (Numbers 16:3.)  All these are examples of expressions of synonimity. In my opinion, this is also the case in the verse, If from a thread even to a sandal tie, if I take (anything that is thine), (Above, 14:23. Here too, there is a redundant “if.”)  which is equivalent to saying, “If, from a thread even to a sandal tie, I take anything that is yours.” It may be that [in the verse here before us the meaning is], “If you are as you have said.” that is, if you are speaking what is in your heart concerning the matter, and if you will listen to me and consummate the sale. A similar usage of a missing word is found in the verse, And their brethren said unto them, What are ye? (Judges 18:8.)  [which means, “What are you saying?”] In my opinion, a similar case of such usage is the verse, Wherefore am I? (Further, 25:2. See also Ramban there.)  [meaning, “Wherefore am I in the world?”] Perhaps this is the opinion of Onkelos who translated here, “if you will do me a favor,” meaning, “if you will do my will as you have said.”</p>

              <p>And I wish that I had already given it to you. [Rashi makes this comment] because here it is speaking of money, which must be actually handed over [to validate the transaction]. However [in v. 11 it speaks of] land, which is at one’s disposal [one can say] “as though I have already given it to you.” This is because land [is readily available and] doe need to be collected. (Maharshal) But R. Meir Stern writes: Here it says נתתי כסף, past tense, although it should have used future tense and said: “I will give you the money.” And Rashi explains it as: “I wish that I had already given it to you.” And also in v. 11 it said השדה נתתיה, past tense, although it should have used future tense. Yet, Rashi explained it as: “As though I have already given it to you.” Why does Rashi explain it differently? [The answer is:] Here, Avraham said afterward: “Take it from me.” If נתתי כסף meant, “As though I have already given it to you,” he would not then say, “Take it from me.” If he already “gave” Ephron the money, then Ephron already “received” it, since by definition, giving entails receiving. That is why Rashi explains it as: “I wish that I had already given.” Then it understandable for Avraham to say: “Therefore, now, take it from me.” But on v. 11, Rashi could not explain as he does here, because here it is written לו שמעני נתתי, and לו means “if only.” Here, לו can refer both to שמעני, “If only you would listen to me,” and to נתתי, “If only I had already given.” But in v. 11 it does not [say לו]. However, if it were not written here, “Take it from me,” we would not be forced to say that לו refers also to נתתי; we would say it refers only to שמעני. And we would rather have explained נתתי as in v. 11: [“As though I have already given it to you.”]. </p>

(The word pigu can connote all of these meanings.)  “Ephron was sitting among the children of Ḥet and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, of all those coming to his city gate, saying” (Genesis 23:10).  “Ephron was sitting [yoshev] among the children of Ḥet” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Yashav is written; (Yoshev, “was sitting,” is usually spelled with a vav, but here the vav is missing, so that the word could be read yashav, “he sat.” If the verse is saying that “he sat,” it means that at that point in the narrative he sat down among the children of Ḥet, meaning that he assumed a position of honor among them.)  on that day they appointed him chief officer [over them], so that there would not be [a situation in which] a person of great stature [Abraham] would be purchasing from a person of low stature.  “Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, [of all those coming to his city gate]” (The implication is that all the people of the city were present.)  – Rabbi Pinḥas said: This teaches that they all locked their doors and went out to show kindness towards Abraham [by attending Sarah’s funeral].  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave that is in it, I have given it to you; before the eyes of my people I have given it to you; bury your dead” (Genesis 23:11).  “He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: But if you please, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it from me, and I will bury my dead there” (Genesis 23:13).   “And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him” (Genesis 23:14).  “My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver, between me and you, what is it? Bury your dead” (Genesis 23:15).  “Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he spoke in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” (Genesis 23:16).  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave…My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: All the shekels that are stated in the Torah refer to sela’im; in the Prophets, litrin; (A litra being equal to twenty-five sela’im.)  and in the Writings, centenaria. (A centenarium being equal to one hundred sela’im.)  Rabbi Yudan said: The exception is the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. That is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth, and he does not know that diminishment will befall him” (Proverbs 28:22). “A greedy man rushes after wealth” – this refers to Ephron, who cast a greedy eye upon the wealth of the righteous man [Abraham]. (By demanding an exorbitant price for his field.)  “And he does not know that diminishment will befall him” – as the Torah diminished the letter vav from him. (Throughout the narrative, Ephron’s name is written with a vav, but here, where he overprices his field, his name is spelled without the vav. Thus, because of his greediness, diminishment befell him.)  That is what is written: “Abraham heeded Ephron and Abraham weighed for Ephron [the silver…]” – Ephron is written without a vav.  “Four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” – Rabbi Abba bar Bizna said: It was usable for all merchandise. (Abraham gave the highest quality of coin, acceptable to all merchants for all kinds of merchandise.) </p>

Specific details are provided regarding the liability for sin-offerings in cases of unintentional incestuous relationships, with distinctions made based on the marital status of the individuals involved. Additionally, individuals who engage in intercourse with a male or an animal, as well as women who engage in intercourse with an animal, are also subject to stoning, with the rationale given that the animal must be stoned to prevent further sin and shame.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>These transgressors are those who are stoned to death: One who engages in intercourse with his mother; or with his father’s wife, even if she is not his mother; or with his daughter-in-law; or with a male; or with an animal; and a woman who engages in intercourse with an animal. And one who blasphemes, and one who engages in idol worship. And one who gives of his offspring to Molekh, and a necromancer, and a sorcerer. And one who desecrates Shabbat, and one who curses his father or his mother, and one who engages in intercourse with a betrothed young woman, and an inciter who incites individuals to idol worship, and a subverter who incites an entire city to idol worship, and a warlock, and a stubborn and rebellious son. The mishna elaborates: One who unwittingly engages in intercourse with his mother who is also his father’s wife is liable to bring two sin-offerings for his intercourse with her: One due to the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s mother and one due to the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s father’s wife. Rabbi Yehuda says: He is liable to bring only one sin-offering, due to the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s mother. One who unwittingly engages in intercourse with his father’s wife while his father is married to her is liable to bring two sin-offerings: One due to the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s father’s wife and one due to the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with a married woman. He is liable due to the former prohibition both during his father’s lifetime and after his father’s death, and whether the relationship between the woman and his father is one of betrothal or one of marriage. Likewise, one who unwittingly engages in intercourse with his daughter-in-law during his son’s lifetime is liable to bring two sin-offerings for his intercourse with her: One due to the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with one’s daughter-in-law, and one due to the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with a married woman. The former liability applies both during his son’s lifetime and after his son’s death, and whether the relationship between the woman and his son is one of betrothal or one of marriage. A man who engages in intercourse with a male or with an animal, and a woman who engages in intercourse with an animal, are executed by stoning. The animal is likewise stoned to death. The mishna asks: If the person sinned by doing this, how did the animal sin? Rather, because a calamity was caused to a person by it, therefore the verse states that it should be stoned, so that it does not cause another to sin. Alternatively, it is so that this animal will not pass through the marketplace, and those who see it will say: This is the animal because of which so-and-so was stoned, and its existence would shame his memory.</p>

            <summary>G'd's forgiveness is held in reserve until needed, similar to Avraham's statement about money for the cave of Machpelah; the word &quot;נתתי&quot; in the past tense can indicate present tense, as seen in Avraham's words in Genesis 23:13. The rainbow symbolizes G'd's covenant and was created since the six days of creation, as seen in the past tense use of &quot;נתתי&quot; in Genesis 9:13. The promise of a son to Sarah is emphasized by the use of &quot;נתתי&quot; in Genesis 17:16, similar to Avraham's statement about money for the field in Genesis 23:13. The past tense can be used for future events, as seen in Isaiah 38:15, and the Torah often speaks of future events in the past tense to emphasize the certainty of G'd's promises, as seen in Rabbeinu Bahya's commentary on Genesis 9:13. The past tense is not always literal, as seen in Rashbam's commentary on Genesis 49:4 and Ibn Ezra's commentary on Genesis 4:23, and the word &quot;הייתי&quot; in Exodus 18:3 is not necessarily in the past tense. The acquisition of a wife is compared to the purchase of land in Genesis 23:13, as noted in Bartenura's commentary on Mishnah Kiddushin 1:1.</summary>

              <p>אשר לקחתי, “which I have taken;” he meant that he would take this (accept this) in the days of Joshua when the tribes would receive their shares of the Holy Land. In those days all of this would be conquered with the sword and the bow and arrow. The use by Yaakov of the past tense here is parallel to the use of the past tense concerning the money for the purchase price of the cave of Machpelah, when Avraham had said: נתתי כסף השדה קח ממני, “I have already given the money for the field, accept it from me.” (Genesis 23,13) Just as Avraham at the time was certain that Efron would finalise the negotiation, so Yaakov was certain that G-d would keep His promises concerning the Israelites receiving their ancestral land in due course. The reason why Yaakov singled out the Emorite and no other Canaanite tribe is that this was by far the strongest of the Canaanite tribes. We find proof of this in Amos 2,9: ואנכי השמדתי את האמורי מפניהם אשר כגובה ארזים גבהו וחסון הוא כאלונים, “yet I destroyed the Emorite before them, whose stature was like that of the cedars amongst the trees and who was as stout as oak trees.”Another interpretation: when Yaakov speaks of “my sword and my bow,” he quotes G-d, just as we have the line said by Moses in Deuteronomy 33,29: בה' מגן עזרך ואשר חרב גאותך, “by G-d your protecting shield, your sword is triumphant.”Rashi here understands our verse as Yaakov referring to the surrounding tribes making a joint effort to avenge the male inhabitants of Sh’chem whom Shimon and Levi had killed, as abstaining from their intention, i.e. “they did not pursue the sons of Yaakov.” (Genesis 35,5)</p>

              <p>[AND LAMECH SAID…] Note, this  (Verses 23 and 24. The reason is that I.E. understands verses 23 and 24 to be an attempt by Lamech to induce his wives to cohabit with him. However, verses 20 through 22 tell us that they in fact did so. Hence verses 23 and 24 must describe what happened before verses 20-22. Its meaning is that Lamech had already said to Adah and Zillah. Va-yomer is thus a pluperfect (Krinsky).)  should have appeared earlier. I have already noted two similar examples of this in my earlier comments. (See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 1:9.)  Three additional examples are: that the man took a golden ring (Gen. 24:22); (This is followed by: and said: Whose daughter art thou (Gen. 24:23). Now, would the servant give a golden ring to the girl before asking her who she was? Therefore Gen. 24:23 must be rendered: And he already said, Whose daughter art thou (Krinsky).)  And the Lord said unto Moses, say unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiff-necked people (Ex. 33:5); (This is preceded by: And when the people heard these evil tidings (v. 4). However, the evil tidings are reported in verse 5. Thus verse 5 should precede verse 4. Hence the meaning of And when the people heard (v. 4) is: and when the people had heard; i.e., when they heard the following, namely what is reported in the next verse (Meijler).)  and And I besought the Lord at that time (Deut. 3:23). (Cf. I.E.’s comment on Deut. 3:23. What is reported in this verse took place before Deut. 3:21, viz., And I commanded Joshua, etc. Moses besought God before he commanded Joshua not to fear the kings of Canaan. Hence Deut. 3:23 is to be rendered as And I had besought the Lord. Ibid. I. E.’s commentary.)  As to our verse, it is to be interpreted as our sages did. The rabbis tell us that Adah and Zillah were afraid to bear children because they feared that their offspring, who were the seventh generation from Cain, would die or be killed as punishment for Cain’s sin. Therefore Lamech said to them, “I am in truth the seventh generation (From Cain. However, in truth Lamech lied to them. He was the sixth and not the seventh generation from Cain (Filwarg).)  and if a man would wound me or a child bruise me, then I would kill them.” I have slain is used in place of I will slay. (Haragti is a perfect.)  Similar examples are: I will give (natati) (Literally, I gave.)  the price of the field (Gen. 23:13), and which I took out (According to I.E., I took (lakachti) means I will take.)  of the hand of the Amorite (Gen. 48:22). There are many similar instances. (The point is that the Bible occasionally uses a perfect in place of an imperfect.)  </p>

              </summary>
              <p>את קשתי נתתי בענן, “I have placed My bow in the cloud, etc.” The plain meaning of these words is that the rainbow is to serve as a sign just as when Yaakov and Lavan erected a mound (pile of stones) as a monument, i.e. a symbol of their treaty in Genesis 31,52. Another example of such a symbol is found when Avraham and Avimelech concluded a treaty in Genesis 21,30 and Avraham set aside seven sheep to serve as a visible symbol of their treaty, (as testimony that he had dug the well). Any symbol which is displayed in front to two partners to a treaty or agreement is called אות, “sign.” This is particularly evident when the removal of the foreskin is referred to as the “sign,” אות, of the covenant between G-d and the Jewish people Genesis 17,11. Just as circumcision is the symbol of a special relationship between Avraham and his descendants and G-d, so the rainbow was a symbol of a new relationship between G-d and mankind which would preclude the recurrence of a deluge. The word נתתי, “I gave or I have given,” may either mean that G-d placed the rainbow in the sky now or that He had done so much previously, in fact before the deluge, at the time of creation; but at that time there had not been a covenantal significance to that phenomenon.  There can be no doubt that the phenomenon of the rainbow as a symbol of the new relationship between man and G-d was meant to reassure man that there would not again be a deluge on earth. The word נתתי may be translated as “I have sworn.” When G-d bestows a gift upon people it is sufficient for Him to say so; there is no need for G-d to confirm this by an oath. We have proof of this when G-d promised the land of Canaan to Avraham and his descendants as an inheritance. He did not do so by swearing an oath; He simply said לזרעך נתתי את הארץ הזאת, “to your descendants I have given this land (Genesis 15,18).” When G-d refers to this gift on future occasions He refers to an oath (Numbers 14,23, Deut. 34,4 etc.) although we never find that He accompanied the promise with an oath. We may therefore understand the word נתתי, “I have given,” as “I have sworn. “This is also the reason why Isaiah 54, 9 could say כי מי נח זאת לי אשר נשבעתי, ”for this is for Me just like the waters of the time of Noach, concerning which I have sworn, etc.”  While it is true that some of our sages (Shevuot 36) have used this passage to prove that when the Torah quotes G-d as saying “no” twice in the same verse this is equivalent to an oath as the Torah writes in verse 11 ולא יכרת כל בשר עוד ממי המבול ולא יהיה עוד מבול לשחת הארץ “and all flesh will not again be destroyed by the waters of a deluge, nor will there be another deluge to destroy the earth,” the words of the Torah are like fire and may be divided into yielding many different meanings. You will observe that Onkelos translates the words (Genesis 15,18) “לזרעך נתתי as יהבית “I have given,” whereas in our verse he translates נתתי as “יהבית also. as “I have given.” Whereas in Genesis 15,18 G-d had only promised that He would give something to Avram’s descendants, we would have expected Him to say “I will give,” especially since, at the time, Avram did not yet have any descendants.” However, the point the Torah and Onkelos wanted to make was that when G-d promises someone a gift in the future the Torah describes it as if it had been given already as when G-d promises He will surely keep His promise.  We have a similar situation when Avraham purchased the cave of Machpelah from Efron in Genesis 23,13 where Avraham speaks of the money for that cave in these words: נתתי כסף השדה קח ממני, “I have given the money for the field, take it from me!” (actually Avraham had not yet “given: the money as yet). Onkelos therefore correctly translates the word נתתי when spoken by Avraham (a mortal human being) as אתן, “I am going to give.” This is so in spite of the fact that Avraham was already holding the money in his hands, and he had no intention of changing his mind.. However, there is a difference between a promise by a human being even someone of the calibre of Avraham and that of a promise by G-d. G-d does not go back on a promise; hence it may be described as if it had already been fulfilled. The lesson is that when the Torah speaks of something G-d will do in the past tense this merely confirms that the promise was unconditional.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>כי יקח איש אשה ובעלה, When a man takes (marries) a woman and lives with her;” The Torah speaks of two methods of acquiring the woman; 1) money or equivalent. 2) marital intercourse. Whenever the Torah speaks of כי יקח, the meaning is not that someone simply “takes,” but that he acquires something with money (or equivalent). Examples of the relationship between קיחה and money are already found when Avraham wanted to purchase the cave of Machpelah (Genesis 23,13) נתתי כסף השדה קח ממני, “I have deposited the money for the field, take it from me.” There is yet a third way in which one can acquire a woman, i.e. by means of a document. The Torah alludes to this in the very next verse when a divorce is discussed. Just as a document is required to dissolve the husband-wife relationship, otherwise the woman cannot be remarried, so a marriage may be concluded by means of such a document. The words ויצאה והיתה, “she leaves and she remarries” next to one another are understood as comparing the process of leaving a marriage to that of entering a marriage (compare Kidushin 5). We therefore have three ways in which a woman can be acquired as pointed out at the beginning of Tractate Kidushin.  The exegetical tool known as גזרה שוה, “identical expressions comparing different subject matter” is so strong that it enables the sages to treat as a capital crime violation of a law derived at only by a comparison of such wording. If a girl who has not been betrothed engages in sexual relations she is not sentenced to death by the court. If she had been betrothed only by receiving the equivalent of some money, she is considered as legally married for the purpose of being sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, even though she never lived with her betrothed. This shows that the גזרה שוה is an extremely powerful exegetical tool (compare Maimonides Hilchot Ishut 1,2 and the Talmud Kritut 5,1.) [In the Talmud there it is pointed out that although the subject of פגול, faulty intentions concerning the consumption of sacrifices, is a major part of the Torah, the penalty is arrived at only by means of a גזרה שוה. Ed.] All these ways of acquiring a woman have to be witnessed by two valid witnesses in order to be legal, although if the woman wants out of the marriage she may require a bill of divorce because her status had been in doubt (Maimonides Hilchot Ishut 4,6). [Witnesses to consummation of a marriage mean witnesses who testify that both parties had secreted themselves long enough for such consummation to be capable of having taken place. Ed.]</p>

This would justify the distant past mode of the word נתתי. “I had given.” The advanced kinds of plants had been assigned as food for man, the fruit of the trees, etc., whereas the more primitive plants, herbs and grass, had been assigned as food for the animals.</p>

              <p>נתתי, is in the future mode, as for instance when Avraham speaks of money in payment for the cave of Machpelah in Genesis 23,13, when he says “נתתי כסף השדה, “I have given the money for the field,” when the deal had not even been completed yet, and certainly no payment had been made. It is best to explain the formulation here as did Rav Saadyah gaon, when he said that G’d, in speaking of what had thus far been exclusively “My” rainbow, He would from this time on share with mankind, also reinforcing the rays of the sun as a blessing for man and the crops in the field. Every time rain would cease, and the rainbow would appear in the sky or on the horizon, man would be reminded of G’d’s promise not to bring on another deluge. The word נתתי in a distant past mode, actually emphasises that the phenomenon of the rainbow had existed already since the six days of creation. During the days of the deluge the rainbow had not appeared, first because the rains had been incessant, and at any rate, there was no one to appreciate it. Now, G’d promises that there would be a regular appearance of the rainbow after every rainfall. In Pessachim 54 the rainbow is listed as one of the phenomena created at dusk immediately before the original Sabbath, seeing there has not been anything new created after the 6 days of creation. The references to the rainbow have been repeated only in order to impress upon people’s minds that it is a powerful sign of G’d’s covenant.

There is an example of לו used in the sense of “perhaps”, — in our verse — “Perhaps he will hate us”, but there is no other example of its usage in this sense in Scripture. Here it corresponds in sense with the word אולי, “perhaps”, as for example in (Genesis 24:5) “אולי the woman will not be willing to follow me” which means “perhaps she will not etc.” As a matter of fact אולי has all the meanings of לו, for there are examples of אולי denoting a petition as for instance (2 Samuel 16:12) “Perhaps (אולי) the Lord will look upon mine eye”, (where the context shows that this involves a kind of petition that God should do this); (Joshua 14:12) “Perhaps (אולי) the Lord will be with me [and I shall drive them out]”, (involving also a petition that God should do this), where אולי has a similar meaning to לו in (Genesis 30:34) “Would (לו) it might be according to thy word”. Then again the word אולי has the meaning of “if”; for example, (Genesis 18:24) “Perhaps (אולי) there are fifty righteous [wilt Thou destroy etc.]” (which is equivalent to “if there are fifty… wilt thou destroy?”.)</p>

              <p>The Gemara asks: But there is the case of the betrothal of a woman, as it is written: “When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her” (Deuteronomy 24:1), and one derives betrothal through money by a verbal analogy of the term “taking” used here and “taking” from the case of the field of Ephron. And yet we learned in the mishna that Beit Hillel say one can betroth a woman with one peruta or with any item that is worth one peruta. If so, shall we say that Rav Asi, who claims that all sums of money mentioned in the Torah are in Tyrian coinage, stated his opinion in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai?</p>

              </summary>
              <p>The Gemara continues its explanation: And from where do we derive that betrothal is accomplished by means of giving money? It is derived by means of a verbal analogy between the term expressing taking stated with regard to betrothal and from the term expressing taking with regard to the field of Ephron. How so? It is written here, with regard to marriage: “When a man takes a woman” (Deuteronomy 24:1), and it is written there, concerning Abraham’s purchase of the field of the Cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite: “I will give money for the field; take it from me” (Genesis 23:13). This verbal analogy teaches that just as Ephron’s field was acquired with money, so too, a woman can be acquired with money.</p>

              <p>§ The Gemara notes: And a tanna cites the halakha that a woman can be betrothed with money from here, a different source. As it is taught in a baraita that when the verse states: “When a man takes a woman and engages in sexual intercourse with her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly matter in her, and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1), in this verse, the term taking is only with money. And so it says: “I will give money for the field; take it from me” (Genesis 23:13).</p>

              <p>“He spoke with them, saying: If you are willing to bury my dead from before me, heed me, and intercede for me with Ephron, son of Tzoḥar” (Genesis 23:8).  “He spoke with them, saying: If you are willing…[intercede [pigu] for me]” – prevail upon him for me, mediate on my behalf; and if that is not [sufficient], entreat him on my behalf. (The word pigu can connote all of these meanings.)  “Ephron was sitting among the children of Ḥet and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, of all those coming to his city gate, saying” (Genesis 23:10).  “Ephron was sitting [yoshev] among the children of Ḥet” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Yashav is written; (Yoshev, “was sitting,” is usually spelled with a vav, but here the vav is missing, so that the word could be read yashav, “he sat.” If the verse is saying that “he sat,” it means that at that point in the narrative he sat down among the children of Ḥet, meaning that he assumed a position of honor among them.)  on that day they appointed him chief officer [over them], so that there would not be [a situation in which] a person of great stature [Abraham] would be purchasing from a person of low stature.  “Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, [of all those coming to his city gate]” (The implication is that all the people of the city were present.)  – Rabbi Pinḥas said: This teaches that they all locked their doors and went out to show kindness towards Abraham [by attending Sarah’s funeral].  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave that is in it, I have given it to you; before the eyes of my people I have given it to you; bury your dead” (Genesis 23:11).  “He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: But if you please, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it from me, and I will bury my dead there” (Genesis 23:13).   “And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him” (Genesis 23:14).  “My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver, between me and you, what is it? Bury your dead” (Genesis 23:15).  “Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he spoke in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” (Genesis 23:16).  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave…My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: All the shekels that are stated in the Torah refer to sela’im; in the Prophets, litrin; (A litra being equal to twenty-five sela’im.)  and in the Writings, centenaria. (A centenarium being equal to one hundred sela’im.)  Rabbi Yudan said: The exception is the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. That is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth, and he does not know that diminishment will befall him” (Proverbs 28:22). “A greedy man rushes after wealth” – this refers to Ephron, who cast a greedy eye upon the wealth of the righteous man [Abraham]. (By demanding an exorbitant price for his field.)  “And he does not know that diminishment will befall him” – as the Torah diminished the letter vav from him. (Throughout the narrative, Ephron’s name is written with a vav, but here, where he overprices his field, his name is spelled without the vav. Thus, because of his greediness, diminishment befell him.)  That is what is written: “Abraham heeded Ephron and Abraham weighed for Ephron [the silver…]” – Ephron is written without a vav.  “Four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” – Rabbi Abba bar Bizna said: It was usable for all merchandise. (Abraham gave the highest quality of coin, acceptable to all merchants for all kinds of merchandise.) </p>

              <p>For there are times when the tzaddik’s light is obscured from a person and he does not merit understanding or seeing his [the tzaddik’s] great light. And even if he is by the tzaddik, he cannot taste, understand or see the tzaddik’s great light,  he can achieve the ultimate good. We find this in the case of Efron (Genesis 23:11-15). The site of the Makhpelah Cave is the gate of Gan Eden through which all souls ascend, and its light is very great. Even so, for him [Efron] it was a place of blackness and obscurity. This is why he very happily sold it to Avraham, as is taught (Zohar I, 128a).</p>

Onkelos suggests the land was worth that amount, while others argue that Ephron overcharged Abraham. Rashbam questions the significance of the price, while Sforno suggests it was a minor transaction. Rabbeinu Bahya highlights the righteous nature of Abraham in paying the full price, contrasting it with Ephron's greed.

              </summary>
              <p>ארץ ארבע מאות שקל כסף, “a piece of land worth four hundred silver shekel,” etc. This is the meaning of the words according to Onkelos.  Another meaning of these words could be that Efron suggested that either he or his ancestors had paid this sum of money for this piece of land. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 58,7 took the view that the piece of land in question was not worth anywhere near the price Efron was charging Avraham. This is why his name is suddenly (verse sixteen) spelled without the letter ו, to show that instead of becoming rich by overcharging Avraham, Efron became impoverished as a result of his greed. On the words ביני ובינך מה היא, “what is such a paltry sum between me and you,” the Midrash (Baba Metzia 86) says that the righteous promise little and perform in excess of what they promise. An example is Avraham who promised to serve his guests only a piece of bread, whereas he prepared a sumptuous feast (Genesis 18,8), instructing Sarah to bake cakes from the finest flour, while he himself ran to the stables to prepare the best calves for the meal. The wicked, on the other hand, promise a lot and do not keep any of it, such as Efron who kept speaking about what he was going “to give” to Avraham whereas when it came to the conclusion of the transaction he overcharged him. The Torah testified that Avraham paid him in hard cash, the price being exorbitant. As proof of the miserly and avaricious attitude of Efron the sages in the Talmud draw our attention to the numerical value of the name עפרון which the Torah abbreviated to עפרן when it became clear that he did not give Avraham anything. The remaining letters in his name amount to 400, the same as the numerical value of the letters in the expression רע עין, grudging, envious. Avraham did not want to accept any gifts from him but to pay full value, בכסף מלא, as is the custom of righteous people. We find that King David (Samuel II chapter 24) also did not want to accept any gifts and paid handsomely for the threshing ground of Aravnah the Jebusite, although offered the site plus animals to serve as sacrifices as well the animals’ yokes to serve as fire-wood. David paid 50 shekels for the threshing ground plus the animals and their yokes as he did not want to appear cheap in the eyes of G’d (Samuel II 24,24).</p>

              <p>LAND OF FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER. According to Onkelos’ opinion, the intent of this is that the land was so worth, [since he translated, “land worth four hundred shekels of silver.”] Perhaps it was Ephron’s intent to say that the price of the land was so fixed in that place for it was customary in most lands that the price of a field be fixed in accordance with its dimensions. In the words of our Rabbis, (Bereshith Rabbah 58:9.)  however, Ephron set an exorbitant arbitrary price, and Abraham, out of the willingness of his heart, listened and did according to his will, and magnified himself. (Daniel 8:4. A reference to the Midrash (ibid.) which says that Abraham gave Ephron shekels of large size.)  If we follow the simple interpretation of Scripture, land of four hundred shekels of silver means that either Ephron bought it for that price, or it was so purchased by his forefathers.</p>

    Our sages understood Efron as having greatly overcharged Avraham, and they describe Efron as an individual who says a lot, but falls far short in his performance of what he promised.
    According to Rabbi Meir, (Maha’ram from Rotenburg) Efron had never meant to give Avraham more than the cave for free, a promise he kept. He only charged Avraham for the field, seeing that it did not appear as proper to acquire only the cave.
    Nachmanides, following the plain text, writes that the words ארבע מאות שקל כסף,” 400 silver shekel,” refer to the price either Efron himself or his forebears had paid when they had bought the field originally.”

              <p>“He spoke with them, saying: If you are willing to bury my dead from before me, heed me, and intercede for me with Ephron, son of Tzoḥar” (Genesis 23:8).  “He spoke with them, saying: If you are willing…[intercede [pigu] for me]” – prevail upon him for me, mediate on my behalf; and if that is not [sufficient], entreat him on my behalf. (The word pigu can connote all of these meanings.)  “Ephron was sitting among the children of Ḥet and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, of all those coming to his city gate, saying” (Genesis 23:10).  “Ephron was sitting [yoshev] among the children of Ḥet” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Yashav is written; (Yoshev, “was sitting,” is usually spelled with a vav, but here the vav is missing, so that the word could be read yashav, “he sat.” If the verse is saying that “he sat,” it means that at that point in the narrative he sat down among the children of Ḥet, meaning that he assumed a position of honor among them.)  on that day they appointed him chief officer [over them], so that there would not be [a situation in which] a person of great stature [Abraham] would be purchasing from a person of low stature.  “Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, [of all those coming to his city gate]” (The implication is that all the people of the city were present.)  – Rabbi Pinḥas said: This teaches that they all locked their doors and went out to show kindness towards Abraham [by attending Sarah’s funeral].  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave that is in it, I have given it to you; before the eyes of my people I have given it to you; bury your dead” (Genesis 23:11).  “He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: But if you please, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it from me, and I will bury my dead there” (Genesis 23:13).   “And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him” (Genesis 23:14).  “My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver, between me and you, what is it? Bury your dead” (Genesis 23:15).  “Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he spoke in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” (Genesis 23:16).  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave…My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: All the shekels that are stated in the Torah refer to sela’im; in the Prophets, litrin; (A litra being equal to twenty-five sela’im.)  and in the Writings, centenaria. (A centenarium being equal to one hundred sela’im.)  Rabbi Yudan said: The exception is the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. That is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth, and he does not know that diminishment will befall him” (Proverbs 28:22). “A greedy man rushes after wealth” – this refers to Ephron, who cast a greedy eye upon the wealth of the righteous man [Abraham]. (By demanding an exorbitant price for his field.)  “And he does not know that diminishment will befall him” – as the Torah diminished the letter vav from him. (Throughout the narrative, Ephron’s name is written with a vav, but here, where he overprices his field, his name is spelled without the vav. Thus, because of his greediness, diminishment befell him.)  That is what is written: “Abraham heeded Ephron and Abraham weighed for Ephron [the silver…]” – Ephron is written without a vav.  “Four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” – Rabbi Abba bar Bizna said: It was usable for all merchandise. (Abraham gave the highest quality of coin, acceptable to all merchants for all kinds of merchandise.) </p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22): AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH. This was Ephron the Hittite. (See above, Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; and the parallels listed there; below, Tanh. (Buber), Deut. 4:4.)  When Abraham's wife Sarah died, Abraham went to Ephron for him to sell him the cave. Ephron said to him: Give me its price. He said to him (in Gen. 23:15): WHAT IS A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER BETWEEN YOU AND ME? SO BURY YOUR DEAD. Abraham began piling up the silver for Ephron, as stated (in Gen. 23:16): SO ABRAHAM HEEDED EPHRON, AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE SILVER FOR EPHRON…. Ben Ma'ma said: Although R. Hanina has said: All the shekels in the Torah are sela'im, these &lt; shekels &gt; are an exception, since they are centenaria. (The word is Latin. One centenarium was worth 100,000 sesterces. According to a fourth-century inscription of northern Africa, a centenarium was a hundred pieces (e.g., of gold). See A. Souter, A Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A.D.

When Ephron saw the silver, he moved quickly and was persuaded, as stated (in Gen. 23:6): BURY YOUR DEAD IN THE CHOICEST OF OUR TOMBS. The Holy One said to him: You have moved quickly after money. (Prov. 28:22): AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter. (Prov. 28:22, cont.): AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY (HSR) WILL COME TO HIM. And what was his loss (rt.: HSR)? R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: Every EPHRON which is written here &lt; in Scripture &gt;, before he took the silver from Abraham, is written plene as 'PRWN (i.e., with the vowel O represented by the Hebrew consonant W); but this &lt; usage &gt; (in Gen. 23:6) is deficient (HSR): AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE SILVER FOR EPHRON ('PRN).

              </summary>
              <p>(Lev. 25:14:) “When you sell property to your kinsman.” This text is related (to Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth, [and he does not know that loss will come to him].” This verse speaks about many people. “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth.” This was Cain. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “You moved quickly to inherit the world. By your life, you shall have a loss [in the matter].” Ergo (in Prov. 28:22), “and he does not know that loss will come to him.” And what happened to him? That he wandered about the world, as stated (in Gen. 4:12), “you shall become a ceaseless wanderer on the earth.” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This was Ephron the Hittite. (See Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; and the parallels listed there; and Tanh. (Buber), Deut. 4:4.)  When Abraham's wife Sarah died, Abraham went to Ephron for him to sell him the cave. Ephron said to him, “Give me its price.” He said to him (in Gen. 23:15), “What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between you and me?” Abraham began piling up the silver for Ephron, as stated (in Gen. 23:16), “So Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed out […].” Ben Ma'ma said, “Although R. Hanina has said, ‘All the shekels in the Torah are sela'im,’ these [shekels] are an exception, since they are centenaria. (The word is Latin. One centenarium was worth 100,000 sesterces. According to a fourth-century inscription of northern Africa, a centenarium was a hundred pieces (e.g., of gold). See A. Souter, A Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A.D. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1957).)  [So it was] four hundred centenaria [that] Abraham piled up before Ephron.” When Ephron saw the silver, he moved quickly and hastily, as stated (in Gen. 23:6), “bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You have moved quickly after money. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” And what was his loss? R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said, “Every [mention of] Ephron which is written here [in Scripture], before he took the silver from Abraham, is written plene as 'prwn (i.e., with the vowel o represented by the Hebrew consonant w); but this [usage] (in Gen. 23:16) is deficient (hsr), ‘and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron ('prn). It is written with the w missing (hsr).” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This is the one who lends at interest, because he is anxious to become wealthy. He lends in order to receive interest from the borrower and becomes wealthy from the interest. But a curse is given through his riches, as stated (ibid., cont.), “and he does not know that loss will come to him.” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This represents those who engage in business in the sabbatical year, in that they move quickly to become rich. They do not observe the sabbatical year, and think they will become rich. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” Since he did not observe the sabbatical year, the curse began entering into his money, and he sells [all that he had]. What is written above the matter (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord.” And after that it is written (in vs. 14), “When you sell property.” R. Eleazar Haqappar said, “It is written (in Cant. 5:15), ‘His legs are pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold.’ This column has a capital above and a pedestal (Gk.: basis.)  below.” (See Lev. R. 25:8.)  R. Samuel ben Guriah said, “You have no section in the Torah which does not have a capital above and a pedestal below. (The parallel in Lev. R. 25:8 explains that each section can be expounded with reference to what precedes and follows it.)  What is written above of the matter (in Lev. 25:1-2)? ‘Then the Lord spoke unto Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, “Speak unto the Children of Israel [….] ‘the land shall observe [a Sabbath for the Lord].’”’ Then after that [comes] the section on the jubilee (in vs. 8), ‘And you shall count seven [Sabbaths of years].’ If one has not observed the sabbatical year and the jubilee, or [even] one of them, in the end, I will make it that he will sell his land, [as stated] (in vs. 14), ‘When you sell property to your kinsman.’ (T’Arakh. 5:9; below, 9:8.)  [If] he repents, [all] is well; but if not, he will end up selling his field, as stated (in vs. 25), ‘When your relative becomes poor and sells some of his property.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up selling his house, as stated (in vs. 29), ‘And when someone sells a dwelling house.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up going around [begging] at doorways, as stated (in vs. 35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor [… you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you].’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to you, as stated (in vs. 39), ‘And when your relative becomes poor] near you and is sold to you.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to the gentiles, as stated (in vs. 47), ‘And when a foreigner and a sojourner near you becomes wealthy, [while your relative near him becomes poor and is sold to a sojourning foreigner near you….].’ Now it is not merely the individual himself [at issue here], but that person and all Israel; for so you find in the days of Jeremiah, because they profaned the sabbatical year, they were sold to the gentiles, as stated (in II Chron. 36:17-18), ‘So He brought up the king of the Chaldeans upon them [….] And all the vessels of the house of God […] and the treasures of the house of the Lord […].’ Behold the case of [all] Israel.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “See how they will be sold to the gentiles because they profaned the sabbatical year.” He said to him, “Master of the world, did You not say this (in Lev. 25:35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you, [you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you]?’ Fulfill what You said to them and called them, ‘My relatives (ah) and friends,’ as stated (in Ps. 122:8), ‘For the sake of My relatives (ah) and friends’: (Lev. 25:35:) ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you,’ [i.e.,] when their strength fails before Nebuchadnezzar, the Divine Presence, as it were, will be with them. It is so stated (in Is. 43:14), ‘for your sake I have sent to Babylon.’ (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘You shall maintain (literally, hold on to) him.’ Hold them (i.e., Israel), lest they perish. But how? (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘As a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you.’ Although they became foreigners and sojourners in Babylon, if You do not give them grace, they will perish, [so just] ‘let him live near You.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Because of their sins I have sold My house to the Chaldeans.” It is so stated (in Lev. 25:29), “And when someone sells a dwelling house.” This is the house of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Ps. 132:13), “For the Lord has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling.” And what happened [to it]? (II Kings 25:9 = Jer. 52:13:) And he burned the house of the Lord [...].” (Lev. 25:29, cont.:) “A walled city.” This is the city of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated] (in II Chron. 36:19), “and they broke down the wall of Jerusalem […].” That is what the Holy One, blessed be He, says (in Lev. 25:47), “And when a foreigner and a sojourner [near you] becomes wealthy.” This wealthy foreigner is Nebuchadnezzar, and this sojourner is the Median Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “And is sold to a sojourning foreigner.” This [sojourning foreigner] is the Greek Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “Or to a foreigner's family.” This is the Edomite Empire (i.e., Rome). Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, why were they sold to these empires?” He said to him, “Because they profaned the sabbatical year.” It is so stated (in II Chron. 36:20–21), “Then he carried off unto Babylon those left from the sword,” and the end of the Scripture is “[until the land made up] its Sabbaths; as long as it lay desolate, it observed Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses at the end of all of these sections, “Is it your wish that they do not go into exile? [Then] warn them concerning the sabbatical years and the jubilees.” That is what He has said at the end of all the sections (in Lev. 26:2), “You shall observe My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord.” What is the meaning of “I am the Lord?” I am the one who is going to give you a good reward, if you observe them; but if not, I am going to exact retribution from them through the Empires. Therefore, say to them to be careful about the sabbatical year. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord,” so that they do not attain [the punishments in] those sections written below (in Lev. 26:14-45). (Lev. 25:14:) “When you sell property to your kinsman or buy from your neighbor's hand, do not deceive.” [Thus] you shall not deceive one another. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “For I also sold the whole world to Abraham and did not deceive him. He [then went back and sold it to Me,” as stated (Genesis 14:19), “the Buyer (Qoneh. A more traditional rendering of this word here would be MAKER.)  of heaven and earth.” When? When Abraham observed the commandments of the Holy One, blessed be He. Before the Torah was given to Israel, our father Abraham kept it [and observed all the commandments that are in the Torah]. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Alexandra, “Abraham even observed the [rabbinic precept of] eruvim of cooked foods.” (See Tanh. (Buber), Gen. 3:1, and the notes there.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5), “Because ('qb 'shr) Abraham heeded [My voice and kept My charge: My commandments, My statutes, and My Torahs].” What is the meaning of 'qb? (Gen. R. 95:3; Cant. R. 5:16:1; PR 21:12; cf. Ned. 32a.)  R. Simeon ben Laqish said, “At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He.” (So also Numb. R. 18:21. According to other traditions Abraham recognized his creator at the age of forty-eight (Gen. R. 30:8; 46:2; Cant. R. 5:16:1), at the age of fifty (PR 21:12), or at the age of one (Gen. R. 95:3).)  How is this shown? 'Qb is a number. (I.e., 'ayin) is seventy, q (i.e., qof) is one hundred, [and] b (i.e., bet) is two, for a total of one hundred seventy-two. Now (according to Gen. 25:7) Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five [years]. Deduct from them. [The result is] three, when he was little. Ergo, at the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He. When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw how Abraham loved the commandments, He began buying heavenly and earthly [places] for him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19), “Blessed be Abram of God most high, Buyer of heaven and earth.” So also it says (Gen. 13:15), “For all the land (or earth) which you see, to you I will give it.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “All the world is wholly Mine; and I bought it for Abraham, because he has observed My commandments. But you, through your sins, have caused him to be [like] an alien who rents a house from its owners, for so Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 14:8), ‘why are you like a foreigner in the land […]?’ When you sinned before Me, I sold you, as stated (in Ps. 44:13), ‘You shall sell Your people for no money […].’ For that reason, if someone has to sell a house, a field, or [some] article, you shall not deceive one another.” It is therefore written (in Lev. 25:14), “shall not deceive his brother.” (Lev. 25:15-18:) “According to the years after the jubilee […]. According to the multitude of years, you shall increase […]. A man shall not deceive his brother […]. So you shall carry out my statutes and judgements.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Just as I sold my people and returned again to reinstate them, as stated (Jer. 3:14), ‘”Turn back, faithless children,” says the Lord; “for I am a master to you.”’ It is also written (in Is. 52:3), ‘For thus says the Lord, “You were sold for free, and you shall be redeemed for no money.”’ So too you should not sell the land absolutely, as stated (in Lev. 25:23), ‘[it] shall not be sold permanently.’ The Land [of Israel] is dear to me because I have made it holier than all the [other] lands in the world.” You yourself know, when the Land of Israel was distributed to the tribes, it did not pass from tribe to tribe. Rather [it was distributed] to each tribe separately. You yourself know. Look at how many lawsuits the daughters of Zelophehad brought, so that their inheritance would not pass from one tribe to another. Moreover the Holy One, blessed be He, conceded to their words, as stated (in Numb. 27:7), “The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right.” (Numb. 36:9:) “Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another.” Therefore, if a redeemer is found for it, fine; but if not, whoever buys it acquires it until the jubilee. Then on the jubilee he releases it. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:41), “Then he shall depart from you, he and his children with him and he shall return to his family.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “When the year of the redemption draws near, I will redeem you, as stated (in Is. 63:4), ‘For a day of vengeance was in My heart, but there came My year of redemption.’”</p>

              <p>(Numb. 21:34:) “But the Lord God said unto Moses, ‘Do not fear him.’” This text is related (to Prov. 28:14), “Fortunate is the one who is always afraid […].” Such is the nature of the righteous. Although the Holy One, blessed be He, assures them, they do not cast off fear. And so it is written about Jacob (in Gen. 32:8]), “And Jacob was [greatly] afraid.” Why was he afraid? He said, “Perhaps I was tainted by something at Laban's,” since it is written (in Deut. 23:15), “so [the Lord] is not to see anything indecent among you and turn away from you.” Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, may have forsaken me. Moses also acquired fear in the manner of his ancestor. Why was he afraid? He said, “Perhaps Israel sinned in the war with Sihon or became tainted by a transgression.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (in Numb. 34:21), “’Do not fear,’ as they all fulfilled [their actions] with justice. ‘Do not fear him,’ [even though] a warrior more formidable than himself has never arisen in the world [since his time].” Thus it is stated (in Deut. 3:11), “For only Og King of Bashan was left over from the remaining Rephaim.” (According to Deut. 2:11, 20-21, together with Numb. 13:33, the Rephaim were a race of giants.)  Now he had been left from the warriors whom Amraphel and his colleagues (Gen. 14:1, 9) had slain, as stated (in Gen. 14:5), “and they smote the Rephaim […].” But this [man] was their refuse, like olive pits that come out as survivors from the bottom of the oil press. It is so stated (in Gen. 14:13), “Then the survivor came and told Abram (about Lot's capture).” This was Og. And here [Scripture] made him into leftovers, as stated (in Josh. 13:12), “he was left over from the remaining Rephaim.” It was his intention that Abraham would go out [to war] and be killed. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave him a reward for [what] his feet had earned [for the good that ended up resulting]; in that he lived all those years until he fell at the hand of [Abraham's] children. When Moses came to wage war with him, he was afraid of him. He said, “I am a hundred and twenty years old, while he is five hundred years old.” If he did not have merit, he would not have lived all these years. The Holy One, blessed be He, said (in Numb. 21:34 = Deut. 3:2:) “Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand,’ you with your hand shall kill him, (Numb. 21:34 = Deut. 3:2, cont.) ‘and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon….’” (Deut. 3:6:) “And we shall utterly destroy it […].” But is it not written (in Deut. 3:7), “But all the cattle and the booty of the towns we took as booty for ourselves?” It is simply that they utterly destroyed their bodies, so as not to benefit from any of them at all. (Numb. 21:35:) “So they smote him, his sons [and all his people].” The written text (ketiv) [reads] “his son,” (Cf. a similar verse about Sihon, Deut. 2:33, where HIS SON is the undoubted reading.)  because he had a son more formidable than himself. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “In this world you destroy the nations little by little, but in the world to come, I will remove them from the world at a single stroke. It is so stated (in Is. 33:12), “And the people shall become burnings of lime, thorns cut down that are burned in the fire.” Amen, may it be His will!</p>

                <h4>Midrash Tanchuma, Re'eh 10:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(Deut. 14:22:) “You shall surely tithe.” This text is related (to Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person (i.e., a miser) moves quickly after wealth; [and he does not know that loss will come to him].” R. Hanina interpreted the verse with reference to Ephron (of Gen. 23). (Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; Lev. 9:1; Gen. R. 58:7; Exod. R. 31:17; PRK 10:1; see also BM 87a. Cf. above, Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:13, which identifies the man with Cain.)  For R. Hanina said, “All the shekels mentioned in the Torah are sela, those in the prophets are litrai, (The Greek word means “pounds.”)  and those in the writings are centenarii, (The Latin word denotes weights of a hundred pounds.)  except for the shekels of Ephron, which are not centenarii. (For this valuation of the shekel, see yQid. 1:3 (59d), 5 (60c); Bekh. 50a; PR 1:4.)  This is what is written (in Gen. 23:9), ‘let him give it to me at the full price.’” Because he brought the evil eye (of greed) into Abraham's wealth, the written text lacks the letter waw. This is what is written (in Gen. 23:15), “My lord, listen to me, what is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between you and me?” He said to him, “If you want to give me four hundred centenarii of silver from the goods of your house, you can give it to me.” Because he brought in an evil eye (i.e., of greed) into Abraham's wealth, [his name] is lacking the letter waw, where it is stated (in Gen. 23:16), “So Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron. It is the second Ephron that is written deficient. R. [Ammi] interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to one who borrows a cow. Since he was too miserly to rent two cows, he borrowed one and rented one. And (according to Prov. 28:22) “he does not know that loss will come to him”; that it is written (in Exod. 22:13), “[When someone borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies,] and its owner is not with it, he shall surely pay.” R. Isaac interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to the one who lends to an Israelite at interest and is too miserly to lend it without interest, and (Prov. 8:22) “he does not know that loss will come to him”; that it is written (in Prov. 28:8), “The one who augments his wealth by interest and usury amasses it for one who is generous to the poor.” Who is the one that is generous to the poor? This is Esau the wicked. Is Esau the wicked generous to the poor? Rather does he not oppress the poor? He is like those procurators who go out to the villages and plunder tenants. Then they go back to the capital and say, “Gather the poor, because we want to perform a good act for them.” The [Aramaic] adage says, “[She commits adultery] for apples, and distributes [them] to the sick.” R. Levi interpreted the verse (i.e., Prov. 28:22) with reference to the person who does not take out his tithes properly. To this end R. Levi told a story about someone who did take out his tithes properly: Now he had a certain field that produced a thousand measures every year. So he took a hundred measures from it for his tithes; and from the remainder he and the children of his household sustained themselves all of his days. At the time of his death, he summoned his son. He said to him, “My son, give your attention to this field. It yields such and such [a number of] measures, and I take out such and such a tithe. From it I have sustained myself and my household all my days.” When that son planted it the first year, it produced a thousand measures, and he took out a hundred measures from it for the tithe. For the second year, an evil eye (i.e., of greed) entered within him. So he subtracted ten [measures from the tithe], but [the field] subtracted one hundred [measures from its yield]. Similarly also [on the third, fourth, and fifth [years], until it was reduced to its tithes. When kinfolk and friends saw [what was happening], they put on white (i.e., festive) [tunics] and wrapped themselves in white [mantles]. [When] they came to him, he said to them, “Why have you come? To rejoice over the very one who has been excommunicated [by the Heavens]?” They said to him, “God forbid! We have only come to rejoice with you. In the past you were the owner of the house, and the Holy One, blessed be He, was the priest; but now the Holy One, blessed be He, has become the owner of the house, and you are the priest.” For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22), “You shall surely tithe.”</p>

            <summary>Abraham used both the expression of &quot;gift&quot; and &quot;sale&quot; when acquiring the cave to protect his claim under Jewish law, including דין חליפין. The use of the word &quot;shekel&quot; in the transaction with Efron was defined as קנטרין, a coin weighing four times the usual weight. Abraham ensured the presence and consent of the local populace to act as his broker, preventing any future claims under דין המצר.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>There was also the concern that landowners of the adjoining property could claim that the land should have been sold to them in preference to an outsider, something known in Jewish law as דין המצר. Another consideration of Abraham was that after the transfer of the cave someone might present a lien dated prior to the transaction which would require him to give up his claim. For all these reasons Abraham used both the expression of &quot;gift&quot; and &quot;sale&quot; when referring to the way he wanted to acquire the cave. This would protect his claim also under the heading of what is known in Jewish law as דין חליפין, i.e. acquisition by means of a symbolic transfer. Under this heading there is no such law as אונאה, reversal of the sale due to unfair pricing. This דין חליפין applies to transactions involving either real estate or chattels whereas such acquisition by a symbol representing the ultimate object does not apply to money, i.e. coins. Hence Abraham's reference to receiving the land as a gift. Our sages in Bechorot 50 phrased it thus: Rabbi Chaninah stated that every time the word &quot;כסף&quot; i.e. silver or money appears in the Torah, the meaning is &quot;סלעים&quot;, 25 silver coins of a standard denomination; the exception is the use of the word &quot;shekel&quot; in connection with the transaction involving Abraham and Efron. In that instance the meaning is קנטרין, a coin weighing four times the usual weight of the &quot;shekel.&quot; This is the meaning of the Torah (Genesis 23,15) defining the &quot;shekel&quot; as being &quot;four hundred shekel acceptable at any merchant.&quot; The fact that Efron arbitrarily changed the usual definition of the value of the &quot;shekel,&quot; made the transaction unassailable in the future seeing he himself had set the terms of the sale. Concerning Abraham's fear that the דין מצר might be invoked by a neighbour in the future, Abraham ensured the presence and consent of all the local populace who would jointly act as his broker in the transaction. This would preclude any claim at a later date. It also demonstrated that there was no outstanding lien against the property as any such lienholder should have spoken up at that time, seeing he was present.</p>

            <summary>The principle that the wicked say much and do not do even a little is derived from Ephron, who initially offered a piece of land to Abraham for free but ultimately accepted payment. In contrast, the righteous, like Abraham, say little and do a lot, as seen when Abraham offered bread to angels but then prepared three bulls and nine measures of fine flour for them. Even God exemplifies this principle by using only two letters to speak of judgment but employing seventy-two letters to repay Israel's enemies.</summary>

                <h4>Avot DeRabbi Natan 13:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Say little and do a lot. How so? This teaches us that the righteous say little and do a lot, but the wicked say a lot and don’t do anything at all. And how do we know that the righteous say little and do a lot? For this is what we find with Abraham our forefather, who said to the angels, “Have a piece of bread with me today,” as it says (Genesis 18:5), “I will get a piece of bread, and you can dine to your heart’s content.” But then after that, look at what Abraham did for the angels who serve God! He went and prepared three bulls and nine measures of fine flour for them! And how do we know that he prepared nine measures of fine flour? Because it says (Genesis 18:6), “Abraham hurried into the tent, to Sarah, and said: Hurry! Three measures of fine flour! The word three refers to the first three [measures], the word fine brings it to six, and the word flour makes nine. And how do we know that he prepared three bulls for them? Because it says (Genesis 18:7), “Abraham ran to the cattle [and selected a good, tender calf].” Cattle is one [bull]. Calf is two. Tender is three. (And some say that good was four.) “Then he gave it to the boy, who hurried to prepare it.” That is, he gave it to Ishmael, in order to train him in performing the mitzvot. Even the Holy Blessed One said little and did a lot, as it says (Genesis 15:13–14), “[God] said to Abram: Know well that your offspring will be strangers in a land not their own, and they shall be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years. But I will judge the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall go out with great wealth.” God spoke of this judgment with only the two letters dalet and nun, which spell the word dan (judge). But when the time came to pay back the enemies of Israel, God used seventy-two letters to do it, as it says (Deuteronomy 4:34), “Or has any god attempted to come and take one nation out from another, with great acts, signs, and wonders, and with awesome power?” From this you learn that when the enemies of Israel were made to pay for what they had done, they paid with seventy-two letters. And how do we know that the wicked say a lot and don’t do anything at all? For this is what we find with Ephron, who said to Abraham (Genesis 23:15), “A piece of land worth four hundred pieces of silver; [what is that between you and me?]” [as if he was willing to give away the land for free]. But in the end, when Abraham went to give him the payment, it says, “Abraham understood Ephron, and paid him the money” [and he simply accepted it].</p>

              </summary>
              <p>From where do we derive this principle that the wicked say much and do not do even a little? We derive it from Ephron. Initially, it is written that Ephron said to Abraham: “A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you?” (Genesis 23:15). And ultimately it is written: “And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant” (Genesis 23:16), i.e., shekels that could be used in any location. This teaches that not only did Ephron take shekels from Abraham, he took from him only centenaria [kantarei], i.e., superior coins, as there is a place where they call a shekel a centenarius.</p>

Halakhah details the retroactive effect of a betrothal conditioned on a larger sum, with specific rules for validity and pending status. Jewish Thought contrasts Abraham's spiritual growth with Moses' concerns for justice and limitations, highlighting their different approaches. Kabbalah discusses the incomplete generosity of the wicked, using examples from Efron and Abimelech. Midrash references various biblical figures like Ephron, Balaam, and Abraham to discuss greed, consequences, and proper observance. The Talmud contrasts the actions of the wicked and the righteous, exemplified by Ephron and Abraham, while explaining the varying value of coins mentioned in scripture. Lastly, Targum recounts Abraham's payment to Ephron in negotiable currency for the burial cave.</summary>

              <p>וישקל אברהם לעפרן:  The name עפרן is missing a 'ו'. The Ba'al Haturim explains that he had an evil eye, and the name of עפרן without a 'ו' adds in gematria to ר״ע עי״ן (evil eye).  The reason for this comes from a statement in Bava Batra (9B) which states that whoever gives a coin to a poor person is blessed with 6 blessings, and whoever is stingy with the poor is not blessed with these 6 blessings.  It is for this reason that Efron lost his  'ו' (which has the numerical value of 6) - as he was stingy he lost 6 blessings.  Our sages also tell us (Sotah 36B) that we give the glass of blessing to a generous spirit, as the verse states טוב עין הוא יבורך (with a 'ו') - Don't read 'he is blessed', but rather 'he will bless'.  Both the literal reading and the way it is read are true - someone who blesses others generously will be blessed with the six blessings (as depicted by the 'ו' in יבורך).</p>

The first is Efron who was stingy and therefore took 400 Silver shekels. The second place relates to the brothers of Joseph had a bad view of Josef the righteous and they were jealous of him because of the coat of many colours.  The result of this was that the Jewish people were exiled for 400 years as strangers, affliction and servitude.  The third place relates to Esau who had a bad view of his brothers, and he was jealous of him because of the blessings which Isaac blessed Jacob.  It is for this reason that Jacob placed a space between each flock to fill the eyes of that evil man (that was to be given to Esau), because he came with 400 men. The fourth place relates to Naval, because he was a stingy man.  It was for this reason that David approached him with 400 men.</p>

It is almost certain that this silver was not in the form of minted coins; it was more likely a collection of metal pieces whose value was determined by weight. Abraham surprised Efron, who expected him to suggest a much lower price, after which the negotiations would continue until the two sides agreed upon a compromise sum. However, Abraham chose to refrain from the formal method of purchase, and instead immediately paid the entire sum, which was four hundred shekels of pure, choice silver, ready currency that would be accepted by anyone in the world.</p>

In the third millenium BCE one finds this unit of weight in Babylonia. Sixty Babylonian shekels were a maneh.

The shekel as a unit of weight for gold is first mentioned in Jewish sources in Genesis 24:22 and Joshua 7:21. In Genesis 23:16 one finds mention of the shekel as a unit of weight for silver.)  When the condition is fulfilled the betrothal will take effect retroactively even if he did not say “from now.” For anyone who says al menath it is as if he had said “from now.” Yet if she accepts betrothal from another before the conditions are fulfilled and afterwards the conditions were fulfilled, the betrothal of the second man is void. But if he said to her “on the condition that I will give to you a maneh within 30 days,” if he gave it to her within the thirty days behold it is a betrothal retroactively; if he did not give it within thirty days she is not betrothed, and if she accepts betrothal from another man during the thirty days she is betrothed but she is not betrothed (i.e., this is a pending situation.)  until thirty days.

His time in Egypt, where he portrayed Sarah as his sister, showed his reliance on human intellect and effort before God's intervention. After separating from Lot, Abraham's spiritual growth was evident in his defeat of four kings and his refusal of material wealth from the king of Sodom. In contrast, Moses, in response to the Israelites' complaints, sought help from God and later asked to be relieved of his leadership role, showing his concern for justice and his own limitations. Despite God's displeasure, He redistributed spiritual power among Moses and the seventy elders to demonstrate that the task was not beyond Moses' capabilities.</summary>

                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 16:1:27</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>According to Bereshit Rabbah 39, Abraham reportedly said to G-d, &quot;Did not Noach become the founding father of seventy nations?&quot; G-d however, replied that the nation of which it would be said &quot;Who is such a great nation?&quot; (Deut 4,7) will be descended from Abraham. The need to state that those who curse Abraham will be cursed, is ample proof of his erstwhile unpopularity, and of the fact that Abraham had to suffer greatly for his beliefs. Henceforth, however, his detractors would be cursed, and he himself would be visibly blessed. In fact, his very existence would promote blessings for the rest of mankind. (4) Abraham departed Ur Kasdim and Charan, thereby fulfilling G-d’s command. By retaining his wife and nephew however, the separation from his &quot;birthplace&quot; and &quot;father's house&quot; was less than complete. Also, he was careful to take along his material wealth. He not only did not protest the company of Lot etc., but he actively solicited that company, i.e. vayikach, he took. (5) This is why the Torah mentions the presence of those people three times. Abraham proceeded unimpeded until Shechem, notwithstanding the fact that the Canaanite was at that time in the process of driving the Semites out of the country. In such troubled times, a newcomer like Abraham could have expected to suffer at the hands of both adversaries in the struggle for possession of that country. (6) At that time, G-d promised Abraham that the present turmoil would not produce permanent ownership of that land by the Canaanites, but that this land would ultimately belong to a nation yet to be founded by Abraham. In fact, had it not been for the conquest by the Canaanites, taking the land from the Semites and giving it to one family, i.e. the descendants of Abraham, would have been difficult to justify. Gittin 38 explains the justification for Israel's conquest of the land of Sichon and Og in a similar fashion, i.e. the illegal conquest of most of Ammon and Moab by Sichon and Og had paved the way for Israel dispossessing Sichon and Og eventually (in a war started by Sichon). (7) In response to that promise by G-d, Abraham built an altar, but could not very well proclaim his true belief in G-d and call for others to follow him until near Bet El; he settled down in a peaceful atmosphere. Proclaiming the sovereignty of G-d there would be more likely to produce positive results, away from the turmoil of war in other parts of the country. (8) Perhaps because he was still in the company of Lot and other less idealistically inspired fellow travellers, as well as lacking the benefits of circumcision, he decided to ride out the famine in Canaan in neighbouring Egypt. For that reason, he may not have received direct guidance from G-d on the subject. Probably, Abraham considered the certainty of impoverishment, animosity, and likely attack by surrounding tribes, as outweighing the possible dangers in Egypt. Jacob was moved by similar considerations when he complained about his sons' delay in travelling to Egypt to secure a food supply. The appearance of being affluent was in itself capable of inviting attack from those less fortunate (Genesis 42). Similarly, the four outcasts in Kings II Chapter 7 considered any chance of survival in the enemy camp as offering a better chance than certain death by famine in the city or in their primitive place of refuge. No doubt, Abraham had instructed Sarah to assume this brother/sister relationship even before they arrived in Egypt, since he could not reasonably have expected the Egyptians to make enquiries about Sarah's marital status. Surely, the normal thing was for a man to travel with his wife. (9+10+11) Therefore, the brother/sister relationship had to be demonstrated at the outset, so as to prevent any danger to Abraham. He assumed that either his goodwill would be sought actively, i.e. &quot;so that I shall benefit on your account,&quot; or that at the very least his survival would be assured i.e. &quot;I shall remain alive on your account.&quot; David's conduct in Gat (Samuel I Chapter 22) was motivated by the same considerations. In view of the fact that the Egyptians would most likely react to Sarah's physical beauty, Abraham referred to the fact of her beauty as something that had, of course, been known to him for a long time, but not until then had it been a factor to be considered in their public behavior. (12) He also realized that in the event of his own death, Sarah would consider her own survival under such circumstances as a fate worse than death. Therefore, the entire household maintained the fiction of Abraham and Sarah being brother and sister, so that when Pharaoh later said, &quot;She also said he is my brother,&quot; he meant that Sarah had only confirmed the facts which he had already ascertained. There could not therefore be a question of him having stolen another man's wife. The Torah testifies that there had in fact been no need to deny the husband/wife relationship in order to protect themselves against Pharaoh. After Abraham had used all the intellectual faculties at his command to survive the trip to Egypt, G-d now intervened to prevent Pharaoh from forcing his attentions on the presumably single Sarah. G-d’s intervention had become necessary to prevent Abraham and Sarah having problems as a result of their machinations, not despite their machinations. Pharaoh was obviously smitten by G-d in a way that made him impotent, and demonstrated to him that the punishment inflicted upon him was related to his attempt to rape Sarah. Pharaoh did not blame Abraham for having taken precautions to protect himself and his wife, knowing full well that these precautions were justified. What Pharaoh did object to was that Abraham had not at least told him privately, i.e. lee (the word is used repeatedly), what the true relationship between Sarah and him had been. The fact that he had to issue a command to his people not to molest Abraham (Genesis 12,20) proves that Abraham's estimate of the morality of Pharaoh's subjects had been quite accurate. That Abraham could not use the argument he was later to use with Avimelech was obvious, since Pharaoh had challenged Abraham concerning Abraham's evaluation of himself, and not his evaluation of his people. Just because his people were more law-abiding in matters of morality than the Egyptians, Avimelech could challenge the fact that Abraham had seen fit to use deception, and construe it as an insult against his people. The events that occurred in Egypt at this time serve to disabuse us of two erroneous attitudes. 1) The belief that if only human intellect, effort and caution is employed, success is guaranteed. 2) That since everything is in the hands of G-d anyways, our efforts to alter that which seems in store for us are futile and doomed to failure. Therefore, a life of passive acceptance of all dangers ought to be the only path to follow. Abraham had employed all his wits, had made extensive efforts, taken precautions, all to no avail; only then did G-d intervene to smite Pharaoh at the critical moment. Isaiah 50,10-11 conveys a similar lesson. In verse 10, a person relying on G-d is depicted as walking in darkness, relying solely on G-d to provide light. In verse 11, however, those who rely on their own light exclusively, are also scored by the prophet. When the following verse (Isaiah 51,2) states, &quot;Look towards Abraham and Sarah,&quot; the message is clearly that the proper way to behave can be learned only by studying what happened to our two ancestors who were called upon to act and whose actions and efforts were blessed by G-d. The Torah proceeds to tell us that Abraham returned to where he came from, that he accumulated material wealth. Though he returned greatly enriched materially, his spiritual path only took him back to Bet El, he had not made notable progress in that area of his life. This may have been due to his having kept Lot, whom he should not have taken along in the first place, at his side. He should have observed G-d’s original command in its entirety. (13) Under the circumstances, G-d now began to prepare the scenario that would lead to the separation of the two men. The scenario was provided by the fact that the land could not support their combined wealth. The company of Lot was no longer suitable for the tzaddik. The mention of the Canaanites as well as the Perusites being in the land of Canaan which they were in the process of conquering from the descendants of Shem, provided the contrast to the rift that developed between the shepherds of Lot and those of Abraham. Abraham realized that the quarrel between the shepherds would lead to an estrangement between their respective masters and, though he was the senior, offered Lot the choice of the areas available. He could have driven Lot away by force, but refrained, thereby demonstrating that material possessions were not uppermost in his system of values. Lot was unabashed in choosing the most fertile land, ignoring the fact that its inhabitants were the most sinful people, more sinful than the ones G-d had bidden Abraham to part company with when He had ordered him out of Ur. Abraham's essential strength of character was displayed clearly in this event, and this is one of the reasons why immediately upon the departure of Lot, we read about the explicit promise of G-d regarding the future ownership of the land of Canaan. This time G-d is much more specific in the promise, seeing that Abraham had renounced material wealth as a primary consideration in his thinking. Also, the apparent success of the Canaanites wresting more of the land from the Semites as evidenced by the two Canaanite tribes already settling there made it necessary for G-d to point out that such possession by the Canaanites would be temporary. We also observe that as long as Abraham remained in the company of Lot, he suffered the temporary absence of his wife, i.e. he was imposed upon. (14) Immediately after his separation from Lot, he becomes capable of defeating the mightiest four kings of their time when he liberates Lot and secures a great deal of booty. No doubt the sequence of these events is to teach that Abraham's spiritual growth had been impeded by the physical proximity of Lot, and could now resume its normal progress. The details about the exploits of these four kings serve to underline their power and the greatness of Abraham's achievement in defeating them. Also, although Abraham had heard about Lot's capture only by implication, he had reacted promptly. The palit, escapee, in 14,13 probably only related to the fact that the five kings had lost the battle and that any survivors had been captured. Abraham having &quot;heard&quot; must be understood in a sense similar to Genesis 23,16, when Abraham had not really &quot;heard&quot; with his ears. Or, like in Esther Chapter 4, when Mordechai is reported as having &quot;heard&quot; about the plot to assassinate the king. That, too, may not have been &quot;hearing&quot; in the literal sense of the word. Despite those quite imprecise reports, Abraham mobilized the forces at his command to engage in a war in order to rescue his nephew. Even at this stage, Abraham had not ceased to feel brotherly responsibility for the safety of Lot. (15) During the encounter with Malki Tzedek, who appeared while Abraham was discussing the spoils of war with the king of Sodom, who himself had been a prisoner rescued by Abraham, the former acknowledged that the spoils rightfully belonged to Abraham. Abraham, however, demonstrated his attitude towards material possessions even more clearly on this occasion. The king of Sodom had the nerve to offer Abraham the spoils, though they were not even his to dispose of. Abraham swore an oath that he would not allow the king of Sodom to lose even a shoelace, except for the food which had been consumed by Abraham's soldiers during the campaign. Abraham was not motivated by haughtiness; he simply did not want his attitude to material wealth to be compared to that of the king of Sodom. He did not want the Sodomites to think that if part of his wealth had its physical origin in the former belongings of the Sodomites, the whole of his wealth must be of similar caliber. He wanted to emphasize that whereas the purpose of the Sodomites was to accumulate wealth in this world, he himself was interested in accumulating wealth in a higher world. In an allegorical sense, one may see in the king of Sodom's invitation the lure of Satan who says to the warrior who has risked his life to amass the spoils of war, &quot;Give me your soul and take for yourself the material things in life.&quot; This, of course, is the path which will leave man eventually bereft of both material and spiritual values when he dies. Abraham's response to all those who follow in his footsteps throughout the ages has been, &quot;I have raised my hand to G-d, I will not benefit in the least from the material gains of this struggle, I will not sell my soul except to the extent that physical comforts are instrumental in ensuring my success in my efforts to attain spiritual maturity.&quot; This too is the attitude towards wealth expressed by Solomon in Kohelet 5,18. &quot;Also when the Lord gives a man wealth and properties, and He gives him the power to enjoy those and to benefit from his toils, all this is a gift from the Almighty.&quot; Since perfection of the human being is unattainable without the help of G-d, and is achieved only gradually, step by step, it is fitting that Abraham from hereon in makes further progress on the ladder of spiritual achievements. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>Moses heard the people cry in family groups, it was bad in his eyes.&quot; Moses had only seen the outer manifestations of the people's complaints. He did not realise that the word &quot;families&quot; mentioned here, alluded to the deeper cause of the Israelites' dissatisfaction, namely the laws of purity forbidding various incestuous relationships. Moses therefore thought that it was the manna itself which was the cause of their dissatisfaction. The word ra, needs to be understood as tzorat ayin, envy, jealousy. The Torah commands that when the year of release approaches shemittah, overdue loans must be &quot;released,&quot; i.e. forgiven. Prior to that, loans should not be refused out of fear that the debtor would be tardy in repayment in order to take advantage of the &quot;release&quot; mechanism. (Deut. 15, 9-10) According to the Sifri, Moses, in this instance worried less about G'ds honour. He was concerned that the people's request should not be granted, since it was unjustified. This is the reverse of what had happened at the time of the golden calf, when it had been Moses trying to convince G'd that it was not worth getting angry about. (Exodus 32, 11) For that reason, Moses did not even relay the people's request to G'd. Moses saw himself as unfit to provide satisfactory leadership, therefore he asked for help from G'd in the form of a management team. Failing this, he asked to be relieved through death, so that he would not have to witness the failure of his efforts to date. Moses listed three possible causes that can commit a man to provide for others. 1) Begetting a human being. This makes the one who begets responsible for his offspring's continued life and well being. 2) The natural instinct to raise one's young, something observed even in the animal kingdom. 3) Freely assumed obligations such as marriage, purchase of slaves etc. Moses underlines that in the case of the Jewish people, he has no responsibility for them arising from any of the causes listed. (compare chapter 11, verse 12) Foreseeing his own ultimate death as being due to frustration, he asks to be released before that happens, in the event G'd does not agree to appoint assistants for him. Verse 15, i.e. horgeyni na harog, &quot;kill me dead,&quot; means &quot;if You kill me, You will be killing someone who is already dead. A further argument used by Moses was that a leader who has at his disposal the means to satisfy his people's request, does have some responsibility in the matter. Since he, Moses, was however, in no position to provide the meat asked for, he felt no obligation in the matter. (4) G'd was displeased by Moses' request, although He acceded to it. By not providing additional ruach, spiritual power, but merely redistributing it amongst Moses and the seventy elders, i.e. &quot;I will delegate from the spirit which is upon you&quot; (verse 17), He demonstrated that He did not feel that the task allotted to Moses had been beyond his capacity. (6) Moses seemed unconcerned about G'ds reputation in the matter, concentrating on his own role in providing the meat, not worrying about the damage to G'ds image in the eyes of the people as an inadequate provider. G'd wished to show that even henceforth with the seventy elders, the combined leadership of the people would not be able to draw on an enlarged reservoir of spiritual resources. </p>

              <p>“He sent messengers to Bilam son of Beor, to Petor” – it was his city. Some say he was a moneychanger [shulḥani], (Petora means table [shulḥan] in Aramaic.)  as the kings of the gentiles would consult with him like a moneychanger to whom everyone brings his money. (So, too, people would bring their money to Bilam, for his counsel.)  Some say he was initially an interpreter of dreams, but then he reverted to being a sorcerer and reverted to [prophesy by] the Divine Spirit.  “In the land of the members of his people” – as Balak was from there, and he [Bilam] had told him that he would ultimately reign.  “To summon him” – as he wrote to him: ‘Do not think that it is only my mission that you are performing and that I, alone, will honor you. If you uproot them, you will be honored by all the nations, and Canaan and the Amalekites will prostrate themselves to you.’  “Behold, a people emerged from Egypt” – he [Bilam] said to him: ‘Of what concern is it to you?’ He said to him: ‘“Behold, it has covered the face of the earth [ein haaretz]” – they shut the eyes [einayim] upon which the land relies, Siḥon and Og, they destroyed them and covered their eyes. What can I do?’   “And it sits across from me [mimuli]” – mimuli is written without a vav, (The word &quot;mimuli&quot; can be written mem, mem, vav, lamed, yod. In the verse here, the vav was left out which makes it possible to connect it to the word amilam. )  just as it says: “In the name of the Lord, for I will cut them down [amilam]” (Psalms 118: 10).  “And now, please go curse this people for me, as they are too mighty for me; perhaps I will be able to smite them, and I will drive them from the land, for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed” (Numbers 22:6).  “And now, please go curse [ara] [this people] for me” –“what is “ara for me”? I can overcome them a bit, like a person who picks [oreh] figs. (A few at a time, since they do not all ripen at the same time.)    “As they are too mighty for me” – not that they are powerful, and their armies are numerous, but rather that they are victorious with their mouths. This is something that I am unable to do.  “Perhaps I will be able to smite them” – what did this one see, that led him to provoke [them]; did the Holy One blessed be He not say to them [Israel] that they  may not take their land? It is, rather, that they (The Moavites.)   were sorcerers and diviners greater than Bilam, as it is stated: “Balak saw”; however, they were unable to understand the matters accurately. Likewise, it says: “You are wearied in the abundance of your devising; let now the astrologers, the stargazers…save you [from what will come upon you]” (Isaiah 47:13). He [Balak] saw in his astrology that Israel would fall into his hands. That is why he made his daughter available to wantonness, and twenty-four thousand of them fell. That is why he provoked [them]. But he did not know how. That is why, “perhaps I will be able to smite [nakeh] them” – like one who deducts [shemenakeh] one twenty-fourth per se’a. (The assumption is that this is the percentage of waste found in the grain (Bava Batra 93b).)  Likewise, for each twenty-four thousand of Israel, one thousand was missing. (Twenty-four thousand people died due to the sin relating to the wantonness of the daughters of Moav and the consequent worship of the idle of Baal Peor. If multiplied by twenty-four the number is 576,000 which is close to the number of men older than twenty.)   “I will drive them from the land” – he was seeking to prevent them only from entering the Land.  “For I know that he whom you bless is blessed” – how did he know? It is because at the time that Siḥon sought to wage war against Moav, he feared that they were mighty, and hired Bilam and his father to curse Moav, as it is stated: “Therefore the allegorists will say” (Numbers 21:27), and it is written: “A fire emerged from Ḥeshbon” (Numbers 21:28), and it is written: “Woe to you, Moav” (Numbers 21:29). That is why he said: “For I know that he whom you bless is blessed.”</p>

              <p>“He spoke with them, saying: If you are willing to bury my dead from before me, heed me, and intercede for me with Ephron, son of Tzoḥar” (Genesis 23:8).  “He spoke with them, saying: If you are willing…[intercede [pigu] for me]” – prevail upon him for me, mediate on my behalf; and if that is not [sufficient], entreat him on my behalf. (The word pigu can connote all of these meanings.)  “Ephron was sitting among the children of Ḥet and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, of all those coming to his city gate, saying” (Genesis 23:10).  “Ephron was sitting [yoshev] among the children of Ḥet” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Yashav is written; (Yoshev, “was sitting,” is usually spelled with a vav, but here the vav is missing, so that the word could be read yashav, “he sat.” If the verse is saying that “he sat,” it means that at that point in the narrative he sat down among the children of Ḥet, meaning that he assumed a position of honor among them.)  on that day they appointed him chief officer [over them], so that there would not be [a situation in which] a person of great stature [Abraham] would be purchasing from a person of low stature.  “Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, [of all those coming to his city gate]” (The implication is that all the people of the city were present.)  – Rabbi Pinḥas said: This teaches that they all locked their doors and went out to show kindness towards Abraham [by attending Sarah’s funeral].  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave that is in it, I have given it to you; before the eyes of my people I have given it to you; bury your dead” (Genesis 23:11).  “He spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, saying: But if you please, hear me: I will give the price of the field; take it from me, and I will bury my dead there” (Genesis 23:13).   “And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him” (Genesis 23:14).  “My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver, between me and you, what is it? Bury your dead” (Genesis 23:15).  “Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed for Ephron the silver that he spoke in the hearing of the children of Ḥet, four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” (Genesis 23:16).  “No, my lord, heed me; the field I have given to you, and the cave…My lord, heed me: Land worth four hundred shekels of silver” – Rabbi Ḥanina said: All the shekels that are stated in the Torah refer to sela’im; in the Prophets, litrin; (A litra being equal to twenty-five sela’im.)  and in the Writings, centenaria. (A centenarium being equal to one hundred sela’im.)  Rabbi Yudan said: The exception is the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. That is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth, and he does not know that diminishment will befall him” (Proverbs 28:22). “A greedy man rushes after wealth” – this refers to Ephron, who cast a greedy eye upon the wealth of the righteous man [Abraham]. (By demanding an exorbitant price for his field.)  “And he does not know that diminishment will befall him” – as the Torah diminished the letter vav from him. (Throughout the narrative, Ephron’s name is written with a vav, but here, where he overprices his field, his name is spelled without the vav. Thus, because of his greediness, diminishment befell him.)  That is what is written: “Abraham heeded Ephron and Abraham weighed for Ephron [the silver…]” – Ephron is written without a vav.  “Four hundred shekels of silver, in the currency of merchants” – Rabbi Abba bar Bizna said: It was usable for all merchandise. (Abraham gave the highest quality of coin, acceptable to all merchants for all kinds of merchandise.) </p>

The Cave of Makhpela, as it is written: “Abraham heeded Efron, and Abraham weighed for Efron [the money…]” (Genesis 23:16). The Temple, as it is written: “David gave to Ornan for the place [six hundred shekels worth of gold]” (I Chronicles 21:25). Joseph’s tomb – “he purchased the tract of the field” (Genesis 33:19); Jacob purchased Shekhem.  Rabbi Ḥiyya Rabba, Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi, and Rabbi Shimon bar Ḥalafta forgot words from the Targum, and they came to a certain Arabian merchant to learn it from there. (To learn the meaning of words in the Targum from the language spoken by the Arabian.)  He heard his voice that he said to another: ‘Lift this yahava upon me.’ We understand from him that yahava is a burden, as it is stated: “Cast your burden [yehavekha] upon the Lord, and He will sustain you” (Psalms 55:23). In addition, he heard the voice of an Arabian who said to another: ‘Why are you mekhaseh me,’ but he wished to say: ‘Why are you me’aseh me,’ as it is written: “You will crush [ve’asotem] the wicked, for they will be ashes” (Malachi 3:21). In addition, they heard that a woman said to another: ‘Come to the bathhouse.’ She answered: “I am bereaved and lonely [vegalmuda]” (Isaiah 49:21). Galmuda – I am a menstruant. In addition, he heard another woman saying to another: ‘Lend me your broom,’ and she said: ‘Lend me metatekh,’ as it is stated: “I will sweep it with the broom [metateh] of destruction, the utterance of the Lord of hosts” (Isaiah 14:23). [They heard women say to another woman:] ‘We came to arouse lelivyatakh’ (We came to wail with you.)  – “Who prepare for rousing their wailing [livyatan]” (Job 3:8). [And they heard:] ‘Lend me your diamond [kesitatekh].’ [And they heard:] ‘Take this lamb [kesita] out to the pasture.’ (The price of one hundred kesita that Jacob paid could have been one hundred jewels or one hundred lambs.)   “For one hundred kesita.” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: One hundred precious stones, one hundred sheep, one hundred sela. Rabbi Simon said: Kof – kamilia [jewel], samekh (The letter samekh and the letter sin are interchangeable.) – sela’im, tet – terayon [valuable coins]. Yod heh, what are they doing here? Rabbi Yehuda of Sikhnin in the name of Rabbi Levi: These are gold pendants and emeralds that are typically placed in nose rings. Who writes the writ of sale? Rabbi Berekhya said: The Lord [Ya] writes the writ of sale. Who attests to the writ of sale? The Lord [Ya] attests to the writ of sale. That is the yod heh of kesita. That is what is written: “There the tribes went up, the tribes of the Lord [Ya], a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the Lord” (Psalms 122:4) – Ya attests on their behalf that they are the sons of their fathers.

              <p>Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22): AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH. This was Ephron the Hittite. (See above, Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; and the parallels listed there; below, Tanh. (Buber), Deut. 4:4.)  When Abraham's wife Sarah died, Abraham went to Ephron for him to sell him the cave. Ephron said to him: Give me its price. He said to him (in Gen. 23:15): WHAT IS A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER BETWEEN YOU AND ME? SO BURY YOUR DEAD. Abraham began piling up the silver for Ephron, as stated (in Gen. 23:16): SO ABRAHAM HEEDED EPHRON, AND ABRAHAM WEIGHED OUT THE SILVER FOR EPHRON…. Ben Ma'ma said: Although R. Hanina has said: All the shekels in the Torah are sela'im, these &lt; shekels &gt; are an exception, since they are centenaria. (The word is Latin. One centenarium was worth 100,000 sesterces. According to a fourth-century inscription of northern Africa, a centenarium was a hundred pieces (e.g., of gold). See A. Souter, A Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A.D.

(Prov. 28:22): AN EVIL-EYED PERSON MOVES QUICKLY AFTER WEALTH. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter. (Prov. 28:22, cont.): AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT POVERTY (HSR) WILL COME TO HIM.

              <p>(Numb. 22:4, cont.:) “Now Balak ben Zippor was king of Moab….” But was he not formerly a prince, as stated (in Josh. 13:21), “Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, princes of Sihon?” (According to Enoch Zundel in his commentary, ‘Ets Yosef, Balak is to be identified with Zur. So also Issachar Ber Ashkenazi in his commentary, Mattenot Kehunnah, on the parallel in Numb. R. 20:4; Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1954), vol. III, p. 353; vol. VI, p. 136, n. 791.)  It is simply that when Sihon was killed they made him king in his place. (Numb. 22:4, cont.:) “At that time.” As it was the time that caused it for him. (Numb. 22:5:) “And he sent messengers to Balaam ben Beor at Pethor.” [Pethor (Petor) was] the name of his city. (Numb. R. 20:7; Sanh. 105ab.)  But others say that [the name implies] he was a money-changer, (Since pator in Aramaic denotes a table, these interpreters would read the clause: AND HE SENT MESSENGERS TO BALAAM BEN BEOR AT A MONEY-CHANGER’S TABLE. Cf. Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Gen. 23:16.)  since the kings of the nations of the world took counsel with him, as the money-changer to whom they all would show [their coins]. Still others say that in the beginning he was an interpreter (poter) of dreams. He turned to being a diviner. Then he turned to the holy spirit. (See Numb. 24:2.)  (Numb. 22:5, cont.:) “To the land of his kinsfolk,” for Balak came from there, and [Balaam] had told him, “Your destiny is to become king.”(Numb. 22:5, cont.:) “To summon him.” Thus he wrote him, “Do not suppose that it is for myself alone that you are doing this and that I alone am honoring you. If you uproot them, you shall receive honor from all the nations, so that the Canaanites and the Egyptians shall all bow down to you.” (Numb. 22:5, cont.:) “Here is a people that has come out of Egypt.” He said to him, “As for you, how does it concern you?” He said to him (in Numb. 22:5, cont.), “’Look, they have covered the face (literally: eye) of the earth.’ [There are] two eyes upon which the land depends, Sihon and Og. They have destroyed them and covered their eyes. And [now] what do I do?” (Numb. 22:5, cont.:) “Now they are dwelling opposite me (mmwly).” [What is actually] written [in the Biblical text] is mmly (from the root, mwl, which means, &quot;cut off&quot;), just as it says (in Ps. 118:10), “in the name of the Lord I will cut them off (rt.: mwl).” (With the word rewritten in this sense, the end of Numb. 22:5 reads: NOW THEY ARE DWELLING [THERE] CUTTING ME OFF. This interpretation of Numb. 22:5 is also given by Rashi, ad loc.)  (Numb. 22:6:) “So come now please, curse (arah) [this people] for me.” What is the meaning of “curse ('rh) […] for me?” Perhaps I shall be able to control them little by little, like someone who picks (rt.: 'rh) figs. (Numb. 22:6, cont.:) “For they are mightier than I.” [It is] not that they are more valiant than I, nor [is it] that their forces are more numerous than mine. It is simply that they conquer through their mouth, [and this is] something that I cannot do. (Numb. 22:6, cont.:) “Perhaps I shall be able to smite them.” What reason was there for this one to engage them (i.e., Israel) in war? Did not the Holy One, blessed be He, tell them this, that [Israel] was not to take any of their land? [It was] simply that [Balak] was more of a master of sorceries and divinations than Balaam, for it is so written of him (in Numb. 22:2), “Now Balak [ben Zippor] saw (in a vision),” except that he did not really comprehend the things [he saw]. And so it says (in Is. 47:13-14), “You are wearied with your many deliberations; let those who study the heavens please stand up and save you; let those who gaze at the stars make known month by month whatever will come upon you. See they have become like straw; fire consumes them […].” When he saw that Israel would fall into his hand, he therefore gave his daughter over (to prostitution to lure Israel to sin); (See Numb. 25:1-15. Numb. 25:15 specifically identifies the sacred prostitute Cozbi as the daughter of Zur, whom the midrash (above, section 7:4) has already identified with Balak.)  and through her twenty-four thousand fell. To this end he would have engaged them in war, but he did not know how. (Numb. 22:6:) “Perhaps I shall be able to smite (nkh) them.” As one discounts (rt.: nkh) one twenty-fourth of a [se’ah]; (On allowing a given species to have up to 1/24 of another species, see Kil. 2:1; yKil. 2:1 (27c); BB 6:2; BB 93b-94a, where as elsewhere a rova‘ is a quarter of a qav, which in turn is one sixth of a se’ah. Thus one rova’ equals one twenty-fourth of a se’ah.)  so also did twenty-four thousand fall from Israel there, [which is] one less. (24 x 20,000 = 480,000, and 24 x 5,000 = 120,000, it turns out that, if 25,000 is found to be 1/24 of 600,000 and only 24,000 fell, then 1,000 are missing In a long note Buber further explains that apart from the law of mixtures, in the removal of the hallah, what is taken is generally 1/24 of the dough (so Hal. 2:7). Buber also notes a variant reading which substitutes menabber (denoting one who removes the hallah) for menakkah (translated here as “discount”). So the Holy One cleansed Israel by removing 1/24 of the people. However, since there were 600,000 Israelites, 25,000 (=1/24 of 600,000), not 24,000, should have been removed. The thousand extra can be explained on analogy with the law of mixtures allowing 1/24 for impurities. The first part of the interpretation in the text comes from dividing 25,000 into two parts of 20,000 + 5,000 and then multiplying each separately and adding the results, instead of simply multiplying 25,000 by 24,000. Regarding the number of Israelites in the desert, Scripture gives the 600,000 figure only in Exod. 12:37. Cf. Exod. 38:26; Numb. 1:46; 2:32, which fix the figure at 603,550 adult males excluding Levites; also Numb. 26:57, which reports a census figure of 601,730 after the removal of the 24,000 in Numb. 25:9.)  (Numb. 22:6, cont.:) “And drive them away from the land,” for he only desired to drive them away, so that they would not enter the land. (Numb. 22:6, cont.:) “For I know that whomever you bless is blessed and that whomever you curse is cursed.” From where did he know? When Sihon desired to fight with Moab [and] was afraid because they were warriors, he hired Balaam and his father to curse Moab, for it says (in Numb. 21:27–29), “Therefore those who speak in parables say, ‘Come to Heshbon, let it be built; let the city of Sihon be established. For a fire has come forth from Heshbon, [a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab…]. Woe be to you, O Moab!’” Ergo it says (in Numb. 22:6), “for I know [that whomever you bless is blessed and that whomever you curse is cursed].”</p>

              <p>(Lev. 25:14:) “When you sell property to your kinsman.” This text is related (to Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth, [and he does not know that loss will come to him].” This verse speaks about many people. “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth.” This was Cain. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “You moved quickly to inherit the world. By your life, you shall have a loss [in the matter].” Ergo (in Prov. 28:22), “and he does not know that loss will come to him.” And what happened to him? That he wandered about the world, as stated (in Gen. 4:12), “you shall become a ceaseless wanderer on the earth.” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This was Ephron the Hittite. (See Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; and the parallels listed there; and Tanh. (Buber), Deut. 4:4.)  When Abraham's wife Sarah died, Abraham went to Ephron for him to sell him the cave. Ephron said to him, “Give me its price.” He said to him (in Gen. 23:15), “What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between you and me?” Abraham began piling up the silver for Ephron, as stated (in Gen. 23:16), “So Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed out […].” Ben Ma'ma said, “Although R. Hanina has said, ‘All the shekels in the Torah are sela'im,’ these [shekels] are an exception, since they are centenaria. (The word is Latin. One centenarium was worth 100,000 sesterces. According to a fourth-century inscription of northern Africa, a centenarium was a hundred pieces (e.g., of gold). See A. Souter, A Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A.D. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1957).)  [So it was] four hundred centenaria [that] Abraham piled up before Ephron.” When Ephron saw the silver, he moved quickly and hastily, as stated (in Gen. 23:6), “bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You have moved quickly after money. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” And what was his loss? R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said, “Every [mention of] Ephron which is written here [in Scripture], before he took the silver from Abraham, is written plene as 'prwn (i.e., with the vowel o represented by the Hebrew consonant w); but this [usage] (in Gen. 23:16) is deficient (hsr), ‘and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron ('prn). It is written with the w missing (hsr).” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This is the one who lends at interest, because he is anxious to become wealthy. He lends in order to receive interest from the borrower and becomes wealthy from the interest. But a curse is given through his riches, as stated (ibid., cont.), “and he does not know that loss will come to him.” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This represents those who engage in business in the sabbatical year, in that they move quickly to become rich. They do not observe the sabbatical year, and think they will become rich. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” Since he did not observe the sabbatical year, the curse began entering into his money, and he sells [all that he had]. What is written above the matter (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord.” And after that it is written (in vs. 14), “When you sell property.” R. Eleazar Haqappar said, “It is written (in Cant. 5:15), ‘His legs are pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold.’ This column has a capital above and a pedestal (Gk.: basis.)  below.” (See Lev. R. 25:8.)  R. Samuel ben Guriah said, “You have no section in the Torah which does not have a capital above and a pedestal below. (The parallel in Lev. R. 25:8 explains that each section can be expounded with reference to what precedes and follows it.)  What is written above of the matter (in Lev. 25:1-2)? ‘Then the Lord spoke unto Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, “Speak unto the Children of Israel [….] ‘the land shall observe [a Sabbath for the Lord].’”’ Then after that [comes] the section on the jubilee (in vs. 8), ‘And you shall count seven [Sabbaths of years].’ If one has not observed the sabbatical year and the jubilee, or [even] one of them, in the end, I will make it that he will sell his land, [as stated] (in vs. 14), ‘When you sell property to your kinsman.’ (T’Arakh. 5:9; below, 9:8.)  [If] he repents, [all] is well; but if not, he will end up selling his field, as stated (in vs. 25), ‘When your relative becomes poor and sells some of his property.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up selling his house, as stated (in vs. 29), ‘And when someone sells a dwelling house.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up going around [begging] at doorways, as stated (in vs. 35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor [… you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you].’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to you, as stated (in vs. 39), ‘And when your relative becomes poor] near you and is sold to you.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to the gentiles, as stated (in vs. 47), ‘And when a foreigner and a sojourner near you becomes wealthy, [while your relative near him becomes poor and is sold to a sojourning foreigner near you….].’ Now it is not merely the individual himself [at issue here], but that person and all Israel; for so you find in the days of Jeremiah, because they profaned the sabbatical year, they were sold to the gentiles, as stated (in II Chron. 36:17-18), ‘So He brought up the king of the Chaldeans upon them [….] And all the vessels of the house of God […] and the treasures of the house of the Lord […].’ Behold the case of [all] Israel.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “See how they will be sold to the gentiles because they profaned the sabbatical year.” He said to him, “Master of the world, did You not say this (in Lev. 25:35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you, [you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you]?’ Fulfill what You said to them and called them, ‘My relatives (ah) and friends,’ as stated (in Ps. 122:8), ‘For the sake of My relatives (ah) and friends’: (Lev. 25:35:) ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you,’ [i.e.,] when their strength fails before Nebuchadnezzar, the Divine Presence, as it were, will be with them. It is so stated (in Is. 43:14), ‘for your sake I have sent to Babylon.’ (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘You shall maintain (literally, hold on to) him.’ Hold them (i.e., Israel), lest they perish. But how? (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘As a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you.’ Although they became foreigners and sojourners in Babylon, if You do not give them grace, they will perish, [so just] ‘let him live near You.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Because of their sins I have sold My house to the Chaldeans.” It is so stated (in Lev. 25:29), “And when someone sells a dwelling house.” This is the house of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Ps. 132:13), “For the Lord has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling.” And what happened [to it]? (II Kings 25:9 = Jer. 52:13:) And he burned the house of the Lord [...].” (Lev. 25:29, cont.:) “A walled city.” This is the city of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated] (in II Chron. 36:19), “and they broke down the wall of Jerusalem […].” That is what the Holy One, blessed be He, says (in Lev. 25:47), “And when a foreigner and a sojourner [near you] becomes wealthy.” This wealthy foreigner is Nebuchadnezzar, and this sojourner is the Median Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “And is sold to a sojourning foreigner.” This [sojourning foreigner] is the Greek Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “Or to a foreigner's family.” This is the Edomite Empire (i.e., Rome). Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, why were they sold to these empires?” He said to him, “Because they profaned the sabbatical year.” It is so stated (in II Chron. 36:20–21), “Then he carried off unto Babylon those left from the sword,” and the end of the Scripture is “[until the land made up] its Sabbaths; as long as it lay desolate, it observed Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses at the end of all of these sections, “Is it your wish that they do not go into exile? [Then] warn them concerning the sabbatical years and the jubilees.” That is what He has said at the end of all the sections (in Lev. 26:2), “You shall observe My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord.” What is the meaning of “I am the Lord?” I am the one who is going to give you a good reward, if you observe them; but if not, I am going to exact retribution from them through the Empires. Therefore, say to them to be careful about the sabbatical year. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord,” so that they do not attain [the punishments in] those sections written below (in Lev. 26:14-45). (Lev. 25:14:) “When you sell property to your kinsman or buy from your neighbor's hand, do not deceive.” [Thus] you shall not deceive one another. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “For I also sold the whole world to Abraham and did not deceive him. He [then went back and sold it to Me,” as stated (Genesis 14:19), “the Buyer (Qoneh. A more traditional rendering of this word here would be MAKER.)  of heaven and earth.” When? When Abraham observed the commandments of the Holy One, blessed be He. Before the Torah was given to Israel, our father Abraham kept it [and observed all the commandments that are in the Torah]. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Alexandra, “Abraham even observed the [rabbinic precept of] eruvim of cooked foods.” (See Tanh. (Buber), Gen. 3:1, and the notes there.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5), “Because ('qb 'shr) Abraham heeded [My voice and kept My charge: My commandments, My statutes, and My Torahs].” What is the meaning of 'qb? (Gen. R. 95:3; Cant. R. 5:16:1; PR 21:12; cf. Ned. 32a.)  R. Simeon ben Laqish said, “At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He.” (So also Numb. R. 18:21. According to other traditions Abraham recognized his creator at the age of forty-eight (Gen. R. 30:8; 46:2; Cant. R. 5:16:1), at the age of fifty (PR 21:12), or at the age of one (Gen. R. 95:3).)  How is this shown? 'Qb is a number. (I.e., 'ayin) is seventy, q (i.e., qof) is one hundred, [and] b (i.e., bet) is two, for a total of one hundred seventy-two. Now (according to Gen. 25:7) Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five [years]. Deduct from them. [The result is] three, when he was little. Ergo, at the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He. When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw how Abraham loved the commandments, He began buying heavenly and earthly [places] for him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19), “Blessed be Abram of God most high, Buyer of heaven and earth.” So also it says (Gen. 13:15), “For all the land (or earth) which you see, to you I will give it.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “All the world is wholly Mine; and I bought it for Abraham, because he has observed My commandments. But you, through your sins, have caused him to be [like] an alien who rents a house from its owners, for so Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 14:8), ‘why are you like a foreigner in the land […]?’ When you sinned before Me, I sold you, as stated (in Ps. 44:13), ‘You shall sell Your people for no money […].’ For that reason, if someone has to sell a house, a field, or [some] article, you shall not deceive one another.” It is therefore written (in Lev. 25:14), “shall not deceive his brother.” (Lev. 25:15-18:) “According to the years after the jubilee […]. According to the multitude of years, you shall increase […]. A man shall not deceive his brother […]. So you shall carry out my statutes and judgements.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Just as I sold my people and returned again to reinstate them, as stated (Jer. 3:14), ‘”Turn back, faithless children,” says the Lord; “for I am a master to you.”’ It is also written (in Is. 52:3), ‘For thus says the Lord, “You were sold for free, and you shall be redeemed for no money.”’ So too you should not sell the land absolutely, as stated (in Lev. 25:23), ‘[it] shall not be sold permanently.’ The Land [of Israel] is dear to me because I have made it holier than all the [other] lands in the world.” You yourself know, when the Land of Israel was distributed to the tribes, it did not pass from tribe to tribe. Rather [it was distributed] to each tribe separately. You yourself know. Look at how many lawsuits the daughters of Zelophehad brought, so that their inheritance would not pass from one tribe to another. Moreover the Holy One, blessed be He, conceded to their words, as stated (in Numb. 27:7), “The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right.” (Numb. 36:9:) “Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another.” Therefore, if a redeemer is found for it, fine; but if not, whoever buys it acquires it until the jubilee. Then on the jubilee he releases it. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:41), “Then he shall depart from you, he and his children with him and he shall return to his family.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “When the year of the redemption draws near, I will redeem you, as stated (in Is. 63:4), ‘For a day of vengeance was in My heart, but there came My year of redemption.’”</p>

                <h4>Midrash Tanchuma, Re'eh 10:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(Deut. 14:22:) “You shall surely tithe.” This text is related (to Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person (i.e., a miser) moves quickly after wealth; [and he does not know that loss will come to him].” R. Hanina interpreted the verse with reference to Ephron (of Gen. 23). (Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; Lev. 9:1; Gen. R. 58:7; Exod. R. 31:17; PRK 10:1; see also BM 87a. Cf. above, Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:13, which identifies the man with Cain.)  For R. Hanina said, “All the shekels mentioned in the Torah are sela, those in the prophets are litrai, (The Greek word means “pounds.”)  and those in the writings are centenarii, (The Latin word denotes weights of a hundred pounds.)  except for the shekels of Ephron, which are not centenarii. (For this valuation of the shekel, see yQid. 1:3 (59d), 5 (60c); Bekh. 50a; PR 1:4.)  This is what is written (in Gen. 23:9), ‘let him give it to me at the full price.’” Because he brought the evil eye (of greed) into Abraham's wealth, the written text lacks the letter waw. This is what is written (in Gen. 23:15), “My lord, listen to me, what is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between you and me?” He said to him, “If you want to give me four hundred centenarii of silver from the goods of your house, you can give it to me.” Because he brought in an evil eye (i.e., of greed) into Abraham's wealth, [his name] is lacking the letter waw, where it is stated (in Gen. 23:16), “So Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron. It is the second Ephron that is written deficient. R. [Ammi] interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to one who borrows a cow. Since he was too miserly to rent two cows, he borrowed one and rented one. And (according to Prov. 28:22) “he does not know that loss will come to him”; that it is written (in Exod. 22:13), “[When someone borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies,] and its owner is not with it, he shall surely pay.” R. Isaac interpreted the verse (Prov. 28:22) with reference to the one who lends to an Israelite at interest and is too miserly to lend it without interest, and (Prov. 8:22) “he does not know that loss will come to him”; that it is written (in Prov. 28:8), “The one who augments his wealth by interest and usury amasses it for one who is generous to the poor.” Who is the one that is generous to the poor? This is Esau the wicked. Is Esau the wicked generous to the poor? Rather does he not oppress the poor? He is like those procurators who go out to the villages and plunder tenants. Then they go back to the capital and say, “Gather the poor, because we want to perform a good act for them.” The [Aramaic] adage says, “[She commits adultery] for apples, and distributes [them] to the sick.” R. Levi interpreted the verse (i.e., Prov. 28:22) with reference to the person who does not take out his tithes properly. To this end R. Levi told a story about someone who did take out his tithes properly: Now he had a certain field that produced a thousand measures every year. So he took a hundred measures from it for his tithes; and from the remainder he and the children of his household sustained themselves all of his days. At the time of his death, he summoned his son. He said to him, “My son, give your attention to this field. It yields such and such [a number of] measures, and I take out such and such a tithe. From it I have sustained myself and my household all my days.” When that son planted it the first year, it produced a thousand measures, and he took out a hundred measures from it for the tithe. For the second year, an evil eye (i.e., of greed) entered within him. So he subtracted ten [measures from the tithe], but [the field] subtracted one hundred [measures from its yield]. Similarly also [on the third, fourth, and fifth [years], until it was reduced to its tithes. When kinfolk and friends saw [what was happening], they put on white (i.e., festive) [tunics] and wrapped themselves in white [mantles]. [When] they came to him, he said to them, “Why have you come? To rejoice over the very one who has been excommunicated [by the Heavens]?” They said to him, “God forbid! We have only come to rejoice with you. In the past you were the owner of the house, and the Holy One, blessed be He, was the priest; but now the Holy One, blessed be He, has become the owner of the house, and you are the priest.” For that reason Moses warned Israel (in Deut. 14:22), “You shall surely tithe.”</p>

              <p>Rabbi Jehudah said: Three forefathers made covenants with the people of the land. (With reference to) Abraham (the circumstances were as follows). When the angels were revealed unto him, he thought that they were travellers (from among) the people of the land, and he ran to meet them, and he wished to prepare for them a great banquet, and he told Sarah to prepare cakes for them. When Sarah was kneading, she perceived that the manner of women was upon her, therefore he did not hand them any of the cakes. He ran to fetch a calf. But the calf fled from before him, and went into the Cave of Machpelah, and he went in there after it, and he found Adam and his help-meet lying there upon their beds, and they slept, and lights were kindled above them, and a sweet scent was upon them like a sweet savour, therefore he desired to have the Cave of Machpelah as a burial possession. He spoke to the sons of Jebus, in order to purchase from them the Cave of || Machpelah by a purchase with gold, and by a perpetual deed for a possession of a burying-place. Were they Jebusites? Were they not Hittites? But they were called Jebusites according to the name of the city of Jebus. The men did not accept (this request). He began to bow down and prostrate himself unto them, as it is said, &quot;And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land&quot; (Gen. 23:12).</p>

He made with them a covenant with an oath that the Israelites would not take possession of the city of Jebus save by the consent of the sons of Jebus, and afterwards he bought the Cave of Machpelah by a purchase with gold, and a perpetual deed, for a perpetual possession, (as it is said), &quot;And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant&quot; (Gen. 23:16).</p>

              <p>Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” that is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth” (Proverbs 28:22); (The midrash will explain how this relates to the verse “if you lend money to My people,” but it first cites other interpretations of the verse. )  this is Cain, who hastened himself to take the world. How so? When he was with his brother, as it is stated: “It was when they were in the field” (Genesis 4:8), they said one to the other: ‘Come, let us divide the world.’ Cain said: ‘You take the movable property, and I [will take] the land.’ They divided it between them. Abel took the movable property and Cain [took] the land. [Cain] plotted to oust [Abel] from the world. Abel was walking on the earth and Cain was pursuing him. He said to him: ‘Leave what is mine.’ [Abel] went to the mountains, and [Cain] said: ‘Leave what is mine,’ until he stood over him and killed him. That is, “a greedy man rushes after wealth.” This is Cain, who was greedy toward his brother.  “And does not know that lack will come upon him” (Proverbs 28:22). What lack befell [Cain]? It is that the Holy One blessed be He said: “Restless and wandering you shall be on the earth” (Genesis 4:12). What is that? It is that every place that he went, the Holy One blessed be He would bring trouble along with him and they would strike him and pursue him until they would drive him away. Solomon proclaimed in his regard: “If a man would beget one hundred” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); this is Cain who begot one hundred children, “and would live many years” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); he lived as long as Adam lived, “and the days of his years would be numerous” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); he lived seven hundred and thirty-six years longer than his father, “but his soul will not be sated from the goodness” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); as his soul would not be sated with his money, as it is stated: “Restless and wandering you shall be on the earth” (Genesis 4:12). “And moreover, he has no burial” (Ecclesiastes 6:3), as he was in abeyance, gradually weakening until the flood came and swept him away. “I say: A stillborn is better than he” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); this is Abel, his brother, as [Cain] rose up and felled him, [leaving him] dead in the field.  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is Ephron. When Sarah died and Abraham was seeking a place to bury her, he said to them [the Hittites]: “Heed me, and intercede for me with Ephron, son of Tzohar” (Genesis 23:8). Immediately, they went and appointed [Ephron] prefect over them that very day. They said to him: ‘Sell the cave to Abraham.’ He said to them: ‘I will not sell it to him.’ They said to him: ‘If you do not do so we will remove you from your prefecture.’ Immediately, Abraham arose and weighed the silver for him. Rabbi Ḥama said: Every shekel stated in the Torah is a sela, (When the Torah mentions a shekel it refers to the coin known in the Mishna as a sela.)  in the Prophets is a litra, (Twenty-five sela.)  and in the Writings is a centenarium. (One hundred litra.)  Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: Except for the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. What did Ephron say to Abraham? If you give me four hundred shekel, from the merchandise of your house you will give it to me. (This sum is insignificant to a man as wealthy as you (Matnot Kehuna).)  Because he was greedy regarding Abraham’s money, the verse subtracted a vav from him. (In the verse that states that Abraham paid the money to Ephron, Ephron’s name is spelled without a vav (Genesis 23:16). This symbolizes the fact that Ephron would experience financial setbacks. )  That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” The verse subtracted a vav from the person who was greedy. Moreover, the cave was not called by his name, but rather, by the name of the children of Ḥet, as it is stated: “That Abraham purchased from the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 25:10); it does not say from Ephron, but from the children of Ḥet.  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is Esau. When Isaac died, Jacob and Esau came and divided everything. Jacob said: ‘Shall this wicked be destined to enter, he and his children, the Cave of Makhpela, and he will have a portion and residence with the righteous buried in it?’ Immediately, he took all the money in his possession and made it into a pile and said to Esau: ‘My brother, do you want the portion you have in this cave, or this silver and gold?’ At that moment, Esau said: ‘This kind of burial place is found everywhere. For one grave that I have in the cave, will I lose all this money?’ Immediately, he rose and took all the money and gave him his portion. That is what Jacob says to Joseph: “In my grave that I excavated [kariti] for me” (Genesis 50:5). “I purchased,” is not written, but rather kariti. He said to them: ‘I gave Esau a pile [keri] of dinars.’ That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” What is the lack? It is that he did not enter the Cave of Makhpela.  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is the borrower who was too miserly to rent two cows, and he borrows one and rents one. Because he rented only one, if it [the borrowed cow] dies or is injured, he pays. If he rented and it dies, the Torah says: “If he is a renter, it goes for his rent” (Exodus 22:14). (The owner does not receive payment beyond the rent.)  That is, “a greedy man rushes after wealth,” as he was too miserly to rent [both cows], the result is “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” That is what is written: “[If a man borrows from his neighbor and it is injured or dies,] its owner is not with it, he shall pay” (Exodus 22:13).  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” Rabbi Levi said: This is one who does not separate his tithes properly. There was an incident involving one who would separate his tithes properly, and he had one field that would produce one thousand measures, and he would separate from it one hundred measures as tithe. From the remainder, he and the members of his household supported themselves. At the time of his death, he called his son and said: ‘My son, pay attention to this field, such and such measures it produces, such and such measures for tithe, and from it I supported myself all my days.’ When he passed from the world, the first year, the son sowed it, and it produced one thousand measures and he separated from it one hundred as tithe. The second year, miserliness overcame him and he deducted ten, (He separated only ninety measures as tithe.)  and it deducted one hundred; (The next year, the field produced only nine hundred measures.)  likewise the third, likewise, the fourth, likewise, the fifth, until it reached the total of its tithes. (Each year, he deducted ten measures from the tithe and the field produced one hundred measures fewer, until ultimately, the field produced only one hundred measures.)  When his relatives saw that it was so, they rose, donned white garments and wrapped themselves in white outer garments and came to him. He said to them: ‘Have you come to rejoice over my [troubles]?’ They said: ‘Heaven forbid, we came only to rejoice with you.’ In the past, you were the landowner and the Holy One blessed be He was the priest. Now, you have become the priest and the Holy One blessed be He has become the landowner. That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.”  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is one who would lend with interest, because he was too miserly to lend to Israelites without interest. “And does not know that lack will come upon him,” as it is written: “He who increases his wealth through usury and interest amasses it for one who cares for the poor” (Proverbs 28:8). Who is “one who cares for the poor”? This is Esau. Is Esau one who cares for the poor? Is he not one who exploits the poor? Rather, he was like generals, commanders, and governors who invade cities, rob, and plunder, and when they return they say: ‘Bring us the poor and we will support them.’ The folk proverb says: She prostitutes herself for apples and distributes them to the ill.  Another matter, what is: “Amasses it for one who cares for the poor”? Everything that the Babylonian kingdom gathers in this world, the Holy One blessed be He gives it to Israel in the future, as it is stated: “Its merchandise and its fee will be sacred to the Lord” (Isaiah 23:18).  Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you lend money and do not take interest from him, you are My people. Just as I will never stumble, so, too, you will never stumble,’ as it is stated: “He does not lend with usury” (Psalms 15:5) and it is written: “One who performs these will never stumble” (Psalms 15:5).</p>

(See Ketuvot 39b) If the father or the girl refuse the marriage, if her father steadfastly refuses to let her be married to her seducer, her seducer must nonetheless pay the price paid for virgins who become married for the first time. That price is 50 shekel, and this is the reason why the word: ישקל “he must weigh it,” is used here. This is also the amount of compensation paid for having raped a virgin. (Ketuvot 38b) and the amount that is required to be written in the marriage contract for a virgin (Ketuvot 10a) [We are familiar with this expression from when Avraham weighed the silver pieces to Efron in Genesis 23,16 in order to acquire Sarah’s burial plot, the cave and field of Machpelah.

[The question is why he had to repeat this, having just requested it in the previous verse. Ed.] If you were to answer that there were many caves and many fields, and he wanted to specify which one he had in mind, and his son might not know which one he referred to, he spelled out the name of the cave and the field, In the event that people would object to his being buried there, Yaakov gave him details of the transaction that had taken place between Avraham, Efron and the townspeople at the time, and he presumably handed him the document that testified to the sale of both the field and the cave at the time. (Genesis 23,16-18) He left out no detail that could be considered pertinent to ensure that there could be no legal impediment that Joseph would have to face.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Say little and do a lot. How so? This teaches us that the righteous say little and do a lot, but the wicked say a lot and don’t do anything at all. And how do we know that the righteous say little and do a lot? For this is what we find with Abraham our forefather, who said to the angels, “Have a piece of bread with me today,” as it says (Genesis 18:5), “I will get a piece of bread, and you can dine to your heart’s content.” But then after that, look at what Abraham did for the angels who serve God! He went and prepared three bulls and nine measures of fine flour for them! And how do we know that he prepared nine measures of fine flour? Because it says (Genesis 18:6), “Abraham hurried into the tent, to Sarah, and said: Hurry! Three measures of fine flour! The word three refers to the first three [measures], the word fine brings it to six, and the word flour makes nine. And how do we know that he prepared three bulls for them? Because it says (Genesis 18:7), “Abraham ran to the cattle [and selected a good, tender calf].” Cattle is one [bull]. Calf is two. Tender is three. (And some say that good was four.) “Then he gave it to the boy, who hurried to prepare it.” That is, he gave it to Ishmael, in order to train him in performing the mitzvot. Even the Holy Blessed One said little and did a lot, as it says (Genesis 15:13–14), “[God] said to Abram: Know well that your offspring will be strangers in a land not their own, and they shall be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years. But I will judge the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall go out with great wealth.” God spoke of this judgment with only the two letters dalet and nun, which spell the word dan (judge). But when the time came to pay back the enemies of Israel, God used seventy-two letters to do it, as it says (Deuteronomy 4:34), “Or has any god attempted to come and take one nation out from another, with great acts, signs, and wonders, and with awesome power?” From this you learn that when the enemies of Israel were made to pay for what they had done, they paid with seventy-two letters. And how do we know that the wicked say a lot and don’t do anything at all? For this is what we find with Ephron, who said to Abraham (Genesis 23:15), “A piece of land worth four hundred pieces of silver; [what is that between you and me?]” [as if he was willing to give away the land for free]. But in the end, when Abraham went to give him the payment, it says, “Abraham understood Ephron, and paid him the money” [and he simply accepted it].</p>

              </summary>
              <p>From where do we derive this principle that the wicked say much and do not do even a little? We derive it from Ephron. Initially, it is written that Ephron said to Abraham: “A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you?” (Genesis 23:15). And ultimately it is written: “And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant” (Genesis 23:16), i.e., shekels that could be used in any location. This teaches that not only did Ephron take shekels from Abraham, he took from him only centenaria [kantarei], i.e., superior coins, as there is a place where they call a shekel a centenarius.</p>

Additionally, any unspecified silver shekel mentioned in the Prophets is a silver litra, weighing twenty-five sela, and any unspecified silver shekel mentioned in the Writings is in centenaria [kintarin], silver weighing one hundred sela. This is the case throughout the Bible except for the silver of Ephron, where even though it is written in the Torah: “Shekels of silver,” without specification, it is in centenaria, as it is written: “Four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant” (Genesis 23:16). This means that the silver was acceptable as shekels everywhere, and there is a place where they call a centenarius a shekel.</p>

The field and cave were outside Kiryat Arba, previously known as Mamre. The field became Abraham's possession, transitioning from a commoner to a king. The field and cave were established as Abraham's property, including the surrounding area and access path to the cave. The field's spiritual value rose by becoming Abraham's property, extending along the length of the town. The location was previously known by different names, indicating the history of its ownership. Abraham acquired the field and cave, not just the cave alone.</summary>

Here it is described in precise detail, i.e. ממרא היא חברון, whereas previously it had been described as קרית ארבע, “the city of the four;” later on during the lifetime of Yaakov it has been described as ממרא קרית הארבע היא חברון, (Genesis 35,27) a location where both Avraham and Yitzchok had been residents at one time or another. Earlier. in connection with Avraham, (12,18) he had been described as having settled in Kiryat Arba which is described there as “part of Chevron.” This was meant to tell us that Mamre was the original founder who had built himself a town adjacent to Chevron which had previously been inhabited by Hittites. He called that new town “Mamre,” thus memorializing himself. The “groves” of Mamre, i.e. אלוני ממרא, were situated at the entrance to that town. The cave of Machpelah, in another direction, at that time had belonged to the Hittites. After Mamre’s death, a giant by the name of Arba became very powerful and claimed the entire area, naming it Arba after himself. Several centuries later, when the Israelites had defeated most of Canaanite tribes they called that town Chevron.</p>

But the real meaning of the verse is: The field and the cave that was therein and all the trees … became secured to Abraham as a possession etc. (i. e. verse 17 is an incomplete sentence and must be read together with verse 18, thus: ויקם השדה וגו… לאברהם למקנה —The field etc. became secured to Abraham as a possession). </p>

[Accordingly,] ויקם does not mean acquisition, as in (Vayikra 25:30): “The house in the walled city shall be established (וקם), to the one who bought it,” where Rashi explains that possession is transferred from the seller to the buyer’s control. This is because there, the verse mentions the buyer after וקם, unlike here. [You might object: Here too, the next verse says]: “This became Avraham’s through a purchase” — [thus mentioning the buyer after ויקם.

              </summary>
              <p>The simple meaning of the verse is: The field came into... It seems we could ask either way: If the simple meaning works well, [why do we need the first explanation?] Rashi does not usually bring a Midrash without reason! And if the simple meaning does not work well, why bring it? This question should be asked whenever Rashi brings both. The answer is: The simple meaning, on its own, raises a question. It is redundant to say, “The field of Ephron... became Avraham’s through a purchase.” Why say, “Of Ephron”? Do we not already know it was his field? Perforce, an elevation took place specifically for the field of Ephron—it previously belonged to a commoner, Ephron. However, the exposition by the Midrash of “elevation,” when on its own, also raises a question. The verse already said, “The field of Ephron was established.” Why say again, “The field and the cave...”? A further problem with the Midrash, [when on its own, is that] the next verse לאברהם למקנה. becomes somewhat disjointed Thus Rashi brings also the simple meaning: the field, etc, came into Avraham’s possession. It says, “The field of Ephron,” and then repeats, “The field and the cave...” in order to indicate both explanations. Accordingly, ויקם applies to both. It applies to “The field of Ephron” to indicate “elevation.” And it applies to “The field and the cave” to indicate that it came into Avraham’s possession. In the simple meaning, ויקם denotes that possession of the field was transferred from the seller’s control and was established to the buyer, as Rashi exsimpleed on (Vayikra 25:30), “The house in the walled city shall be established (וקם)...” The questions of Re’m, and of the Minchas Yehudah who came after him, are thus resolved. There is no need for their forced explanations, as ויקם שדה and וקם הבית both mean the same. In the simple meaning, ויקם השדה means that possession of the field was established in the buyer’s control, the same as Rashi exsimpleed for וקם הבית. Rashi understands the word וקם to mean “shall be established,” and only says “in the control of the buyer” to exsimple that verse’s following phrase: “To the one who bought it.” The same applies here: ויקם means the field was established to Avraham. Whereas Re’m and Minchas Yehudah understood that according to Rashi there, וקם means “acquisition” [and thus conflicts with its meaning here]. But this is not so, and it is difficult to understand why they said this. (R. Meir Stern) </p>

              <p>THE term kam (he rose) is a homonym. In one of its significations it is the opposite of “to sit,” as “He did not rise (kam) nor move for him” (Esth. 5:9). It further denotes the confirmation and verification of a thing, e.g.: “The Lord will verify (yakem) His promise” (1 Sam. 1:23); “The field of Ephron was made sure (va-yakom) as the property of Abraham” (Gen. 23:17). “The house that is in the walled city shall be established (ve-kam)” (Lev. 25:30); “And the kingdom of Israel shall be firmly established (ve-kamah) in thy hand” (1 Sam. 24:21). It is always in this sense that the verb is employed with reference to the Almighty; as “Now shall I rise (akum), saith the Lord” (Ps. 12:6), which is the same as saying, “Now shall I verify my word and my dispensation for good or evil.” “Thou shalt arise (takum) and have mercy upon Zion” (Ps. 102:13), which means: Thou wilt establish what thou hast promised, viz., that thou wouldst pity Zion.</p>

              <p>“The field of Ephron that was in Makhpela that was before Mamre, the field and the cave that was in it, and every tree that was in the field, that was within its border all around, were established” (Genesis 23:17).  “As possession for Abraham before the children of Ḥet, of all coming to his city gate” (Genesis 23:18).  “The field of Ephron…were established [vayakam]” – it had been lowly and was now elevated [vekamat], as it had belonged to an insignificant person and now it became that of a great person.  “The field of Ephron that was in Makhpela” – this teaches that it doubled [nikhpelu] in value in the eyes of everyone, (After Abraham acquired it.)  and that anyone who is buried in it can be certain that his reward is doubled [kaful]. (Due to its great sanctity.)  Rabbi Abahu said: It is because the Holy One blessed be He folded up [kafaf] the [great] height of Adam the first man (See Bereshit Rabba 12:6.)  and buried him in it [the Cave of Makhpela].  “The field and the cave that was in it…” – Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said: From where is it derived what we learned: One who sells his field must write down the field and its [specific] border markers? It is from here: “The field and the cave that was in it, and every tree that was in the field that was within its border all around, as possession for Abraham before the children of Ḥet.”  Rabbi Elazar said: How many inkwells are emptied, how many quills are broken in order to write “the sons of Ḥet”? (It is repeated so frequently that it must use a good deal of ink and many pens to write it when a scribe writes a Torah.)  “The sons of Ḥet” is repeated ten times, corresponding to the Ten Commandments, to teach you that anyone who endorses the transaction of a righteous man, it is as though he fulfilled the Ten Commandments.  Rabbi Yudan said: “The sons of Barzilai” is written five times, (In I Kings chapter 2.)  corresponding to the five books of the Torah, to teach you that anyone who feeds a slice of bread to a righteous man, (As Barzilai fed David (see II Samuel 17:27).)  it is as though he fulfilled the five books of the Torah.</p>

              <p>R. Juda the Nasi, taxed the Rabbis with the expense of the fortified wall of the city. Resh Lakish said to him: &quot;The Rabhis did not need any guard, for it is written (Ps. 139, 18) Should I count them, they would be more numerous than the sand. Shall we assume that this refers to the righteous, since concerning all Israel it is written (Gen. 23, 17) As the sand ichich are upon the sea-shore. How can it be possible that the righteous should be more than the sands? We must therefore say that it refers to the deeds of the righteous which, if counted, would be more numerous than the sand. Now, if the little sands guard the sea, howmuch more should the acts of the upright, which are more than the sands, guard their performers?&quot; Wiien Resh Lakish came before R. Jochanan, the latter said: &quot;Why not say from the following (Songs 8, 10) I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof; i.e., I am a wall, refers to the Torah. And my breast like the towers thereof, (Fol. 8) refers to the scholars.&quot; Resh Lakish, however, explains the last passage as Raba did, namely: &quot;I am a wall, refers to the congregation of Israel; And my breasts like the towers thereof, refers to the house of prayer and the houses of learning.&quot; R. Huna b. R. Chisda taxed the Rabbis. R. Nachman b. Isaac said to him: &quot;By this act you have transgressed the Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa. The Pentateuch (Deut. 33, 3) Yea, Thou also lovest the tribes; all their saints were in Thy hand: and they prostrate before Thy feet, received Thy words. Thus said Moses before the Holy One, praised be He: 'Sovereign of the Universe, even when Thou lovest the heathens, the saints of Israel shall be in Thy hand;' (i.e., they shall be guarded by Thee). The prophets (Hos. 8, 10) But even though they should be given among the nations, now will I gather them up; and they shall be humbled by reason of the burden of king and princes. And Raba said: 'This verse was written in the Aramaic language, [the expression vitnu (given) should be read yishnu (to study)]; i.e., if all the Israelites who are in exile should occupy themselves with the study of the Torah, the gathering of them would be at hand soon; but if only a few of them study, then they should be exempt merely from the burdens imposed by kings or princes.' And the Hagiographa (Ezra 7, 24) No one shall be empowered to impose any tax, tribute, or toil, etc. And R. Juda said: 'This refers to all kinds of taxes.' &quot; </p>

He also discusses the significance of &quot;לפקדיהם&quot; in relation to atonement and the count of the Israelites.

              <p>Upon hearing this Pharaoh said: קומו צאו, &quot;arise and depart.&quot; In other words Pharaoh freed the Israelites by this proclamation. The expression קומו, &quot;arise,&quot; may even contain a hint of Pharaoh's granting the Israelites a &quot;higher status&quot; than they had possessed heretofore. Bereshit Rabbah 58,8 explains Genesis 23,17 where the field and cave of Machpelah are described as ויקם, having arisen. Whereas previously, before Abraham's purchase, the field and cave belonged to a low-life such as Efron, the field and cave &quot;rose&quot; to a higher status by becoming the property of a man of the calibre of Abraham. At any rate, Pharaoh believed that by declaring the Israelites a free people without any further ado, he could free himself of the plague of the dying of the firstborn. If they did not leave immediately, their continued stay could not be blamed on him.</p>

              <p>Our sages comment that a sinner causes his head to be bowed as a result of his sins. Evil is defined as something which causes man to look only at what is below him, at the ground, whereas קדושה, sanctity, results in raising up one's head and elevating a person spiritually. We note that the Torah describes even the cave of Machpelah as undergoing an elevation after Abraham purchased it (Genesis 23,17). Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 58,8 describe the cave as undergoing an elevation. Inasmuch as the Torah commands this count after the sin of the golden calf as Rashi concluded based on the words ונתת אותו על עבודת אהל מועד &quot;and you will appoint it for the service of the Tent of Meeting&quot; in verse 16, we can understand why the expression כי תשא, &quot;when you will raise,&quot; is appropriate. We encounter a similar use of the word תשא in Genesis 40,13 when the Torah refers to Pharaoh &quot;raising&quot; the head of the chief of the butlers who would be reinstated into his position. In our case, the Israelites will be enabled to hold their heads high again as a result of this count which served as atonement for the sin of the golden calf. Up until this time they had not felt able to raise their heads due to the shame of having had a part in that sin. לפקדיהם, &quot;according to their number;&quot; this is to be understood as parallel to Numbers 31,49 where the Torah states that not a single one of the 12,000 men whom Moses had sent on the punitive expedition against the Midianites had become a casualty during that war. There too the words נשאו את ראש meant that &quot;they counted the sum.&quot; Shabbat 64 explains that the words ולא נפקד ממנו איש, meant that not a single one of those soldiers was guilty of a sin. ונתנו איש כפר נפשו, &quot;each one will give (this) as ransom for his soul to G'd.&quot; This is a reference to the Israelites each having forfeited their lives through participation in the sin of the golden calf. בפקד אותם, &quot;when numbering them.&quot; The meaning is literal. </p>

              <p>THE CAVE OF MACHPELAH. Rashi comments: “It had a lower and an upper cave. Another explanation [of why it was called Machpelah — the root of which is keiphel (double)] — is that it was ‘doubled’ on account of the four couples who were buried there: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah”. But this is incorrect since Scripture states, the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah. (Verse 17 here.)  Thus we see that it is the name of the place in which the field was located, and there is no need to search for a reason for the names of places. In Bereshith Rabbah, the Sages have said: (55:10.)  “The Holy One, blessed be He, bent double the stature of the first man and He buried him there.” In their opinion, this entire place was always called Machpelah though the people did not know the reason for it for Ephron sold him everything for the price of the field unaware that there was a grave in it. Abraham, on the other hand, desired only that he should sell him the cave which was in the end of the field, and the field might be retained by Ephron. But Ephron by way of good conduct or trickery, [possibly hoping to receive a higher price for the larger transaction], said that he would give him the field and the cave which was in it since it would be unbecoming for such an honorable person to own the cave as a possession for a burial-place while the field belonged to another. Abraham rejoiced at this suggestion, and he purchased it in its entirety for the price that Ephron mentioned.</p>

              <p>The Gemara asks: From where are these matters, i.e., that a grafted carob and a sycamore trunk are not included in the sale of a field, derived? Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: As the verse states: “So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave that was within it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the boundaries around, were established for Abraham as a possession” (Genesis 23:17–18). This teaches that anything that requires a boundary around it, as it does not have natural demarcations, is included in the sale of a field. This excludes these trees, i.e., the grafted carob and the sycamore trunk, which do not require a boundary around them, as they stand out individually on their own. Rav Mesharshiyya says: From here there is a source that the acquisition of the actual boundaries in a sale is from the Torah.</p>

Abraham's prayers for Adam and Eve were reflected in his actions of burying Sarah. The Midrash highlights Sarah's virtues and Abraham's deep love and honor towards her. Abraham and Sarah served as a rectification for Adam and Eve, ensuring their continuity in the afterlife. Rabbeinu Bahya and Ramban discuss the symbolic significance of the patriarchs' actions, while Targum simply states that Abraham buried Sarah in the cave of Machpelah.</summary>

            <summary>Abraham buried Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah in Hebron, in the land of Canaan, to emphasize that she died and was buried in the land of Israel, not the land of the Philistines. The purchase of the burial plot highlights the superiority of the land of Israel, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham. The repetition of details about the location serves to honor the burial place of the patriarchs and demonstrate the significance of familial bonds in Jewish tradition. The completion of the acquisition of the field by Abraham was solidified through the burial of Sarah on the land.</summary>

(I.E. points out that verse 20 does not repeat verse 17. The latter states that the field was made sure as a possession, the former that it was made sure as a burial ground for Abraham and his descendants (Filwarg).)  Scripture tells of the purchase of the field of Machpelah to teach us of the superiority of the land of Israel over all countries, both for the living and the dead. Moreover, it informs us that God’s word to Abraham that he would possess the land as an inheritance was fulfilled. (Abraham now began to take actual possession of the land of Israel (Filwarg).) </p>

              <p>The Torah wanted to confirm that the transaction complied with all and every legal form of acquisition. The words &quot;afterwards&quot; mean that once Abraham had weighed the money for Efron the latter had foregone all claim to that property in perpetuity. Maimonides explains it thus in chapter one of Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah: &quot;A Gentile loses his right to formerly owned property the moment he accepts the money as compensation for it. A Jew, on the other hand, does not acquire title to his new property until he has a written document. Once this has occurred the property in question is like land in the desert which anyone can stake a claim to.&quot; In other words, once the Gentile has accepted the money he loses all former claims. Had Abraham buried Sarah before giving the money to Efron, the fact that he gave the money to Efron afterwards would not have made a full acquisition, seeing that the act of possession expressed by his burying Sarah would not have been performed on land owned by him at the time. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>We need to examine if the act of חזקה, i.e. using the land for one's own purpose, is actually legally valid when the act of such חזקה is performed on land previously owned by a Gentile. In chapter two of the above-mentioned tractate of Maimonides, he writes as follows: &quot;In the case of formerly ownerless property, or property formerly owned by a proselyte, the fact that the squatter (Jewish) has eaten the proceeds of such land for a number of years does not constitute an act of acquisition of either tree or the land itself until such time as the squatter has performed an act on the body of the land itself. What kind of activity would qualify in such an event? In the case of a Jew having taken over the house of a proselyte or an abandoned house, if he whitewashed it or added a moulding about 60 centimeters high this would constitute a valid act of acquisition. If he took earth from high ground and transferred it to fill lower ground in the same piece of land this would be considered as an improvement of the earth and would qualify as an act of acquisition.&quot; It is clear therefore that if the squatter merely shifted some earth without specific intent to effect an improvement on that soil- even though he thereby levelled the ground,- this would not be enough to qualify under the heading of קנין, acquisition. Maggid Mishneh (a commentator on Maimonides) writes that if the squatter spread mats on the ground in order to be able to sit on it in comfort and to enjoy this, this would count as a valid act of קנין, acquisition. An alternative cited by the above commentator suggests that even spreading the mats merely in order to improve the appearance of the ground in question suffices. Rabbi lbn Migosh concurs with the latter example. Thus far the quotation from Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah. Granted that according to the first example cited by the Maggid Mishneh anyone who benefits from an act performed on the land he squats on performs a valid act of חזקה, Abraham benefited by having buried Sarah on that land and thereby performed an act of acquisition; however, according to the opinion of Rabbi lbn Migosh that an actual improvement of the land has to take place, Sarah's burial would not have constituted such an improvement. How then did Abraham acquire that land (even though Efron had forfeited it)?</p>

              <p>Perhaps the superstructure erected around the grave, and especially the sepulchral chambers dug within the earth which was customary at the time, constituted such an improvement in the field under discussion. These sepulchral chambers were probably white-washed with lime to prevent the earth around them from crumbling. Now we can understand the reason the Torah repeated the words ויקם השדה. It means that after Abraham had buried Sarah the acquisition of that field by Abraham became complete.</p>

              <p>AND AFTER THIS, ABRAHAM BURIED SARAH HIS WIFE IN THE CAVE OF THE FIELD OF MACHPELAH BEFORE MAMRE — THE SAME IS HEBRON — IN THE LAND OF CANAAN. The reason why Scripture reverts to clarify the field, the place and the land is that the whole section mentioned the sons of Heth and Ephron the Hittite. Therefore Scripture mentions at the conclusion that the field was in the land of Canaan which is the land of Israel. And so it said at the beginning of the section: in Kiryath arba — the same is Hebron — in the land of Canaan. (Above, Verse 2.)  All this is to explain that the righteous woman died in the land of Israel, and there she was interred, as the Hittites were of the families of Canaan. (Ibid., 10:15.)  In my opinion, the reason for the verses is only to mention that this was the land of Canaan, not the land of the Philistines. Having said, And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days, (Ibid., 21:34.)  and since all his habitats were in that land — in Gerar, (Ibid., 20:1.)  and the valley of Gerar, (Further, 26:17-18.)  and Beer-sheba, (Above, 22:19.)  and from there to Hebron and back — Scripture therefore mentioned that Hebron is in the land of the Canaanite who dwelt in that hill country, (Numbers 14:45.)  not in the land of the Philistines, which is mentioned in connection with Abraham. And in the end Scripture added a phrase to inform us that the cave was in the field of Machpelah before Mamre, for this was the name by which it was known. This section was written to inform us of G-d’s kindnesses to Abraham, i.e., that in the land in which he came to live he was regarded as a prince of G-d, (Above, Verse 6.)  and each individual as well as all the people called him “my lord” although he did not tell them that he was a prince and a great man. Also, in his lifetime G-d fulfilled His promise to him: And I will make thy name great, and thou shalt be a blessing. (Ibid., 12:2.)  Moreover, his wife died and was buried in the inheritance of the Eternal. (I Samuel 26:19. A reference to the land of Israel.)  Further, Scripture wanted to inform us of the place of the burial of the patriarchs since we are obligated to honor the burial place of our holy ancestors. Our Rabbis said (Sanhedrin 111a.)  that this also was one of the trials of Abraham: he desired a place to bury Sarah but did not find it until he purchased it, [despite G-d’s promise that the entire land would be given to him]. I do not know a reason for the words of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, who says that the purpose of this section is to let us know the superiority of the land of Israel as regards the living and the dead, and also to fulfill the word of G-d which promised him that the land would be an inheritance of his. But what superiority of the land was thus demonstrated? Abraham would not have carried her to another land to bury her, and the word of G-d to Abraham applied to the whole land, and that was fulfilled only with his seed.</p>

Es liegt darin der Gedanke, daß der Ort, welcher für das Begräbnis gewünscht wird, einen besonderen Wert für den zu Begrabenden oder dessen Angehörige habe. Er soll nicht nur begraben, sondern gerade dort begraben werden. Da tritt denn nun die Überlieferung hinzu, daß Saras Leiche nicht die erste dort zu begrabende gewesen. Schon ruhten dort Adam und Eva. Das Elternpaar der Menschheit waren die ersten, die dort begraben, zu ihnen sollte sich das Elternpaar des jüdischen Volkes, dieses geistige Elternpaar der Menschheit, gesellen; darum hatte sich Abraham gerade diese Höhle ersehen.</p>

              <p>Die Örtlichkeit, von welcher die Höhle den Namen trägt, hieß: מכפלה, und weist dieser Name von כפל, doppelt, auf eine gepaarte räumliche Gestaltung hin. Es scheint, daß die Örtlichkeit aus paarweise geschichteten Höhlen bestand, die sich also von selbst der Bestattung von im Tode wie im Leben vereinten Gattenpaaren darbot, wie ja denn dort Adam und Eva, Abraham und Sara, Jizchak und Rebekka, Jakob und Lea ruhen. Der erste Besitz, den der jüdische Stamm an seinem Lande erhielt, waren Gräberpaare, die der erste Jude für sich und demnächst auch für sich und seine Kinder und Enkel mit ihren Frauen erkaufte. Der Gedanke an den Wert der Familienbande, die dem Manne sein Weib und den Kindern ihre Eltern ans Herz knüpfen, war fortan unzertrennlich mit dem jüdischen Boden verknüpft, bildete fortan den Grundzug in dem Charakter des Juden, und befähigte ihn, das zu werden, was er geworden. Vielleicht stammt hiervon auch der Name Chebron, der fortan dem Orte beigelegt wurde. חברון heißt ja: der innige Aneinanderschluss, der bezeichnendste Name für die Innigkeit, welche den jüdischen Mann und das jüdische Weib als Gatte und Gattin, als Vater und Mutter im Leben und durchs Leben gleichsam in eins zusammenwachsen lässt. Noch in der nationalen Blüte der späteren Jahrhunderte stieg kein Tagesopfer auf der Moriahöhe in Jeruschalaim empor, bevor nicht der Priesterherold von des Tempels Zinne den Morgenstrahl über die Gräber der Väter und Mütter zu Chebron leuchten gesehen — כבוד אב ואם ist dem Juden die Vorbedingung und Wurzel für כבוד המקום. —</p>

The reason is that throughout the inhabitants of that land had been described as members of the tribe known as Hittites, a major tribe of the Canaanite nation, Whenever “the land of Canaan” is mentioned, the Torah, by implication, reminds us of the loving Providence of G’d Who gave this ancestral land to the Jewish nation. Although Avraham had only come to that land as a stranger with no claim on any part of that land, he had risen to be a highly respected member of that society, so much so that the people ceded a little of their ancestral land to have him use it as his in perpetuity.
    An additional reason for describing this location in such detail was so that we should be aware of where our patriarchs have been buried, in order to honour their memory on the occasions when we are obligated to honour the dead of our people who had led sainted lives .by visiting their graves.

The spirit of prophecy cried out and said, &quot;A capable wife, who can find her...&quot; This can be compared to a skilled ship captain who conquered the waters and winds. Suddenly, pirates attacked him and he fought them off. Later, he came to a treacherous strait and a strong wind shattered his ship. He begged for mercy from the people around him, saying, &quot;Yesterday, I conquered the waters and killed the pirates. Now, I ask others to save me.&quot; They replied, &quot;When your ship was strong, you were a hero and didn't need our help. Now that your ship is broken, you seek our aid.&quot; Similarly, Abraham was a hero and fought off the pirates when they attacked him (Genesis 14:15). He also divided his wealth among himself, Ishmael, and his household of 318 people (Genesis 14:14). He saw his own strength on the day of Isaac's circumcision (Genesis 17:26) and was blessed by God (Genesis 14:19). Now, you say, &quot;I am a stranger and a resident, etc.&quot; He said to them, &quot;What shall I do? My wife has died, as it is written 'And I will bury my dead, etc.' (Genesis 23:4).&quot; Immediately, Abraham grew old. &quot;A woman of valor, who can find her?&quot; (Proverbs 31:10). This is Sarah, for &quot;a woman of beautiful appearance&quot; (Genesis 12:11), her husband trusted in her. &quot;Please say that you are my sister&quot; (Genesis 12:13). &quot;And he had abundant livestock&quot; (Genesis 13:2). His camel was good and not evil, and Abraham treated it well for her (Genesis 12:16). She sought wool and flax, for she also fulfilled the commandments like Abraham. &quot;Whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her voice, for in Isaac shall your offspring be called&quot; (Genesis 21:12). She was like a merchant ship that had been across the river and came to the land of Canaan. &quot;And she rose up in the middle of the night, and Abraham rose early in the morning, etc.&quot; (Genesis 19:27). She planned a field and took it, which was the field of Machpelah, as it is written &quot;So the field and the cave in it were established&quot; (Genesis 23:20). She planted a vineyard with the fruit of her hands, for &quot;the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel&quot; (Isaiah 5:7). She girded her loins with strength when the angels came to eat with Abraham and said to her, &quot;Quickly, make three seahs, etc.&quot; (Genesis 18:6). The reason was that she was a good trader, and to Sarah he said, &quot;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver, etc.&quot; (Genesis 20:16). She sent out her hand with the spindle, etc. (Proverbs 31:19). She drove out this maidservant (Genesis 21:10). &quot;Do not be afraid for your household from snow, for the Holy One, blessed be He, made an agreement with him that in the merit of circumcision and Sabbath, his sons will not descend to Gehenna. For every household that is circumcised has two Sabbath days and clothing. She made coverings for herself when they asked him, &quot;Where is Sarah, your wife?&quot; And he said, &quot;Behold, in the tent&quot; (Genesis 18:9). They said to her, &quot;Behold, you are with child, and your sons are destined to be priests, to wear the priestly garments and to serve in the Tent of Meeting, as it is written 'And they shall make the ephod, etc.'&quot; (Exodus 28:6). When Sarah died, he leapt upon her, old and aged. Immediately, her husband became known in the gates, etc.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>[(Gen. 24:1:) NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.] This text is related (to Ps. 25:10): ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH. The beginning of Torah is steadfast love, its middle is steadfast love, and its end is steadfast love. (See above, 4:1 &amp; 4; Eccl. R. 7:2:2.)  Its beginning is steadfast love in that he has rendered steadfast love to bridegrooms and brides. He rendered steadfast love to Adam and Eve, as stated (in Gen. 2:22): THEN GOD BUILT THE RIB &lt; WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE MAN INTO A WOMAN &gt;. R. Abbahu said: In Arabia they call the plaited coiffure a &quot;building.&quot; (Cf. Ber. 61a; Shab. 95a; Erub. 18a; Nid. 45b; ARN, A, 4; Gen. R. 18:1; M. Pss. 25:11.)  The Holy One adorned Eve and brought her to Adam. (Cf. Gen. R. 8:13.)  Do you suppose that he brought her to him under an olive tree? Or under a fig tree? Our masters have said: The Holy One made thirteen bridal canopies for Adam and Eve, as stated (in Ezek. 28:13): YOU WERE IN EDEN, THE GARDEN OF GOD; &lt; EVERY PRECIOUS STONE WAS YOUR COVERING: CARNELIAN, CHRYSOLITE, AMETHYST, BERYL, LAPIS LAZULI, JASPER, SAPPHIRE, TURQUOISE, EMERALD, AND GOLD &gt;. And the least of them is gold; for so it is written: EMERALD, AND GOLD (i.e., with gold in last place). Thus &lt; there were &gt; thirteen bridal canopies which were made for Adam and Eve. (Since Ezek. lists only nine stones plus gold, according to BB 75a there were only ten canopies; or perhaps eleven, with EVERY PRECIOUS STONE representing the extra one. Lev. R. 20:2 explains the tradition of thirteen by having EVERY PRECIOUS STONE represent three canopies. Similarly Gen. R. 18:2; Eccl. R. 8:1:2; PRK 4:4; PR 14:10.)  R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina: The Holy One adorned Eve with twenty-four ornaments. And not only that, but he took her by the hand and brought her to Adam. R. Abbin Berabbi the Levite said: Blessed is a provincial who has seen this: the king taking &lt; his bride &gt; by the hand and bringing her to the house for him. (Gen. R. 18:3.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 2:22, cont.): AND BROUGHT HER TO ADAM. Ergo (in Ps. 25:10): ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH. Thus the beginning of Torah is steadfast love. Its middle also is steadfast love. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 35:8): THEN REBEKAH'S NURSE, DEBORAH, DIED. When she had died, what is written (ibid.)? AND ITS NAME (i.e., the name of her burial place) WAS CALLED WEEPING OAK, for Jacob was sitting there and weeping over her. The Holy One said: Jacob is sitting and grieving. He appeared to him visibly, as stated (in vs. 9): NOW THE LORD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN… &lt; AND BLESSED HIM &gt;. (Eccl. R. 7:2:3; see Gen. R. 8:13; 82:1.)  And its end is steadfast love, &lt; as seen in the case &gt; of Moses; for, when he passed away, he buried him. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 34:6): AND &lt; THE LORD &gt; BURIED HIM IN THE VALLEY IN THE LAND OF MOAB. Ergo (in Ps. 25:10): ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH. (Cf. M. Pss. 25:11, which derives from the verse that the Holy One adorns brides (Gen. 2:22), visits the sick (Gen. 18:1), and buries the dead (Deut. 34:6).)  Abraham persisted in clinging to a measure of steadfast love. The Holy One said to him: This measure was mine and you have taken it. By your life, I am making you &lt; old &gt; like me. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Dan. 7:9): AS I LOOKED, THRONES WERE SET IN PLACE, AND THE ANCIENT OF DAYS TOOK HIS SEAT. HIS GARMENT WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW, &lt; AND THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD WAS LIKE PURE WOOL &gt;. (See Gen. R. 58:9.)  What is written elsewhere on the matter (in Gen. 23:19)? THEN AFTERWARDS ABRAHAM BURIED HIS WIFE SARAH. (In doing so, Abraham showed his steadfast love.)  He persisted in clinging to her. The Holy One said to him. You deserve a crown. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD (i.e., with a crown of white hair).</p>

              <p>And Abraham was old, and well stricken in years (Gen. 24:1). Scripture states elsewhere in reference to this verse: A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband (Prov. 12:4). This verse alludes to Abraham, who mourned for Sarah, for it was written previously: And Sarah died (Gen. 23:2). Abraham began to weep for her, saying: A woman of valor who can find? For her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her (Prov. 31:10). When did he demonstrate his trust in her? When he said to her: Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister (Gen. 12:13). She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life (Prov. 31:12). She seeketh between wool and flax (ibid., v. 13) alludes to her decision to separate Isaac and Ishmael when she said to her husband: Cast out this bondwoman and her son (Gen. 21:10). She is like the merchant ships (Prov. 31:14); For the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house (Gen. 12:15), and later Abimelech sent her away. She riseth also while it is yet night (Prov. 31:15). When did that happen? At the time Abraham arose early in the morning (Gen. 22:3). She considereth a field and buyeth it (Prov. 31:16). She thought about the field of Machpelah and acquired it. Ultimately she was buried there, as it is said: And after this, Abraham buried Sarah, his wife (Gen. 23:19). She girdeth her loins with strength (for the birth of Isaac) (Prov. 31:17). When was that? When the angels appeared, as it is said: And Abraham went into the tent unto Sarah (Gen. 18:6).</p>

This is reflected in the Zohar's interpretation of Genesis 23,19 and 2,4, where Abraham's actions secure the continuity of Adam and Eve through him.

              </summary>
              <p>I shall now explain all these matters step by step. Regarding the statement that Abraham and Sarah were the תקון for Adam and Eve, the Zohar on this portion (page 34 Sullam edition) writes as follows: Rabbi Shimon said that when Abraham entered the cave of Machpelah to bury Sarah, Adam and Eve arose as they did not want to remain buried in there. They complained that they had suffered sufficient disgrace in the world beyond the grave where they were now having to face G–d, because they had been guilty of bringing sin into the world. Now they should suffer additional shame when constantly having to face a pair of humans so much better than they? Abraham replied that he was prepared to pray to G–d on Adam's behalf so that he would cease to suffer embarassment before G–d in the future and so that G–d would forgive Adam his sin. Immediately after that Abraham buried his wife Sarah. What is the meaning of the words ואחרי כן, &quot;after that.” in 23,19? It means that Abraham proceeded to bury Sarah as soon as the dialogue between him and Adam was over. The Torah writes that אברהם קבר את שרה, instead of אברהם קבר לשרה. This means that he also reburied חוה. After that the minds of Adam and Eve were put at rest. This is the meaning of אלה תולדות השמים והארץ בהבראם &quot;and these are the generations of heaven and earth&quot; (Genesis 2,4), meaning that those created as a mixture of heaven and earth endure only by the grace of Abraham (the letters in the word בהבראם). Adam and Eve, of course, were not descendants of man; they were created by G–d. Their continuity was assured through Abraham, their תולדות are through אברהם. We have further proof from Genesis 23,20 which describes the field of Machpelah “ויקם” as a hereditary possession for Abraham. Until that time, as is apparent, Adam and Eve had not had a firm hold on the world beyond the grave. The word ויקם is derived from קיום, a permanent existence. Thus far the Zohar.  Abraham assured Adam's permanent status in the hereafter; Sarah did the same for Eve.</p>

We also find that Sarah was buried at the site she died as the Torah wrote: “Sarah died at Kiryat Arba which is presently called Hebron,” i.e. she died in Hebron and was buried in Hebron as the Torah reports in Genesis 23,19 “afterwards (after the purchase of the local burial ground) Avraham buried his wife Sarah.” We also find that Miriam was buried where she died (Numbers 20,1)</p>

              <p>AND ABRAM PASSED THROUGH THE LAND. I will tell you a principle by which you will understand all the coming portions of Scripture concerning Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is indeed a great matter which our Rabbis mentioned briefly, saying: (Tanchuma Lech Lecha, 9.)  “Whatever has happened to the patriarchs is a sign to the children.” It is for this reason that the verses narrate at great length the account of the journeys of the patriarchs, the digging of the wells, and other events. Now someone may consider them unnecessary and of no useful purpose, but in truth they all serve as a lesson for the future: when an event happens to any one of the three patriarchs, that which is decreed to happen to his children can be understood. Concerning all decisions of “the guardians [angels],” (Daniel 4:14.)  know that when they proceed from a potential decree to a symbolic act, the decree will in any case be effected. It is for this reason that the prophets often perform some act in conjunction with the prophecies, just as Jeremiah commanded Baruch his disciple, And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, and thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink. (Jeremiah 51:63-64.)  Likewise is the matter of Elisha when he put his arm on the bow [held by Joash, King of Israel]: And Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The Eternal’s arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory against Aram. (II Kings 13:17.)  And it is further stated there, And the man of G-d was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldst have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Aram till thou hadst consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite Aram but thrice. (Ibid., Verse 19.)  It is for this reason that the Holy One, blessed be He, caused Abraham to take possession of the Land and symbolically did to him all that was destined to happen in the future to his children. Understand this principle. Now, with the help of G-d, I will begin to explain in detail the subject matter of the verses. And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem. This is the city of Shechem for such was the name of this place, (Ramban differs with Ibn Ezra’s comment that the name Shechem was non-existent in the days of Abraham but is used here because Moses called it by the name by which it was known in his time.)  and Shechem the son of Hamor (Genesis 34:2.)  was called by the name of his city. Now Rashi wrote, “He entered it unto the place of Shechem in order to pray on behalf of Jacob’s sons when they would come grieved from the field.” (Ibid., 34:7. In our text of Rashi: “when they would come to fight against Shechem.”)  This is correct. And I add that Abraham took possession of this place at the very beginning, even before the land was given to him. (As told later in Verse 7. His taking possession of Shechem is stated in the preceding Verse 6.)  It was thus hinted to him that his children would first conquer this place (Reference is to the capturing of the city by the sons of Jacob. See further, 34:25.)  before they would merit it and before the guilt of the dwellers of the land was full (Further, 15:16.)  to warrant their exile therefrom. It is for this reason that the verse here states, And the Canaanite was then in the land. (He took possession of this place even though the Canaanite was yet in the land. (Tur.))  And when the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him the land by His Word, Abraham journeyed from there and pitched his tent between Beth-el and Ai for this was the place that Joshua captured first. (In battle. (Joshua 8:1-24.) The capture of Jericho earlier was effected by a miracle.)  It is possible that Scripture mentions, And the Canaanite was then in the land, to teach us concerning the substance of this chapter, i.e., to state that Abram came into the land of Canaan, but G-d did not show him the land He had promised him. He passed to the place of Shechem while the Canaanite, that bitter and impetuous nation, (Habakkuk 1:6.)  was yet in the land, and Abram feared him. Therefore he did not build an altar to G-d. But when he came to the vicinity of Shechem at the oak of Moreh, G-d appeared to him and gave him the land, and as a result his fear departed from him for he was already assured in the land that I will show thee, and then he built an altar to G-d in order to worship Him openly. Now eilon Moreh (the oak of Moreh) is in the vicinity of Shechem and is also called eilonei Moreh, as it is written over against Gilgal, beside ‘eilonei Moreh.’ (Deuteronomy 11:30.)  There in Shechem, near the Jordan, are Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, where the Israelites arrived at the beginning of their entrance into the land. (Sotah 36 a: “On the day Israel crossed the Jordan, they came to Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal.”)  Eilonei Mamre, (“The oaks of Mamre.” (Genesis, 18:1.))  however, is a place in the land of Hebron, (As is clearly stated: Mamre… the city of Arba which is Hebron. (Ibid., 35:27.))  far from the Jordan. Know that wherever Scripture states, eilonei Mamre, the name Mamre is on account of an Amorite by that name to whom the place belonged, just as it says, And he dwelt at the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshkol and brother of Aner, (Ibid., 14:13.)  and wherever it says, eilon moreh or eilonei moreh, (Deuteronomy 11:30.)  the places were so called on account of a man by the name of Moreh, but he was a Canaanite from the land of the Canaanites, who abide in the plains. (Ibid. The end of this verse reads: beside the oaks of Moreh. From this Ramban derives the fact that Moreh was a Canaanite, unlike Mamre who was an Amorite.)  When Scripture mentions Mamre alone, it means the name of a city, just as it is said: And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, the city of Arba, which is Hebron; (Genesis 35:27.)  Before Mamre which is Hebron. (Ibid., 23:19.)  The man to whom the oaks belonged was called after the name of the city. A similar case is that of Shechem the son of Hamor, who was called Shechem after the name of the city Shechem. In Bereshith Rabbah (42:14.)  it is said, “In the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, Mamre is the name of a place, and in the opinion of Rabbi Nechemyah, it is the name of a person.”</p>

              <p>BURY ME ‘EL AVOTHAI.’ With my fathers. This is the language of Rashi. However, Rashi did not explain the expression el hame’arah as meaning ‘with’ the cave. (Ramban’s intent is to point out that the word el in the second expression could not mean “with,” which confronts us with the difficulty of having the same word assume different meanings in the same verse. Ramban will suggest various ways of resolving this difficulty.)  It is possible that the expression of this verse is concise [and should be understood as if it said], “Bury me and carry me to my fathers to the cave,” for so Jacob said, And thou shalt carry me out from Egypt, (Above, 47:30.)  and it further says, And his sons carried him. (50:13.)  It is possible that the word el serves here to indicate many meanings: (Since Ramban cites Scriptural references to justify each usage, he finds no difficulty in the fact that the word is used differently in the same verse.)  Bury me ‘with’ my fathers, just as in the verse, And thou shalt not take a woman ‘el’ her sister, (Leviticus 18:18.)  meaning “with her sister.” El hame’arah means “in the cave,” just as in the verses: ‘Ve’el’ (And in) the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee; (Exodus 25:21.)  Behold, he hath hidden himself ‘el’ (among) the baggage. (I Samuel 10:22.)  Of similar usage is the expression, And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife ‘el’ (in) the cave. (Above, 23:19.)  Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the meaning of the expression, Bury me (Kivru (bury me) is in the plural form.)  with my fathers, is that the brothers should go with Joseph. Now Jacob really did not need to do that. However, he now commanded all of them to bury him in the cave, just as he had sworn Joseph, because he feared that Pharaoh might not give Joseph permission to leave the land lest he remain in his land [Canaan]. (Abarbanel comments that the reason Pharaoh sent a group of Egyptians to accompany the burial party was that he feared lest Joseph and his brothers be influenced by the attachment to Canaan demonstrated by their father in both life and death and decide to stay there.)  Do you not see that it was necessary for Joseph to plead with the house of Pharaoh (Further, 50:4-5.)  that they should request Pharaoh to let him go, and he answered, Go up, and bury thy father, as he made thee swear, (Ibid., Verse 6.)  as he agreed to it only on account of the oath!</p>

[It occurs to this editor that if Yaakov, Avraham’s grandson, had not relied on Lavan’s word when he agreed to work seven years for the hand of Rachel in marriage, but had insisted on a written document, he might have saved himself an untold amount of grief.]</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויקם השדה והמערה אשר בו , “and the field and the cave which is in it ‘rose.’” The Torah appears to repeat itself as we had been told already in verses 17-18 that the field and the cave passed from the possession of Efron to that of Avraham and the Torah specified its precise location. However, verses 17-18 speak about what happened to the field and the cave before Sarah was buried in there. At that time the property passed to the hands of Avraham only as a מקנה, a “purchase.” Now that Sarah had been buried in the cave of Machpelah the Torah speaks of it becoming an אחוזה, an inalienable piece of property. By burying Sarah in that cave Avraham had performed an act of permanent acquisition. The reason the Torah again stresses מאת בני חת, as if the sellers had been a whole group of people instead of merely Efron is of crucial importance. The Torah wants to forestall anyone ever raising any objection against this sale. This is why the Torah repeats the story of the acquisition of this piece of property again at the end of the Book of Genesis (49,32) prior to Yaakov being buried there. The Torah speaks about this transaction no fewer than eight times in this portion, and twice more at a later date, making a total of ten references to what should be viewed as a simple transaction. [Anyone living in our own times realizes that all this was not enough to safeguard our claim to make it universally recognized. Ed.]   Our prescient sages in Bereshit Rabbah 58,8 have already foreseen such spurious counterclaims when they wrote: “how much ink has been spilled, how many styluses have been broken merely in order to write the words בני חת, ‘the Hittites.’” Ten times did the Torah repeat its reference to the Hittites. The Torah did so in order that anyone who acknowledges our title to the cave of Machpelah be considered as if he had observed the Ten Commandments.” We find similarly excessive sounding verbiage in Chronicles I chapter 21 where David’s purchase of the threshing ground of Arnon the Jebusite is described by Ezra Hasofer. The word Arnon appears no fewer than ten times in that report!  One of the moral lessons to be derived from our chapter is that even if man may conquer the whole of the inhabited part of the earth during his lifetime, in the end, when it is time to be buried, all he will own are the four cubits where he has been laid to rest. Avraham had been given the entire earth as a gift from G’d and what he had acquired by paying for it was only the cave of Machpelah in the “city of four, i.e. in Chevron.” Even though the Israelites conquered the whole of the land of Canaan by the sword, we find that three locations in that country are distinguished especially. This was so because they had not been acquired by force of arms but by legal tender, the previous owners having willingly forfeited their claim to these properties. They are Chevron, Mount Gerizim and Mout Eyval, and Mount Moriah. The Torah has documented our claim to Chevron in this portion. Mount Gerizim and Mount Eyval were the mountains where G’d concluded a covenant with the Jewish people (the generation which had not been of age or had not been born at the time of the Exodus). This area had already been bought by Yaakov when the Torah reported in Genesis 33,19: “Yaakov bought the piece of land, etc.” Mount Moriah’s purchase has been documented in Chronicles I chapter 21,.</p>

              <p>Chapter 34: Torah [1] &quot;And Abraham was old, coming with days&quot; (Genesis 24:1).&quot;The Woman of Valor, who can find? etc.&quot; (Proverbs 31:10) This entire verse is required regarding Sarah, as it is written above, &quot;Afterward, Abraham buried Sarah&quot; etc. (Genesis 23:19) and as soon as Sarah died, old age came upon him and he became elderly. The spirit of prophecy cried out and said, &quot;A capable wife, who can find her...&quot; This can be compared to a skilled ship captain who conquered the waters and winds. Suddenly, pirates attacked him and he fought them off. Later, he came to a treacherous strait and a strong wind shattered his ship. He begged for mercy from the people around him, saying, &quot;Yesterday, I conquered the waters and killed the pirates. Now, I ask others to save me.&quot; They replied, &quot;When your ship was strong, you were a hero and didn't need our help. Now that your ship is broken, you seek our aid.&quot; Similarly, Abraham was a hero and fought off the pirates when they attacked him (Genesis 14:15). He also divided his wealth among himself, Ishmael, and his household of 318 people (Genesis 14:14). He saw his own strength on the day of Isaac's circumcision (Genesis 17:26) and was blessed by God (Genesis 14:19). Now, you say, &quot;I am a stranger and a resident, etc.&quot; He said to them, &quot;What shall I do? My wife has died, as it is written 'And I will bury my dead, etc.' (Genesis 23:4).&quot; Immediately, Abraham grew old. &quot;A woman of valor, who can find her?&quot; (Proverbs 31:10). This is Sarah, for &quot;a woman of beautiful appearance&quot; (Genesis 12:11), her husband trusted in her. &quot;Please say that you are my sister&quot; (Genesis 12:13). &quot;And he had abundant livestock&quot; (Genesis 13:2). His camel was good and not evil, and Abraham treated it well for her (Genesis 12:16). She sought wool and flax, for she also fulfilled the commandments like Abraham. &quot;Whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her voice, for in Isaac shall your offspring be called&quot; (Genesis 21:12). She was like a merchant ship that had been across the river and came to the land of Canaan. &quot;And she rose up in the middle of the night, and Abraham rose early in the morning, etc.&quot; (Genesis 19:27). She planned a field and took it, which was the field of Machpelah, as it is written &quot;So the field and the cave in it were established&quot; (Genesis 23:20). She planted a vineyard with the fruit of her hands, for &quot;the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel&quot; (Isaiah 5:7). She girded her loins with strength when the angels came to eat with Abraham and said to her, &quot;Quickly, make three seahs, etc.&quot; (Genesis 18:6). The reason was that she was a good trader, and to Sarah he said, &quot;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver, etc.&quot; (Genesis 20:16). She sent out her hand with the spindle, etc. (Proverbs 31:19). She drove out this maidservant (Genesis 21:10). &quot;Do not be afraid for your household from snow, for the Holy One, blessed be He, made an agreement with him that in the merit of circumcision and Sabbath, his sons will not descend to Gehenna. For every household that is circumcised has two Sabbath days and clothing. She made coverings for herself when they asked him, &quot;Where is Sarah, your wife?&quot; And he said, &quot;Behold, in the tent&quot; (Genesis 18:9). They said to her, &quot;Behold, you are with child, and your sons are destined to be priests, to wear the priestly garments and to serve in the Tent of Meeting, as it is written 'And they shall make the ephod, etc.'&quot; (Exodus 28:6). When Sarah died, he leapt upon her, old and aged. Immediately, her husband became known in the gates, etc.</p>

              <p>And Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old; these were the years of the life of ‎Sarah. And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba, the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. And Abraham ‎came to mourn over, Sarah, and to weep over her, and he stood up from before his dead and ‎spoke unto the sons of Heth, the in habitants of the land, saying: I am a stranger and so ‎journey with you; give me a possession of a burying place with you that I may bury my dead ‎out of my sight. And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him: Behold the ‎land is before thee, in the choice of the land bury thy dead, for verily, no man will pre vent ‎thee from burying thy dead. And Abraham said unto them: If it be your mind that I should bury ‎my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron, the son of Zohar, that he ‎may give me the cave of Machpelah, which is in the end of his field, and I will purchase it of ‎him for whatsoever he may desire for it. And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth, and ‎they went and called him, and he came into the presence of Abraham; and Ephron said unto ‎Abraham: Whatsoever thou wishest thy servant will do. And Abraham said: Nay, but I will buy ‎the cave and thy field for its full value, as a possession for a burial place forever. And Ephron ‎answered, saying: Behold the field and cave are before thee, give me whatsoever pleaseth ‎thee. But Abraham said: Nay, only for its full value shall I purchase it from thy hands and from ‎the hands of all those that go in at the gate of thy city, and from thy seed forever. And Ephron ‎and all his kinsmen heard this, and Abraham weighed unto Ephron four hundred shekels of ‎silver, into the hands of Ephron and his brethren; and Abraham wrote down these ‎proceedings and had it testified by four witnesses, and these are their names: Ami gal, son of ‎Abishna, the Hittite; Adihoron, son of Ashu nash, the Hivite; Abdon, son of Ahirom, the ‎Gomrite, and Bakdil, son of Abidos, the Zidonite; and Abraham took the book of the sale and ‎placed it in his treasury, and these are the words that Abraham wrote into the book saying: ‎That Abraham bought the cave and the field from Ephron, the Hittite, and from his seed, and ‎from all those that went in at the gate of his city and from their seed forever, to be the ‎purchased possession of Abraham and his seed, and of all those that go forth from his loins for ‎a possession of a burying place forever. And he put a seal thereto and had it testified by ‎witnesses. Thus the field and the cave therein and the entire ground were secured for ‎Abraham and his seed after him, from the children of Heth; and behold it is before Mamre, ‎even in Hebron, which is in the land of Canaan. And after this Abraham buried there Sarah his ‎wife, and that place with all its boundaries became the possession of Abraham and his seed for ‎a burying place. And Abraham buried Sarah in great display, as it is customary with the burials ‎of kings, and she was interred in very beautiful and costly garments. And her bier was ‎attended by Shem and his sons Eber and Abimelech, also by Auer, Eshcol, and Mamre, and all ‎the dignitaries of the land followed her bier. And the days of Sarah were a hundred and seven ‎and twenty years when she died, and Abraham made a great and heavy mourning, and he ‎observed that mourning for seven days.  And all the inhabitants of the land consoled Abraham ‎and Isaac his son concerning Sarah. . And when their days of mourning were over Abraham ‎sent away his son Isaac to go unto the house of Shem and Eber to learn the ways and ‎instructions of the Lord. And Isaac remained there for three years. At that time Abraham arose ‎with all his servants and they started to return home, towards Beer-sheba. And when the year ‎was around, Abimelech king of the Philistines, died in that year. He was one hundred and ‎ninety-three years old when he died. And Abraham went with all his people into the land of ‎the Philistines to comfort the household of Abimelech, and all his household, and then he ‎returned to his home.‎</p>

              </summary>
              <p>I shall now explain all these matters step by step. Regarding the statement that Abraham and Sarah were the תקון for Adam and Eve, the Zohar on this portion (page 34 Sullam edition) writes as follows: Rabbi Shimon said that when Abraham entered the cave of Machpelah to bury Sarah, Adam and Eve arose as they did not want to remain buried in there. They complained that they had suffered sufficient disgrace in the world beyond the grave where they were now having to face G–d, because they had been guilty of bringing sin into the world. Now they should suffer additional shame when constantly having to face a pair of humans so much better than they? Abraham replied that he was prepared to pray to G–d on Adam's behalf so that he would cease to suffer embarassment before G–d in the future and so that G–d would forgive Adam his sin. Immediately after that Abraham buried his wife Sarah. What is the meaning of the words ואחרי כן, &quot;after that.” in 23,19? It means that Abraham proceeded to bury Sarah as soon as the dialogue between him and Adam was over. The Torah writes that אברהם קבר את שרה, instead of אברהם קבר לשרה. This means that he also reburied חוה. After that the minds of Adam and Eve were put at rest. This is the meaning of אלה תולדות השמים והארץ בהבראם &quot;and these are the generations of heaven and earth&quot; (Genesis 2,4), meaning that those created as a mixture of heaven and earth endure only by the grace of Abraham (the letters in the word בהבראם). Adam and Eve, of course, were not descendants of man; they were created by G–d. Their continuity was assured through Abraham, their תולדות are through אברהם. We have further proof from Genesis 23,20 which describes the field of Machpelah “ויקם” as a hereditary possession for Abraham. Until that time, as is apparent, Adam and Eve had not had a firm hold on the world beyond the grave. The word ויקם is derived from קיום, a permanent existence. Thus far the Zohar.  Abraham assured Adam's permanent status in the hereafter; Sarah did the same for Eve.</p>

The long conversations and considerable formality of the chapter, which are not unusual in an ancient Near Eastern context, contrast with the extreme brevity of the previous chapter. The narrative strikes a curious balance between the emotional reality of the situation (e.g., the repetition of “dead,” “presence,” and “bury”) and the requirements of legal procedure (“Hear me,” “give title,” and “holding”).</p>

The concept of old age signifies a connection to celestial largesse exclusive to the Jewish people, emphasizing the importance of spiritual growth and avoiding incorrect opinions and actions. The acceptance of converts is associated with serving God before experiencing good times, with Passover focused on God and Sukkot on heavenly bounty. Abraham raised Malchut/Kingship with kindness and observance of Torah, leading to blessings, and the Mishnah praises him for observing all mitzvot and being blessed in his old age. In the Liturgy, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are highlighted for their blessings, and the Talmud emphasizes their graceful aging as Torah scholars, contrasting Torah study with other professions. King David and Abraham are both described as old in the Tanakh, and both Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Abraham's old age and blessings. Rabbi Nehorai advocates teaching Torah over worldly trades, drawing parallels to Abraham's blessings and the abundance during his lifetime.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>And Abraham was old, well advanced in years; and G-d had blessed Abraham with everything. (Genesis 24:1) Based upon what I heard from my grandfather on the verse: “It came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods…” (I Kings 11:4), we see here that [when Abraham was old] “G-d had blessed Abraham with everything.” “Everything” – bakol – has the numerical value of ben – “son.” (The words בכל and בן both have the numerical value of 52.)  The wise will understand this. (The verse says “For the ways of the L-rd are right; the just walk in them, but transgressors stumble in them” (Hosea 14:10). The Torah is comprised of two aspects – spirit and matter, revelation and concealment, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge. Thus, the Talmud states: “If a person is unworthy, the Torah becomes a potion of death for him; if he is worthy, it is a potion of life” (Yoma 72b). These two aspects also correspond to the spiritual paradigms of Giver and Receiver, or Lights and Vessels, and Kabbalistically, are represented by the Masculine and Feminine dimensions of creation. Only when they are united can harmony reign in the universe. Even then, however, the influence must be from above to below – from giver to receiver, spirit to matter. When the aspect of receiver dominates, then the vessel can be too strong, and the light can be concealed. This model applies to every word of the Torah, and is the meaning of the verse: “his wives turned away his heart.” Abraham, however, merited “everything” – i.e. a son. He learned Torah from the side of light and revelation. Along these lines, the Degel Machane Ephraim (parashas Masai) writes: “I heard from my grandfather, in the name of the sefer Bris Menucha, that if you see a Torah scholar who has incorrect opinions and acts improperly, he certainly has drunk from the ‘bitter waters.’” Thus, the Rabbis taught in Pirkei Avos (1:11): “Sages, be careful with your words, lest you incur the penalty of exile, and be banished to a place of evil waters, and the disciples who follow you there will drink and die (spiritually) and consequently, the Name of Heaven will be desecrated.”)  Degel Machane Ephraim, Chayeh Sarah</p>

This was ‎why up until then anyone looking at Avraham or Yitzchok could ‎not be sure whether he was looking at the father or the son. ‎Ed.] [If I understand the Talmud correctly, what is meant is ‎that when the Torah had described Adam as having begotten a ‎son in his own image (Genesis 5,3) as opposed to his first two ‎sons, the resemblance between fathers and sons continued ‎unabated until the time when Avraham was described as having ‎aged. Ed.] The point the Talmud makes is that beneficial ‎largesse provided from the celestial regions for the lower regions ‎of the universe manifests itself in one of two ways. It may be ‎measured in terms familiar to us in this part of the universe, or it ‎may be described in terms of concepts applicable in the celestial ‎regions, seeing that these two domains each have their own set of ‎rules. When this beneficial largesse originates directly in the ‎celestial spheres close to the Creator, it had not become subject to ‎limitations applicable in the parts of the world we live in. [As an ‎example, we may distinguish between nourishment provided by ‎G’d through the earth giving its yield, when such nourishment is ‎subject to limitations that apply on our planet, whereas when G’d ‎fed the Jewish people with manna, such limitations did not apply, ‎as the manna originated directly in one of the seven layers of ‎heaven. Ed.] This latter method of benefiting from G’d’s largesse is ‎reserved exclusively for the Jewish people. The Jewish people ‎have become privy to this (on occasion) due to their having clung ‎to their Creator with such devotion.‎ The other nations sharing this planet with us, receive ‎whatever largesse G’d provides for them only through “nature,” ‎which “processes” such gifts from G’d before it reaches its ‎recipients. This is what is meant when the Torah wrote in Genesis ‎‎25,12-15 ‎ואלה תולדות ישמעאל שנים עשר נשיאים לאומתם‎, “and this is ‎the line of Ishmael, son of Avraham……12 chieftains, etc.” The ‎word: ‎לאומתם‎ is derived from ‎אמה‎, “mother;” when a mother ‎measures her son she uses measuring devices used in our parts of ‎the universe. The Torah (Genesis 25,13, and again in verse 16) ‎adds: ‎בשמותם לתולדותם‎ and ‎בחצריהם ובטירותם‎, “by their names, in ‎the order of their births, and by their villages and their ‎encampments;” these words describe the parameters within ‎which they were privy to G’d’s benevolent largesse. The contrast ‎with which the Torah describes a similar description of the ‎development of the Jewish people can be seen in the words ‎למשפחותם לבית אבותם‎, “according to their family, their respective ‎father’s house”. The word ‎אבותם‎ in this instance is derived from ‎אבה‎, as in ‎לא אבה יבמי‎, “he did not want to perform levirate ‎marriage with me.” (Deuteronomy 25.7) The word ‎אבה‎ is a ‎synonym for ‎רצון‎, “will, desire.” The widow describes that her ‎brother-in-law does not wish to fulfill the will of heaven in ‎maintaining his deceased brother’s name alive. Let us ‎illustrate by an example more familiar to all of us. A potter ‎intends to create a vase of a certain shape and colour. Before ‎setting out to shape the clay he has a definite image of the ‎finished product in his mind’s eye. This image is known as ‎מחשבה‎, ‎or ‎אב הפעולה‎, “the father of the finished product.” The ‎רצון‎, the ‎will to create a vase, is called ‎אב‎, father, as it precedes even the ‎sculptor’s vision of the final shape and colour of the product is ‎about to embark on creating. The eventual product is known as ‎בני בנים‎, euphemism for “grandchildren.” [In relation to the ‎רצון‎ ‎the initial will to create something. Ed.] Israel’s drawing down ‎G’d’s largesse to itself is somewhat similar. The process begins ‎with this celestial largesse entering the domain of the physical ‎universe, ‎גבולין‎. [A domain defined by borders both dimensionally ‎and directionally. Ed.] The various shapes and forms this largesse ‎assumes once it has entered our part of the universe is known as ‎בני בנים‎, “grandchildren.” The original ‎רצון‎, G’d’s intention to ‎provide this largesse, is called ‎זקן‎, “an old man.” When ‎Solomon in Proverbs 17,6 speaks about ‎עטרת זקנים בני בנים‎, loosely ‎translated as “grandchildren are the crown of their elders,” the ‎meaning of this line on a deeper level, is: “the largesse that has ‎been received by Israelites as a result of G’d’s benevolence, is ‎rooted in the will of G’d,” i.e. from this ‎רצון‎ to the world known as ‎בני בנים‎. ‎</p>

For when he is very quick and quickly runs from mitzvah to mitzvah, he thereby loses the element of holiness, that which is between mitzvah and mitzvah. On account of this quickness he bypasses and skips over this element. This is because the mitzvah itself is coming toward him, since it is being pulled and dragged in his direction by the first mitzvah, which drags the second one, as mentioned above. Thus, when he also runs quickly toward the mitzvah, he might skip over and bypass the aforementioned element—i.e., that which is between the mitzvot. He is therefore one who acts quickly and suffers loss. But if he waits a bit, he can in the meantime attain also the element between the mitzvot, as mentioned above.</p>

In these two matters we find the concentration of all the life of this world, in that he said, “this is my portion from all my toil.” “One says his staff,” for a staff hints at life, meaning that the power of life remained with him, as it is written (Zechariya, 8:4), “[thus shall the old men and women dwell in Jerusalem], and each man his staff in hand.” “One says his water jug,” for a jug is a vessel of reception, meaning, ready and still longing to add to it. This was his delight, for this is the main point of the life of this world. And this is the meaning of the verse, “and Avraham was old, coming in days,” that he came to the roots of life, and he himself became a vessel of reception, yearning for God to increase his life at each moment.</p>

            <summary>Abraham, who was old and well advanced in age, wanted to ensure his son Isaac would marry before his death, so he sent his servant to find a wife from his family. God had blessed Abraham with wealth, honor, and a son, but he desired to see his son married. The Rabbis debated whether Abraham had a daughter named Bakkol, with some saying it was a blessing not to have one, while others believed he did have a daughter. The mention of Abraham's old age reflected his concern for his son's marriage and the need to find a suitable wife.</summary>

Eliezer might want to secure Abraham's wealth for himself through the marriage of his daughter to Abraham's son. This is the reason Abraham made Eliezer swear an oath concerning the fact that his son was not to marry someone of Canaanite descent. Eliezer would thus get the message that his daughter was not suitable marriage material for a son of Abraham who was blessed whereas the Canaanites were cursed (compare Bereshit Rabbah 59,9).</p>

              <p>ואברהם זקן בא בימים, “Avraham was old, getting on in years, etc.” The meaning of the verse is 1) seeing Avraham felt that he had aged he was afraid that he might die before Yitzchak had married. He did not want to send off his servant without an oath in the event he would not return from his mission before he, Avraham, had died. By making Eliezer swear he assured himself that Yitzchak would do what he wanted as Yitzchak was in the habit of listening to Eliezer’s advice.  The reason Avraham did not impose an oath on Yitzchak instead was so that the servant would not be able to fool Yitzchak by presenting any number of arguments seeing hat he was not under oath to Avraham. Avraham considered the Canaanite as captive to deceitful practices as we know from Hoseah 12,8: כנען בידו מאזני מרמה לעשוק אהב, “A Canaanite uses false weights, loves to overreach.” He made the servant swear to reinforce Eliezer’s obligation in the matter. Tanchuma Chayey Sarah 2 claims that there are four possible causes why premature old age suddenly settles on a person. 1) because he lives in fear of something; 2) because he is angry at his children; 3) because he is married to an evil person; 4) because of being involved in waging wars. The respective verses from Scripture quoted by that Midrash to support its claim are 1) Chronicles 1 21,30 “and David was unable to go to it to worship the Lord because he was terrified by the sword of the angel of the Lord.” We also have a verse in Kings I, 1,1 “and King David was old, advanced in years.” As to the anger caused to a person by his children aging him, we read in Samuel I 2,22: now Eli was very old. When he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, etc.” We have proof that being engaged in constant warfare ages a person from Joshua 13,1: “Joshua was old, advanced in years.” Concerning a husband’s aging prematurely due to being married to bad women, we find a verse in Kings I 11,4 “it was when Solomon grew old because his wives had turned his heart, etc.” On the other hand, we know that Avraham’s wife had always honoured him and not caused him any grief, for even when she referred to him as old (Genesis 18,12), she still called him אדוני, “my lord.”</p>

              <p>וה' ברך את אברהם בכל, “and G’d had blessed Avraham with everything.” The plain meaning of the word בכל is Avraham was blessed in every undertaking; he had all types of properties, enjoyed honour both locally and amongst distant countries. He enjoyed old age. He had not been denied any of the things the average person hopes for. The only thing he had not yet achieved was to be blessed with grandchildren. Seeing that he was anxious to become a grandfather, Avraham made his servant take an oath that he would secure a suitable wife for Yitzchak. A Midrashic approach (Baba Batra 16): Concerning the words וה' ברך את אברהם בכל, Rabbi Meir said that seeing Avraham did not have a daughter, this was a blessing. Rabbi Yehudah said that Avraham did have a daughter. A third (anonymous) view quoted in the Talmud is that the name of that daughter was בכל, hence this was part of the blessings the Torah speaks about Avraham enjoying. Rabbi Meir meant that if Avraham had had a daughter he would have faced the difficulty of finding a husband for her. He most certainly would not have chosen a son-in-law from amongst the local Canaanites, and even if such a daughter would have married someone in Charan, the people there were also idolaters and a woman who is subservient to her husband would have had an untenable position if she had been loyal to her father Avraham’s teachings in the home of her pagan husband. Rabbi Yehudah simply felt that one cannot describe someone as enjoying “all of G’d’s blessings,” unless such a person had also been blessed with having a daughter.  The unnamed scholars (אחרים) who claim that Avraham’s daughter was called בכל, revealed a profound mystical dimension to us. When they said that Avraham’s daughter was called בכל, they did not refer to a biological daughter. They referred to a spiritual dimension called בת, “daughter.” Their statement is of a kabbalistic nature [elaborated on by Nachmanides in his commentary on this verse]. They meant that Avraham achieved a virtue known as כל. Anyone who attains this virtue will find himself blessed both on earth and in heaven. This is why these sages said that Avraham was blessed בכל, i.e. “with“ the virtue known as kol. The reason why these sages called this virtue “bat,” is that the greatest (hollow) measure known in the Bible (Kings I 7,26) was the so-called ים של שלמה, the copper basin in front of the Temple from which the priests washed their hands and feet. This basin had a capacity of 2000 bat [equal to 225 times the minimum size of a ritual bath. Ed]. The reason these sages used this measure as their terms of reference when alluding to Avraham’s achievement in the spiritual spheres is that the bat is a sub-category of the virtue (מדה) known as כל. Being a sub-category the name בת, “daughter” is appropriate (just as a subsidiary commercial company is called חברת בת in Hebrew; i.e. “daughter-company.”) In kabbalistic parlance this “virtue,” or “emanation,” is known as the “celestial tribunal of G’d.” This is the reason our verse did not commence with the customary ויברך ה' את אברהם, first describing the actvity, i.e. ויברך, but it first described who carried out the activity, i.e. השם. It is important to appreciate this rule, as it is one of the mystical dimensions of understanding a Torah text.</p>

              <p>...And when they arose in the morning, the servant said to them that they should send him away to his master and give him Rebecca, and he would take her to Issac. And behold, Bethuel did not refuse this, but her brother and her mother said - from their imaginary great love that they had for her - that it was fit that the maiden should dwell with them a year or ten months, to fill her eyes with seeing the people of her father's house, and her family and then leave. Indeed, they said this because she was going to a very faraway land, and it would not be likely that she would return to see the household of her father. So the slave besought them that they not delay him from returning to his master... And when they saw this, they said that they would ask the maiden, if she would agree to go with him. And when they asked her, she said that she would already go with him, and that the separation would not be difficult in her eyes...</p>

              <p>AND ABRAHAM WAS OLD, WELL STRICKEN IN AGE. Scripture reiterates [Abraham’s old age although it has already mentioned it] (Above, 18:11.)  in order to inform us of the reason that he adjured his servant. Thus Scripture says that because Abraham saw himself to be very old and he thought that if he will send the servant to the land of his origin, perhaps before the messenger would return, he will have gone to his long home, (Ecclesiastes 12:5.)  he therefore adjured his servant — whose counsel Isaac would follow since he ruled over all that he had (Verse 2 here.)  — that he should not take for him a wife from the daughters of Canaan. In Bereshith Rabbah, (48:19.)  the Rabbis said: “Here (That is, above, 18:11, where Scripture says, Now Abraham and Sarah were old.)  it was old age combined with vitality; further on (That is, in the verse before us.)  it was old age without vitality.” By this the Rabbis wanted to explain that ba’im [literally: “coming” in days — mentioned above] (Above, 18:11.)  — means the beginning of the days of old age, as the word ba’im indicates the present, just as, ‘Haba’im’ (those that come) in at these gates. (Jeremiah 7:2.)  But here it says that he was very old for already he was ba bayamim [literally: “he had come in days” — past tense], just as: Thy brother ‘ba’ (came) with subtlety.

              <p>AND THE ETERNAL HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS. I.e., with riches, possessions, honor, longevity and children, which are all the treasures of man. Scripture mentions this in order to say that Abraham was perfect in every detail, lacking in no respect save seeing his son have children who would inherit his superior position and his honor. This was why he desired it. Now our Rabbis have a wonderful insight into this verse. They said: (Baba Bathra 16b.)  “And the Eternal had blessed Abraham ‘bakol’ (in all things). Rabbi Meir said that Abraham was blessed in that he did not have a daughter. Rabbi Yehudah said that he did have a daughter. Acheirim (Literally “other ones,” other Rabbis besides those mentioned. Rabbi Meir is sometimes called by this name. Here, however, it could not refer to him since his opinion has already been stated. Acheirim here refers to anonymous authorities or to the opinion of Rabbi Meir’s master, Elisha ben Abuyah, who was also known as Acheir. See Chagigah 15a.)  say that he did have a daughter and her name was Bakol.” (The profounder meaning of this saying will be explained further in the text.)  Rabbi Meir thus explained that Abraham did not have a daughter. This was a blessing for Abraham for he could not have married her except to the cursed sons of Canaan. If he were to send her to his country, she would also worship the idols as they did because a woman is subject to the authority of her husband. Indeed, Abraham did not want his worthy children from his wife Sarah to go outside the Land, and surely not that they worship the idols. Rabbi Yehudah, however, explained that Abraham did have a daughter since the Merciful One did not even cause him to lack a daughter, and that was the blessing implied by the expression, in all things, for he had everything that people desire, completely without exception. Then came Acheirim and mentioned the name of the daughter. Now truthfully, the intent of Acheirim and their controversy with Rabbi Yehudah were not merely to inform us of the name of this daughter. Far it be from them to expend the great and generalized blessing of Abraham on this matter, i.e., that Scripture is saying that G-d blessed him with one daughter with that name. However, Acheirim established a new interpretation on this verse, a very profound matter, and they explained with it one of the secrets of the Torah. Thus they said that the word bakol hints at a great matter, namely, that the Holy One, blessed be He, has an attribute called Kol (All), so called because it is the foundation of everything. It is with reference to this attribute that it says, I am the Eternal that maketh ‘Kol’ (all). (Isaiah 44:24.)  And this is also what Scripture says, And the profit of the earth is ‘bakol’ (in all), (Ecclesiastes 5:8.)  that is to say, the profit of the earth and the abundant goodness that is bestowed upon all that come into the world is on account of this attribute Kol. It is the eighth attribute of the thirteen attributes. (See Ramban Exodus 34:6.)  And there is another attribute called bath [literally “daughter”] that emanates from it, and with it He moves everything. This is “the Court of the Holy One, blessed be He,” that is hinted at in the word, Vahashem (And the Eternal), in all places. It is called kalah (bride) in the book of The Song of Songs because it is comprised of hakol (the All), and it is this attribute which the Sages have surnamed Knesseth Yisrael (the assembly of Israel) in many places because it is the gathering of hakol (the All). It was this attribute which was to Abraham as a bath because he was the man of kindness, and he conducted himself in accordance with it. This was why Acheirim said that this blessing with which Abraham had been blessed in all things does not allude either to his having begotten a daughter from his wife Sarah, as Rabbi Yehudah said, or not, as Rabbi Meir claimed, but instead it hints at a great matter, i.e., that he was blessed with an attribute called bath which is contained in the attribute Kol, and is therefore also called Kol, being analogous to the expression, For My name is in him. (Exodus 23:21.)  Thus Abraham was blessed in heaven and on earth. This is why he said, By the Eternal, the G-d of heaven and the G-d of the earth. (Verse 3 here.)  This matter is to be found hinted at in the traditions of our Rabbis in many places. Thus they said in the Midrash Chazita: (Another name for the Midrash Rabbah on the Song of Songs. The name Chazita is derived from the first word in the verse with which this Midrash opens. ‘Chazita’ (Seest thou) a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings. (Proverbs 22:29.) The Midrash quoted is found ibid., 3:21.)  “Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai asked Rabbi Eliezer the son of Rabbi Yosi, ‘Have you possibly heard from your father of the meaning of the verse, The crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him?’ (Song of Songs 3:11.)  He said to him, ‘Yes.’ He asked, ‘How?’ He replied, ‘It is like a king who had an only daughter whom he loved very much, and he would call her “my daughter.” This did not completely express his love for her until he called her “my sister.” Still he was not satisfied until he called her “my mother.” In the same way, the Holy One, blessed be He, loved Israel in the beginning and called them “My daughter.” It is this which Scripture says, Hearken, O daughter, and consider. (Psalms 45:11.)  This did not completely express His love for them until He called them “My sister,” as it is said, Open to me, my sister, my love. (Song of Songs 5:2.)  Still He was not satisfied until He called them “My mother,” as it is said, Attend unto Me, O My people, ‘ule’umi’ (O My nation). (Isaiah 51:4.)  The word is written le’imi (O My mother).’ Then Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai arose and kissed him on his head, and he said to him, ‘Had I come to listen to this word of yours it would have been sufficient.’…” Now, had the commentator who prides himself on his knowledge of the Torah’s secrets (Reference here is to Ibn Ezra who often prides himself on knowing the secrets of the Torah but who, in the case of this Midrash concerning Abraham’s having a daughter by the name of Bakol, criticizes the interpretation by commenting that if that were the case, the word bakol should have had an additional letter beth preceding it and meaning “and G-d blessed Abraham ‘with’ bakol.”)  known this, his lips would be dumb and not deride the words of our Rabbis. Therefore, I have written this in order to silence those who speak arrogantly against the righteous one. (See Psalms 31:19.) </p>

This is why Abraham's servant said: &quot;And Adonai blessed my master very much and he has become wealthy.&quot;  And it is for this reason that the text needed to explain first that God had blessed Abraham &quot;with everything,&quot; as in a similar instance: &quot;And Ham was the father of Canaan&quot; (Genesis 9:18).  </p>

Es ist jüdische Weisheit, die spricht: יפה שעה אחת בתשובה ומעשים טובים בעולם הזה מכל חיי העולם הבא, eine Stunde des sittlichen Fortschrittes und der guten Taten in diesem Leben überwiegt das ganze zukünftige Leben, wenngleich sie ebenfalls hinzufügt: ויפה שעה אחת של קורת רוח בעולם הבא מכל חיי העולם הזה und eine Stunde geistiger Befriedigung im jenseitigen Leben überwiegt das ganze diesseitige. זקן ist ihr derjenige, der mit seinem hieniedigen Dasein beide Welten erworben, die diesseitige für die künftige, indem er der hieniedigen Welt den Stempel des Göttlichen aufgedrückt. צדיקים ישכינו שכינה בארץ, bereiten die Erde zur Stätte des Göttlichen.</p>

              <p>Baba Batra 16b werden noch drei Erläuterungen zu dem ודי ברך את א׳ בכל gegeben, die wohl erwogen sein wollen. R. Meir: Der Segen habe darin bestanden, daß Abraham keine Tochter gehabt. R. Jehuda: Der Segen habe vielmehr darin bestanden, daß Abraham auch eine Tochter gehabt. Andere meinen, er habe eine Tochter gehabt, die בכל hieß. R. Elieser Hammodai fügt hinzu: Der Ruf von Abrahams großer astrologischer Kenntnis habe bewirkt, daß alle Könige des Morgen- und Abendlandes ihn täglich aufgesucht. R. Schimeon ben Jochai: Abraham sei mit einer köstlichen Perle geschmückt gewesen, bei deren Anblick jeder sogleich Heilung gefunden etc. Nun kann sicherlich hier nicht jene Gesinnung haben ausgedrückt werden sollen, die den höchsten Segen darin findet, überhaupt keine Tochter zu haben. Abgesehen davon, daß ja dieselben Weisen den Zweck einer jeden Ehe nur in Sohn und Tochter erreicht erblicken (Jebamot 61b), wäre ja auch keine Stelle ungeeigneter zu einer solchen Äußerung, als gerade ein Kapitel, dessen Inhalt, Sara und Rebekka, wie kaum ein anderes der Verherrlichung des Weibes dient. Vielmehr dürfte allen diesen Aussprüchen das בכל, Gott habe Abraham in allem gesegnet, dahin erschienen sein: in allem d. h. selbst in solchen Verhältnissen, in welchen ohne besondere göttliche Fürsorge eine Trübung seines Lebensglückes zu erwarten gewesen wäre. Gerade an dieser Stelle nun, in welcher Abrahams große Sorge hervortritt, für seinen einzigen Sohn eine entsprechende Frau zu finden, eine Sorge, für deren Lösung er nur einer ganz besonderen göttlichen Fügung vertrauen zu müssen glauben durfte, liegt der Gedanke unendlich nahe: welche Sorge, ja welcher kaum zu beseitigende Kummer wäre Abraham daraus erwachsen, wenn er eine Tochter gehabt hätte und für eine Tochter seines Hauses einen Gatten aus den kanaatischen oder aramäischen Männern hätte suchen müssen!! Ein Sohn Abrahams wird zuletzt selbst eine Tochter Kanaans oder Arams zu sich hinüber gewinnen in den Geist eines abrahamitischen Hauses. Allein aus gleichem Grunde wird auch die abrahamitische Tochter dem Geiste und dem Hause Abrahams durch einen kanaanitischen oder aramäischen Gatten verloren gehen. Denn der Sohn baut das Haus des Vaters weiter, aber die Tochter geht über in das schwiegerelterliche Haus, das sie mit als Mauer (חמיה) umfängt. Kanaanitischem oder aramäischem Götzendienste hätte Abraham seine Enkel geboren sehen müssen, wenn er eine Tochter gehabt hätte — vor diesem Schmerz, meint R. Meir, habe Gott ihn segnend bewahrt, indem er ihm keine Tochter geschenkt.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ואברהם זקן בא בימים, “Avraham had become old, advanced in years.” The Torah writes this comment at this point in order to inform us that as a result of the death of Sarah, symptoms of old age suddenly became manifest in Avraham’s whole demeanour. This is also what the sages had in mind when they said” “a wife’s death primarily affects her husband.” True, the Torah had already described both Avraham and Sarah as זקנים באים בימים, “old, advanced in years” (18,11), the matter has been repeated because as a result of Sarah having become pregnant and given birth to Yitzchok both she and her husband had become rejuvenated. Avraham now reverted to being an old man.
    It is also possible to justify the mention of Avraham having become an old man at this point in view of what follows, i.e. his empowering Eliezer to choose a wife for his son Yitzchok, seeing G’d’s promise that he would die at an old age בשלום, i.e. having seen his major hopes fulfilled, this could not occur until Yitzchok had been married and had produced an heir. We know from Psalms 128,6 וראה בנים לבניך שלום על ישראל, “and live to see children of your children, peace be unto Israel,” that until one has been blessed with grandchildren one does not consider oneself as having died בשלום. He therefore had concluded that the time was overdue to see to it that Yitzchok would marry. The Torah testifies that Avraham considered himself as blessed in all areas of life, i.e. וה' ברך את אברהם בכול, although he was too old now to undertake a strenuous journey to Aram Naharayim. The word בא in our verse is to be understood as being in the past tense as in Genesis 27,35 בא אחיך במרמה, “your brother has already come, deviously, etc.”

              <p>“Abraham was old, advanced in years” [24:1]. He was very old with many days. That is to say, there are many old people who soon become aged and have white hair from troubles and exile. However, Abraham had wealth and honor and he had a son. He was not old, but the years came upon him. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:1.)  He thought that he would die before his son, Isaac, found a wife. Therefore, he made his servant swear that he should only give his son a wife from his family. He did not make Isaac swear, since Abraham thought that if he only made Isaac swear and not the servant, perhaps the servant might be a deceiver and convince my son, Isaac, that he should take a Canaanite. Therefore, I must make the servant swear. The Midrash talks about four ways in which a person becomes old and gray. When a person is frightened, then old age comes upon him; when one has evil children; when someone goes to war; when someone has an evil wife. (Bahya, Genesis, 24:1.) </p>

Rabbi Meir said: the Holy One blessed Abraham that he did not give him a daughter, since if he would have had a daughter, Abraham would not have been able to give her a good husband. She would have had to take a husband who was an idol worshipper. Each wife is under the authority of her husband and if the husband is an idol worshipper, then the wife must also worship idols. Rabbi Judah said: Abraham did have a daughter. The person desires to have daughters and sons, particularly when he is rich. (Ibid.) </p>

          <details>
            <summary>The acceptance of converts is not done during good times for the Jews, as it is believed that a person should start serving God before experiencing good times in order to merit the world to come even during good days. The festivals of Passover and Sukkot are oriented differently, with Passover being focused on God and Sukkot on the bounty from Heaven. The use of the &quot;four species&quot; during Sukkot represents different types of existence in the universe, with each symbolizing a different aspect of Jewish society and the world. The purpose of performing the mitzvah properly is to achieve joy and earn merits, emphasizing the importance of placing material wealth in the service of God.</summary>

                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 67:8:16</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>The reason that the regular offerings as well as those offered on the new moon are not mentioned in this Parshah,- as opposed to Parshat Pinchas,- is the fact that here we concentrate only on the special days which through their work prohibition become holy convocations of a national character. During these days we try to make a whole nation concentrate on its function in life. The reason that the usage of the term chag and tachog are different on Passover and Sukkot respectively, is that the former, since it recalls slavery, hard labour, is best remembered by quiet contemplation, no forced activities, etc. The Sukkot festival however, follows the joy of having brought in the harvest, a time that is normally allocated to restful enjoyment, and a feeling of contentment, security. At such a time, and in order to remind us that the bounty came from Heaven and is not due only to our toil, we are bidden to leave the security of our homes and remind ourselves where it all came from. Having done this, the Torah is confident that the eighth day can be lachem (23,36) for us. (literally &quot;for you,&quot; meaning us) Not so Passover. On that occasion, the whole festival is described as &quot;for G'd all seven days.&quot; (23,26) This is much more pronounced in Parshat Re-ey, when the seventh day of Passover is described as being &quot;for G'd,&quot; the other days not having been so designated. The use of the word ach, only, when introducing the tabernacle festival celebration (23,39) is to emphasize that this celebration is oriented towards G'd, as distinct from the Passover celebration which was primarily oriented towards ourselves. Reminders of this aspect of the celebration are &quot;the four species.&quot; Each is an instrument of thanksgiving to G'd. Although the &quot;four species&quot; must be owned only on the first day of the festival, their use during all the seven days continues, as the statement &quot;and you shall rejoice&quot; is connected to their use. Each of the species represents a different kind of Jew, from the most accomplished both religiously and socially, to the most ignorant in either field. The unforgettable lesson lies in the fact that as long as they are part of the whole, even completely ignorant people have a role to play. By including him in the fabric of Jewish society, the environment the ignorant finds himself in, will sooner or later be an incentive for him to raise his sights both spiritually and socially. At the same time, when looking at the &quot;four species,&quot; we are also reminded of four types of existence in the universe. 1) The One and Only Incomparable Oneness, the Almighty. 2) Purely spiritual creatures, i.e. angels. 3) Bodies which are of an enduring nature, apparently lasting forever, i.e. the stars, the planets. 4) The world we are part of, containing a mixture of body and spirit, therefore subject to death and decay. The etrog, represents the highest form of existence seeing that it is perfect from all aspects. It is therefore held apart from the other three species, not bound up with it in a single bunch. We hold it in the left hand so that it is opposite our hearts, just as we lay the tefillin phylacteries, on our left arm. For this reason such care is taken to secure the most perfect specimen of that fruit which can be obtained. The lulav, palm frond, represents the angels, being the most honoured of the remaining three species. The world of the angels is considered a &quot;higher&quot; world. The lulav is taller than the other plants in that bunch, as a reminder of that fact. The hadass, myrtle branch, represents the stars, the planets, the nine leaves, (three times three stems with three leaves each) hint at the nine planets which make up our galaxy. The aravah, willow branch, by its very lack of attractive features, describes man and his inadequacies. Moreover, the leaves of the aravah resemble the shape of the human mouth, man being the most advanced creature in his particular world. The fact that the benediction over the mitzvah mentions the lulav rather than the etrog, is to remind us of our purpose to achieve the level of service to G'd that is performed by the angels. Since our sages tell us that the first day of Sukkot is referred to as rishon, the first, because it is the first day in the new year that our sins begin to be counted again, the significance of not performing the mitzvah with a stolen lulav is obvious. Simchah, joy, is our destiny when we perform the mitzvah properly, and earn merits. Spending money in order to perform the mitzvah, indicates that we appreciate that material wealth must be placed in the service of G'd, else it is a corrosive influence. </p>

Behold, they may gather together [gor yagur], but without Me; whosoever shall gather together [gar] with you shall fall on yours (Isaiah 54:15). He who dwells [gar] with you in your poverty, he is the one who shall fall on yours. But not another.&quot; Behold, you see that we do not accept converts when times are good [for the Jews]. For a beginning should not be made from good days. Since a person will certainly serve God, may He be blessed, because of this, when he sees good. Hence, it is necessary for him to have his start before [the good times]. Then he will [merit it to] acquire the world to come even during the good days.</p>

He thus bestowed the Priests (Kohanim) with the Supernal keys to draw forth blessings, beneficence, and emanations from all the Upper levels and Supernal Sefirot into this pool-Breichah-בריכה called “Thus-Koh-כה.”</p>

The Torah hints to this when it states, (Genesis 24:1)  “And HaShem-יהו&quot;ה blessed Avraham in all-BaKol-בכל.” From Avraham it was given over to Yitzchak, as it states, (Genesis 27:33)  “And I ate from all-MiKol-מכל before you came, and I blessed him.” It was then transferred from Yitzchak to Yaakov, as it states, (Genesis 33:11)  “For God has been gracious with me and I have all-Kol-כל.” That is, Yaakov said to Esav, “Lest it enter your mind that what I have given you caused a lacking for me, know that all the keys to the supernal blessing-Brachah-ברכה have been given over into my hand and that it includes all-Kol-כל.” This is the meaning of his words, “I have all-Kol-כל.

              <p>Therefore, know that the quality of HaShem of Hosts-HaShem Tzva’ot-יהו״ה צבאו״ת draws down HaShem’s-יהו&quot;ה Upper Kindness (Chessed Elyon), (This was discussed in the previous gate.)  as well as drawing the kindness of Avraham-Chessed Avraham-חסד אברהם, which is worldly kindness-Chessed Olam-חסד עולם, into His quality as the Living God-E”l Chai-א״ל חי. His quality as God of Hosts-Elohi”m Tzva’ot-אלהי״ם צבאו״ת draws down the power of might-Gevurah-גבורה, judgment-Din-דין, fear-Pachad-פחד, and punishment-Onesh-עונש, into His quality as the Living God-E”l Chai-א״ל חי. Therefore, His quality as the Living God-E”l Chai-א״ל חי, which includes everything, is called “All-Kol-כל,” since everything is in it. All the Sefirot bestow the powers of kindness-Chessed, judgment-Din, and mercy-Rachamim through these qualities called HaShem God of Hosts-HaShem Elohi”m Tzva’ot-יהו״ה אלהי״ם צבאו״ת. This is the meaning of the verse, (Isaiah 44:24)  “I am HaShem-יהו״ה who makes all-Kol-כל,” since all come out of this quality called “All-Kol-כל.” Similarly, the verse states, (Genesis 1:31)  “And God saw all-Kol-כל that He made and it was very good-Tov-טוב,” and, (Psalms 119:128)  “Therefore I have declared the fairness of every-Kol-כל precept regarding everything-Kol-כל,” and it states, (Genesis 24:1)  “HaShem-יהו״ה blessed Avraham in all-Kol-כל.”</p>

              <p>Now, wherever in Torah you come across the word All-Kol-כל keep this principle in mind and remember that it indicates one of three matters. Sometimes the word “All-Kol-כל” refers to HaShem’s-יהו&quot;ה quality as the Living God-E”l Chai-א״ל חי, sometimes it refers to His quality of Lordship-Adona”y-אדנ״י, and sometimes it indicates the sum of all creations, and as you have been shown to know, everything comes into being from the power of “All-Kol-כל.” This being so, contemplate what Torah states about our forefathers. About Avraham, it says, (Genesis 24:1)  “HaShem-יהו״ה blessed Avraham in all-Kol-כל,” about Yitzchak, it says, (Genesis 27:33)  “I partook of all-Kol-כל,” and about Yaakov, it says, (Genesis 33:11)  “I have all-Kol-כל.” That is, all three were blessed with the quality that includes all-Kol-כל.</p>

              <p>Chapter 28: Torah [1] And the Lord visited Sarah (Genesis 21:1). This means &quot;Behold, God will not cast away the perfect, neither will He uphold the evil doers&quot; (Job 8:20). &quot;Behold, God will not cast away the perfect,&quot; refers to Abraham who suffered for many years until Sarah bore a child, yet God did not abandon him. &quot;Neither will He uphold the evil doers,&quot; refers to Abimelech's household who were restrained and prevented from harming Abraham, as it says &quot;For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah&quot; (Genesis 20:18). Rabbi Abbahu said: The Holy One, blessed be He, restrained everything that belonged to Abimelech, his wife, his slaves, his maidservants, his cattle and his flocks. How did He restrain them? He sealed their mouths from speaking, so that they would not speak about her; He blinded their eyes so that they would not gaze upon her; He deafened their ears so that they would not hear her prayer; He restrained their sexual desires so that they would not be intimate with her. From where do we know that it says &quot;For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah.&quot; And Scripture says: &quot;And because of her only, he [Abraham] was blessed&quot; (Genesis 24:1). When Abraham prayed for them, the Holy One, blessed be He, immediately healed them, as it says &quot;And Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children&quot; (Genesis 20:17). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham, &quot;You pray for others to have children, but your wife Sarah is not bearing children.&quot; Immediately, God remembered Sarah and she became pregnant. Therefore, the verse says, &quot;Behold, God will not cast off the innocent&quot; (Job 8:20).</p>

              <p>Chapter 33 Writings: [1] &quot;Blessed is the man who fears the Lord&quot; (Psalm 112:1). This means that in the end, everything will be heard by God: &quot;Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man&quot; (Ecclesiastes 12:13). How does one ultimately succeed? Nothing is more beloved than one who fears the Almighty, as it is written, &quot;In the end, everything will be heard,&quot; etc. In the custom of the world, one person says to his friend, &quot;I am rich and have plenty of wheat, oil, and wine.&quot; His friends tell him, &quot;You have everything, where will you put it? If you have no storage, you have nothing.&quot; Similarly, one who is rich and wise in knowledge, but does not have fear of sin, has nothing, as it is written, &quot;In the end, everything will be heard,&quot; etc. For this reason, David said, &quot;Blessed is the man who fears the Lord.&quot; This refers to Abraham, as it is written, &quot;Now I know that you fear God&quot; (Genesis 22:12). &quot;He delights greatly in His commandments&quot; (Psalm 112:1). This refers to Abraham, as it is written, &quot;Because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws&quot; (Genesis 26:5). &quot;His descendants will be mighty on earth&quot; (Psalm 112:2). This refers to Isaac, as it is written, &quot;In Isaac shall thy seed be called&quot; (Genesis 21:12). What is written afterwards? &quot;And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great&quot; (Genesis 26:13). &quot;The generation of the upright will be blessed&quot; (Psalm 112:2). And Abraham was old and well-stricken in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things&quot; (Genesis 24:1). Similarly, God blessed Isaac after Abraham's death, as it is written, &quot;And after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). Therefore it is said, &quot;The generation of the upright will be blessed.&quot;</p>

The spirit of prophecy cried out and said, &quot;A capable wife, who can find her...&quot; This can be compared to a skilled ship captain who conquered the waters and winds. Suddenly, pirates attacked him and he fought them off. Later, he came to a treacherous strait and a strong wind shattered his ship. He begged for mercy from the people around him, saying, &quot;Yesterday, I conquered the waters and killed the pirates. Now, I ask others to save me.&quot; They replied, &quot;When your ship was strong, you were a hero and didn't need our help. Now that your ship is broken, you seek our aid.&quot; Similarly, Abraham was a hero and fought off the pirates when they attacked him (Genesis 14:15). He also divided his wealth among himself, Ishmael, and his household of 318 people (Genesis 14:14). He saw his own strength on the day of Isaac's circumcision (Genesis 17:26) and was blessed by God (Genesis 14:19). Now, you say, &quot;I am a stranger and a resident, etc.&quot; He said to them, &quot;What shall I do? My wife has died, as it is written 'And I will bury my dead, etc.' (Genesis 23:4).&quot; Immediately, Abraham grew old. &quot;A woman of valor, who can find her?&quot; (Proverbs 31:10). This is Sarah, for &quot;a woman of beautiful appearance&quot; (Genesis 12:11), her husband trusted in her. &quot;Please say that you are my sister&quot; (Genesis 12:13). &quot;And he had abundant livestock&quot; (Genesis 13:2). His camel was good and not evil, and Abraham treated it well for her (Genesis 12:16). She sought wool and flax, for she also fulfilled the commandments like Abraham. &quot;Whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her voice, for in Isaac shall your offspring be called&quot; (Genesis 21:12). She was like a merchant ship that had been across the river and came to the land of Canaan. &quot;And she rose up in the middle of the night, and Abraham rose early in the morning, etc.&quot; (Genesis 19:27). She planned a field and took it, which was the field of Machpelah, as it is written &quot;So the field and the cave in it were established&quot; (Genesis 23:20). She planted a vineyard with the fruit of her hands, for &quot;the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel&quot; (Isaiah 5:7). She girded her loins with strength when the angels came to eat with Abraham and said to her, &quot;Quickly, make three seahs, etc.&quot; (Genesis 18:6). The reason was that she was a good trader, and to Sarah he said, &quot;Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver, etc.&quot; (Genesis 20:16). She sent out her hand with the spindle, etc. (Proverbs 31:19). She drove out this maidservant (Genesis 21:10). &quot;Do not be afraid for your household from snow, for the Holy One, blessed be He, made an agreement with him that in the merit of circumcision and Sabbath, his sons will not descend to Gehenna. For every household that is circumcised has two Sabbath days and clothing. She made coverings for herself when they asked him, &quot;Where is Sarah, your wife?&quot; And he said, &quot;Behold, in the tent&quot; (Genesis 18:9). They said to her, &quot;Behold, you are with child, and your sons are destined to be priests, to wear the priestly garments and to serve in the Tent of Meeting, as it is written 'And they shall make the ephod, etc.'&quot; (Exodus 28:6). When Sarah died, he leapt upon her, old and aged. Immediately, her husband became known in the gates, etc.</p>

              <p>[2] Another explanation: And Abraham was old, advanced in age, and the Lord had blessed Abraham with everything (Genesis 24:1). &quot;Grey hair is a crown of glory; it is gained by living a godly life&quot; (Proverbs 20:29). From Adam to Abraham, twenty generations passed, and there is no mention of any of them being old except for the father, son, and grandson, who all stood together for four generations. Nobody knew who was the oldest among them, and they resembled one another. The son did not honor the father because they did not know who was older, as it is written: &quot;Their days are quickly gone, and they pass away&quot; (Psalms 78:33). But when Abraham stood up, God honored him with this crown. This is like a king who had a beloved servant. He said to him, &quot;I will give you gold and silver, and you have slaves and maids. But I will take the crown from my head and give it to you.&quot; Similarly, Abraham was beloved by God, as it is said, &quot;Abraham, my friend&quot; (Isaiah 41:8). God said to him, &quot;What can I give you? You already have gold and silver,&quot; as it is written, &quot;And Abraham was very wealthy&quot; (Genesis 13:2). But God said, &quot;Look at what is written about me: 'the hair of his head was pure wool' (Daniel 7:9). I will make you an ornate crown, as it is written, 'Grey hair is a crown of glory; it is gained by living a godly life' (Proverbs 16:31). And where will you find it? You will find it on the path of righteousness&quot; (Proverbs 16:31).</p>

              <p>Chapter 40: Torah [1] And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old (Genesis 27:1). Twenty generations passed until Abraham, in which old age is not mentioned except for him, as it says, &quot;Now Abraham was old&quot; (Genesis 24:1). And Isaac also stood [before God] and it came to pass, that when Isaac was old (Genesis 27:1). And Jacob also stood [before God], as it says, &quot;And the eyes of Israel were dim with age&quot; (Genesis 48:10). The verse (Psalms 102:17) says, &quot;He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.&quot; The only way [to achieve this level of prayer] is through old age, as it says, &quot;The beauty of young men is their strength, and the glory of old men is their gray hair&quot; (Proverbs 20:29). Abraham merited his son through five things, as our Rabbis taught: the father merits a son through five things: through his [the father's] name, through his [the father's] good deeds, through his [the father's] wealth, through his [the father's] strength, and through his [the father's] wisdom. Similarly, Isaac [merited his son through five things], and similarly Jacob [merited his son through five things]. Similarly, Jacob merited Joseph [through these five things], who resembled him in appearance and in title, as it says, &quot;And Joseph was handsome in form and appearance&quot; (Genesis 39:6). [He resembled him] in wisdom, as it says, &quot;Behold, he is the master of dreams&quot; (Genesis 37:19). He had beauty, appearance, and wisdom. And in Isaac's case, it is written, &quot;Who is this man?&quot; (Genesis 24:65). What is the meaning of &quot;this man&quot; in reference to Joseph? That he was handsome and had wisdom. Likewise, Isaac was also built with wisdom. And just as Joseph stood up to his brothers in strength, so did Isaac stand up in strength against all the men of Gerar. Just as Joseph was wealthy, so was Isaac wealthy, as it says, &quot;And the man became great and went forward and became very great&quot; (Genesis 26:13). The verse (Genesis 26:8) explains [the word] &quot;wisdom&quot; as meaning &quot;the greatness of his children.&quot; From where do we learn that Isaac was handsome like Joseph? It is written about Joseph, &quot;And Joseph was handsome in form and appearance,&quot; and when he went to his brothers, what did they say? &quot;Behold, the master of dreams is coming!&quot; (Genesis 37:19). And it is said about Isaac, &quot;Who is this man?&quot; (Genesis 24:65). What is the meaning of &quot;this man&quot; in reference to Joseph? That he was handsome and had wisdom. Likewise, Isaac was also built with strength, as it says, We know this from the fact that he dug many wells, as it says, &quot;Isaac dug again the wells of water&quot; (Genesis 26:18), and &quot;Isaac's servants dug in the valley&quot; (Genesis 26:19), and &quot;they dug another well&quot; (Genesis 26:21). He had strength in his hands. From where do we know that he was wealthy? It says, &quot;The man became great, and he grew richer and richer until he was very wealthy&quot; (Genesis 26:13). And from where do we know that he lived to a ripe old age of 180 years? It says, &quot;And Isaac lived one hundred and eighty years&quot; (Genesis 35:28). Abraham was the son of Terah, and Isaac was the son of Abraham. Why does the Torah mention this? Because God said to Isaac, &quot;You have merited these five things, so I will add another five years to your life, like your father Abraham.&quot; That is why it says, &quot;Look upon your servants&quot; (Psalms 119:16). Anyone who has merit will receive these five things, and anyone who does not have merit will receive five calamities in return. And who was this? Joab, as it is said: &quot;Let Joab and his descendants be perpetually guilty of their bloodshed. May they be afflicted with leprosy, jaundice, and starvation.&quot; (2 Samuel 3:29) Leprosy corresponds to strength; one who has leprosy has no strength. Jaundice corresponds to beauty; even if someone is young and jaundiced, there is no beauty in them. Starvation corresponds to wealth, as it says, &quot;Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed. Leave your simple ways and you will live&quot; (Proverbs 9:5-6). One who is starving has no leisure to engage in Torah study. Falling by the sword corresponds to the five aspects of praise. These are five calamities corresponding to five aspects of praise. One who does not merit praise inherits these five kinds of calamities, like Joab. But one who does merit praise receives them like Isaac, as it is said, &quot;And it came to pass, when Isaac was old&quot; (Genesis 27:1), and David cries out, &quot;May your children be like your ancestors&quot; (Psalms 45:17). Therefore, it says, &quot;And it came to pass, when Isaac was old.&quot;</p>

              <p>[2] And so all the righteous suffered in their youth and ultimately found comfort. Abraham suffered greatly in his youth, was thrown into a fiery furnace, and was cast out of his father's house. Sixteen kings came against him, and his wife was taken from him by both Pharaoh and Abimelech. He was tested with his only son, Isaac, but in the end found peace, as it says &quot;And Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things&quot; (Genesis 24:1). Isaac also suffered greatly in his youth, as Ishmael took an arrow and tried to kill him. It says, &quot;And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac&quot; (Genesis 21:9). &quot;Playing&quot; means he took an arrow and tried to kill him. Furthermore, his father Abraham was going to slaughter him, and then famine came, as it says, &quot;Now there was a famine in the land&quot; (Genesis 26:1). Isaac went to Abimelech and became the target of jealousy, as it says, &quot;And the Philistines envied him&quot; (Genesis 26:14). They told him to leave, and he went and settled in Gerar, where he disputed with the shepherds. But ultimately he found comfort, as it says, &quot;Therefore he called it Rehoboth, for he said, 'For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land'&quot; (Genesis 26:22). Similarly, Jacob suffered greatly, as Esau pursued him, and he was enslaved by his sons. He was pursued by Laban and punished through his daughter. His son was sold, and in the end he found peace, as it says, &quot;And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years&quot; (Genesis 47:28). Joseph was deeply pained when his brothers despised him, threw him into a pit, sold him into slavery, and he was imprisoned. As it is written, &quot;They afflicted his feet with shackles; iron pierced his soul until his word came to pass and God's word proved him true&quot; (Psalms 105:18-19). Joseph remained silent, as it is written, &quot;He sits alone in silence&quot; (Lamentations 3:28). In the end, he was redeemed, as it is written, &quot;He will not abandon forever, for He desires to show kindness&quot; (Lamentations 3:31). And it is written at the end, &quot;Hurry and go up to my father&quot; (Genesis 45:9).</p>

              <p>“Take the Levites” – that is what the verse said: “The Lord assesses the righteous, but He hates the wicked and the lover of villainy” (Psalms 11:5). “The Lord assesses the righteous” – the Holy One blessed be He does not elevate a person to a position of authority until he first assesses and examines him. When he passes His ordeal, He elevates him to a position of authority. Likewise, you find regarding Abraham our patriarch. The Holy One blessed be He subjected him to ten ordeals and he passed them. Then He blessed him: “The Lord blessed Abraham with everything” (Genesis 24:1). Likewise, Isaac, He subjected him to the ordeal of Avimelekh, and he passed the ordeal. Then He blessed him, as it is stated: “Isaac sowed in that land and found in that year one hundredfold, and the Lord blessed him” (Genesis 26:12). Likewise, Jacob our patriarch, He subjected him to an ordeal with all those travails; with Esau, with Rachel, with Dina, with Joseph, and how he left his father’s house: “For with my staff I crossed this Jordan” (Genesis 32:11). And He blessed him: “God appeared to Jacob again, already upon his arrival from Padan Aram, and He blessed him” (Genesis 35:9). Likewise, Joseph with the wife of Potifera; he was incarcerated for twelve years and became king because he passed his ordeals. That is, “the Lord assesses the righteous.”  The tribe of Levi, too, devoted their lives for sanctification of the name of the Holy One blessed be He. When Israel was in Egypt, they rejected the Torah and circumcision, as Ezekiel rebukes them: “So said the Lord God: On the day that I chose Israel, I raised My hand to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt” (Ezekiel 20:5). What is ultimately written thereafter? “They defied Me and did not want to heed Me…and I said to pour My fury upon them” (Ezekiel 20:8). What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He brought darkness upon the Egyptians for three days, during which he killed all the wicked of Israel, as it says: “I will purge the rebels and the transgressors against Me from among you” (Ezekiel 20:38). Likewise it says: “The fig tree formed its unripe figs” (Song of Songs 2:13), these are the wicked who were among Israel. “And the vines, budding, emitted fragrance” (Song of Songs 2:13), the survivors who repented were accepted. “Arise, my love, my fair one, and go” (Song of Songs 2:13), as the time of the redemption has arrived. But the tribe of Levi, all of them were righteous, and all of them would perform the Torah, as it is stated: “For they observed Your saying, and Your covenant they upheld” (Deuteronomy 33:9); this is circumcision. Moreover, when Israel crafted the calf, the tribe of Levi did not participate, as it is stated: “Moses stood at the gate of the camp…and all the sons of Levi gathered to him” (Exodus 32:26). When Moses said to them: “Each man, place his sword upon his thigh” (Exodus 32:27), what did they do? They placed it and showed no favor. Likewise, Moses said in his blessing: “Who said of his father and of his mother: I have not seen him” (Deuteronomy 33:9). When the Holy One blessed be He saw that they were all righteous, he subjected them to an ordeal and they passed the ordeal, as it is stated: “Whom you subjected to an ordeal at Masa” (Deuteronomy 33:8). Immediately, He said: “The Levites shall be Mine” (Numbers 8:14), to realize what is stated: “The Lord assesses the righteous” (Psalms 11:5). But the wicked, it is written in their regard: “But He hates the wicked and the lover of villainy” (Psalms 11:5). David said: “Happy is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways” (Psalms 128:1).</p>

He gave him a tithe of everything” (Genesis 14:20).  “And blessed is God, the Most High, who delivered [migen] your enemies into your hand” – Rabbi Huna said: He turned the plot [mangenin] against you upon your enemies. Rabbi Yudan said: How many stratagems [mangenaot] did I perform in order to deliver them into your hand. They (The two sets of kings.)  had been fond of one another; this one would send letters to that one, and that one would send gifts to this one, but I incited discord between this one and that one so they would come and fall into your hand.   “He gave him a tithe of everything [mikol]” – Rabbi Yehuda bar Rav Simon said: On the basis of that tribute, three of the pillars of the world, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, benefitted. Regarding Abraham it is written: “The Lord had blessed Avraham with everything [bakol]” (Genesis 24:1), due to the merit of: “He gave him a tithe of everything [mikol].” Regarding Isaac it is written: “And I partook of all [mikol]” (Genesis 27:33), due to the merit of: “He gave him a tithe of everything [mikol].” Regarding Jacob it is written: “For God has graced me and because I have everything [kol]” (Genesis 33:11), due to the merit of: “He gave him a tithe of everything [mikol].”  From where did Israel merit the Priestly Benediction? (Numbers 6:23–26.)  Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda said: From Abraham: “So [ko] shall your descendants be” (Genesis 15:5) – “so [ko] shall you bless the children of Israel” (Numbers 6:23). Rabbi Neḥemya said: From Isaac, as it is stated: “I and the lad will go to there [ko]” (Genesis 22:5). That is why the Omnipresent said: “So [ko] you shall bless the children of Israel.” The Rabbis said: From Jacob, as it is stated: “So [ko] you shall say to the house of Jacob” (Exodus 19:3). Corresponding to it is: “So [ko] shall you bless the children of Israel.”  Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, Rabbi Eliezer said: [God said:] ‘When will I increase your descendants like the stars? (This section is referring to the verse: “He took him outside, and said: Look now to the heavens, and count the stars, if you could count them, and He said to him: So [ko] will your offspring be” (Genesis 15:5).)  When I reveal Myself to them through the word ko’ – “So [ko] you shall say to the house of Jacob” (Exodus 19:3). Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: When I reveal Myself to their leader (Moses.)  through the word ko: “So [ko] said the Lord: My firstborn son is Israel” (Exodus 4:22).</p>

(Yishmael would stand at the entrance of the tent in order to ensure that men would not enter it when Sarah was alone, to avoid the seclusion of a man and a woman, which is forbidden.)    “And it was behind him” – this refers to the angel, who looked behind him, sensing that light was coming from behind him. (Sarah’s body virtually glowed from her righteousness.)  “Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years; it had ceased to be with Sarah the manner of women” (Genesis 18:11).  “Abraham and Sarah were old” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It was already stated: “Abraham and Sarah were old,” why does the verse state [again]: “Abraham was old”? (Genesis 24:1). (That verse is referring to a time forty years later than our verse.)  The explanation is that the Holy One blessed be He restored him to the days of his youth; (When the angels came to him he became reinvigorated. Consequently, he had to go through the ageing process again.)  therefore, it was necessary to write a second time: Abraham was old. Rabbi Ami said: Here it refers to old age with vitality, and there it refers to old age without vitality.  “It had ceased [ḥadal] to be with Sarah the manner of women” – just as it says: “If you refrain [teḥdal] from vowing” (Deuteronomy 23:23), [meaning that] it had ceased, just as it says: “And he refrained [veḥadal] from offering the Paschal lamb” (Numbers 9:13).</p>

              <p>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak began: “One who pursues righteousness and kindness [will find life, righteousness, and honor]” (Proverbs 21:21). Upon the death of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, who used to dance [at weddings] with three myrtle branches, (He would juggle the branches to entertain the bride and groom.)  winds and storms emerged that uprooted all the good trees in the Land of Israel. Why was that? Because he used to pick branches from them with which to dance before the bride. (The storms that uprooted the trees were a sign that the very forces of nature were mourning his death.)  The Rabbis would say: ‘Why does he act like this? Why does he demean the honor of the Torah?’ (It is not befitting for a Torah scholar of such esteem to perform this kind of entertainment.)  Rabbi Ze’eira said: ‘Leave him, as he knows what he is doing.’ When he died, they went out to bestow kindness upon him. (A common expression meaning that they went to his funeral, and eulogized him.)  A fiery branch descended and assumed the shape of a myrtle branch, and interposed itself between the bier and the congregation. They said: ‘See this elder, who used to rise up and exert himself [in doing mitzvot], so a [fiery] branch rose up for him.’   Alternatively, “one who pursues righteousness” (Proverbs 21:21) – this is Abraham. “[For I love him, so that he will command his children and his household after him,] that they observe the way of the Lord”; “and kindness…” (Genesis 18:19), as cited above. (See Bereshit Rabba 58:9.) </p>

              <p>“You are fairer [yafyafita] than sons of man; grace flows…” (Psalms 45:3) – [this refers to Abraham]. You are fair (The word yafyafita, with a doubling of the syllable yaf, indicates two kinds of beauty.)  among the heavenly, as it is stated: “The angels cried outside” (Isaiah 33:7). (The angels cried for Abraham at the binding of Isaac (see Bereshit Rabba 56:5).)  You are fair among the earthly – “you are a prince of God in our midst” (Genesis 23:6). “Therefore, God has blessed you forever” (Psalms 45:3) – “the Lord blessed Abraham with everything.”  “Who will ascend the mountain of the Lord?” (Psalms 24:3). This refers to Abraham, [who experienced spiritual elevation atop Mount Moriah, where God told him:] “Now I know that you are God fearing” (Genesis 22:12). “Who will stand [yakum] in His holy place?” (Psalms 24:3) – this refers to Abraham, as it is stated: “Abraham arose [vayakom] early in the morning, to go to the place” (Genesis 19:27). “Clean of hands and pure of heart” (Psalms 24:4) – “[Abram said to the king of Sodom: I have raised my hand to the Lord…] that neither a thread nor a shoelace [nor anything of yours shall I take]” (Genesis 14:22–23); “and pure of heart” – [for he said to God:] “Far be it from You to do something like this, [to put the righteous to death along with the wicked]” (Genesis 18:25). “Who has not taken a soul in vain” (Psalms 24:4) – this refers to Nimrod’s soul; (Abraham slew Nimrod, but it was not without justification, because Nimrod was pursuing him to kill him.)  “nor taken an oath deceitfully” (Psalms 24:4) – “I have raised my hand to the Lord, God Most High” (Genesis 14:22). “He will receive the blessing of the Lord, and righteousness [from the God of his salvation]” (Psalms 24:5) – “Abraham was old…and the Lord blessed Abraham with everything.”   Abraham was the source of blessing for everyone, as it is stated: “[All the families of the earth] shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3). Who was the source of blessing for Abraham? The Holy One blessed be He was his source of blessing – “the Lord blessed Abraham with everything.” Moses was the source of miracles for Israel, as it is written: “With all the signs and the wonders…that Moses performed” (Deuteronomy 34:11–12). Who was the source of miracles for Moses? It was the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “Moses built an altar and called its name; The Lord Is My Miracle” (Exodus 17:15).  David was Israel’s shepherd, as it is stated: “You will shepherd My people Israel” (I Chronicles 11:2). Who was David’s shepherd? It was the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want” (Psalms 23:1).  Jerusalem is the source of light for the world, as it is stated: “Nations will walk by your light” (Isaiah 60:3). Who is the source of light for Jerusalem?

              <p>“Abraham was old [zaken].” Zaken – this one acquired [zeh kana] two worlds. (He enjoyed both worlds – possessing great wealth and a ripe old age in this world, and the ultimate reward in the World to Come.)  There were three people who were crowned with old age and length of days, and the three of them were originators of dynasties: Abraham, Joshua, (See Joshua 13:1.)  and David. (See I Kings 1:1.)  Abraham was the originator of the patriarchs. Joshua was the originator of the monarchy of the tribe of Ephraim, as it is stated: “From Ephraim came those whose roots are in Amalek” (Judges 5:14) – this refers to Joshua. (Joshua was the first to wage war against Amalek (Exodus 17:9).)  David was the originator of the monarchy of the tribe of Judah.  Rabbi Aḥa said: You may meet a person who appears old, but does not [actually] have [length of] days, (This refers to someone who grays prematurely; he appears aged, although he is young.)  or one who has [length of] days but does not appear old. But here, [regarding Abraham,] the elderly appearance corresponded to the [length of] days, and the [length of] days corresponded to the elderly appearance.   “Advanced in years [ba bayamim]” – he gained entry [ba] into two worlds. (This is derived from the syllables ba ba, which could be interpreted as “he entered, he entered.”)  Rabbi Abba said: He entered [ba] through the direct gate to the World to Come. (Bayamim is taken as a reference to one’s truly significant days [yamim], that is, in the World to Come. Abraham, in his great righteousness, gained entry [ba] to that world directly, without reservation.)  Rabbi Yitzḥak said: [Abraham had entered [ba]] those days in whose regard it is written: “Before the bad days come” (Ecclesiastes 12:1). (That verse refers to old age, when man’s senses and physical strength begin to fail him. Although chronologically Abraham reached this age, the verse goes on to say: “And the Lord blessed Abraham with everything.” He was miraculously spared the ravages of old age.) </p>

Rather, “the Lord blessed Abraham with everything” means that He did not grant him a daughter at all.  Rabbi Levi said three interpretations: “With everything” means that he granted him control over his evil inclination; “with everything” means that Ishmael repented during his lifetime; “with everything” means that his food storehouse lacked nothing.

              <p>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon said: Abraham demanded aging. He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, a man and his son enter a place and no one knows which of them to honor. Because you adorn him with aging, a person knows whom to honor.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, you have demanded a good thing, and it will begin with you.’ From the beginning of the book until that point, aging is not written. When Abraham stood, He granted him aging – “Abraham was old” (Genesis 24:1).   Isaac demanded suffering. He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, a person dies without suffering, the attribute of justice is outstretched against him. When you bring suffering upon him, the attribute of justice is not outstretched against him.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, you have demanded a good thing, and I will begin with you.’ From the beginning of the book until here, suffering is not written. When Isaac stood, He granted him suffering – “it was when Isaac was old, and [his eyes] dimmed.”  Jacob demanded illness. He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, a person dies without illness and does not settle matters between his children. When he is ill for two or three days, he settles matters between his children.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, you have demanded a good thing, and it will begin with you’ – “One said to Joseph: Behold, your father is ill” (Genesis 48:1).  Rabbi Levi said: Abraham introduced aging, Isaac introduced suffering, Jacob introduced illness, Hezekiah introduced illness that is cured. He said to Him: ‘You would sustain one until the day of his death. (In good health.)  But because a person is ill and recovers, is ill and recovers, he repents.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘As you live, you have demanded a good thing.’ That is what is written: “A composition of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he became ill and recovered from his illness” (Isaiah 38:9). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: From here [we learn], that between illness and illness, there was an illness that was more severe than both of them.</p>

              <p>R. Nehorai says: &quot;I will put aside all the worldly occupation and will teach my son only the Torah; for a man enjoys its benefit in this world and the capital remains for the future world. But other occupations are not so, and furthermore, when a person gets sick when he advances in age, or any misfortune should overcome him, on account of which he could not work, then he is exposed to the pangs of hunger. But the Torah is not so, it protects him from all evil things. Concerning his youth what does the passage say? (Is. 40, 31) Yet they that wait upon the Lord shall acquire new strength; and concerning the aged, what does the passage say? (Ps. 92, 15) They shall still bring forth fruit in old age. So also do we find concerning Abraham, our patriarch (Gen. 24, 1) And Abraham was old — and the Lord blessed Abraham in all things..

Another matter: “For to the man who is good before Him” – these are the Israelites who were in Egypt, [to whom] “He gave wisdom, knowledge, and joy.” “But to the sinner He gave the task to gather and to amass” – these are the Canaanites. Rabbi Levi said: None of them would add even a drop of oil to his beans, and even if his egg would break, he would not taste it, but rather, he would sell it and turn it into money, so that the Israelites would enter the land and find it filled with blessings.

              </summary>
              <p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 8:6): TAKE THE LEVITES. This text is related (to Ps. 11:5): THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS. The Holy One does not elevate a person to an office until  he tests and examines him. (Tanh. Numb. 3:8; Numb. R. 15:12.)  When he withstands his test, he elevates him to the office. And so you find in the case of our father Abraham, when the Holy One tested him with ten temptations, he withstood his trial. Then after that he blessed him. It is so stated (in Gen. 24:1): AND THE LORD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS. So also in the case of Isaac, when he tested him in the days of Abimelech, he withstood the trial. Then after that he blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 26:12): SO ISAAC SOWED ON THAT LAND [ … FOR THE LORD HAD BLESSED HIM]. So also in the case of Jacob, when he tested him by means of all those tribulations with Esau with Dinah, with Joseph, and  how he departed from the house of his father and his mother (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): FOR WITH  …, he blessed him. It is so stated (in Gen. 35:9): NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN, [WHEN HE CAME FROM PADDAN-ARAM, AND BLESSED HIM]. So also in the case of Joseph, he tested him with the wife of Potiphar, and he was imprisoned for twelve years. Then after that he came out and became king because he had withstood his trial. Ergo (in Ps. 11:5): THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS. So also in the case of the tribe of Levi, they laid down their lives for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One (i.e. for martyrdom), so that the Torah would not be set aside. Now when Israel was in Egypt, they had rejected the Torah and circumcision and all of them had become worshipers of idols as Ezekiel has demonstrated where it is stated (in Ezek. 20:5): AND YOU SHALL SAY UNTO THEM: THUS SAYS THE LORD GOD, IN THE DAY THAT I CHOSE ISRAEL…. Then what is written at the end (in vs. 8)? BUT THEY REBELLED AGAINST ME AND DID NOT COME TO HEARKEN UNTO ME. [INDIVIDUALLY THEY DID NOT CAST AWAY THE ABOMINATIONS OF THEIR EYES NOR DID THEY FORSAKE THE IDOLS OF EGYPT]. What did the Holy One do? He brought darkness upon Egypt for three days, and during those  he killed all the wicked ones of Israel. For this reason it says (in Ezek. 20:36, 38): AS I BROUGHT YOUR ANCESTORS TO JUDGMENT IN THE DESERT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT….] SO WILL I REMOVE FROM YOU . So also it says (in Cant. 2:13): AND THE FIG TREE SHEDS (Heb.: hanetah. Although the biblical context suggests a translation such as “puts forth” or “ripens” the context understands this rare verb in a more negative sense. See above vol. 2, p. 62 Tanh. (Buber); Exod. 3:7).)  ITS GREEN FIGS…. These are the wicked who are in Israel. (Ibid. cont.:) AND THE VINES IN BLOSSOM GIVE OFF FRAGRANCE. These are the rest who have repented and been accepted. (Ibid. cont.:) ARISE, MY BELOVED, MY FAIR ONE, AND COME AWAY, for behold the time of redemption has arrived. However all those in the tribe of Levi were righteous and carried out the Torah. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:9): FOR THEY OBSERVED YOUR WORD, i.e., the Torah; AND KEPT YOUR COVENANT, i.e., circumcision. And not only that, but when Israel made the calf, the tribe of Levi did not participate there as stated (in Exod. 32:26): SO MOSES STOOD UP ON THE GATE OF THE CAMP AND SAID: WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD COME TO ME. THEN ALL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI GATHERED UNTO HIM. When Moses said (in vs. 27): EACH  [PUT HIS SWORD ON HIS THIGH, they immediately did so. Moreover they did not show partiality. And so Moses blesses them,  the one (according Deut. 33:9) WHO SAYS OF HIS FATHER AND MOTHER: I DO NOT CONSIDER THEM …, FOR THEY (the Levites) OBSERVED YOUR WORD AND KEPT YOUR COVENANT. When the Holy One saw that they all were righteous, that he had tested them and they had withstood their trial, as stated (of Levi in Deut. 33:8):  WHOM YOU TESTED AT MASSAH, the Holy One immediately said (in Numb. 8:14): AND THE LEVITES SHALL BELONG TO ME to fulfill what is stated (in Ps. 11:5): THE LORD TESTS THE RIGHTEOUS. In the case of the wicked, however, it is written of them (ibid. cont.:) BUT HIS SOUL (i.e. the soul of the Holy One) HATES THE WICKED AND THE LOVER OF INJUSTICE. David said (in Ps. 128:1): BLESSED IS EVERYONE WHO FEARS THE LORD AND WALKS IN HIS WAYS.</p>

Now a buckler is nothing but a shield, as shown in the verse (I Sam. 17:7): AND THE ONE BEARING THE BUCKLER WAS GOING BEFORE HIM (i.e., Goliath). What is the meaning of ENCOMPASSING HIM WITH FAVOR? That he blessed Abraham in his old age, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.</p>

              <p>[(Gen. 24:1:) NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.] This text is related (to Ps. 25:10): ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH. The beginning of Torah is steadfast love, its middle is steadfast love, and its end is steadfast love. (See above, 4:1 &amp; 4; Eccl. R. 7:2:2.)  Its beginning is steadfast love in that he has rendered steadfast love to bridegrooms and brides. He rendered steadfast love to Adam and Eve, as stated (in Gen. 2:22): THEN GOD BUILT THE RIB &lt; WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM THE MAN INTO A WOMAN &gt;. R. Abbahu said: In Arabia they call the plaited coiffure a &quot;building.&quot; (Cf. Ber. 61a; Shab. 95a; Erub. 18a; Nid. 45b; ARN, A, 4; Gen. R. 18:1; M. Pss. 25:11.)  The Holy One adorned Eve and brought her to Adam. (Cf. Gen. R. 8:13.)  Do you suppose that he brought her to him under an olive tree? Or under a fig tree? Our masters have said: The Holy One made thirteen bridal canopies for Adam and Eve, as stated (in Ezek. 28:13): YOU WERE IN EDEN, THE GARDEN OF GOD; &lt; EVERY PRECIOUS STONE WAS YOUR COVERING: CARNELIAN, CHRYSOLITE, AMETHYST, BERYL, LAPIS LAZULI, JASPER, SAPPHIRE, TURQUOISE, EMERALD, AND GOLD &gt;. And the least of them is gold; for so it is written: EMERALD, AND GOLD (i.e., with gold in last place). Thus &lt; there were &gt; thirteen bridal canopies which were made for Adam and Eve. (Since Ezek. lists only nine stones plus gold, according to BB 75a there were only ten canopies; or perhaps eleven, with EVERY PRECIOUS STONE representing the extra one. Lev. R. 20:2 explains the tradition of thirteen by having EVERY PRECIOUS STONE represent three canopies. Similarly Gen. R. 18:2; Eccl. R. 8:1:2; PRK 4:4; PR 14:10.)  R. Levi said in the name of R. Hama bar Hanina: The Holy One adorned Eve with twenty-four ornaments. And not only that, but he took her by the hand and brought her to Adam. R. Abbin Berabbi the Levite said: Blessed is a provincial who has seen this: the king taking &lt; his bride &gt; by the hand and bringing her to the house for him. (Gen. R. 18:3.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 2:22, cont.): AND BROUGHT HER TO ADAM. Ergo (in Ps. 25:10): ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH. Thus the beginning of Torah is steadfast love. Its middle also is steadfast love. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 35:8): THEN REBEKAH'S NURSE, DEBORAH, DIED. When she had died, what is written (ibid.)? AND ITS NAME (i.e., the name of her burial place) WAS CALLED WEEPING OAK, for Jacob was sitting there and weeping over her. The Holy One said: Jacob is sitting and grieving. He appeared to him visibly, as stated (in vs. 9): NOW THE LORD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN… &lt; AND BLESSED HIM &gt;. (Eccl. R. 7:2:3; see Gen. R. 8:13; 82:1.)  And its end is steadfast love, &lt; as seen in the case &gt; of Moses; for, when he passed away, he buried him. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 34:6): AND &lt; THE LORD &gt; BURIED HIM IN THE VALLEY IN THE LAND OF MOAB. Ergo (in Ps. 25:10): ALL THE PATHS OF THE LORD ARE STEADFAST LOVE AND TRUTH. (Cf. M. Pss. 25:11, which derives from the verse that the Holy One adorns brides (Gen. 2:22), visits the sick (Gen. 18:1), and buries the dead (Deut. 34:6).)  Abraham persisted in clinging to a measure of steadfast love. The Holy One said to him: This measure was mine and you have taken it. By your life, I am making you &lt; old &gt; like me. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Dan. 7:9): AS I LOOKED, THRONES WERE SET IN PLACE, AND THE ANCIENT OF DAYS TOOK HIS SEAT. HIS GARMENT WAS AS WHITE AS SNOW, &lt; AND THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD WAS LIKE PURE WOOL &gt;. (See Gen. R. 58:9.)  What is written elsewhere on the matter (in Gen. 23:19)? THEN AFTERWARDS ABRAHAM BURIED HIS WIFE SARAH. (In doing so, Abraham showed his steadfast love.)  He persisted in clinging to her. The Holy One said to him. You deserve a crown. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD (i.e., with a crown of white hair).</p>

              <p>[(Gen. 24:1:) NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.] This text is related (to Prov. 31:10): WHO CAN FIND A GALLANT WIFE? (Cf. Tanh., Gen. 4:4.)  About whom were the words spoken? &lt; They were spoken about Sarah &gt; since it is written above (in Gen. 23:2): AND ABRAHAM PROCEEDED TO MOURN FOR SARAH AND WEEP FOR HER, &lt; i.e., &gt; he began to weep and eulogize. So he said: When shall I be able to get &lt; another wife &gt; like you? (The midrash is interpreting Prov. 32:10ff. as Abraham’s eulogy over Sarah.)  (Prov. 31:10:) A GALLANT WIFE. This was Sarah, as stated (in Gen. 12:11): SEE HERE NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A BEAUTIFUL-LOOKING WOMAN. (Prov. 31:10, cont.:) HER VALUE WAS FAR BEYOND THAT OF RUBIES, in that you came from afar. Thus it is stated (in Is. 46:11): SUMMONING A BIRD OF PREY FROM THE EAST, MY CONFIDANT FROM A FAR COUNTRY. (Prov. 31:11:) HER HUSBAND'S HEART HAD CONFIDENCE IN HER: This was Sarah, as stated (in Gen. 12:13): [PLEASE SAY YOU ARE MY SISTER] SO THAT IT MAY BE WELL WITH ME BECAUSE OF YOU. (Prov. 31:11, cont.:) AND HE HAS NO LACK OF PROFIT. This refers to our father Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 13:2): NOW ABRAHAM WAS VERY RICH. (Prov. 31:12:) SHE DID GOOD FOR HIM AND NOT EVIL. This refers to Sarah, since it is stated (in Gen. 12:16): AND BECAUSE OF HER, IT WENT WELL WITH ABRAHAM. (Prov. 31:13:) SHE LOOKS FOR WOOL AND FLAX, &lt; in choosing &gt; between &lt; flaxen &gt; Ishmael and &lt; the pure wool of &gt; Isaac. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:9f.): THEN SARAH SAW THE SON OF HAGAR THE EGYPTIAN … AND SAID TO ABRAHAM: CAST OUT THIS SLAVE WOMAN &lt; AND HER SON &gt;…. (Prov. 31:14:) SHE WAS LIKE THE MERCHANT SHIPS, in that she was moving from place to place and from country to country. Like such a vessel which goes from place to place on the sea (according to Prov. 31:14, cont.): SHE BRINGS HER FOOD FROM AFAR. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 20:16): THEN HE SAID UNTO SARAH: SEE, I HAVE GIVEN YOUR BROTHER A THOUSAND SILVER PIECES. (Prov. 31:15:) SHE ALSO AROSE WHILE IT WAS STILL NIGHT AND GAVE FOOD TO HER HOUSEHOLD. When? (In Gen. 22:3:) SO ABRAHAM AROSE EARLY IN THE MORNING…. (Prov. 31:15, cont.:) AND GAVE FOOD TO HER HOUSEHOLD, EVEN A STATUTE (The usual translation here is PORTION, but STATUTE better fits the Tanhuma context.)  FOR HER YOUNG WOMEN. (Gen. 17:26:) ON THAT VERY DAY ABRAHAM WAS CIRCUMCISED…. Now STATUTE can only mean circumcision, as shown (in Ps. 105:10): AND HE ESTABLISHED IT (i.e., Abraham's covenant) FOR JACOB AS A STATUTE, FOR ISRAEL AS AN EVERLASTING COVENANT. (Of course, Abraham’s EVERLASTING COVENANT meant circumcision.)  (Prov. 31:16:) SHE SET HER MIND ON A FIELD AND BOUGHT IT. Thus, while she was alive, she had her mind on obtaining the cave of Machpelah AND BOUGHT IT, for here she is buried in it (cf. Gen. 23). (Prov. 31:16, cont.:) FROM THE FRUIT OF HER HANDS SHE PLANTED A VINEYARD, as stated (in Gen. 21:33): AND HE PLANTED A TAMARISK TREE. What is the meaning of AND HE PLANTED? &lt; It is &gt; as you say (in Gen. 9:20): AND HE PLANTED A VINEYARD. (Prov. 31:17:) SHE GIRDED HER LOINS WITH VIGOR, when Abraham said to her (in Gen. 18:6): HURRY UP WITH THREE SEAHS OF FINE MEAL…. (Prov. 31:18:) SHE PERCEIVED THAT HER MERCHANDISE WAS GOOD; AND (in Gen. 21:7) SHE SAID: WHO WOULD HAVE SAID TO ABRAHAM THAT SARAH WOULD SUCKLE CHILDREN? (Prov. 31:18, cont.:) HER LAMP WOULD NOT GO OUT AT NIGHT. When? (In Gen. 14:15:) THEN HE DEPLOYED &lt; HIS FORCES &gt; AGAINST THEM BY NIGHT. (The verse assumes that Sarah was waiting up for Abraham to return from battle.)  (Prov. 31:21:) SHE WOULD NOT BE AFRAID FOR HER HOUSEHOLD BECAUSE OF SNOW. When? When the Holy One showed him Gehinnom (with its snow), she foretold that none of her children would go down into its midst. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 15:17): THERE APPEARED A SMOKING OVEN AND A FLAMING TORCH. Why? Because they fulfilled two commandments, (as shown in Prov. 31:21, cont.): BECAUSE ALL HER HOUSEHOLD ARE CLOTHED TWOFOLD, (The traditional text vocalizes TWOFOLD to mean CRIMSON.)  i.e., with the Sabbath and with circumcision. (Prov. 31:22:) SHE MADE COVERINGS FOR HERSELF. When? When they said to him (in Gen. 18:9): WHERE IS YOUR WIFE SARAH? He said to her: You have received good news that you are to bear &lt; children &gt;, and from them will go forth high priests who will serve in the Tent of Meeting. (Prov. 31:22, cont.:) HER CLOTHING IS LINEN AND PURPLE, as stated (in Exod. 26:31): &lt; AND YOU SHALL MAKE A VEIL OF &gt; {LINEN} [BLUE] AND PURPLE…. (Prov. 31:23:) HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES. When Sarah died, old age sprang upon Abraham and he was called elderly. Now it is stated (in Gen. 23:6, after the report of Sarah's death): HEAR US, MY LORD, YOU ARE A PRINCE OF GOD IN OUR MIDST. Ergo, HER HUSBAND WAS KNOWN IN THE GATES; &lt; and the verse continues &gt; immediately: AS HE SAT AMONG THE ELDERS OF THE LAND. He had become old; therefore, it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.</p>

              <p>[(Gen. 24:1:) NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.] Come and see: From Adam even to Abraham there are twenty generation, but there is no &lt; mention of &gt; old age written about &lt; any of &gt; them except about him. (BM 87a; Sanh. 107b; Gen. R. 59:6; 65:9; below, 6:7; PRE 52.)  They sired children and grandchildren, but one did not recognize which was the son and which was the father. Also the children were striking the fathers without knowing it, as stated (in Ps. 78:33): SO HE ENDED THEIR DAYS IN FUTILITY AND THEIR YEARS IN TERROR, because they were all alike until Abraham came along. Then the Holy One gave him this &lt; gray &gt; crown which is an ornament for when one becomes old. And when did it come over him? When he practiced righteousness, since it is stated (in Prov. 16:31): GRAY HAIR IS A CROWN OF GLORY. And how do you find it? (Ibid., cont.:) IT IS FOUND BY WAY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. To whom does this &lt; verse &gt; refer? To Abraham, concerning whom it is written (in Gen. 18:19): FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &lt; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD, TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE &gt;…. The Holy One said to him: By your life, you are worthy of an old age. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD. Now David also received this crown, as stated (in I Kings 1:1): NOW KING DAVID WAS OLD. Why? Because he had acted according to Abraham's standard, as stated (in II Sam. 8:15): AND DAVID PRACTICED JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS TOWARD ALL HIS PEOPLE.

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD. Three people loudly demanded three things, and from them they had their beginning.  (Gen. R. 65:9; 97:1 (Vatican MS); BM 87a; Tanh., Gen. 5:1; PRE 52. See also above, 2:20.)  Abraham demanded old age. Abraham said: When a father and his son enter into a city, no one knows which is the older and which is the younger. The Holy One said: You have loudly demanded old age. By your life, I am beginning with you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD. Isaac demanded afflictions. Isaac said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, when someone sins, you exact retribution from him all at once. Afflict him little by little, and you are exacting retribution from him. If you had brought afflictions upon the generation of the flood, they would not have rebelled against you. You, however, bestowed prosperity upon them. They therefore rebelled against you. Thus it is stated (in Job 12:6): THE TENTS OF ROBBERS PROSPER, AND THOSE WHO PROVOKE GOD HAVE SECURITY. The Holy One said to him: You have loudly demanded afflictions. By your life, I am beginning with you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 27:1): AND IT CAME TO PASS THAT ISAAC WAS OLD, [AND HIS EYES WERE TOO DIM TO SEE]. Jacob demanded illness. Jacob said to the Holy One, Sovereign of the World, one dwells in contentment. Then his life departs, and strife comes into the world. For that reason it is required for one to be in the hands of others; or, in the case of others, it is required for them to be in his hand. Now he dies suddenly and strife comes about in the world. Rather let [one] become [ill] for five or six days until he has ordained for his children everything that is necessary. Then let him depart from the world. The Holy One said to him: Jacob, you have demanded illness. By your life, I am beginning with you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 48:1): AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THESE THINGS {THAT IT WAS TOLD} [THAT ONE SAID] TO JOSEPH: BEHOLD, YOUR FATHER IS ILL. Ergo: The three patriarchs established these three things. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD.</p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD. In the beginning his name had been Abram; and now an H was added to it since he had inherited two worlds, for due to him this world and the world to come were created. R. Halafta bar Kahana said: It is written (in Gen. 2:4): THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH IN THEIR BEING CREATED (HBR'M). These are the letters which (when rearranged) spell &quot;Abraham.&quot; (Thus Gen. 2:4 means that heaven and earth were created in Abraham.)  Ergo: Due to him this world and the world to come were created. &lt; It was &gt; he to whom the Holy One said (in Gen. 12:2): I WILL MAKE YOU A GREAT NATION. Why did he not say to him: &quot;I will establish you&quot; instead of I WILL MAKE YOU? R. Berekhyah the Priest said in the name of his father, R. Hiyya, who spoke in the name of Rav Judah bar Ezekiel and his masters on behalf of our masters in the Diaspora: The Holy One said to Abraham: I am creating you as a new creation and renovating you. (Gen. 12:2:) I WILL ENLARGE YOUR NAME. R. Judah b. R. Shallum the Levite said: The Holy One said to Abraham: I am making your name &lt; correspond &gt; to the number of the members within you. Just as &lt; there are &gt; two hundred and forth-eight members &lt; in the human body &gt;, so &lt; the letters of &gt; your name (when enlarged by an &quot;H&quot;) &lt; shall add up to &gt; two hundred and forth-eight. (Ibid., cont.:) I WILL ENLARGE YOUR NAME, AND YOU SHALL BE A BLESSING. When did he show him the blessing?

Now in the midst of that orchard was a one tree with an elixir of life and another tree with the elixir of death grafted upon it. The tenant said: If I water the tree with the elixir of life, the tree with the elixir of death will drink. The tenant said: I shall work and finish my time. Then whatever the king wants to do in his garden he may do. (Cf. Matthew 13:24–30.)  The king is the Holy One, and the garden is the world. The Holy One delivered it to Abraham.

The Holy One said: By your life, I am beginning &lt; the aging process &gt; with you, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS AGED. (Heb.: zaqen. In Scripture (Gen. 18:11) Abraham and Sarah are the first persons to whom this word is applied.)  • With trials: Where is it shown? Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, if you had not given contentment to the generation of the flood, they would not have provoked you to anger. But, if you had brought trials upon them, they would not have rebelled against you. The Holy One said to him: With you I am beginning to have one suffer trials through his child. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:8.): SO THE CHILD (Isaac) GREW AND WAS WEANED. (The passage goes on to show how the weaning led in vs. 11 to Abraham being distressed.)  {R. Joshua} [R. Osha'ya] and R. Abbin differed. (Gen. R. 53:10.)  The one said that he was weaned from trials. The other said that he was weaned from the evil drive to the good drive. • With an inn, according to what is written (in Gen. 21:33): AND AT BEER-SHEBA HE PLANTED AN ESHEL, i.e., an inn. (Eshel, which is commonly translated here as “tamarisk tree,” can also mean “inn.” Gen. R. 54:6; Sot. 10a.)  • With a legatum {i.e., a gift}: Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 25:6): BUT TO ABRAHAM'S SONS BY CONCUBINES ABRAHAM GAVE GIFTS. </p>

              <p>Another interpretation: When the king loves someone, he honors him with silver, gold, and garments so as to make [him wealthy]. Then, while he is traveling by ship, the wind comes and destroys the ship. Where &lt; now &gt; is the king's gift? Here he had honored him and enriched him. Could he possibly have saved him from the sea? Or from robbers? (Gk.: lestai.)  But the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when he gives one a gift, he protects him, as stated (in Numb. 6:24): THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU. He blessed Abraham and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): &lt; NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD, ADVANCED IN YEARS &gt;, AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS. He blessed Isaac and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 25:11): GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC.

              </summary>
              <p>Thus has R. Tanhuma interpreted (Gen. 27:1): NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD &lt; AND HIS EYES WERE TOO WEAK TO SEE &gt;. You find that there are twenty generations from Adam to Abraham, and there is no &lt; mention of &gt; old age written about &lt; any of &gt; them except Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD. (For parallel accounts, see above, 5:4.)  Isaac arose, &lt; and &gt; it is also written (in Gen. 27:1): NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD. Jacob arose, &lt; and &gt; it is also written (in Gen. 48:10): NOW ISRAEL'S EYES WERE DIM WITH AGE. This text is related (to Ps. 90:16): LET YOUR WORK BE WORTHY FOR YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR GLORY ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN. Now GLORY can only be old age and gray hair, as stated (in Prov. 20:29): THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNG IS THEIR STRENGTH; BUT THE GLORY OF THE OLD IS GRAY HAIR. Ergo (in Ps. 90:16): AND YOUR GLORY ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN. &lt; These words mean &gt; that Abraham endowed Isaac with five things. Thus have our masters taught (in 'Eduy. 2:9): A FATHER ENDOWS HIS SON WITH FIVE THINGS: WITH BEAUTY, WITH STRENGTH, WITH WEALTH, WITH WISDOM, AND WITH &lt; LENGTH OF &gt; YEARS. How is it shown about BEAUTY? In that Isaac was as handsome as Joseph. It is written of Joseph (in Gen. 39:6): NOW JOSEPH WAS WELL BUILT. Also, when he went to his brothers, they said (in Gen. 37:19): HERE COMES THIS (hallazeh) DREAMER. It is also said of Isaac (in Gen. 24:65): WHO IS THIS (hallazeh) MAN &lt; WALKING IN THE FIELD TO MEET US &gt;? Thus Isaac was as handsome as Joseph. How is it shown that Isaac was mighty in STRENGTH? Look at how many wells he dug! Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:18-22): THEN ISAAC REDUG &lt; THE WELLS OF WATER &gt;…. AND ISAAC'S SERVANTS DUG…. AND THEY DUG ANOTHER WELL…. THEN HE MOVED FROM THERE AND DUG &lt; ANOTHER WELL &gt;…. Look at the power which he had! Where is it shown about WEALTH? Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:13): AND THE MAN GREW &lt; RICHER AND RICHER &gt;…. It also says (in vs. 14): AND HE POSSESSED FLOCKS &lt; AND HERDS &gt;…. Where is it shown about WISDOM? Where he said to his father (in Gen. 22:7 at the time of his being bound): HERE ARE THE FIRE AND THE WOOD…. [How is it shown] about &lt; LENGTH OF &gt; YEARS? In that he was one hundred and eighty years old &lt; when he died &gt;, while Abraham was &lt; only &gt; one hundred and seventy-five. On account of these five things {through which he had attained merit}, five years more than his father's were added to him. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 90:16): LET YOUR WORK BE WORTHY FOR YOUR SERVANTS…. Anyone who has merit is meritorious in these five things, and anyone who does not have merit is not meritorious and receives five retributions that correspond to them. (See yQid. 1:7 (61a).)  And who is this anyone? This is Joab, of whom it is stated (in II Sam. 3:29): MAY IT (Abner's blood) FALL UPON THE HEAD OF JOB AND HIS SON; (Masoretic Text: ALL HIS FATHER’S HOUSE.)  [MAY THE HOUSE OF JOAB NEVER LACK ONE WITH A DISCHARGE, A LEPER, A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE, ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD, AND ONE LACKING BREAD]. ONE WITH A DISCHARGE corresponds to STRENGTH. In the case of one who has a discharge, there is no one weaker than he. A LEPER corresponds to BEAUTY. In the case of one who is a leper, even a young &lt; leper &gt;, there is no one more ugly than he. A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE corresponds to WEALTH; for he [is one] {like a poor woman is one} who, if not spinning flax, has nothing of which to eat. ONE LACKING BREAD corresponds to WISDOM, as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where Wisdom says): COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD. And ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD corresponds to &lt; LENGTH OF &gt; YEARS. The one who sins is afflicted by them, but the one who is meritorious receives, as did Isaac. David also gave praise (in Ps. 45:17 [16]): INSTEAD OF YOUR PARENTS THERE WILL BE YOUR CHILDREN.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>(Numb. 8:6:) “Take the Levites.” This text is related (to Ps. 11:5), “The Lord tests the righteous.” The Holy One, blessed be He, does not elevate a person to an office until He first tests and examines him. (Numb. R. 15:12.)  When he withstands his test, He elevates him to the office. And so you find in the case of our father Abraham; when the Holy One, blessed be He, tested him with ten temptations, he withstood his trials. Then after that He blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 24:1), “And the Lord blessed Abraham in all things.” So also in the case of Isaac, when He tested him with the days of Abimelech, he withstood the trial. Then after that He blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 26:12), “So Isaac sowed on that land […] for the Lord had blessed him.” So also in the case of Jacob, when He tested him by means of all those tribulations with Esau, with Rachel, with Dinah, with Joseph, with Simeon, with Benjamin and [with the tribulation of] how he departed from the house of his father and his mother (in Gen. 32:11), “for with [only] my staff did I cross [this Jordan].” Then after that He blessed him. It is so stated (in Gen. 35:9), “Now God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-Aram, and blessed him.” So also in the case of Joseph, He tested him with all of those tribulations, with the wife of Potiphar and he was imprisoned for twelve years. Then after that he came out and became king because he had withstood his trial. Ergo (in Ps. 11:5), “The Lord tests the righteous.” So also in the case of the tribe of Levi, they laid down their lives for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, (i.e. for martyrdom), so that the Torah would not be set aside. Now when Israel was in Egypt, they had rejected the Torah and circumcision and all of them had become worshipers of idols, as Ezekiel has demonstrated where it is stated (in Ezek. 20:5), “And you shall say unto them, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “In the day that I chose Israel […].”’” Then what is written at the end (in vs. 8)? “But they rebelled against Me and did not come to hearken unto Me; each man did not cast away [the abominations of their eyes nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt].” What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He brought darkness upon Egypt for three days, and during those [days] he killed all the wicked ones of Israel. For this reason it says (in Ezek. 20:36-38), “[As I brought your ancestors to judgment in the desert of the land of Egypt….] So will I remove from you those who rebel and transgress against Me.” So also it says (in Cant. 2:13), “And the fig tree sheds (Heb.: hanetah. Although the biblical context suggests a translation such as “puts forth” or “ripens” the context understands this rare verb in a more negative sense. See above vol. 2, p. 62 Tanh. (Buber); Exod. 3:7).)  its green figs…,” these are the wicked who are in Israel; (ibid. cont.) “and the vines in blossom give off fragrance,” these are the rest who have repented and been accepted; (ibid. cont.) “arise, my beloved, my fair one, and come away,” for behold the time of redemption has arrived. However all those in the tribe of Levi were righteous and carried out the Torah. It is so stated (in Deut. 33:9), “For they observed Your word,” i.e., the Torah; (ibid. cont.) “and kept Your covenant,” i.e., circumcision. And not only that, but when Israel made the calf, the tribe of Levi did not participate there, as stated (in Exod. 32:26), “So Moses stood up on the gate of the camp and said, ‘Whoever is for the Lord come to me,’ and all the Children of Levi gathered unto him.” When Moses said (in vs. 27), “Each [of you] put his sword on his thigh…,” they immediately did so. Moreover they did not show partiality. And so Moses blesses them, [namely (according Deut. 33:9)], “The one who says of his father and mother, ‘I do not consider them’ and his brother….” When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that they all were righteous, that He had tested them and they had withstood their trial – as stated (of Levi in Deut. 33:8), “[Your faithful one,] whom You tested at Massah” – the Holy One, blessed be He, immediately said (in Numb. 8:14), “And the Levites shall belong to Me,” to fulfill what is stated (in Ps. 11:5), “The Lord tests the righteous.” In the case of the wicked, however, it is written of them (ibid. cont.), “but His soul (i.e. The soul of the Holy One, blessed be He,) hates the wicked and the lover of injustice.” David said (in Ps. 128:1), “Fortunate is everyone who fears the Lord and walks in His ways.”</p>

Thus do our masters teach us: If one is riding upon an ass when the time for prayer arrives, he should dismount. However, if he is unable to dismount because of his concern for the merchandise loaded upon the ass, or because he fears that there may be non-Jews or bandits roaming about in the vicinity, he should pray while mounted. R. Yohanan declared: This statement indicates that a man’s mind must be completely at ease while praying to God.

              <p>And Abraham was old, well stricken in age (Gen. 24:1). R. Joshua the son of Nahmani said: Men become old prematurely because of four things: fear, grief caused by children, a wicked wife, and wars. We learn about fear from David, as it is written: But David would not go before it to inquire of God; for he was terrified because of the sword of the angel of the Lord (I Chron. 21:30), and that is followed by the verse: And David was old (ibid., v. 31). The consequences of grief brought on by children we learn from Eli. It is written: Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel (I Sam. 2:21). The effect of wars is recorded in what happened to Joshua after he fought with the thirty-one kings: And Joshua was old, well stricken with years (Josh. 23:1). We read about what transpires because of a wicked wife, in the verse: It came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods (I Kings 11:4). However, Abraham’s wife honored him and called him my lord, as is said: And my lord is old (Gen. 18:12). Concerning her Scripture states: A Virtuous woman is a crown to her husband (Prov. 12:4). Hence, it is written of him: And the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things (Gen. 24:1).</p>

O Lord my God, Thou art very great; Thou art clothed with glory and majesty (Ps. 104:1). What prompted David to bless the Holy One, blessed be He, with his soul? He did so because the soul sees but is not seen, and the Holy One, blessed be He, sees but is not seen. Hence, the soul that sees but is not seen praised the Holy One, blessed be he, who sees but is not seen. Similarly, the soul guards the body and the Holy One, blessed be He, guards the entire universe. It is fitting, therefore, that the soul which guards the body should praise the Holy One, blessed be He, who guards His world. What is the meaning of the verse O Lord my God, Thou art very great? R.

This verse alludes to Abraham, who mourned for Sarah, for it was written previously: And Sarah died (Gen. 23:2). Abraham began to weep for her, saying: A woman of valor who can find? For her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her (Prov. 31:10). When did he demonstrate his trust in her? When he said to her: Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister (Gen. 12:13). She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life (Prov. 31:12). She seeketh between wool and flax (ibid., v. 13) alludes to her decision to separate Isaac and Ishmael when she said to her husband: Cast out this bondwoman and her son (Gen. 21:10). She is like the merchant ships (Prov. 31:14); For the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s house (Gen. 12:15), and later Abimelech sent her away. She riseth also while it is yet night (Prov. 31:15). When did that happen? At the time Abraham arose early in the morning (Gen. 22:3). She considereth a field and buyeth it (Prov. 31:16). She thought about the field of Machpelah and acquired it. Ultimately she was buried there, as it is said: And after this, Abraham buried Sarah, his wife (Gen. 23:19). She girdeth her loins with strength (for the birth of Isaac) (Prov. 31:17). When was that?

I will give you the crown that is on my head, and place it upon your head.” Similarly, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham: Silver and gold I have given thee, as it is said: And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold (Gen. 13:1); now what can I give you beside the crown that is on My head?

And the Lord blessed Abraham in all things (Gen. 24:1). What merit had he acquired? He set aside tithes from all his possessions, as it is said: And He gave him a tenth of all (Gen. 14:20).

              <p>(Deut. 7:12:) “And it shall come to pass if you heed [these statutes].” What is written above the matter (in Deut. 7:7)? “It is not because you are the most numerous of all the peoples [that the Lord desired you and chose you. Rather you are the least of all the peoples].” It is not because you are the most numerous of all the nations,” and it was not because you fulfilled more commandments than they; for the nations do more commandments that they were not commanded than you, and they magnify My name more than you. Thus it is stated (in Mal. 1:11-12), “For from the rising of the sun until its setting My name is great among the nations, [and in every place incense is offered to My name, even a pure oblation; for My name is great among the nations]…. But you desecrate it when you say the table of the Lord is defiled, and its special food is treated with scorn [like ordinary] food.” (Deut. 7:7:) “Rather you were the least of all the peoples.” Rather, because you diminish yourselves for Me, therefore I love you.’ And so it says (in Mal. 1:2-3), “’I have loved you,’ says the Lord …. ‘But I have hated Esau….’” It also says (in Hos. 14:5), “I will heal their veering and love them voluntarily….” My soul has volunteered to love them, even though they were not worthy; and so it says (in Deut. 7:8), “Because the Lord loves you […].” It is written (in Is. 2:2), “And it shall come to pass that in the latter days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains….” This text is related (to Job 8:7), “Though your beginning was trifling (rt.: ts'r), [your end shall greatly flourish].” [This verse is here] to teach you that everyone who is troubled (rt.: ts'r) from his beginning will have it well at his end. You have no one who was more troubled (rt.: ts'r) than Abraham, who was cast into a fiery furnace and went into exile from his ancestral home. Moreover, sixteen kings pursued him. He also stood the test of ten trials and buried Sarah. Yet in the end he had rest, as stated (Gen. 24:1), “Now Abraham was old, advanced in years, and the Lord blessed [Abraham in all things].” So too was Isaac troubled (rt.: ts'r) in his youth, for the Philistines were jealous of him, [as stated] (in Gen. 26:16), “And Abimelech said unto Isaac, ‘Go away from us, [for you have become have become too powerful for us].’” But in the end they begged him [for mercy], as stated (in vs. 27-28), “And Isaac said unto them, ‘Why have you come unto me…?’ And they said, ‘We have clearly seen….’” Jacob also was troubled (rt.: ts'r) in his youth, as stated (in Ps. 129:1), “’They have harassed me greatly from my youth,’ let Israel now say.” While he was in his mother’s belly, Esau sought to kill him, as stated (in Gen. 25:22), “But the children struggled [within her].” [Moreover,] when he received the blessings (according to Gen. 27:41), “Then Esau hated Jacob …, and Esau said in his heart, ‘Let the days of mourning for my father come, [and I will kill my brother Jacob]’.” So he fled to Laban and was troubled (rt.: ts'r) over his daughters, and after that Laban sought to kill him, as stated (in Deut. 26:5), “An Aramean would have destroyed my ancestor.” (This is required sense by the midrash. A more usual translation would read: A WANDERING ARAMEAN WAS MY ANCESTOR.)  He went away from him and encountered Esau, as stated (in Gen. 33:1), “Now Jacob raised his eyes and saw Esau coming….” There came upon him the trouble over Dinah, the trouble over Rachel and the trouble over Joseph. But in the end he had rest, [as stated] (in Gen. 47:12), “And Joseph sustained his father [and his brothers]….” Ergo (in Job 8:7), “Though your beginning was trifling (rt.: ts'r), your end shall greatly flourish.” Another interpretation (of Is. 2:2), “the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains… and Mount Tabor shall become very tall.” A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To the palace (Palterin. Gk.: praitorion; Lat. praetorium.)  children of a king. They went down from the city and killed lions, tigers, and bears in the forest. Then they brought them and hung them opposite the city gate, so that all the people in the city were amazed from those lions. The Holy One, blessed be he, did so with Sisera. [When] Sisera came against Israel on Mount Tabor; (according to Jud. 5:20), “The stars fought from the heavens; from their courses they fought with Sisera.” (Cf. Pes. 118b, according to which the stars descended and heated the iron implements in Sisera’s army.)  All began to be amazed, for there had never been an event like this, when the stars came down from the heavens to make war with flesh and blood. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In this world the stars have fought on your behalf, but in the world to come (according to Zech. 14:3-4), ‘Then the Lord will come forth and fight with those nations [as when He fights in the day of battle]. And His feet shall stand in that day [upon the Mount of Olives]….’ And [so on through] all that section (of Zechariah).” Then everyone will see and point Him out with the finger, as stated (in Is. 25:9), “In that day they shall say, ‘See, this is our God; [we waited for Him, and He delivered us. This is the Lord; we waited for Him. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation].’”</p>

(Cant. R. 3:7:2, 4.)  When it said, “There is his bed,” it is simply that [the verse] was only concerned with the King to whom peace (rt.: shlm) belongs (God). (Ibid.:) “There is his bed.” This is the Temple. (Numb. R. 11:3.)  But why was the Temple compared to a bed? It is simply that just as a bed is only for being fruitful and multiplying, so it was with the Temple. Whatever was in it was being fruitful and multiplying, as stated (in I Kings 8:8 = II Chron. 5:9), “The poles grew long.” (This literal interpretation of the Hebrew text was seen to imply that the poles miraculously lengthened while within the Temple. See Tanh., Exod. 7:11.)  It also says (in II Chron. 3:6), “the gold was gold from Parvaim (as if from prh),” which produced fruit (rt.: prh). And so it says (in I Kings 7:2), “And he built the house of the Forest of Lebanon.” Why was it compared to a forest? Just as a forest is fruitful and multiplies, so it is in the case of the Temple. Whatever was in it was being fruitful and multiplying. It is therefore stated (in Cant. 3:7), “There is his bed.” (Ibid., cont.:) “With sixty warriors.” These are the sixty letters that are in the priestly blessing (in Numb. 6:24-26). (Cant. 3:8:) “All of them equipped with a sword,” because in each and every [verse of the priestly blessing] the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is mentioned, “The Lord (This translation follows the common practice of substituting THE LORD for the Divine Name.)  bless you […]; The Lord make [His face] shine […]; The Lord lift up [His face …].” (Cant. 3:8, cont.:) “Each with his sword on his thigh.” What is the reason for the thigh to be mentioned here? Simply that, even if one sees in his dream a sword being drawn, placed over his neck, and [then] cutting off his thigh, he rises early in the morning and goes to the synagogue, (There may be an allusion here to circumcision. See Numb. R. 11:3; Cant. R. 3:7:4.)  from the fear [of what] he saw at night in his dream; then [when] he sees the priests raising their hands, the bad dream is cancelled from him. It is therefore stated (Cant. 3:8, cont.), “because of fear at night.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, told Moses to caution Aaron and his children to bless My children, as stated (in Numb. 6:23), “Thus shall you bless [the Children of Israel].” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In the past I needed to bless My creatures. (Above, Gen. 3:5; Tanh., Gen. 3:4; Numb. 2:9, cont.; Numb. R. 11:2; PRK 31 (suppl. 1):11.)  I blessed the first Adam and his wife, as stated (in Gen. 1:28), ‘Then God blessed them.’ I blessed Noah and his children, as stated (in Gen. 9:1), ‘Then God blessed Noah and his children.’ I blessed Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 24:1), ‘and the Lord had blessed Abraham in everything.’” [Then] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham, “From now on behold, the blessings are being delivered to you.” Thus it is stated (in Gen. 12:2), “and you are to be a blessing.” Abraham begot two [children], Ishmael and Isaac, but he did not bless them. A parable: (Gen. R. 61:6.)  To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard (Pardes. Cf. the Gk.: paradeisos.)  [and] gave it to a tenant. Now in the midst of that orchard was one tree with an elixir of life…. Then Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve tribes, as stated (in Gen. 49:28), “All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve in number, and this is what [their father] spoke to them [when he blessed them…].” From now on, said the Holy One, blessed be He, behold, the blessings are being delivered to you; and the priests will bless Israel.</p>

              <p>Abraham introduced old age, trials, hospitality, and legacies. He introduced old age, for whenever he and his son entered a city, the inhabitants were unable to determine which of them was the elder of the two (and therefore the one) to be honored. Abraham was disturbed by this, and so he said: Master of the Universe, how shall one distinguish between father and son? The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: Be assured, I will begin with you (to distinguish between father and son), as it is said: Abraham was old (Gen. 24:1).</p>

              <p>God’s way is not man’s way. As long as a man’s friend lives, his friendship for him continues, but after his friend’s death, his concern for him ceases. The Holy One, blessed be He, however, does not act in that manner. When Abraham died, the Holy One, blessed be He, continued to love his son Isaac, as it is said: And it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac, his son (ibid. 25:11). It may happen that a king bestows gifts of silver, gold, and raiment upon his friend, and the friend then sails away. These possessions may be lost when a storm arises, and the king is powerless to protect him from the sea or from pirates. However, when the Holy One, blessed be He, presents a gift to his beloved one He guards it, as it is said: The Lord bless thee and guard thee (Num. 6:24). He blessed Abraham and guarded him, as it is said: And the Lord blessed Abraham in all things (Gen. 24:1). He acted similarly toward Isaac and Jacob.</p>

This verse refers to our patriarchs Isaac and Abraham. Abraham was blessed, as it is said: And the Lord blessed Abraham with everything (Gen. 24:1), and Isaac was likewise blessed, as is written: And the Lord blessed him (ibid. 26:12). Abraham begot both a righteous and a wicked son, Isaac and Ishmael; and Isaac begot both a righteous and a wicked son, Jacob and Esau. Abraham’s wife was barren (at first), and Isaac’s wife was also barren (at first).</p>

              <p>A lady asked of R. Yosé the son of Halafta: “In how many days did the Holy One, blessed be He, create the world?” “In six days,” he replied, “as it is written: For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth (Exod. 20:1).” “What has He been doing since then?” she asked. “He has been erecting ladders,” he answered, “upon which one ascends and another descends; one becomes wealthy and the other poor.” You know this to be so from the fact that it is written with reference to Jacob’s going to Aram-naharaim: With my staff I passed over this Jordan (Gen. 32:11). And he took one of the stones of that place and put under his head (ibid. 28:11). Surely, if he had owned a mattress or a cushion he would have placed them under his head, yet after he joined Laban’s household he became wealthy, as is said: And the man increased exceedingly (ibid. 30:43). Why did he become wealthy? Because of the power of the blessings his father had bestowed upon him, as it is said: And give thee the blessing of Abraham (ibid. 28:4). What was Abraham’s blessing? And the Lord blessed Abraham in all things (ibid. 24:1). After his return from Laban’s house, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: Now I must bless him Myself. Immediately, the Holy One, blessed be He, appeared before him and blessed him, as it is said: And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Padan-aram, and blessed him (ibid. 35:9).</p>

              <p>Another interpretation of &quot;Happy is the man&quot; (Psalm 1:1): This refers to the righteous men. The prophets are happy because they give form to the image of God, and to the one who plants the tree. This is what the scripture means by &quot;For the Lord God is a sun and shield&quot; (Psalm 84:12). Rabbi Chiya bar Abba said: &quot;Happy are they who are like the sun, which shines forth, and like a shield, which protects.&quot; Another interpretation of &quot;shield&quot;: This refers to the Persian Targum for a curtain that surrounds a person, protecting them from the four winds. And how do we know that it includes the fourth wind? It is written, &quot;You crown us with loving-kindness&quot; (Psalm 5:13). Another interpretation of &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;shield&quot;: This refers to Abraham, our forefather. &quot;Sun&quot; refers to Abraham, as it is written, &quot;Who raised up righteousness from the east&quot;  (Isaiah 41:2) The shield represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;I am your shield&quot; (Genesis 15:1). The God represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;You are a prince of God in our midst&quot; (Genesis 23:6). Grace and glory God gives represent Abraham, as it is written, &quot;And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold&quot; (Genesis 13:2). &quot;He does not withhold good from those who walk with integrity&quot; represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;Walk before me, and be blameless&quot; (Genesis 17:1). If Scripture speaks of Abraham in this way, then when it says, &quot;He does not withhold good from those who walk with integrity,&quot; what does it mean to walk with integrity? Rather, just as Abraham, who walked with integrity before the Holy One, Blessed be He, had a shield, so too anyone who walks with integrity before Him has a shield. After him, what is written? &quot;Happy is the man who trusts in You&quot; (Psalms 84:13). Abraham is not written here, but rather &quot;man,&quot; meaning all people. David said, &quot;Happy is the man whom You discipline, Lord, and whom You teach from Your law&quot; (Psalms 94:12). Rabbi Yudan opened by saying, &quot;Do not boast before the king, and do not stand in the place of great men&quot; (Proverbs 25:6). Rabbi Yudan read it from the place where this section was closed and from the place where the previous section was opened. Rabbi Pinchas worked an extended passage from Psalms 119:100, &quot;I understand more than the aged.&quot; At first, the Holy One, Blessed be He, blessed His world, as it says, &quot;And God blessed them&quot; (Genesis 1:28). Once Noah stood, He blessed him, as it says, &quot;And God blessed Noah and his sons&quot; (Genesis 9:1). Once Abraham stood, He blessed him, as it says, &quot;And God blessed Abraham in everything&quot; (Genesis 24:1). What is the meaning of &quot;it will be a blessing&quot;? Rav Nachman said that He handed the blessings over to him and said, &quot;Until now, I have been required to bless the world, but from now on, the blessings are in your hands, and whomever you bless will be blessed.&quot; Once Isaac stood, he blessed him, as it says, &quot;And Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac&quot; (Genesis 25:5). What did he give him? Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Nechemia, and the Rabbis (said): Rabbi Yehuda said it was the firstborn. Rabbi Nechemia said it was a blessing. And the Rabbis said it was burial and a deed of inheritance. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Chama: they only gave him gifts. And why didn't they give him a blessing? It is like a king who had a garden and gave it to a tenant, and in it were all kinds of trees intertwined with each other, one of the Tree of Life and one of the Tree of Death. The tenant said, &quot;If I water the Tree of Life, the Tree of Death will live with it. And if I do not water it, how will the Tree of Life live?&quot; The tenant returned and said, &quot;This year I will complete my tenancy and go, and what do I care about the king's garden?&quot; Abraham said, &quot;I will not bless Isaac now because the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah are now being blessed.&quot; I am flesh and blood today, but tomorrow I will be in the grave, and what needs to be done in his world will be done. When Abraham died, God revealed Himself to Isaac and blessed him, as it says, &quot;After Abraham's death, God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). And so He did to Jacob, as it says, &quot;God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan Aram, and He blessed him&quot; (Genesis 35:9). And Isaac stood and blessed Jacob with giving, as it says, &quot;May God give you of the dew of heaven&quot; (Genesis 27:28), and he sealed it with a call, &quot;And Isaac called Jacob, and he blessed him&quot; (Genesis 28:1). Jacob stood to bless the tribes and began with what Isaac had sealed. This is what is written, &quot;And Jacob called to his sons and said&quot; (Genesis 49:1), and he sealed it with this, as it says, &quot;And this is what their father said to them&quot; (Genesis 49:28). Moses stood to bless Israel, and said, &quot;Jacob is the firstborn of the Holy One, blessed be He,&quot; and he began with a call and sealed it with &quot;And this is the blessing&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:1), and he sealed it with &quot;Happy are you&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:29). When David stood, he opened with &quot;God is my Lord,&quot; and sealed it with &quot;Blessed are You, God&quot; (Psalms 118:27).</p>

              <p>...  “He does the will of those who fear Him…” (Tehillim 145:19) Meaning that Gd does not annul his prayers and gives him what he requests. This refers to David, of whom it is written “I am a companion to all who fear You…” (Tehillim 119:63) at the time when he was troubled over the Holy Temple, as it is written “Remember, O Lord, onto David all his affliction. That he swore to the Lord, he vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob; That I shall not come into the tent of my house, and I shall not go up on the bed that was spread for me. I shall not give sleep to my eyes nor slumber to my pupils, Until I find a place for the Lord, dwellings for the Mighty One of Jacob.” (Tehillim 132:1-5) Since the Holy One saw that he stood there, troubled over the Holy Temple, He immediately sent Gad the prophet to him and showed him the place of the Holy Temple, as it is written “And Gad came to David on that day, and said to him, ‘Go up to erect an altar to the Lord in the threshing-floor of Aravnah the Jebusite.’” (Shmuel II 24:18) David went there immediately, as it says “And David went up according to the word of Gad, as the Lord had commanded. (Shmuel II 24:19) He found there the altar where Adam, the first man, made offerings, where Noach made offerings, where Avraham made offerings. Once he found it he began to measure, saying ‘from here to here will be the Courtyard, from here to here will be the Holy of Holies’ as it says “And David said, ‘This is the House of the Lord God…” (Divre HaYamim I 22:1) And how could he declare “…and this is the altar for burnt offerings for Israel” (ibid.)? This is what is meant that the Holy One does not nullify the desire of the righteous, but rather gives them what they seek in order to fulfill “He does the will of those who fear Him…” (Tehillim 145:19)</p>

              </summary>
              <p>“These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his household” (Exodus 1:1).  That is what is written: “He who spares his rod hates his son, and he who loves him seeks for him admonition” (Proverbs 13:24). The way of the world is that a person whom another tells him: ‘So-and-so struck your son,’ he would harass him. What is the meaning when the verse states: “He who spares his rod hates his son”? It is to teach you that anyone who withholds rebuke from his son, his son will ultimately set out on a path of depravity and he will hate him.  As we find regarding Ishmael, who was beloved (Literally, he had longings for his father, which could explain his father’s love for him.)  by his father Abraham, who did not chasten him, and he set out on a path of depravity. He then hated him and expelled him from his home emptyhanded. What did Ishmael do? When he was fifteen years old, he began to bring an idol from the marketplace, and he played with it and worshipped it in the manner that he saw others doing. (Although he made it look like he was just playing with it and even mocking it, in fact his intention was to worship it.)  Immediately, “Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she bore to Abraham, playing [metzaḥek]” (Genesis 21:9), and metzaḥek means nothing other than idol worship, like you say: “They rose to carouse [letzaḥek]” (Exodus 32:6).  (This verse is written in the context of the sin of the Golden Calf.)   Immediately, “She said to Abraham: Expel this maidservant and her son” (Genesis 21:10), so that my son will not learn his ways. Immediately, “the matter was very troubling in the eyes of Abraham regarding his son” (Genesis 21:11), because he emerged to a path of depravity. “God said to Abraham: Let it not be troubling in your eyes about the lad…everything that Sarah says to you, heed her voice” (Genesis 21:12). From here you learn that Abraham was subordinate to Sarah in prophecy. Immediately, “Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water…” (Genesis 21:14), teaching you that he hated Ishmael because he set out on a path of depravity, and sent him and his mother Hagar emptyhanded, and for that reason expelled him from his home.  Is it conceivable that Abraham, in whose regard it is written: “Abram was very wealthy in livestock, in silver, and in gold” (Genesis 13:2), would send his wife and his son from his house emptyhanded, without garments and without sustenance? Rather, it is to teach you that once he [Ishmael] set out on the path of depravity, he [Abraham] paid no attention to him. (Consequently the verse states that he gave them bread and water, implying that he did not give them other means of support. )  What ultimately became of him? When he banished him, he sat at the crossroads and would rob people, as it is stated: “He will be a wild man” (Genesis 16:12).  Similarly, “Isaac loved Esau” (Genesis 25:28); therefore he set out on a path of depravity, because he did not chasten him, as we learned: The wicked Esau violated five transgressions on that day. He consorted with a betrothed young woman, killed a person, denied the revival of the dead, denied the principle [of belief in God], and scorned the birthright. In addition, he desired the death of his father and sought to kill his brother, as it is stated: “Let the days of mourning for my father approach and I will kill Jacob my brother” (Genesis 27:41), and he caused Jacob to flee from his fathers.  And he [Esau] too went to Ishmael to learn from him the path of depravity and to add to his wives, as it is stated; “Esau went to Ishmael, [and took Maḥalat the daughter of Ishmael…in addition to his wives, as his wife]” (Genesis 28:9).  Similarly, David did not chastise Avshalom and did not chasten him, [and Avshalom] set out on the path of depravity. He sought to kill his father, he lay with his [father’s] concubines, and forced him to walk barefoot, weeping; and thousands and tens of thousands from Israel fell. In addition, he caused him endless hardships, as it is written: “A psalm by David when he fled from Avshalom, etc.” (Psalms 3:1). What is written afterward? “Lord, how numerous are my tormentors, etc.” (Psalms 3:2). The path of depravity (A wayward child)  in a person’s household is worse than the war of Gog and Magog, as regarding Gog and Magog it is written: “Why do nations rage and peoples meditate in vain?” (Psalms 2:1), and there it is written: “Lord, how numerous are my tormentors.”  David acted similarly with Adoniya, as he did not chasten him with chastisement and he did not scold him; therefore, he set out on the path of depravity, as it is written: “His father never distressed him, [saying: Why did you do so? …and she bore him after Avshalom]” (I Kings 1:6). But wasn’t Avshalom the son of Maakha, and Adoniyahu the son of Ḥaggit? What is: “And she bore him after Avshalom”? Rather, because [Avshalom] set out on the path of depravity because his father did not chasten him, and in Adoniyahu’s regard, it is written: “His father never distressed him,” he, too, set out on the path to depravity. Therefore, it is written: “And she bore him after Avshalom.”   “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition” (Proverbs 13:24); this is the Holy One blessed be He. It is because he loves Israel, as it is written: “I have loved you, said the Lord” (Malachi 1:2) that he promotes them through suffering. You find three excellent gifts that the Holy One blessed be He gave to Israel, and he gave them all to them by means of suffering: The Torah, the Land of Israel, and life in the World to Come. The Torah, as it is written: “Happy is the man whom You afflict, Lord, whom You teach from Your Torah” (Psalms 94:12). The Land of Israel, as it is written: “For you know in your heart [that as a man rebukes his son, so the Lord your God rebukes you]” (Deuteronomy 8:5); what is written after it: “For the Lord your God will bring you [to a good land]” (Deuteronomy 8:7). The World to Come, as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the Torah is light, [and the reproofs of instruction are the way of life]” (This indicates that the way to merit everlasting life is through reproof, which involves suffering. )  (Proverbs 6:23).  Anyone who chastises his son, the son adds love for his father and he honors him, as it is stated: “Admonish your son, and he will give you rest [and provide delights to your soul]” (Proverbs 29:17), and it is stated: “Admonish your son, as there is hope” (Proverbs 19:18). And he adds love for him, as it is stated: “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition” – because he sought for him admonition, therefore he loves him.  You find that Abraham chastised his son Isaac, taught him Torah, and guided him in his path, as it is written in Abraham’s regard: “Because Abraham heeded My voice, [and kept My commission, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws]” (Genesis 26:5), and it is written: “And this is the legacy of Isaac, Abraham’s son: [Abraham begot Isaac]” (Genesis 25:19), to teach you that he was similar to his father in every sense; in beauty, wisdom, wealth, and good deeds.  Know [that Isaac internalized Abraham’s lessons and accepted his authority], for he was thirty-seven years old when his father bound him, and it is written: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years” (Genesis 24:1), and he bound him and tied him, and [Isaac] did not prevent [him from doing so]. Therefore, “Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac” (Genesis 25:5); that is: “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition.”  Similarly, Isaac would seek admonition for Jacob, as he taught him Torah and chastised him in his study hall, as it is stated: “Jacob was a simple man, [a dweller in tents]” (Genesis 25:27). He learned what his father taught him and then he took his leave from his father and secluded himself in the house of Ever to study Torah. Therefore, he merited blessing and inherited the land, as it is stated: “Jacob settled in the land of his father's residence, in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 37:1).  Jacob our patriarch, too, chastised his sons, chastened them, and taught them his ways, until ultimately, there were none among them who was defective, as it is written: “These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt [with Jacob]” (Exodus 1:1); the verse likened them all to Jacob, as they were all righteous like he was. That is: “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition.”</p>

Men with professional dealings with women should not be secluded with them, nor should a father teach his son a trade that involves frequent interaction with women. Rabbi Meir advises teaching a clean and easy trade and praying for success. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar emphasizes that humans should work without anguish, as animals do. Abba Guryan warns against teaching trades associated with dishonesty, while Rabbi Nehorai advocates teaching only Torah as it provides rewards in this world and the next, preserves from evil, and can be studied in all circumstances.

              </summary>
              <p>Rabbi Yehuda says: A bachelor may not herd cattle, nor may two bachelors sleep with one covering, lest they transgress the prohibition against homosexual intercourse, but the Rabbis permit it. Anyone who has professional dealings primarily with women may not be secluded with women. There is more of a concern that such a man might sin due to his familiarity with the women. And a person may not teach his son a trade that necessitates frequent interaction with women, for the same reason. With regard to teaching one’s son a trade, Rabbi Meir says: A person should always teach his son a clean and easy trade and pray for success to the One to Whom wealth and property belong, as ultimately there is no trade that does not include both poverty and wealth, since a person can become rich from any profession. Poverty does not come from a particular trade, nor does wealth come from a particular trade, but rather, all is in accordance with a person’s merit. Therefore, one should choose a clean and easy trade, and pray to God for success. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Have you ever seen a beast or a bird that has a trade? And yet they earn their livelihood without anguish. But all these were created only to serve me, and I, a human being, was created to serve the One Who formed me. Is it not right that I should earn my livelihood without anguish? But I, i.e., humanity, have committed evil actions and have lost my livelihood. This is why people must work to earn a living. Abba Guryan of Tzadyan says in the name of Abba Gurya: A person may not teach his son the trades of a donkey driver, a camel driver, a pot maker, a sailor, a shepherd, or a storekeeper. The reason for all these is the same, as their trades are the trades of robbers; all of these professions involve a measure of dishonesty and are likely to lead to robbery. Rabbi Yehuda says in Abba Gurya’s name: Most donkey drivers are wicked, since they engage in deceit, and most camel drivers, who traverse dangerous places such as deserts, are of fit character, as they pray to God to protect them on their journeys. Most sailors are pious, since the great danger of the seas instills in them the fear of Heaven. The best of doctors is to Gehenna, and even the fittest of butchers is a partner of Amalek. Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades in the world, and I teach my son only Torah, as a person partakes of its reward in this world and the principal reward remains for him in the World-to-Come, which is not true of other professions, whose rewards are only in this world. Furthermore, if a person comes to be ill, or old, or undergoes suffering, and is unable to be involved in his trade, behold, he dies in hunger. But with regard to the Torah it is not so, since one can study it under all circumstances. Rather, it preserves him from all evil and sin in his youth, and provides him with a future and hope in his old age. The mishna explains: With regard to his youth, what does it say about a Torah scholar? “But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength” (Isaiah 40:31). With regard to his old age, what does it say? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age” (Psalms 92:15), and it likewise states with regard to Abraham our forefather: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things” (Genesis 24:1). We found that Abraham our forefather fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given, as it is stated: “Because that Abraham listened to My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws” (Genesis 26:5), which indicates that Abraham observed all the mitzvot of his own accord and was rewarded in his old age as a result.</p>

              <p>Our forefather Avraham, on the other hand, merited both old age as well as beneficial days. Thus the plain meaning of the Midrash is that Avraham enjoyed a desirable lot even in this world. In fact, the Sages tell us in Baba Basra (16b) that there were three people to whom the Holy One Blessed is He gave a taste of the World to Come while they were yet in this world. They were: Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov. As it is written, “With everything” (Bereishis 24:1), “From everything” (ibid. 27:33), “Everything” (ibid. 33:11). However, I have heard a deeper explanation of the Midrash in the name of my illustrious mentor, Rabbi Yudel, ztz”l, president of the court and dean of the yeshiva of the holy community of Kauli. It is based upon a passage in the Zohar (Parashas Vayechi 221b) commenting on the verse, “And the days approached for Yisrael to die” (Bereishis 47:29). The Zohar asks: “On how many days does a person die (i.e. why is “days” in the plural)? Does the soul not exit in a single moment?” Explains the Zohar: When a person passes from this world all his days come for a reckoning before the Holy One Blessed is He. Not one is omitted. If a person behaved righteously and feared Hashem continually, if he clung to Him lovingly every day and was whole in his commitment to Torah, fear of Heaven, mitzvos and good deeds, then all his days will be crowned and garbed with splendor and majesty.</p>

The years of the wicked, on the other hand, become shortened; this means that even if they live chronologically speaking for many years, the sum total of their life is short, seeing it was not filled with worthwhile activities.

              <p>And it mentioned three levels: “Has goodness bestowed upon him, his life is lengthened, and he inherits the land.” And these three things, which are levels of the world to come, are known to the sages and to the understanding. As that which it said, “has goodness bestowed upon him,” is the full goodness; “his life is lengthened,” is life that is completely eternal; “and he inherits the land,” is meaning to say that he will have in the world to come, that which includes everything. And hence it said, “and he inherits the land” - as it is written (Deuteronomy 8:9), “A land [...] in which you will lack nothing.” Such that he will have the complete good, which is mentioned in that which it said, “has goodness bestowed upon him”; and he will have eternal life which is hinted to in that which it said, “his life is lengthened”; and [he will have] the good that encompasses everything that is hinted to in that which it said, “and he inherits the land” - about which it is stated, “A land [...] in which you will lack nothing.” And it is as it is written with Avraham (Genesis 24:1), “and the Lord blessed Avraham with everything”; and with Yitzchak (Genesis 27:33), “and I ate of everything”; and with Yaakov (Genesis 33:11), “I have everything.” And in the first chapter of Bava Kamma (16b), they said about this, “Three were given a taste of the world to come,” as it is found there. Such that from this you learn that the world to come is everything, and there is nothing to add upon these three things - if there is complete good, if there is eternal life and if there is good that encompasses everything. And behold length of days is clinging to the supernal level, from which there is length of days. And the bestowing of good is the clinging to the level of good, as is known. “And he inherits the land,” is the holy Land of Israel that encompasses everything. And just like they hint to the world to come, so too do they hint to the levels of this world. So from this, the whole discussion [in the Gemara] is like its plain sense. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>Rabbi Nehorai says: I will abandon every profession in the world and I will not teach my son anything but Torah, for a person enjoys its reward in this world while the principal remains for him in the world to come. But all other professions are not so; for when a man comes to sickness or old age or suffering and cannot engage in his profession, he must die of starvation, whereas the Torah is not so, for it guards him from all evil in his youth and gives him a future and hope in his old age. Of his youth what is said? “But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength” (Isaiah 40:31). Of his old age what is said? “They shall still bring forth fruit in old age” (Psalms 92:15).  And it is also said of our father Abraham, “And Abraham was old … And the Lord blessed Abraham with everything” (Genesis 24:1).  We find that Abraham our father observed the whole Torah before it was given, for it is said, “Because Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws” (Genesis 26:5).  Rabbi Nehorai’s statement is perhaps as extreme of a statement as can be found on the issue of work versus Torah study.  It is not a vision that many rabbis shared, at least not in a practical sense.  Nevertheless, there are some elements that in my opinion strike a deep chord.  The first is that in a society without a system to provide for its elderly and in which people cannot save up large sums of money, a life of work does not leave one with enough to live on later in life.  While there are some safeguards that exist today that didn’t exist in the ancient world, care of the elderly is still one of the most difficult and important issues facing society.  The second is that when a person is older, nearer to the end of life, they usually judge their lives not based on how much work they have done, but what good deeds they have done, how well they have treated their families and what kind of a spiritual/moral legacy they will leave behind.  I think that that is partly what Rabbi Nehorai is speaking about:  when a person is older, all the work they did will not matter as much as the quality of the lives they led, and for the rabbis, the quality of life was measured by the amount of Torah studied. The mishnah, the tractate and the entire seder end with a midrash on Abraham. Abraham’s strength stood for him until very late in life.  Indeed, he had Isaac when he was nearly 100 years old! The final midrash on Abraham states that he kept the whole Torah before it was given.  In this context, this means that Abraham’s blessing came to him because of his observance of the Torah and not merely because of his faith in God (as the Christians taught). Congratulations!  We have finished Kiddushin. It is a tradition at this point to thank God for helping us to finish learning this tractate and this entire Seder and to commit ourselves to going back and relearning them, so that we may not forget them and so that their lessons will stay with us for all of our lives. By now, if you have been learning with Mishnah Yomit from the beginning, you have finished two entire Seders of Mishnah.  This is a tremendous accomplishment and you should feel satisfied with your hard work and devotion.  Seder Nashim began with Yevamoth, a tricky tractate with many difficult laws concerning levirate marriage, worked its way through a tractate on marriage contracts (Ketuboth), two tractates on vows (Nedarim and Nazir), one on adulterous women (Sotah), neared completion with a tractate on divorce and finally, after all this learning, a tractate on how one enters marriage.  So you had to wait until the end for the best part, but I’m sure it was worth the effort. So congratulations on making it through another tractate and seder.  May you have the strength and time to keep on learning more Mishnah!  Tomorrow we begin the first tractate of Seder Z’manim (appointed times), tractate Shabbat.</p>

Yet when Sarah died, he did not own a single plot of land in which to bury her, and had to undergo an elaborate and even humiliating negotiation with the Hittites, forced to admit at the outset that “I am a stranger and temporary resident among you” (Gen. 23:4).

Again this sounds like the end of a life, not a preface to a new course of action, and again our expectation is confounded. Abraham launches into a new initiative, this time to find a suitable wife for his son Isaac, who by now is at least thirty-seven years old. Abraham leaves nothing to chance. He does not speak to Isaac himself but to his most trusted servant, whom he instructs to go “to my native land, to my birthplace” (24:2), and find the appropriate woman. He wants Isaac to have a wife who will share his faith and way of life. Abraham does not specify that she should come from his own family, but this seems to be an assumption hovering in the background.</p>

              <p>מפני שיבה תקום, &quot;You shall rise in the presence of an aged person, etc.&quot; Kidushin 32 explains that the word שיבה refers to someone advanced in years, whereas the word זקן refers to someone who has acquired wisdom. The word תקום means to rise as a sign of respect, והדרת פני. The wording in the Talmud is difficult as in order to correspond to what the Talmud says the Torah should have written: מפני שיבה ומפני זקן תקום והדרת. Perhaps the Talmud intended to distinguish between different signs of recognition to be accorded to physical maturity, old age, and to spiritual maturity, i.e. זקנה. In the former case it suffices to rise from one's seat momentarily, whereas in the latter case one is to remain standing for longer; the idea is that זקנה, spiritual maturity, rates a greater degree of recognition than שיבה, mere physical old age.</p>

              <p>You need to appreciate that the “so-called celestial court,” is referred to by G’d as אנכי האל בית א-ל, I am the G’d of Bet El” (31,13). Yonathan ben Uziel translates the words קדוש קדוש... קדוש Isaiah 6,3 as קדיש בשמי מרומא עלאה בית שכינתה, “the Holy One in the lofty heavens in the house of His residence.” Yonathan ben Uziel distinguishes there between the expression “house” and “residence.” Concerning such a “house” G’d had said of Moses (Numbers 12,7) “He is at home in My entire ‘house.’” This is the בת which has been emanated from the יסוד העולם as mentioned by Nachmanides in his commentary on Genesis 24,1 וה' ברך את אברהם בכל, “and the Lord had blessed Avraham with “something called בכל.” This is also what the Torah had in mind when it writes in Exodus 13,21 וה' הולך לפניהם יומם “and G’d was walking ahead of them by day,” and this is followed a short while later by ויסע מלאך האלו-הים “and the angel of the Lord traveled, etc.” (Exodus 14,19). According to Nachmanides the words מלאך האלוקים in that verse are not to be understood as a possessive clause, but the meaning is similar to 18,17 where G’d had spoken of “Himself” in the third person, i.e. the words המכסה אני מאברהם “shall I hide from Avraham, etc., followed by: “seeing that they will observe the path of the Lord, etc.” (instead of My path), as you would have expected if G’d personally had said the words “shall I hide from Avraham, etc.” did not really refer to Himself but to an agent, a מלאך, who because he spoke in the name of the Lord is described as if it were the Lord Himself speaking. The verse there goes on to speak about למען הביא ה', “in order that G’d may make come true all that He said to Avraham.” Had G’d’ personally been the speaker in that verse, the Torah would have written אביא, “in order that I may bring upon Avraham all that I said concerning him.” As pointed out previously, every time the prefix ו appears before the name of G’d it is an allusion to the angel who at that particular time acts on behalf of G’d. You are already aware that the angel who runs G’d’s universe on His behalf is called מטטרן so that it is easy to recognise an allusion to him in the very word המטיר.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>A kabbalistic approach to the words כל אשר נשמת רוח חיים באפיו understands the word כל, “all,” as an allusion to the emanation כל with which G-d had blessed Avraham (Genesis 24,1). This is the tenth emanation, the region where the souls “grow.” Our sages who instituted the prayer we recite on Sabbath morning commencing with the words נשמת כל חי had this emanation in mind. This is also the mystical dimension of Exodus 31,17 where the Torah says of G-d כי בו שבת וינפש, “for on it (the Sabbath) “He ‘rested’ and concentrated on the regions of the souls.” This emanation or “celestial region,” is the source of all blessings and the source of “life” as we understand it. This is why the Torah said of the original Sabbath ויברך אלוהים את יום השביעי, “the Lord blessed the seventh day.” This is why here the Torah refers to “life” as אשר נשמת רוח חיים באפיו. The difference between man and the other living creatures is that whereas the latter have a רוח חיים, they do not possess a נשמת רוח חיים. The cantillation pazer gadol on the word כל in our verse is designed to draw our attention to the fact that the word does not mean simply “all” as it does usually, but that it refers to the emanation כל which we have mentioned. The word כל does not appear with the cantillation pazer gadol anywhere else in the Bible. It is important to take note of this and to realise its implication.</p>

              <p>ויצונו ה’ לעשות את כל החקים האלה ליראה את ה’ אלו-הינו, “The Lord commanded us to carry out all these statutes in order to revere the Lord our G’d.” At this point Moses explains the principle of reward for keeping the commandments. Reverence for G’d, something previously (5,26) described as not within the power of heaven to grant, is nonetheless the product of Torah-observance, especially the meticulous observance of the statutes, the laws which have no intrinsic value for us as we do not understand them. [I have elaborated on the theme. Ed.]  לטוב לנו כל הימים לחיותינו כהיום הזה, “to be good for us for all times as well as to have kept us alive as of this day.” This means that mitzvah-observance is good both for the body and for the soul. “Good for us for all times,” is a reference to the soul, i.e. the life in the hereafter. The term ימים is indicative of life in the hereafter, something that is prolonged, whereas life on earth is perceived as חיי שעה, “life for hours.” The words: “and to keep us alive as of this day,” are a reference to our physical existence on earth, our bodies. When the Torah describes Avraham as בא בימים in Genesis 24,1, the principal message is that Avraham had earned his hereafter, his eternal life. When David asks: “who is desirous of securing life, loving ‘days’ to see true good?” He refers to eternal life (compare Psalms 34,13). Only in those “days” will man finally experience to see the true “good.” The reason that Moses did not write כיום הזה but added the letter ה writing כהיום הזה, is a reminder of the terrestrial universe which was created by means of the letter ה, the last letter of the tetragrammaton. The reason why Moses first referred to the reward in the hereafter is that the celestial regions preceded earth in creation as a habitat.  After this Moses added: וצדקה תהיה לנו לפני ה’ אלו-הינו, “it, i.e. the performance of these commandments, will be considered a merit for us before the Lord our G’d.” The “good” promised us by the Torah will always be “in front of the Lord,” i.e. in the world of the souls. This is why Onkelos translates these words as וזכו, ”they will merit.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>It is possible that the expression: “you will not eat bread in poverty in that land,” refers to something spiritual, i.e. that the word לחם, “bread,” does not refer to physical food. This would not be the first time that Torah has been compared to לחם. Compare Proverbs 9,5 where Solomon, quoting the Torah called “Wisdom,” says: “come eat my bread”. Seeing that it is impossible to acquire Torah and wisdom in the full sense of the word without proper preparation designed to facilitate its study, Moses may indicate here that the ideal such preparation is residence in the land of Israel, which possesses the physical conditions such as ideal climate to enable people to study Torah successfully. Scholars studying Torah in that land do not suffer from the handicaps which scholars in other countries suffer from. Those scholars belong to the category of people known as eating לחם העצבים, “the bread of troubles” (Psalms 127,2), in contrast to the people in Israel. The true wealth of the people in Israel is the quality of their Torah knowledge which was acquired with the help of the superior climate and therefore food produced in the Land of Israel. This is why Moses underlines this thought by adding לא תחסר כל בה, “nothing is lacking in that land.” The blessing is anchored in the word בכל; compare Genesis 24,1 “and the Lord had blessed Avraham בכל.” The reason Moses adds that the stones of the Land of Israel yield iron, is to tell us that in places where one expects to encounter only stone one will be surprised to find iron. A similar surprise awaits those who see nothing more than high piles of rock in the mountains of that land. These mountains are filled with copper. Seeing that copper and iron are used as raw materials for most of man’s utensils, a land which yields such raw material can aptly be described as “lacking nothing.” A people who have to import all these raw materials are at a serious disadvantage, aware of real shortcomings in their land. If the earth of a land does not yield silver or gold this is at best considered a minor shortcoming. Moses praised the availability of those ores which are needed daily in people’s lives. Moses includes this kind of blessing once more at the end of the last portion of Deuteronomy when he praises the soil of Asher’s section of Eretz Yisrael (33,25).   Our sages in Taanit 4 take a Midrashic approach to the words ארץ אשר אבניה ברזל by suggesting that instead of reading אבניה, “its stones,” we might read this as בוניה, “its builders,” i.e. the Torah scholars are possessed of a faith as strong as iron.</p>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 23:40:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>A Midrashic approach based on Vayikra Rabbah (30,10): the words פרי עץ הדר are a reference to Avraham. The words כפת תמרים are a reference to Yitzchak, whereas the words ענף עץ עבות are a reference to Yaakov. The words ערבי נחל are a reference to Joseph. We need to understand this Midrash along the following lines: The Torah mentioned the word פרי, i.e. fruit in the singular thereby hinting that it was Avraham who paved the way for recognition of G’d as the “One” and only Creator. He spread the idea, i.e. his words bore fruit. The Torah cites proof of this at the beginning of Parshat Lech Lecha (Genesis 12, 5) crediting both Avram and Sarai with having “made” נפש souls, i.e. converting people to monotheism already while they were in Charan and before they moved to the land of Canaan. Furthermore, as we already mentioned, Avraham is referred to in Ezekiel 33,24 as אחד היה אברהם, “unique was Avraham, singular.”  The word עץ, tree, in our verse of פרי עץ הדר refers to a unique feature about Avraham. Just as a tree stops giving fruit when there was no supply of water for its roots but is able to revive itself when provided with water, so Avraham, who had despaired of producing biological offspring and had “dried out,” was rejuvenated and sired a son at one hundred years of age. This is part of what the sages (Baba Metzia 86) had in mind that until the advent of Avraham the concept of old age was unknown. People had not been able to distinguish father and son from their exterior appearance as they looked as if both were of the same age. Avraham was granted the appearance of “old age,” so that henceforth one could distinguish (and honour) the aged on the basis of their appearance even if one did not know the individual in question personally. This is what the Torah (Genesis 24,1) had in mind when it wrote: ואברהם זקן בא בימים, “Avraham had become aged, advanced in years.” We have another verse in Proverbs 20,29 where Solomon elaborates on what the Torah wrote about Avraham. He says: והדר זקנים שיבה, “the majesty of old men is their gray hair.”   The words כפות תמרים refer to Yitzchak seeing he had been bound, כפות, (on the altar). The word תמרים is related to תימרות עשן, “columns of smoke,” mentioned in Song of Songs 3,6 i.e. an allusion to the smoke rising from the remains of the sacrificial animal. He has always been compared to an “unblemished burnt-offering” in our history.  The words ענף עץ עבות are a reference to Yaakov; just as the stem of the myrtle is surrounded by leaves, so Yaakov was surrounded by his sons, the twelve tribes.  The words ערבי נחל refer to Joseph. Just as a willow, after a period of being full of juices shrivels and dries out, so Joseph after a brilliant youth as second in command to Pharaoh the mightiest King of his time, experienced the loss of his legendary father, losing the source of his inspiration. He “dried out,” i.e. he died earlier than his brothers who were senior to him in years. The point that the Midrash wants to make is that when we perform the commandment of taking the four species of plants and waving them in all directions we should remind G’d of the merit of these patriarchs so that their merit will assist us in securing the beneficial rainfall required for the year which has just commenced. Even Moses used to preface his prayers by asking G’d to remember the merits of the patriarchs, such as in Exodus 32,13.</p>

              <p>AND YE WILL KEEP MY COVENANT. I.e., “the covenant which I have made with your fathers to be a G-d unto them and to their seed after them.” (Genesis 17:7.)  Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained it as referring to the covenant which Moses was to make with Israel after the Giving of the Torah, as he said, Behold, the blood of the covenant, which the Eternal hath made with you in agreement with all these words. (Further, 24:8.)  By way of the Truth, [that is, the mystic lore of the Cabala, the verse is to be understood as meaning] that “you should keep My covenant to cleave unto Me, for if thou shalt indeed hearken unto My voice and do all that I speak, (See Ibid., 23:22.)  then ye shalt be Mine own ‘s’gulah’ (treasure) from among all peoples.” (Here in Verse 5.)  This means that “you will be a treasure ‘in My hand,’” for a king does not hand over a precious object into the hand of another [for permanent possession]. The word s’gulah here is similar in meaning to the expression: ‘us’gulath’ (and treasure) such as kings and the provinces have as their own. (Ecclesiastes 2:8.) </p>

              <p>FOR ALL THE EARTH IS MINE. This is similar in meaning to the verses: Which the Eternal thy G-d hath allotted unto all the peoples… But you hath the Eternal taken. (Deuteronomy 4:19-20.)  And thus He said, “And I have set you apart from the peoples, that ye should be Mine (Leviticus 20:26.)  [own] treasure.” It may be that the word s’gulah connotes “attachment.” [The sense of the verse would then be: “and you shall be attached to Me from among all peoples], for unto Me is the earth called kol (all),” as I have explained on the verse, And the Eternal had blessed Abraham ‘bakol’ (in all things). (Genesis 24:1 (Vol. I, pp. 290-292).)  The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand. Similarly, And ye shall be unto me (Verse 6.)  means that “you will be Mine in a special sense, and not as the rest of the peoples.” And so did the Rabbis interpret it in the Mechilta: (Mechilta, ibid.)  “And ye shall be unto Me. As though it were possible to say it, [He is stating], ‘I shall neither appoint nor delegate [any power] to rule over you, but I Myself will rule over you.’ And thus it says, Behold He that keepeth Israel doth neither slumber nor sleep.” (Psalms 121:4.) </p>

              <p>Whereas the terms מכורותיך and מולדתיך occur in Ezekiel 16,3-4, describing close relatives in one’s birthplace, in our verse, the vowel tzeyreh under the letter כ converts this word into one that could have been written with a dagesh, i.e. from the conjugation piel, the strong, transitive conjugation, suggesting that these emotions were evident only when the two brothers engaged in a scheme of doubtful ethical merit. The construction of the word is parallel to Job 37,12 where the word מסבות, describes clouds in constant motion foreboding turmoil, nature at its most destructive. Examples of the expected vowel chirik becoming a tzeyreh instead, are found in Lamentations 2,9, as well as in Numbers 8,26, and in Psalms 74,18. In all those examples the addition of the extra “dot” next to the chirik converts the meaning into something stronger, more aggressive, more intense.</p>

              <p>In light of Midian’s centrality in the Ba’al Peor story, it pays to remember the unusual place this nation has in the formative experiences of the Jewish people. The odyssey begins with Moshe’s sojourn in Midian, when he is taken in by Yitro and offered the latter’s daughter in marriage. Marriage to a foreign noblewoman in a foreign land is not unique to Moshe; it parallels Yosef’s experience in Egypt. But neither is it common. In fact, given that the idea of keeping marriage “within the family” is stressed by both Avraham (Bereshit 24:1-9) and Yitzchak (Bereshit 28:1–9), marriage with a foreigner is usually far from the ideal.</p>

              <p>It is also possible to explain it in this way: when Abraham was circumcised, God said he was now “blameless” (tamim), (See Exodus 17:1 When God made the covenant with Abraham the Torah says: “When Abram was ninety-nine years old, יהוה appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am El Shaddai.*El Shaddai. Walk in My ways and be blameless (Tamim).)  to inform him that the sins of his father, Terah, would be rectified through Job. The first letters of the statement &quot;God appeared to him at Alonei Mamrei, ” (See Genesis 18:1 וַיֵּרָ֤א אֵלָיו֙ יְיְ בְּאֵלֹנֵ֖י מַמְרֵ֑א This is the statement immediately after Abraham has circumcised himself.)  spell “his father.&quot; (אביו)  They are also the letters that make up the Hebrew name of Job. (איוב)  They hint that Job was reincarnated from Terah to atone for idolatry with which he rebelled against God. Some time later I came across the book, Zera Barekh. (Possibly a work by Rabbi Menachem Manli, died in 1740)  The author writes: the soul of Terah came to be in Job. The gematria of the word Vayera is the same as B’ruach, “Containing the spirit” counting the word. (In HaKollel is a strategy for Gematria in which one counts the word in addition to the numerical value of the letters.)  He also writes that Vayera elav Adonai b’elonei mamre contains the letters oyev (enemy) and Iyov (Job), hinting that the soul of Terah, transmigrated into Job. The name of Job is also alluded to in the expression tiratz oyev, “Adonai shatters foes.” This accords with those who interpret, “Abraham came to mourn Sara and bewail her,” (Gen. 23:2) to mean that he had just come from Terah’s burial and that Terah lived until the binding of Isaac. As long as Terah was alive, Abraham faced suffering and trials to atone for his father. When Terah died he no longer faced the suffering because of his father. Terah's soul was transmigrated to Job to complete the rectification. This is alluded to by the word Vayavo, “And he came,” which is made up of the letters aveev, his father, and oyev, enemy. Implying that there was peace for Abraham after the death of his father since Job would now complete the atonement. That is why the final letters of the “Terah died in Haran,” (Genesis 11:32)  spells nahat, peace. Scripture states, “Abraham was old, advanced in years, and God blessed Abraham with everything,” (Gen. 24:1) because after Terah’s death Abraham did not experience sorrow as a result of his father. In the future Terah would be reincarnated as Job.The gematria of the first letters of the words “Old advanced in years God blessed,” (זקן בא בימים וה' ברך It equals 19.)  has the same gematria as Job. For the sake of his father, Job came, allowing Abraham to live in peace. Later I saw what Rabbi Shapira wrote in, Megaleh Amukot. (Nathan Nata Spira 1585 – 20 July 1633 was a Polish rabbi and kabbalist, who served as Chief Rabbi of Kraków. A student of Meir Lublin, Spira played an important role in spreading Isaac Luria's teachings throughout Poland. Spira was the author of a number of works, most notably the Megaleh Amukot.

If we say it is referring to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda with regard to the term “with everything [bakkol],” that is difficult. The Gemara cites Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. As it is taught in a baraita: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham with everything [bakkol]” (Genesis 24:1). Rabbi Meir says: The blessing was that he did not have a daughter. Rabbi Yehuda says: The blessing was that he had a daughter, and her name was Bakkol. Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda understands the birth of a daughter to be a blessing. The Gemara explains the difficulty: Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda explain that the blessing was that the Merciful One did not even deprive Abraham of a daughter, in addition to his sons. Did you hear him say that a daughter is preferable to a son?</p>

Rabbi Meir says: The blessing is that he did not have a daughter. Rabbi Yehuda says: On the contrary, the blessing was that he had a daughter. Others say: Abraham had a daughter and her name was Bakkol. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says: Abraham our forefather was so knowledgeable in astrology [itztagninut] that all the kings of the East and the West would come early to his door due to his wisdom. This is the blessing of bakkol, that he possessed knowledge that everybody needed. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: A precious stone hung around the neck of Abraham our forefather; any sick person who looked at it would immediately be healed. When Abraham our forefather died, the Holy One, Blessed be He, hung this stone from the sphere of the sun, which from that point on brought healing to the sick.

              <p>Apropos the death of Elisha, the Gemara says: Until the time of Abraham there was no aging, and the old and the young looked the same. Anyone who saw Abraham said: That is Isaac, and anyone who saw Isaac said: That is Abraham. Abraham prayed for mercy, that he would undergo aging, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age” (Genesis 24:1). There is no mention of aging before that verse. Until the time of Jacob there was no weakness, i.e., illness. Jacob prayed for mercy and there was weakness, as it is stated: “And one said to Joseph: Behold, your father is ill” (Genesis 48:1). Until the time of Elisha, there was no ill person who recovered, and Elisha came and prayed for mercy and recovered, as it is stated: “And Elisha was fallen ill of his illness from which he was to die” (II Kings 13:14). That is the first mention of a person who was ill and who did not die from that illness.</p>

With regard to Abraham, the verse states: “And the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things [bakkol]” (Genesis 24:1). With regard to Isaac, the verse states: “And I have eaten of all [mikkol]” (Genesis 27:33). With regard to Jacob, the verse states: “And because I have all [khol]” (Genesis 33:11).

              <p>R. Nehorai said: I abandon all professions in the world and teach my son only Torah, (Inserted by GRA in agreement with Ḳid. 82a (Sonc. ed., p. 423).)  because a man enjoys part of its reward in this world while the principal remains intact for the world to come. The other professions, however, are not so. For should a person come to sickness, old age or suffering and is unable to carry on his work, he would die of starvation; whereas with the Torah it is not so, but it protects him from all evil in his youth and gives him a future and hope in his old age. What does it say in Scripture of his youth? But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength. (Isa 40, 31.)  And what does it say of his old age? They shall still bring forth fruit in old age. (Ps. 92, 15. In Ḳid. loc. cit. the Mishnah adds: ‘And thus it is said of our father Abraham, And Abraham was old … and the Lord blessed Abraham in all things (Gen. 24, 1)’.) </p>

              <p>When they were in Egypt there was a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Go and gather the Elders of Israel” (Exodus 3:16), indicating that there were Sages among them who studied Torah. And similarly, when they were in the desert, there was a yeshiva with them, as it is stated: “Gather for me seventy men from the Elders of Israel” (Numbers 11:16). Abraham our Patriarch was himself an Elder and would sit in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years” (Genesis 24:1). From the apparent redundancy of the terms old and advanced in years, it is derived that old means that he was a wise Elder and prominent in Torah, and advanced in years means that he was elderly. Similarly, Isaac our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And it came to pass when Isaac was old and his eyes were dim” (Genesis 27:1). Similarly, Jacob our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Israel’s eyes were heavy with age” (Genesis 48:10).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>(Translated from the Ehrfurt manuscript:) Rabbi Nehorai says: I abandoned every trade in the world and taught my children only Torah, for they eat the reward of its labour in this world but the principal remains for them in the world to come, because every trade in the world only stands for a man in his youth when his strength is upon him, but if he becomes sick, old or has troubles, he will not be able to do work and in the end will die in famine. But Torah keeps him from all evil in his youth and gives him a future and hope in his old age. In his youth, what does it say? &quot;Those who hope in God, He will exchange for him strength, make his limbs rise like eagles&quot; (Yeshayahu 40:31). In his old age, what does it say? &quot;In old age they produce fruit&quot; (Tehilim 92:15). And so too you find regarding Avraham our father, who God blessed in his old age more than in his youth, as it is said, &quot;The time came when Avraham was old, and God blessed Avraham with everything (ba-kol)&quot; (Bereishit 24:1). Rabbi Meir says: [The blessing was] that he didn't have a daughter. Rabbi Yehudah says: That he had a daughter. Rabbi Elazar ha-Moda'i says: This is the large sangenon (a kind of magical precious stone) that was in the hand of Avraham our father. Rabbi Shimon ben Yohai says: This is the beautiful jewel that hung around the neck of Avraham our father, that any sick person who saw it would immediately be healed. When Avraham our father died, God took it and hung it in the daytime. A second thing [that was his reward]: that Esav didn't rebel during his [grandfather's] lifetime. A third thing: that Yishmael did teshuvah during his [father's] lifetime. Others say: Avraham had a daughter and her name was Bakol. God blessed him in his old age more than in his youth because he did the Torah before it came, as it is said, &quot;Because Avraham heard My voice and kept My charge, My commands, My laws, My instructions (torot)&quot; (Bereishit 26:5)—it doesn't say &quot;My Torah&quot; (in singular) but &quot;My instructions&quot; (in plural), this teaches that the words of Torah and the words of scribes were revealed to him.</p>

        <summary>Eliezer, as the faithful servant of Abraham, represents the lower Covenant in Chasidut, with a focus on Torah sh’b’AL Peh, guiding others modestly. In Kabbalah, keeping God's statutes involves caution against temptation, symbolized by a harlot. The Midrash texts explore various aspects of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob's lives, with Eliezer playing a key role in finding a wife for Isaac. In Musar, Eliezer resembles Abraham in appearance and control over his evil urge. The Talmud discusses Eliezer's mastery of his master's Torah and the symbolism of taking oaths. Israel asks Joseph in Tanakh not to bury him in Egypt, and a curse of adjuration is administered to a woman in Numbers 5:21. Abraham instructs his senior servant in Targum to place his hand under his thigh as a sign of loyalty and commitment. After Abraham's death, Isaac restored prosperity in Tosefta by sowing, reaping, and reopening wells filled by the Philistines.</summary>

Meaning, the complete tzadik we spoke of says to the second tzadik, who is not yet at that level [of being complete], and is just like a servant at that level, that they still need to walk modestly, as explained, fixing their internalness, and this is &quot;eldest in his house&quot;. &quot;The one ruling over everything that he had&quot; - meaning even though they [the second tzadik] are at the level of ruling over this trait of not feeling jealousy towards their fellow, that they do not covet nor desire nor envy other people in their possessions, which is the essence of walking in the ways of Hashem, to take out from one's heart jealousy and coveting of money (which is the essence of what impedes service to God), and this is &quot;the one ruling over everything he has&quot;, that they are content with what they have, and does not covet what others had. And the complete tzadik wants to bring them also to the great level, and so he says &quot;put your hand under my thigh&quot; meaning, connect with him.

            <summary>Abraham asked his servant to place his hand under his thigh as a symbolic gesture of subservience and commitment to carry out his bidding. This custom was a way of making an oath and was still followed in India during Ibn Ezra's time. The servant was chosen for his capability to complete the mission through persuasion, intelligence, and firm responses, as well as his humble nature before his master. Eliezer was entrusted with the task due to his senior status and his commitment to fulfill his master's wishes.</summary>

              <p>תחת ירכי, according to the plain meaning of the word it has nothing to do with the place where Avraham had circumcised himself, although it was the most sacred symbol of his body. If it had, why did Avraham not make him swear an oath by using it as the focus instead of using Hashem as his focus? It simply was the custom in those days that any person who was subservient to another person would place his had under the thigh of his master as a symbol that he acknowledged him as such. Having done this was equivalent to a promise to carry out his master’s wishes. This custom was still in use in India in our author’s time.</p>

              <p>The verse begins by explaining three aspect of Eliezer's capability, as a result of which he was ideal for this mission. This is because the thing that was being sought after and worked for could be completed and come to light through one of three possibilities: sometimes by soft language and persuasion, sometimes by intelligence and expansive speech, and sometimes by perceptiveness and a firm response. And all is according to the matter and the person who comes to speak with him. And indeed it is known that the natures of all people are not alike. There are people who are fit to complete a matter in one particular way, and those who are the opposite. And here, Abraham did not know how it would be sought out to accomplish the matter. Therefore he chose this servant, who had all capabilities, because he was his servant and humble before his master with gentle responses.</p>

              <p>PUT, I PRAY THEE, THY HAND UNDER MY THIGH. Some say that my thigh alludes to Abraham’s circumcised member. (One who takes an oath must take hold of a holy object. The circumcised member is such an object. Cf. Shebuot 38b and Rashi.)  However, if this were the case, then Abraham should have made him swear by the covenant of circumcision, and not by the Lord. (One swears by the holy object that one is holding.)  I believe that it was customary in those days for a person to place his hand under the thigh of his master, its meaning being, “If you are subject to my authority, place your hand under my thigh.” The lord then sat on his servant’s hand. By doing so the servant, as it were, said to the master, “My hand is under your authority to do your will.” This custom is still followed in India.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>שים נא ידך תחת ירכי, “please place your hand under my thigh, etc.” The plain meaning of the text is hat Avraham demanded two separate matters from Eliezer. 1) that he should make a covenant with him to serve him as a servant serves a master; i.e. to pay homage to Avraham. 2) an oath sworn by Almighty G’d, the G’d of both heaven and earth . Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra also explains the request of Avraham for Eliezer to place his hand under his thigh in a similar fashion. He writes that it was customary in those days to place one’s hand beneath the thigh of one’s master while the master was seated, so that in effect the master “sat” on the hand of his servant at the time he made him take an oath. According to Ibn Ezra this custom continued in his time in India. A Midrashic approach based on Bereshit Rabbah 59,8 cited by Rashi: The words: “place your hand under my thigh so that I can make you swear an oath,” are all a single request [not as we said previously that there were two requests here.] Avraham made Eliezer swear by placing his hand on the place where he had been circumcised, i.e. where he wore the sign of his covenant with the G’d of heaven and earth. This had been a commandment which Avraham had revealed to the world. The reason the Torah mentions that G’d is the G’d of the heaven is to remind us that the entire Torah is an elongated name of G’d. As a result of this truth, any single commandment in the Torah may be viewed as a “portion” of the name of G’d. When G’d endows us with one of His commandments it is as if He endows us with a part of His elongated name.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ואלוקי הארץ, “and the Lord of the earth.” Do not be surprised if Avraham spoke about “the G’d of the earth,” seeing that he made Eliezer swear in the land of Canaan, a place where G’d most certainly had not yet been recognised as such. It is customary throughout the Bible to relate the term G’d to a certain country as most nations had “national gods,” deities which supposedly had the interests of the inhabitants of that country at heart. This is why we have such expressions as “the God of Israel,” (Exodus 5,1 and many others), “the G’d of Jerusalem,” (Chronicles II 32,19). The name of our G’d is never associated with other nations or their countries. The reason is that the Holy Land is G’d’s special “inheritance;” when Avraham referred to אלוקי הארץ, he referred to G’d as the especial Patron of the Holy Land, the very land in which he resided. If Avraham had found himself in Egypt at that moment, he would not have referred to G’d at that time as אלוקי הארץ, “the G’d of the land. This is why he added a little while later (verse six) “the G’d of heaven who has taken me out from my father’s house, etc.” Whereas Avraham lists a number of places G’d has taken him away from, he never once refers to G’d as being the G’d of any of these places. The reason was that he did not want the G’d in heaven to be associated in Eliezer’s mind with any country other than the Holy Land.  This may help explain the famous statement in Ketuvot 110 that anyone who resides outside the Holy Land is as if he did not have any god at all. They quote as proof Samuel I 26,19 “For they have driven me out today (David speaking), so that I cannot have a share in the Lord’s possession, but am told: ‘go and worship other gods!’” The meaning of the word “as if” in the statement we quoted from Ketuvot is: “such a person is as if he did not belong to the special people who enjoy the protection of the only true G’d, the G’d who is the Lord of the whole universe.” Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra explains the word הארץ to mean that all marriages on earth are the result of divine input. This is what is meant by the Talmud in Sotah 2 that 40 days before the gestation of the fetus a heavenly voice decrees: “the daughter of so-and-so will be married to so-and-so.” These predictions apply even if the parties involved live on opposite sides of the ocean.</p>

Or, its meaning could be that this servant was older (in the sense of senior) to all Avraham’s other servants. </p>

              <p>שים נא ידך תחת ירכי, it was customary to make a person reinforce the promise that he would carry out an assignment by his placing his hand within the control of his master. This was a symbolic gesture meaning that just as his hand was under the control of his master so his personality would be under the control of his master to carry out his assignment. This was such a firmly established custom that the gesture itself was equivalent to swearing an oath. We find that in Genesis 47,29 when Yaakov wants an assurance from his son Joseph that he would not bury him in Egypt but in the land of Canaan, that he requests the same symbolic gesture from Joseph. There are commentators who understand this verse as Avraham requesting an oath from Eliezer. If that were correct, the Torah should have used the familiar formula of ואשביעך בה' אלוקי השמים, “I want you to swear in the name of the Lord of the Heavens to carry out this specific task.” [we must understand the author to mean that the oath and the symbol should have been part of the same verse if indeed placing his hand within the control of his master had been part of the oath. Ed.]

Es scheint nicht eine örtliche Hinweisung auf Mila zu sein. Die Örtlichkeit selbst entspräche nicht, es heißt ja: תחת ירכי. Warum kommt es sonst nicht bei irgend einer Zusicherung vor? ist vielmehr derjenige Körperteil, welcher, wenn man sich setzt oder legt, zuerst in ירך Berührung mit dem Boden kommt, (er ist insofern das Gegenteil von שכם, der Schulter, die beim Aufstehen aus der liegenden Stellung zuerst gehoben wird, woher השכים), es ist lautverwandt mit ירק und bezeichnet das nach hinten oder unten &quot;geworfene&quot; Ende, im Gegensatz zu פנים, daher ירכתים das Hinterteil eines Gebäudes. So heißt auch die Basis des Leuchters: ירכה. (Schmot 25, 31). In beiden Stellen, in welchen dieser Ausdruck vorkommt, ist es ein Sterbender, oder ein dem Tode naher, der einem Überlebenden ein Versprechen abnimmt, ohne dessen zugesagte Erfüllung er nicht ruhig sterben könnte. Sollte nun nicht das: שים נא ידך תחת ירכי wörtlich heißen: &quot;Lass mich auf deiner Hand ruhen&quot;? d. i. gib mir die ganze Kraft und Macht, die du in deiner Hand hast, als Unterlage, damit ich darauf mich ruhig niederlegen könne. Dafür spricht auch, daß die Handlung des Handunterlegens nicht die Handlung des Schwörens ist, sondern dieser vorangeht.</p>

              <p>Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his household. This individual was not necessarily elderly, but was the senior and most distinguished attendant, who oversaw everything that he had, the general administrator of finances in Abraham’s household. Abraham said to him: Please, place your hand under my thigh, which was an ancient manner of taking an oath. In contrast to grasping or shaking hands, which expresses a commitment between two individuals of similar social status, an oath accepted by placing one’s hand under the thigh of a seated person was typically used in the case of an agreement between an individual with a senior status and someone under his jurisdiction. By this action, the taker of the vow expresses his commitment to perform the bidding of the one administering the oath. 6</p>

              <p>שים נא ידך תחת ירכי, “please place your hand beneath my hip.” This was a request to swear an oath to his master by placing his hand on the site of the circumcision. Although in Jewish law, someone who needlessly touches his own or someone else’s male organ deserves to have that hand cut off, Avraham explained that in light of his having become an old man there was no chance that touching him there would result in the wasteful ejaculation of his semen.
    Ibn Ezra writes that in those days servants (slaves) used to place their hands under the hip of their master as a sign of obeisance. The master, by sitting on the servant’s hand signaled the fact that the servant had to do his bidding. The servant, by complying signaled his acknowledgment of his status.

That is, he showed that he was subservient to his master and would serve him properly. (Bahya, Toldot Yizhak, and Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:2.)  Rashi writes. Circumcision was the first commandment given to Abraham that he found difficult to accomplish. The custom was that when someone wants to swear, he takes a Torah scroll in his hands. Abraham did not have a scroll. Therefore, he held his circumcision in his hand and swore on it. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:2.) </p>

            <summary>The Midrash texts explore various aspects of the lives of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants. Abraham was blessed in various ways, including not having daughters, having a daughter named Bakol, and being visited by kings for advice. Ishmael repented during Abraham's lifetime, and Esau did not rebel during that time. Isaac sent Jacob to find a wife suitable for him, unlike the men of the generation of the flood who were punished for their immoral behavior. Jacob's journey to Haran is seen as a righteous act, while Esau's pursuit of him was met with divine intervention. Abraham's servant, Eliezer, played a key role in finding a wife for Isaac, demonstrating faith and determination.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>[3] Another interpretation: [Genesis 28:10-11] &quot;And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of that place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.&quot; The holy meaning of &quot;He will keep the feet of His holy ones&quot; (1 Samuel 2:9) is that the Holy One, blessed be He, will protect the righteous. This refers to Abraham, who pursued the kings. &quot;Who has stirred up one from the east, whom He calls in righteousness to His feet?&quot; (Isaiah 41:2) And the wicked shall be silent in darkness. These are the eighteen kings whom he slew in darkness, as it is said, &quot;And he divided himself against them by night&quot; (Genesis 14:15). Another explanation of &quot;He will keep the feet of His holy ones&quot; is Jacob, when he went out to go to Haran. For the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;Behold, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go&quot; (Genesis 28:15). &quot;And the wicked shall be silent in darkness&quot; refers to Esau, as it is written, &quot;All darkness is laid up for his treasures&quot; (Job 20:26). &quot;And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Esau for stubble&quot; (Obadiah 1:18). &quot;And the wicked shall be silent in darkness&quot; - when he went out to pursue Jacob in the tenth hour, and the Holy One, blessed be He, brought in the sun and made the day ten hours long, as it is said, &quot;And he lighted upon the place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set&quot; (Genesis 28:11), and Esau was standing in darkness and silence, not knowing where to go. Therefore, it is said, &quot;For by strength shall no man prevail&quot; (1 Samuel 2:9). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;Perhaps you are strong?&quot; Even in the future, He will do the same for Israel, as it is said, &quot;But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble&quot; (Proverbs 4:18-19). If you wonder about this matter, behold, it has already occurred in this world, as it is said, &quot;No man saw his brother&quot; (Exodus 10:23). &quot;May the footsteps of His pious ones be guarded.&quot; When Jacob left his father's house, he only took his staff in his hand, as it is stated: &quot;For with my staff, I crossed this Jordan&quot; (Genesis 32:11). The Holy One Blessed be He said to Isaac, &quot;Just as your father Abraham did, so do for yourself. He did not give you all that he had, as it is stated: &quot;And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac&quot; (Genesis 25:5). And similarly, &quot;And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had&quot; (Genesis 24:2). What is the meaning of &quot;who ruled&quot;? Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak said that he had control over all that Abraham had, and he even said to him, &quot;Even if you lose what I have, take a wife for my son from there.&quot; Immediately, the servant took ten camels and all the good things of his master were in his hand (Genesis 24:10). This demonstrates that the halacha was in his hand (as it is stated: &quot;And Abraham gave all that he had,&quot; Genesis 25:5), and furthermore, the servant began to distribute gifts. To this (i.e. Abraham's actions) we attribute the blessings, and to this (i.e. Isaac's actions) we attribute the rings. And Solomon cried out: &quot;There is one who scatters and yet increases more&quot; (Proverbs 11:24). May the Holy One Blessed be He be praised, as it is stated: &quot;And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). Look at all that Abraham did for Isaac, but Isaac did not do the same for Jacob. Instead, he sent him away empty-handed. The Holy One Blessed be He said to him, &quot;You have withheld from this poor man, from your own lack.&quot; As it is stated: &quot;And yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest; then your poverty will come as a robber, and your want like an armed man&quot; (Proverbs 6:10-11). If Jacob had nothing, the Divine Presence would have departed from him. And he could not speak with him except at the time of his death. Come and see what Esau did to Jacob; he saw him empty-handed and did not have mercy on him. Instead, he said, &quot;Let me go first, and if I cannot pass, then I will kill him.&quot; As it is stated: &quot;Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions...because he pursued his brother with the sword&quot; (Amos 1:11). Jacob turned his eyes to the Holy One Blessed be He and performed miracles for him. He placed his staff in the water, and the Jordan River split apart, as it is stated: &quot;With my staff, I crossed this Jordan&quot; (Genesis 32:11). Esau waited on the way, but Jacob did not pass by there. He felt that he had crossed the Jordan. What did Esau do? He pursued him and came ahead to the place of Makhpelah. Jacob said, &quot;I have neither bread nor anything else with me. I will go in and warm my body in this bath.&quot; Esau surrounded the bath so that Jacob could not leave. Jacob pretended to be dead so that he would not have to leave. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;You are joined against a wicked man. I said, 'Here I am with you, etc.' &quot; Jacob said to him at that time, &quot;You have done this for your name's sake; I am sure of it.&quot; And Jacob went out and encountered the place, and there was no encounter except prayer, as it is said, &quot;Do not pray and do not encounter me&quot; (Jeremiah 7:16). David said, &quot;Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in&quot; (Psalms 121:4-8).</p>

              <p>On this point, however, the Tanaim of the following Baraitha differ. (Gen. 24) The Lord has blessed Abraham bakol (in all things). What does the word bakol mean? R. Maier savs: &quot;He was blessed in not having any daughters.&quot; R. Juda says: &quot;On the contrary he was blessed in having a daughter.&quot; Acherim says: &quot;He had a daughter by the name bakol&quot; R. Elazar the Modai, said: &quot;Abraham, our father, was an astrologer; and therefore all the kings from the West and the East came to his door to ask his advice.&quot; R. Simon b. Jochai said: &quot;A diamond was hanging on Abraham's neck, and when a sick man looked upon it, he was cured. And when Abraham passed away, the Holy One, praised be He! sealed it in the planet of the sun.&quot; Abaye said: &quot;This is the reason for the statement: 'When the sun rises the sick become better.' &quot; There is another explanation [of the word bakol] that as long as Abraham was alive Esau did not become bad. According to still others: &quot;Because Ishmael repented in his days.&quot; That Esau did not rebel in his days, as it is written (Gen. 25, 29-34) and Esau came from the field, etc., and it was taught in a Baraitha that on that day our ancestor Abraham died, and Jacob boiled lentils to offer consolation to Isaac. And whence do we learn that Ishmael had repented? As It happened when Rabina and R. Chama b. Bizna were sitting before Raba while Raba was slumbering, Rabina then said to R. Chama b. Bizna: &quot;Is it a real fact what you said in the name of R. Jochanan, that any death which is termed Geviah, refers only to a death of a righteous?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; came the reply. &quot;But the same expression is also written concerning the generation of the flood?&quot; &quot;Our reference is only when the word geviah (departed) goes together with Asipha (gathered).&quot; But concerning Ishmael both expressions are used.&quot; Meanwhile Raba awoke from his slumber. He then said to them: &quot;Children, thus said R. Jochanan, 'Ishmael repented during his father's life, for it is written (Ib., ib. 9) And his sons Isaac and Ishmael, etc. And from the fact that Isaac is named first, although Ishmael was older, it is to be understood that Ishmael had repented and, knowing that Isaac was better than he, he gave him the preference.' &quot; But perhaps the verse counts them inaccordance with their wisdom. Then the Scripture (Ib. 35, 29) And Esau, and Jacob, his sons, buried him, should also have said, Jacob and Esau, and not according to the age, as it is now. Hence, we infer that Ishmael had repented. </p>

Because they knew that it was going to save their children from Gehinnom in the world to come. (See Gen. R. 48:8; Exod. R. 19:4; Tanh., 5:6; cf. M. Ps. 1:20; 6:1; cf. also Gen. R. 21:9.)  Thus it is stated (in Is. 5:14): THEREFORE SHEOL HAS OPENED WIDE ITS GULLET [AND PARTED ITS MOUTH &lt; FOR ONE &gt; WITHOUT A STATUTE]. (A more traditional translation would read: PARTED ITS MOUTH BEYOND MEASURE.)  What is the meaning of WITHOUT A STATUTE? There is no statute but circumcision. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 105:9f.): &lt; THE COVENANT &gt; WHICH HE CUT WITH ABRAHAM…. AND WHICH HE ESTABLISHED FOR JACOB AS A STATUTE. But the Israelites, because they are circumcised, are saved from it. Thus it is stated (in Is. 43:2): WHEN YOU PASS THROUGH THE WATERS, &lt; I WILL BE WITH YOU &gt;.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>(Gen. 9:18:) AND THE CHILDREN OF NOAH &lt; WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &gt; WERE &lt; SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &gt;. (Tanh. Gen. 2:12.)  [Let our master instruct us: Who is the one commanded about being fruitful and multiplying, the man or the woman? Thus] have our masters taught (in Yev. 6:6): THE MAN IS COMMANDED ABOUT BEING FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLYING BUT NOT THE WOMAN. R. Johanan ben Baroqah says: It says concerning both of them (in Gen. 1:28): AND GOD BLESSED THEM, [AND GOD SAID TO THEM: BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY]. (yTa‘an. 7:9 (69c); yMeg. 1:6 (70c); Gen. R. 8:12.)  However, the man is commanded more than the woman. You know yourself that it is so. Look at how Abraham showed a lot of determination in taking a wife for his son Isaac; for thus it says (in Gen. 24:2-4): SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE … AND I WILL MAKE YOU SWEAR BY THE LORD, THE GOD OF THE HEAVENS … THAT YOU &lt; GO &gt; UNTO MY LAND &lt; WHERE I WAS BORN &gt;…. Thus Abraham showed determination about being fruitful and multiplying. So also Isaac sent Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 28:2): ARISE, GO TO PADDAN-ARAM, TO THE HOUSE OF BETHUEL. He sent him to take a wife who was suitable for him. &lt; In doing so he was &gt; unlike the people of the flood generation, who were lecherous, who were going for what was indecent for them. See what is written (in Gen. 6:2): THE DIVINE SONS SAW &lt; HOW BEAUTIFUL THE HUMAN DAUGHTERS WERE AND TOOK WHOMEVER THEY CHOSE AS THEIR WIVES &gt;. The Holy One said: Inasmuch as they have done this, let them perish from the earth. But why were the cattle destroyed with them, as stated (in Gen. 7:23): BOTH HUMAN AND CATTLE? Because the cattle also were acting immorally and going with species that were not their own, the horse with the donkey, the lion with the bull, the snake with the lizard. (Cf. Sanh. 108a.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 6:12): THEN GOD SAW THE EARTH, AND, BEHOLD, IT WAS CORRUPT; [FOR ALL FLESH HAD CORRUPTED ITS WAY UPON THE EARTH]. It does not say &quot;Every person,&quot; but ALL FLESH, &lt; i.e., &gt; even the cattle, the wild beasts, and the fowl. Therefore, they were blotted out along with them. R. Pinhas bar Hama the Priest said: Just as none but the righteous entered the ark, (See Sanh. 108b.)  so the cattle, wild beasts, and fowl who were with them were righteous, as stated (in Gen. 8:19): &lt; THEY WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK &gt; BY THEIR FAMILIES. Do cattle have families? Only those cattle who had not joined themselves to another species entered the ark; therefore, the Holy One ascribed a lineage for them. So, if cattle, wild beasts, and fowl, who are nothing, were ascribed a lineage, was it not proper for Noah and his sons to be ascribed a lineage? The Holy One immediately ascribed them a {lineage, according to what is written} [lineage. Where is it shown? In what we have read] on the matter (in Gen. 9:18): AND THE SONS OF NOAH WHO WENT FORTH FROM THE ARK WERE &lt; SHEM, HAM, AND JAPHETH &gt;….</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:9): HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS. When Jacob set out from his father's house, he set out with only his staff, as stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): FOR WITH &lt; ONLY &gt; MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN. The Holy One said to Isaac: Did your father, Abraham, do this to you? Did he not give you everything that he had? It is so stated (in Gen. 25:5): BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC. &lt; There is &gt; also this (in Gen. 24:2): SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE, THE ONE WHO RULED OVER ALL THAT HE HAD. R. Samuel bar Isaac said: What is the meaning of THE ONE WHO RULED? When he had made him a ruler over all that he had, he said: Even if you &lt; must &gt; give away everything that belongs to me, take a wife for my son from there. (Gen. 24:10:) THEN THE SERVANT TOOK TEN CAMELS FROM THE CAMELS OF HIS MASTER, AND WENT WITH ALL HIS MASTER'S GOODS IN HIS HAND. This refers to a diatheke (The Greek words means “covenant.”)  {gift certificate} which he carried in his hand. (See Gen. R. 59:11 and some versions of PRE 16. Both use the word diatheke in this context. Cf. Gen. R. 61:6.)  (Ergo, in Gen. 25:5:) BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC. The servant began distributing earrings to one woman, necklaces (Lat.: catellae.)  to another, and rings to still another. This is what the text means (in Prov. 11:24): THERE IS ONE WHO DISPENSES LIBERALLY AND STILL INCREASES. The Holy One has blessed him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:11): AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC. But Isaac did not do so for Jacob. Instead he had him set out empty-handed. The Holy One said (in Prov. 11:24, cont.): ANOTHER HOLDS BACK FROM WHAT IS RIGHT, YET THE RESULT IS WANT. And what happened to him (Isaac)? The Divine Presence departed from him. So you find him (the Holy One) speaking with him only when he died. Come and see what Esau the Wicked did to Jacob. He saw him empty-handed and did not show him mercy. Instead he said: See, I am ahead of him, and he cannot pass me on the way. So I will kill him there. And where is it shown? Where the prophet said so (in Amos 1:11): &lt; THUS SAYS THE LORD: FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF EDOM AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT RESCIND IT (the punishment) &gt; BECAUSE HE PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD. Jacob knew &lt; about it &gt; and raised his eyes to the Holy One. Now he had performed miracles with him (Jacob); so he put {his staff for him in his hand} [his staff into the Jordan]. Then the Jordan divided for him, and he crossed. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): FOR WITH MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN. So Esau was waiting on the way, but Jacob did not pass on the way. When Esau perceived that Jacob had fled and crossed the Jordan, what did he do? He pursued him and found him in a cave, a place like the bath that is in Tiberias. (Cf. Gen. R. 75:5.)  Jacob had said: There is no bread and no food at hand. I shall go in and get warm in the bath. Esau the Wicked came and had the bath surrounded the so that he would die in it. The Holy One said to him: &lt; Since &gt; you are the most wicked man in the world, are you to be paired (The verb is related to the Greek noun zeugos (“yoke of beasts”).)  against him? Immediately the Holy One said to Jacob: What are you afraid of? See, I am with you. Jacob said to him: Sovereign of the World, inasmuch as I am trusting you and you are making me a promise, I will have trust [and set out. (Gen. 28:10:) AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA].</p>

              <p>You know this to be so from the fact that Abraham sought a wife for his son Isaac: And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his household, etc. (Gen. 24:2), and it is written also: I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven … that thou shalt go unto my country (ibid., vv. 3–4). Hence, it is apparent that Abraham was concerned with the observance of the law of Increase and multiply. Similarly, Isaac told Jacob: Arise! Go to Padan-aram (Gen. 28:2), to seek a wife proper for him. He did not wish him to be like the men of the generation of the flood, who wallowed in unchastity and indulged in sexual intercourse with species other than their own. Observe what is written concerning them: The sons of God saw the daughters of men … and took them wives, whomsoever they chose (Gen. 6:2). That was the reason they were obliterated from the earth.</p>

              <p>And Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old; these were the years of the life of ‎Sarah. And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba, the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. And Abraham ‎came to mourn over, Sarah, and to weep over her, and he stood up from before his dead and ‎spoke unto the sons of Heth, the in habitants of the land, saying: I am a stranger and so ‎journey with you; give me a possession of a burying place with you that I may bury my dead ‎out of my sight. And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him: Behold the ‎land is before thee, in the choice of the land bury thy dead, for verily, no man will pre vent ‎thee from burying thy dead. And Abraham said unto them: If it be your mind that I should bury ‎my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron, the son of Zohar, that he ‎may give me the cave of Machpelah, which is in the end of his field, and I will purchase it of ‎him for whatsoever he may desire for it. And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth, and ‎they went and called him, and he came into the presence of Abraham; and Ephron said unto ‎Abraham: Whatsoever thou wishest thy servant will do. And Abraham said: Nay, but I will buy ‎the cave and thy field for its full value, as a possession for a burial place forever. And Ephron ‎answered, saying: Behold the field and cave are before thee, give me whatsoever pleaseth ‎thee. But Abraham said: Nay, only for its full value shall I purchase it from thy hands and from ‎the hands of all those that go in at the gate of thy city, and from thy seed forever. And Ephron ‎and all his kinsmen heard this, and Abraham weighed unto Ephron four hundred shekels of ‎silver, into the hands of Ephron and his brethren; and Abraham wrote down these ‎proceedings and had it testified by four witnesses, and these are their names: Ami gal, son of ‎Abishna, the Hittite; Adihoron, son of Ashu nash, the Hivite; Abdon, son of Ahirom, the ‎Gomrite, and Bakdil, son of Abidos, the Zidonite; and Abraham took the book of the sale and ‎placed it in his treasury, and these are the words that Abraham wrote into the book saying: ‎That Abraham bought the cave and the field from Ephron, the Hittite, and from his seed, and ‎from all those that went in at the gate of his city and from their seed forever, to be the ‎purchased possession of Abraham and his seed, and of all those that go forth from his loins for ‎a possession of a burying place forever. And he put a seal thereto and had it testified by ‎witnesses. Thus the field and the cave therein and the entire ground were secured for ‎Abraham and his seed after him, from the children of Heth; and behold it is before Mamre, ‎even in Hebron, which is in the land of Canaan. And after this Abraham buried there Sarah his ‎wife, and that place with all its boundaries became the possession of Abraham and his seed for ‎a burying place. And Abraham buried Sarah in great display, as it is customary with the burials ‎of kings, and she was interred in very beautiful and costly garments. And her bier was ‎attended by Shem and his sons Eber and Abimelech, also by Auer, Eshcol, and Mamre, and all ‎the dignitaries of the land followed her bier. And the days of Sarah were a hundred and seven ‎and twenty years when she died, and Abraham made a great and heavy mourning, and he ‎observed that mourning for seven days.  And all the inhabitants of the land consoled Abraham ‎and Isaac his son concerning Sarah. . And when their days of mourning were over Abraham ‎sent away his son Isaac to go unto the house of Shem and Eber to learn the ways and ‎instructions of the Lord. And Isaac remained there for three years. At that time Abraham arose ‎with all his servants and they started to return home, towards Beer-sheba. And when the year ‎was around, Abimelech king of the Philistines, died in that year. He was one hundred and ‎ninety-three years old when he died. And Abraham went with all his people into the land of ‎the Philistines to comfort the household of Abimelech, and all his household, and then he ‎returned to his home.‎ And after the death of Abimelech the people of Gerar took his son Benmelech, who was then ‎only twelve years of age, and they made him king in his father's place; and they called his ‎name Abimelech after his father, for such was their way of doing in Gerar. And Abimelech ‎ruled in the place of his father and he sat upon his throne. And Lot the son of Haran died also ‎in these days, in the thirty-ninth year of Isaac's life; and all the days that Lot lived were one ‎hundred and forty years when he died. And these are the sons of Lot, born unto him by his ‎daughters. The name of the first-born was Moab and the name of the second was Benamy. ‎And the two sons of Lot took unto themselves wives from the land of Canaan, and they bare ‎unto them children. And these were the children of Moab: Ed, and Majon, and Tarsus, and ‎Canvil, four sons, and they are the fathers of the children of Moab even unto this day. And all ‎the families of the children of Lot went forth to dwell wherever they should find a suitable ‎place, for they were very fruitful and they increased greatly. And they went out and built cities ‎unto themselves in the land of their habitation, calling the names of the cities which they built ‎after their own names. And Nahor son of Terah, Abraham's brother, died in those days, in the ‎fortieth year of the life of Isaac; and all the days of Nahor were one hundred and seventy-two ‎years, and when he died he was buried in Haran. And when Abraham heard of his brother's ‎death he was full of grief and sorrow and he mourned over him many days. And Abraham ‎called Eliezer, his head-servant, to give him orders concerning his house, and he came and ‎stood before him, and Abraham said unto him: Behold I am old, I do not know the day I may ‎die, for verily I am advanced in years. And now arise and go forth and do not take a wife for my ‎son from this place, nor from this land, from the midst of the daughters of the Canaanites ‎among whom we are dwelling. But go thou to my land and to my native place and take from ‎there a wife for my son. And the Lord God of heaven and earth who hath taken me from the ‎house of my father and brought me to this place; and who hath said unto me: To thy seed I will ‎give this land for an inheritance forever, he will send his angel before thee and give thee ‎success on thy way that thou mayest procure a wife for my son from my family and from the ‎house of my father. And the servant answered unto Abraham his master saying: Behold I will ‎go to thy birth-place and to thy father's house to take a wife for thy son from there. But per ‎adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me into this land; must I need bring thy son ‎again unto the land whence thou camest?  And Abraham said unto him: Beware thou, that thou bring not my son thither again. The Lord ‎before whom I have walked will send his angel before thee to make thy way a success. And ‎Eliezer did according to Abraham's orders and Eliezer swore unto Abraham, his master, ‎concerning this matter. And Eliezer arose and took ten camels of the camels of his father, and ‎ten men from the servants of his master he took likewise, and they departed for Haran, the ‎city of Abraham and Nahor, to bring thence a wife for Isaac the son of Abraham. And while ‎they were gone Abraham sent to the house of Shem and Eber, and they brought thence his ‎son Isaac. And Isaac came back to his father's house in Beer-sheba at the same time that ‎Eliezer and his men arrived in Haran. And they stopped in the city near the watering place, and ‎Eliezer made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of wa ter, and they remained ‎there; and Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, prayed, saying: O, Lord God of my master ‎Abraham, I pray thee send me good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master ‎Abraham, and appoint this day a wife for the son of my master from his own family. And the ‎Lord hearkened to Eliezer's voice for the sake of his servant Abraham, and he happened to ‎meet the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, and ‎Eliezer came into her house. And Eliezer related unto them all his affairs, and that he was the ‎servant of Abraham, and they were greatly rejoiced with him; and all of them blessed the Lord ‎for bringing about this event, and they gave him Rebekah, Bethuel's daughter, to be the wife ‎of Isaac, and the young maiden was very comely of appearance; she was a virgin and ten years ‎old at that time. And Bethuel, and Laban and his children, made a great feast that night, and ‎Eliezer and his men came and ate and drank and were exceedingly rejoiced that night; and in ‎the morning Eliezer and his men arose and he called the whole household together, saying: Let ‎me depart now that I go to my master.‎ And they arose and sent away Rebekah, and her nurse Deborah, daughter of Uz, with her. ‎And they gave her silver and gold, and men servants and maid servants, and they blessed her. ‎Thus they sent away Eliezer with his men and the servants that took Rebekah, and he went ‎and returned unto his master into the land of Canaan. And Isaac took Rebekah and she was ‎unto him a wife, and he brought her into the tent, and Isaac was forty years of age when he ‎took Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel, his uncle, for a wife. ‎ And at that time Abraham again took a wife in his old age, from the land of Canaan, and her ‎name was Keturah; and she bare unto him: Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and ‎Ishbak, and Shuah—six sons. And the sons of Zimran were: Abihen, and Molech, and Marim. ‎And the sons of Jokshan were: Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Medan were: Amido, and ‎Joab, and Gochi, and Elisha, and Notach. And the sons of Midian were: Ephah, and Epher, and ‎Chanoch, and Abi da, and Eldaah. And the sons of Ishbak were: Makiro, and Bejodua, and ‎Tator. And the sons of Shuah were: Bildad, and Mamdad, and Meman, and Mehan. All these ‎are the families of the children of Keturah, the Canaanitish woman, which she bare unto ‎Abraham, the Hebrew. And Abraham sent all of them away, giving them gifts, and they went ‎away from Isaac his son, to locate wheresoever they should find a suitable place; and they ‎went all unto the mountains eastward and they built unto themselves six cities and they dwelt ‎therein even unto this day. And the children of Shebah and Dedan, the sons of Jokshan, did ‎not dwell with their brethren in their cities, and they journeyed about camping in the countries ‎and in the deserts even unto this day; and the children of Midian, son of Abraham, went ‎eastward of the land of Cush, where they discovered a large valley in the country of the east, ‎and they located there and built a city, and they dwelt in it. That is the land of Midian unto this ‎day. And Midian dwelt in the city which he built, with his five sons and all belonging unto him; ‎and these are the names of Midian's sons, according to their names and their cities: Ephah, ‎and Epher, and Chanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. And the sons of Ephah were: Methach, and ‎Meshar, and Avi, and Tzanua. And the sons of Epher were: Ephron, and Zur, and Alirun, and ‎Medin. And the sons of Chanoch were: Reuel, and Rekem, and Azi, and Alyoshub, and Alad. ‎And the sons of Abida were: Chur, and Melud, and Keruy, and Molchi. And the sons of Eldah ‎were: Miker, and Reba, and Malchiyah, and Gabol. These are the names of the Midianites ‎according to their families; and afterwards the families of Midian spread throughout the land ‎of Midian. And these are the families of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, whom Hagar, Sarah's ‎handmaid, bare unto Abraham. - - And Ishmael took a wife from the land of Egypt, and her ‎name was Ribah, the same is Meribah. And Ribah bare unto Ishmael: Nebayoth, and Kedar, ‎and Adbeel, and Mibsam, and their sister Bosmath. And Ishmael disowned his wife Ribah, and ‎she went from him and returned to Egypt to the house of her father, and she dwelt there, for ‎she had been very wicked in the sight of Ishmael, and in the sight of his father Abraham. And ‎Ishmael afterward took a wife from the land of Canaan, and her name was Malchuth, and she ‎bare unto him: Nishma, and Dumah, and Masa, and Chadad, and Tema, and Yetur, and ‎Naphish, and Kedma. These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, twelve ‎princes according to their nations; and the families of Ishmael spread forth,  and Ishmael took his children and all the property that he had gained, together with the souls ‎of his household and all belonging to him, and they went to locate where they should find a ‎suitable place, And they went and dwelt near the wilderness of Paran and their dwelling was ‎from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt as thou comest toward Assyria; and Ishmael and ‎his sons dwelt in the land, and they had chidren born unto them, and they were fruitful and ‎increased greatly. And these are the names of the sons of Nebayoth, the first born of Ishmael: ‎Mend, and Send, and Mayon; and the sons of Kedar were: Alyon, and Kezem, and Chamad, ‎and Eli. And the sons of Adbeel were: Cha mad, and Jabin; and the sons of Mibsam were: ‎Obadiah, and Ebedmelech, and Yeush—these are the families of the children of Ribah, the ‎wife of Ishmael; and the sons of Mishma, the son of Ishmael, were: Shamua, and Zecaryon, ‎and Obed; and the sons of Dumah were: Kezed, and Eli, and Machmad, and Amed; and the ‎sons of Masa were: Melon, and Mula, and Ebidadon; and the sons of Chadad were: Azur, and ‎Minzar, and Ebed melech; and the sons of Tema were: Seir, and Sadon, and Yakol; and the ‎sons of Yetur were: Merith, and Yaish, and Alyo, and Pachoth; and the sons of Naphish were: ‎Ebed, and Tamed, and Abiyasaph, and Mir; and the sons of Kedma were: Calip, and Tachti, and ‎Omir—these were the children of Malchuth, the wife of Ishmael, according to their families. ‎All these are the families of Ishmael according to their generations, and they dwelt in those ‎lands wherein they had built themselves cities unto this day.‎ And Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the wife of Isaac, Abraham’s son, was barren in those ‎days, she had no offspring. And Isaac dwelt with his father in the land of Canaan, and the Lord ‎was with Isaac; and Arpachshad, son of Shem, the son of Noah, died at that time, in forty-‎eighth year of Isaac’s life; and all the days of Arpachshad’s life were four hundred and thirty ‎years when he died.‎</p>

The hidden message here is that if G–d has granted someone great wealth, and that person is a miser, does not perform charitable deeds liberally, he will surround himself with קליפות, negative influences, which will eventually prevent him from המושל בכל אשר לו, from exercising control over what he thought was his. When a person is generous such as Abraham, however, he will enjoy being in charge of all that is his.</p>

The words המושל בכל אשר לו, are interpreted by that Midrash as a compliment that Eliezer held his evil urge in check. The Midrash goes on to interpret the words ויאמר אליו העבד in 24,5 by quoting Hoseah 12,8: &quot;A trader (כנען) who uses false weights, who loves to overreach.&quot; &quot;The trader,&quot; i.e. כנען, supposedly refers to Eliezer. Probably the Midrash, too, makes a destinction between the instances where the Torah uses the term עבד for Eliezer, and where another term such as זקן ביתו is employed. Whenever the latter term is used, Eliezer had Mattaron hovering over him.</p>

              <p>The Pardes Rimonim mentions that the &quot;miniature&quot; number is a reference to Chanoch (otherwise known as the angel Mattatron) who is also called נער, and whose function is alluded to in Solomon's Proverbs 22, 6: חנוך לנער על פי דרכו, &quot;educate the lad in the manner appropriate for him. [In his chapter on the definitions of certain words, the author of Pardes Rimonim defines the reason that Mattatron is called נער as being that he performs the duties of a נער. These duties are comprehensive just as the duties of Joshua, who is described as a נער, a senior servant of Moses, or Eliezer, who is described in that fashion although he was the senior servant of Abraham. According to Kabbalists, Mattatron provides the &quot;food&quot; not only for our world but also for the world of the angels. Ed.] When the souls of Jacob and Joseph respectively expanded from the world of אצילות, their origin, the features of Jacob remained engraved on the throne of G–d. This throne is immediately below the region we have called אצילות. Joseph is immediately below his father in the domain of Mattatron whose activities emanate from beneath that &quot;throne.&quot; The significance of the throne is the mystery of בריאה, whereas the significance of Mattatron in the same scheme is the mystery surrounding יצירה, [a more advanced state of the creation of matter. Ed]. Concerning this latter aspect of Mattatron's activities, the Torah describes Joseph here as 17 years old, i.e. a &quot;junior.&quot; Kabbalists also refer to Mattatron as עבד. The Zohar points that out on Genesis 24, 2 where Abraham instructs עבדו זקן ביתו, &quot;his servant the senior member of his household,&quot; to get a wife for Isaac. I have explained this at length in my commentary on חיי שרה. The expression עבד also occurs in Joseph's life when the latter is sold by his brothers. G–d sent His angel along to protect Joseph on his various journeys. This guidance was of a similar nature as that described in Exodus 23, 20: הנה אנכי שולח מלאך לפניך לשמרך בדרך, &quot;Here I am sending an angel ahead of you to protect you on the journey.&quot; Our sages identified that angel with the angel Mattatron, as mentioned by Rashi on that verse. [The fact that Rashi mentions that the numerical value of 314=מטטרון=שדי, clearly establishes that Mattatron is active in matters of יצירה, an activity requring the attribute of שדי. Ed.]</p>

            <summary>Rabbeinu Bahya explains that G'd assured Pinchas of the covenant of Justice, which includes peace as an adjunct. Or HaChaim discusses the symbolism of circumcision as a removal of evil urges, while Rashi connects pouring with the spirit. Ramban offers interpretations of Abraham's possessions, and Tze'enah Ure'enah discusses the custom of placing a hand under a master's foot.

              <p>ירכך, “your thigh;” this is a synonym for “your womb.” Compare Genesis 24,2 where Avraham asks his servant to select a suitable wife for his son Yitzchok, by placing his hand under his thigh, i.e. תחת ירכי; then we have the expression: יוצאי ירך יעקב, “the descendants of Yaakov stemming from his thigh,” in Exodus 1,5. In the Talmud Megillah, folio 13, we hear that a woman’s jealousy is usually concerned with the offspring of other women, where the word for “offspring” used is the word .ירך</p>

                <h4>Or HaChaim on Genesis 2:25:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>ויהיו שניהם ערומים האדם ואשתו ולא יתבששו. Man and his wife were both nude and did not experience a feeling of shame. Before the sin the upper &quot;face&quot; and the lower &quot;face&quot; were equally holy. The element of evil which attached itself to man after the sin concentrates on the lower part of his body. This is the reason that the holy covenant between man and G'd, i.e. circumcision, has to be performed on his sexual organ. The foreskin, ערלה, is the symbol of what kabbalists call the קליפה, the shell or peel which makes penetration to the holy essence difficult. This is why G'd commanded its removal. Inasmuch as all adulterers are victims of the sexual urges burning within them, G'd ordered that this part of man, the source of these abominations, be hidden from view, be covered. Our sages have added the prohibition not to touch that part of one's body (unnecessarily). אורח חיים ,ב,א even tells us to avoid having to look at these parts of our body when we get up and get dressed. The Talmud Shabbat 108 coined the phrase יד לאמה תיקצץ, that the hand which touches the male organ deserves to be cut off. This is because the touch of the hand on the male organ causes sexual arousal, or אש זרה in the language of our sages, something that was not the case before the sin. Henceforth man would expose himself to the danger of that alien fire consuming him if he touched those parts. Let us look for a moment at what Abraham commanded Eliezer before he sent him on the mission to find a wife for Isaac (Genesis 24,2). He instructed his servant: שים נא ידך תחת ירכי, &quot;place your hand under my thigh.&quot; At first glance the instruction for Eliezer to place his hand on Abraham's male organ seems incompatible with what we have just explained. Our sages explain that Abraham was not comparable to his peers in this respect. The touch of a hand on this part of his body did not cause arousal. The act of circumcision he had performed on himself on that organ at an advanced age had made him far more resistant to the evil urge than others. His whole body could be considered as almost pure. The same applies to our verse, that prior to the sin the body was not subject to this אש זרה, the burning passion of sexual arousal. Another meaning is based on the use of the future tense by the Torah. We would have expected ולא נתביישו, &quot;they were not ashamed,&quot; instead of &quot;they will not be ashamed.&quot; The Torah teaches us then that notwithstanding the fact that Adam and Eve were both nude they had no reason to become ashamed as a result. The Torah mentioned this so that we would know who caused the subsequent division between man's upper and lower body respectively.</p>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Bamidbar 25:12:5</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>A kabbalistic approach to the words: “Herewith I grant you My covenant peace.” G’d assured him of the attribute known as ברית which is identical with the concept of כנסת ישראל. This is a variation of the attribute of Justice. We find this attribute mentioned by our sages who stated that Avraham had a daughter (in explaining the words וה' ברך את אברהם בכל, “the Lord had blessed Avraham in all respects,” (Genesis 24,2) see Baba Batra 16). This is why in our verse the wording is והיתה לו ...ברית, meaning that the covenant with this attribute of Justice will be his. G’d assured Pinchas that the peace He promised would be an adjunct to this covenant. It is similar to Leviticus 26,6 where G’d promises that as a consequence of observance of His commandments ונתתי שלום בארץ, “I will grant peace in the land” [as opposed to peace merely between people. Maybe the author means that the very fact that man has to die, the body to return to earth, is symbolic of a constant state of war between the living and the dead. Ed.].  All of this implies that Pinchas deserved to be granted eternal life. This is the justification of the verse in Maleachi 25, we quoted earlier that “My covenant was with him, the life and the peace.” “Life” is an outgrowth of the attribute of Mercy. This is reflected in the Torah describing Pinchas as קנא לאלו-היו “he was jealous for the sake of his G’d (in the sense of the attribute of Justice). If I understand our author correctly, when Pinchas observed a joining together of bodies which represented opposing philosophies which had no business to be joined together he tried to restore the state of affairs in which matters which belong together are joined together. In the celestial regions צדק ושלום נשקו, “righteousness and peace kissed” (Psalms 85,11), i.e. the emanations of מלכות and the adjoining one ofיסוד are perceived as a natural fit. When they are close together the universe can continue to exist. In our terrestrial part of the universe the continued existence of this world is also dependent on matters that belong together being joined together, not matters or people who have no business to indulge in physical union. Basically, Pinchas tried to restore the world’s (Jewish) equilibrium by his deed. If he was granted “peace” as the reward for his deed this was precisely a case of the reward fitting the merit attained. “Peace”, after all, is joining together, creating harmony.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND ALL THE GOODS OF HIS MASTER BEING IN HIS HAND. Rashi comments: “This refers to a deed of gift of all his possessions which he wrote in favor of Isaac so that they would be eager to send him their daughter.” And so it is also stated in Bereshith Rabbah, (59:15.)  “He carried with him a disposition of property.” According to this opinion, the verse stating, And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac, (Further, 25:5.)  means that he caused him to take possession of the belonging at the time of his death so that the other children would not contest his ownership, just as it is said, And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived. (Ibid., Verse 6.)  If so, the word “taking” applies also to the first part of the verse, And the servant ‘took’ ten camels, and departed, and all the goods of his master he took in his hand. Perhaps [the words of the verse are to be transposed as follows]: “And the servant took ten camels and all the goods of his master in his hand, and departed.” Others (This interpretation is found in the commentary of Chizkuni.)  explain the sense of the verse as meaning that immediately upon being sworn, the servant himself went and took many camels from his master’s camels because all his master’s goods were in his hand, he being the officer and captain over all and authorized to take from him whatever he desired, just as the verse says, that ruled over all that he had. (Verse 2 here.)  The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the meaning of this verse is similar to that of the verse concerning Hazael, general of Aram, And Hazael went to meet him [Elisha the prophet], and took a present with him, and every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, (II Kings 8:9.)  [which means “and ‘of’ every good thing of Damascus].” Here too Scripture states that he took in his hand of all his master’s goods ten camels’ burden. The sense of the verse concerning Hazael is that the camels carried all that was good and excellent among those species of fruits and precious things that were found in Damascus or in his master’s house, and in addition they carried a present with them. In a similar sense is the verse, ten asses laden with the good of Egypt, (Further, 45:23.)  [which means laden with the good and excellent fruits of Egypt]. The verses, however, shorten expressions when the subjects are understood.</p>

              <p>אשר לא תקח אשה לבני מבנות הכנעני, “that you will not take a wife for my son from amongst the daughters of the Canaanite, etc.” He warned Eliezer not to take a wife from a nation which was cursed. When a woman is predestined for destruction, she is apt to drag her husband in the same general direction. This is precisely what the mother of all human beings did (compare Genesis 3, 20). You are aware that this is what happened to Solomon who married a number of alien women (Kings I 11,1). The prophet testifies there that it was these women who turned his heart from being completely loyal to G-d. This is the reason that it has become the custom of the Jewish people to read this portion (in the presence of the assembled guests) to a bridegroom on the day when he gets married to remind all the people to be very circumspect in their choice of life-partners. (There is a section on this custom in Zunz: “Ritus” page 15). The Avudraham at the end of ברכת נשואין brings the custom as “on the Sabbath of the seven days of the Chuppah one reads this section before the bridegroom, etc.” (apparently in the Synagogue during the regular morning service). The groom is reminded not to marry a woman because of her physical beauty, as Solomon has said in Proverbs 31,30 ,שקר החן והבל היופי, “grace is deceptive, and beauty is vain.“ He should also not marry a woman because she is wealthy, as money is apt to develop wings and to fly off just like an eagle (compare Proverbs 23,5). The groom should also not marry a woman because she is a member of a powerful, and influential family and he hopes to become powerful and influential himself due to his wife’s connections. If these are a groom’s considerations in the choice of his wife he will be punished and will likely fail on all three counts. The guiding considerations when choosing a wife have to be reverence for G-d, choosing a family which enjoys a good reputation. Seeing that in the majority of cases the daughter‘s character is similar to that of her brothers, one may form some idea about a girl by observing the way her older brothers conduct themselves. (compare Baba Batra 110). Our portion also teaches that it is appropriate to select a bride from amongst one’s family, as did Avraham (compare verse 4) for his son Yitzchak, and as did Amram who married Yocheved (an aunt, Exodus 2,1 something that the Torah forbade later on). Whenever people marry someone to whom they already have a natural affinity, such as members of their own family (excluding incest, of course), the likelihood of harmonious relations not only between husband and wife but between the mutual members of the respective families is enhanced.  If someone marries a wife from a lower social strata, there is a chance that he will feel superior to her and this will lead to bad blood and resentment on his wife’s part. The result will be an ongoing friction. Our sages in Pessachim 49, have described families who are cleaving to one another because they are all part of the same social strata as ענבי הגפן בענבי הגפן דבר נאה ומתקבל, “grapevines joining grapevines are something beautiful and acceptable.” The author continues in this vein, concluding with the quotation from Psalms 125,4 הטיבה ה’ לטובים ולישרים בלבותם, “Do good, O Lord to the good, to the upright in their heart.” The psalmist implores G-d to grant His blessing to people whose motivations in their choice of wife are guided by the principles we have just outlined. The psalm goes on by predicting that those who are guided by base motivations will join the path of the evildoers. When such clear lines of distinction are drawn between people who are sincere in their motivations and those who are not, Israel will be at peace (as one will not confuse one group with another).</p>

              <p>ואשביעך..ואלוקי הארץ, meaning that the same G’d Who is ruler in the heavens also exercises His control down here on earth. Do not think that if you do not honour an oath made to the G’d in heaven that failure to honour it would not have negative consequences for you here on earth. When Avraham speaks of his own self, as opposed to the need to make someone else take an oath, he only needs to refer to the “G’d of the heavens” (compare verse 7) Avraham was well aware of G’d being also the G’d on earth. In Bereshit Rabbah 59,8 Rabbi Pinchas is quoted as saying that until He revealed Himself to His creatures G’d was known only as the “G’d of the heavens,” whereas after He revealed Himself to His creatures [or to an individual creature by performing a miracle for such a person Ed.] He also became known as the ”G’d of the earth.”</p>

              <p>AND I WILL MAKE THEE SWEAR BY THE ETERNAL. It would have been proper for Abraham to command his son Isaac that he should not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. But since it was his wish to dispatch someone during his lifetime to his country and his family, and he made the servant swear to do so whether in his lifetime or after his death, therefore Abraham found it necessary in any case to make the servant swear to go there. In addition he found it necessary to say to him, “I command you that you should not take a woman for my son of the daughters of Canaan. Instead you are to go to my country and take for him a wife from my father’s house.” Now having required the servant to swear to this, he no longer found it necessary to command Isaac at all for he knew that he would not transgress his father’s wish or the oath which he made his servant swear, as the matter was indeed known to Isaac. It is also possible that the servant Eliezer was the administrator of his possessions, and Abraham commanded him to marry off Isaac in accordance with his will and cause him to inherit his estate on this condition, [namely, that he marry in accordance with his father’s wish]. This is the significance of the expression, that ruled over all that he had. (Verse 2 here.) </p>

              <p>THE G-D OF THE HEAVEN, AND THE G-D OF THE LAND. (“Of the land.” From Ramban’s commentary it becomes obvious that he understood the word ha’aretz (the land) to mean “the land of Israel.”)  The Holy One, blessed be He, is called the G-d of the Land of Israel, as it is written, They know not the manner of the G-d of the land, (II Kings 17:26.)  and it is further written, And they spoke of the G-d of Jerusalem, as of the gods of the people of the earth. (II Chronicles 32:19.)  There is a secret in this matter which I will yet explain (See further, 26:5, and Leviticus 18:25.)  with the help of G-d. However [in Verse 7], further on where it says, Who took me from my father’s house, it does not say “the G-d of the land” because he [Abraham] was then in Haran or Ur of the Chaldees. So also the Rabbis have said: (Ketuboth 110b.)  “He who lives outside the land of Israel is as if he had no G-d, as it said, For they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of the Eternal, saying, Go, serve other gods. (I Samuel 26:19. But who said to David, Go serve other gods? However this verse teaches you that he who lives outside of the land of Israel is considered as if he worshipped idols. (Ibid.)) </p>

              <p>ואשביעך, “so that I make you swear, etc.” Avraham anticipates Eliezer’s concern that no woman in her right mind would a follow someone’s servant to a distant country on the servant’s say so that he had been empowered to select her as a wife for the son of his master. Therefore, Avraham told Eliezer that he would give him irrevocable documents, oath-like, to prove to the girl’s family that if she were to come she would indeed become the wife of Avraham’s son Yitzchok. Eliezer would have the widest possible latitude in using his good judgment.

              <p>אשר לא תקח אשה לבני מבנות הכנעני, “that you will not take a wife for my son from among the girls who are of Canaanite origin.” Actually, Avraham should have made Yitzchok swear an oath that he would not marry a Canaanite girl. The reason Avraham did not proceed in this fashion was that he wanted to send someone to his family in Charan or thereabouts, but he wanted to make his servant swear that he would perform the task either while he, Avraham, was still alive, or if necessary, even after his death. To this end he had to make Eliezer take an oath anyway. Seeing that he made Eliezer swear there was no longer any need to make Yitzchok swear to the same effect. He knew that Yitzchok would not violate the wishes of his father in this matter.
    Alternatively, Avraham actually appointed Eliezer to be his executor, ordering him to see that Yitzchok would get married and restricting his choices only by excluding women of Canaanite descent. To make this point quite clear to the reader, the Torah added the words המושל בכל אשר לו, describing Eliezer as having complete power of attorney concerning the affairs of Avraham.
     Some commentators believe that that at the time in question Yitzchok was simply not at hand, a view supported by the Torah when it described the chance meeting of Yitzchok and Eliezer when the former just returned from the well named by Hagar באר לחי רואי, (compare both 24,18 and 16,14) According to a Midrash (Yalkut), Yitzchok returned from Gan Eden at that time where the wounds inflicted upon him by his father when he had been lying bound on the altar had been healed.

              <p>“I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth” [24:3]. I make you swear by God in heaven and earth. Rashi asks a question in this verse, “The God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house” [24:7]. Here he only says, God of heaven and not God of the earth. The explanation is that when God first led him out of the house of Terah, he did not yet recognize that the Holy One was God over all gods. However, they knew the Holy One in heaven, but later Abraham came and caused them to recognize that the Holy One is God over all gods. He then said, the God of heaven and earth. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:7.)  However, Bahya, the Toldot Yizhak, and the Ramban write. Abraham was in the land of Israel. He said: God of heaven and of earth. The Holy One is the Lord in the land of Israel and Abraham said his words about God who is over all gods. Outside the land, the gentiles worship idols. Therefore, Abraham said in the verse, “who took me from my father’s house and from my native land” [24:7]. God in heaven; since outside the land God is only recognized in heaven and not on the earth.

              <p>“You will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites” [24:3]. You should not take a wife from the daughters of the Canaanites. The Torah portion also teaches us that one should take a wife from his family, as Amram, as the verse says, “a certain man of the house of Levi went and married a Levite woman” [Exodus 2:1]. Abraham did this for his son, Isaac, when he also took [a wife] from his family. When people take from their own family, there is peace between them. One cannot accuse the other; you are inferior to me. (Bahya, Genesis, 24:3.)  Ibn Shuaib asks a question. Why did Abraham take a maidservant and a concubine from the nations, but he forbade his son to take a maidservant and none of the Canaanites? The explanation is that Isaac was like a holy sacrifice on Mount Moriah. That is why Abraham did not pray for Sarah when she had no children. Abraham took a maidservant to have children. He thought to himself. I will not exert myself much to pray for Sarah, because I can take a maidservant. Then, the righteous ones will not trouble the Holy One when it is not completely necessary. However, Isaac had to pray for Rebecca that she should have children, since he did not to take a maidservant because he was holy. (Ibn Shuaib, Derashot, Hayyei Sarah, I: 43.)  Ibn Shuaib asks another question. Why did Abraham not ask Isaac if he should send for a wife? The explanation is that Abraham knew well that Isaac would obey him. Another explanation is that Isaac was in the Garden of Eden at the time. He was being healed for what his father had done to his throat. Abraham had wanted to slaughter Isaac and he hurt Isaac in the throat. He was being healed in the Garden of Eden for three years. (Ibid.)  Hizkuni writes. Abraham did not want that his children should take wives from the daughters of Canaan. The Canaanites had said that Abraham’s children could not come into the land of Israel, but they should intermarry with us and through that, they will have the land, since the Holy One does not want to keep His promise to give them the land. Therefore, Abraham ordered his servant that he should not take any wife for his son Isaac from the daughters of Canaan. I know well that the Holy One will give the land of Israel to my children without their daughters. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:3.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>We see, therefore, that the sons of Jacob displayed a total disregard for all these four character traits in their dealings with Shechem and his city. Aristo's lessons of self discipline are valid then for all those who have not had the benefit of the revelation at Mount Sinai, who have not heard the words G-d taught us in the Torah. Such people, if they want to attain wisdom and knowledge of G-d, must travel the path indicated by Aristo in his book of ethics. We Jews, however, are somewhat different trees inasmuch as instead of being rooted in the earth, we are rooted in heaven. Our roots, instead of going deeper into the ground, strive upwards. We learn the word of G-d as soon as we start learning how to walk: &quot;The righteous lives by his faith&quot; (Chabakuk 2,3). Our vital juices are our faith, and our body is the fruit nurtured by these Divinely inspired thoughts. This requires, on occasion, the very opposite of what Aristotele would call &quot;ethical conduct.&quot; Abraham's unquestioning willingness to sacrifice Isaac, Jacob's subterfuge in securing the blessing intended for Esau, or his purchase of the birthright for a pittance, exploiting his brother's hunger, are all examples of this. In fact, practicing the finest human traits such as king Saul's pity for Agog, lost him the kingship (Samuel I Chapter 15). When the prophet (Kings I 20,35) says to his companion, &quot;Strike me,&quot; and his companion refused, the companion was slain for his refusal to raise his hand against the man of G-d. The standards of ethical conduct for Jews are set from on high for the Torah oriented personality, and do not always correspond to the maxims espoused by mere human intellect, however well motivated. Generally speaking, there is no greater sin than disrespect for one's parents. King Chiskiyahu, who displayed that apparent disrespect when he dragged the remains of his father on a stretcher, may have referred to this publicly misunderstood action when he prayed for his survival on his deathbed, and referred to the upright ways of the Lord, invoking his own conduct as deserving recognition. Having obeyed G-d’s law, despite thereby creating a very unfavorable impression of himself amongst the people and thus having exposed himself to condemnation by his peers, he may have prayed for his survival as a sign from G-d that that conduct had been Divinely approved (Kings II 20,1-3). There are numerous examples of the truism (Proverbs 21,30) &quot;No wisdom can prevail against the Lord.&quot; As long as the roots of our faith keep increasing and deepening, we will be nourished by the lifegiving waters of Torah, and need not be afraid of hostile phenomena around us, but we will be able to weather all onslaughts, as illustrated by the parable of the trees in the Mishnah we have quoted. Wisdom which is not based on the revealed will of G-d is apt to mislead its owner, and in times of stress may not protect him against the ravages of external forces. Since Jacob's sons’ roots were not in the earth, but were drawing their nourishment from heaven, they were able to defy all the normal rules of human conduct listed by Aristotele and yet succeed in their plan and its execution. Since the day Abraham had been commanded circumcision, his descendants had been set apart from those uncircumcised. They had, of course, been aware of all the trouble Abraham had gone to to avoid Isaac marrying a Canaanite girl, and the commandment of Isaac and Rebecca to Jacob not to marry a Canaanite. They had also observed that as a result of following these instructions, their father had established a family, all of whom were true to their heritage. Rape of their only sister then was a public desecration of G-d’s name, in the face of which ordinary rules of human conduct did not apply any longer. The brothers' deliberate flouting of all the four major rules of conduct was designed to impress the G-dly principles on which their lives were built, on the surrounding country. On all four occasions when the Torah describes the reaction of Jacob's sons to the rape, be it when they heard about it, when they negotiate with Chamor, when they slew the people in the city, or even when they reject their father's rebuke, each time they refer to the immoral act that had been perpetrated upon them, meaning their sister, and themselves by extension. The fact that the tum-ah defilement is mentioned only in connection with the brothers' reaction underscores that the Torah upholds their conduct (naturally, mention of the event and Jacob having heard about it prior to the brothers is a necessary part of the narrative). </p>

              </summary>
              <p>The matter involving the &quot;nobles&quot; deserves to be explained in a constructive fashion, as some of our sages have done. (6) The people included in the list of those who &quot;ascended,&quot; namely Moses, Aaron, Nadav, Avihu and the elders, had attained a level of insight into the workings of the Divine mind and His entourage which had not been attained by others. They could perceive that all the galaxies are merely tools of the Almighty. Their &quot;vision,&quot; i.e. insight, is described as va-yeche-zu, a lower level of insight than va-yir-oo. The former viewed elokey yisrael, the nobles merely elokim, a far more general, less specific kind of understanding. The livnat ha-sappir, the sapphire brick, represents a figment of purity closer to the unity of G-d than even the highest galgalim, planets, galaxies. It is an insight similar to the one described by Ezekiel 1, even sappir. This is discussed in greater detail in chapter thirty one. (7) &quot;G-d did not stretch out His hand&quot; (24,11) means that G-d did not extend the gift of prophecy to the other numerous high ranking persons among the people. The description of “they ate and drank,&quot; refers back to the consumption of the peace offerings mentioned earlier in the passage. (4) After that came the call to Moses alone to ascend the mountain and meet with G-d. Joshua kept watch at the site from which Moses had ascended outside the encampment. Therefore, when Moses descended, the Torah says &quot;Joshua heard the sound of the people acting wildly.&quot; (Exodus 32, 17) (8) Moses had instructed the elders to judge during his absence, and to refer difficult decisions to Aaron and Chur. The Mountain had been enveloped in cloud for six days to allow Moses preparation for his meeting with G-d. Our sages say that such preparation of six days is mandatory for someone who meets with the Shechinah. Not that there were specific impediments on Moses’s side that had to be overcome. No charadah, trembling is mentioned, such as was the case with the people. As soon as G-d called to Moses on the seventh day, the Presence of G-d manifested itself as a consuming fire. The forty days include the six days Moses had prepared himself to be addressed by G-d. </p>

              <p>We must also consider the four different terms employed in expressing the relations of the heavens to God, bore (Creator), ‘oseh (Maker), koneh (Possessor), and el (God). Comp. “God created the heaven and the earth” (i. 1); “In the day that God made the earth and the heavens” (ii. 4); “Possessor of heaven and earth” (xiv. 19); “God of the Universe” (xxi, 31); “The God of heaven and the God of the earth” (xxiv. 3). As to the verbs, konen, “he established,” tafaḥ, “he spanned, “and natah, “he stretched out,” occurring in the following passages, “Which thou hast established” (Ps. 8:4), “My right hand hath spanned the heavens” (Isa. 18:13), “Who stretchest out the heavens” (Ps. 104:2), they are included in the term ‘asah (“he made”); the verb yaẓar, “he formed,” does not occur in reference to the heavens. According to my opinion the verb yaẓar denotes to make a form, a shape, or any other accident (for form and shape are likewise accidents). It is therefore said, yoẓer or, “Who formeth the light” (Isa. 14:7), light being an accident; yoẓer harim, “That formeth the mountains” (Amos 4:13), i.e., that gave them their shape. In the same sense the verb is used in the passage, “And the Lord God formed (va-yiẓer) all the beasts,” etc. (Gen. 2:7). But in reference to the Universe, viz., the heavens and the earth, which comprises the totality of the Creation, Scripture employs the verb bara, which we explain as denoting he produced something from nothing; also ‘asah (“he made”) on account of the general forms or natural properties of the things which were given to them; kanah, “he possessed,” because God rules over them like a master over his servants. For this reason He is also called, “The Lord of the whole earth” (Jos. 3:11-13); ha-adon, “the Lord” (Exod. xx., 3:17). But although none can be a master unless there exists something that is in his possession, this attribute cannot be considered to imply the belief in the eternal existence of a materia prima, since the verbs bara, “he created,” and ‘asah, “he made,” are also employed in reference to the heavens. The Creator is called the God of the heavens and the God of the Universe, on account of the relations between Him and the heavens; He governs, and they are governed; the word elohim does not signify “master” in the sense of “owner”; it expresses the relation between His position in the totality of existing beings, and the position of the heavens or the Universe; He is God, not they, i.e., not the heavens.

Hence, it is apparent that Abraham was concerned with the observance of the law of Increase and multiply. Similarly, Isaac told Jacob: Arise! Go to Padan-aram (Gen. 28:2), to seek a wife proper for him. He did not wish him to be like the men of the generation of the flood, who wallowed in unchastity and indulged in sexual intercourse with species other than their own. Observe what is written concerning them: The sons of God saw the daughters of men … and took them wives, whomsoever they chose (Gen. 6:2).

            <summary>Ramban explains the difference between vows and oaths, stating that vows are made &quot;to&quot; God and oaths are made &quot;by&quot; God. He also discusses how vows can apply to both secular and religious matters, while oaths only apply to matters that were previously permitted. Radak discusses how Noach began planting a vineyard and making wine, serving as a warning against overindulging in alcohol. Tur HaArokh analyzes G'd's command to Avraham to leave his homeland, with different interpretations regarding when this command was given. Chizkuni explains why only Noach's sons carried his body, not his grandsons, due to concerns about intermarrying with Canaanites. Lastly, Derekh Chayyim discusses how the Torah, heaven and earth, Avraham, Israel, and the Temple are all considered possessions of God.</summary>

              <p>וישאו אותו בניו, “His sons carried him, etc;” only his sons, not any of his grandsons as they had Canaanite mothers. We have read in the Talmud tractate Pessachim folio 50, “are we to assume that Yehudah’s wife (Genesis 38,2) was really a Canaanite, in spite of the fact that Avraham had gone to great length to insure that Eliezer would not select a Canaanite wife for his son Yitzchok? (Genesis 24,3 Yitzchok) Yitzchok had similarly instructed his son Yaakov. The answer given by the Talmud is that the word Canaanite also means: “trader,” and that the Torah told us in Genesis 38,2 that Yehudah’s wife was the daughter of a well known trader, named Shua. If you were to counter how this can be squared with the opinion expressed on Genesis 37,35 where we read about Yaakov’s “sons and daughters all trying to comfort Yaakov over the disappearance and presumed death of Joseph,” that all of Yaakov’s sons had twin girls born with them, so why did Yehudah not marry one of them or a granddaughter of Yaakov? We must assume that all of these twin daughters died prematurely so that the sons of Yaakov had no other option but to marry Canaanite girls. To the additional question why they could not at least have married the children of Shimon of whom we know that he had a son by a Canaanite woman (Genesis 46,10)? B‘reshit Rabbah 80,10 suggests that Shaul borne to Shimon was actually a son of Sh’chem who had raped Dinah; one opinion offered is that Shimon buried that offspring in the land of Canaan before the brothers descended to Egypt and that this is why he is referred to as son of a Canaanite. Getting back to the question why the grandsons of Yaakov were not part of the pall bearers, of the grandfather; Joseph did not wish to do anything that could arouse jealousies among them, some being biologically qualified others not; seeing that no one would be jealous of Ephrayim and Menashe who were princes, he did not object to their being pall bearers. (They would also be founding fathers of tribes in the future) Moreover, Rashi says that Levi was not among the pall bearers, as he would be carrying the Holy Ark. More questions are raised as to how Moses could carry the coffin of Joseph at the Exodus, seeing that he too was a Levite. A suggestion is offered that Joseph’s coffin, similar to the Holy Ark, did not actually need pall bearers as it carried itself, similar to the Holy Ark which is described as carrying its bearers.

              <p>And all of these five things are things that serve His divinity, may He be blessed; so His divinity, may He be blessed, is upon them. Hence they are called a possession. For the Torah is the decree of His mastery, may He be blessed, over the creatures - as [the presentation of] the Torah opens (Exodus 20:20), “I am the Lord, your God, who took you out of the Land of Egypt.” Heaven and earth - they are the world; and His name, may He be blessed, is called upon them. As He is called thus - “the God of heaven and the God of the earth” (Genesis 24:3). Avraham - behold His name is called upon him. And even though His name is called upon all of the forefathers - saying, “the God of Avraham, the God of Yitzchak and the God of Yaakov” - behold that we start with Avraham; and we conclude [by] saying, “the shield of Avraham.” And this is not so with the other forefathers. For note that they said (Pesachim 117b), “They conclude with you (Avraham), and not with them (the other forefathers).” Israel - His name is called upon them, saying, “the God of Israel.” And [even] before they were created, the angels would say, “Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel, etc.” (Midrash Tanchuma, Kedoshim 2 on Psalms 41:14) Note that the name of His divinity is called upon them, but we should not elaborate about this. The Temple - His name is called upon the Temple, as it is written (I Kings 8:43), “for Your name is called upon this House.” Behold these are the five things - just like He, may He be blessed, is the God of the world, so does He use these things [completely]. That is why they are called possessions. And likewise in the Sifrei (Sifrei Devarim 309:5-6 on Deuteronomy 32:6): &quot;Is He not your Father, your Owner?&quot; - Moshe said to Israel, “You are beloved: You are a possession, and you are not an inheritance.” This is one of three things that are called a possession for the Omnipresent, etc.</p>

              <p>I also believe that the expression אלו-הי הרוחות used by Moses here as an attribute for G’d is similar to Avraham referring to G’d as אלו-הי השמים והארץ, “G’d of the heaven and G’d of the earth” (Genesis 24,3). In Moses’ instance there is the additional allusion to G’d governing all four directions on earth. We also find this elsewhere though it is expressed as אני ה' בקרב הארץ “I am the Lord in the midst of the (whole) globe” (Exodus 8,18). G’d is similar to a king who, though resident in the center of the country, exercises his dominion over the far corners of his country. Seeing that the patriarchs described G’d’s kingdom as extending “vertically,” starting from heaven above and including earth below, Moses preferred to describe His dominion as extending “horizontally,” i.e. in all directions, East to West and North to South. In this manner he completed the praise of G’d seeing that now G’d had been acknowledged as extending His supervisory powers to all six extremities of the universe.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויחל נח איש האדמה, we had already pointed out in 5,29 that Noach was a farmer and excelled in this vocation. Now, after the deluge, he acquired additional expertise in combining different strains of grapes and making wine out of the grapes. Up until this time people had used grapes only as a fruit to eat, and had not learned how to make intoxicating wine. When the Torah writes ויחל ויטע, this means that he began by planting grapes and ended by making wine. The expression ויחל is usually associated with the first stage תחלה, in a process requiring several stages. Alternately, the word ויחל is used in the same sense as in Samuel I 14,35 החל לבנות מזבח, “it was the first altar which he (Saul) established” Or, the meaning of the word ויחל may be similar to Joshua 3,7 אחל גדלך, “I will establish your greatness.” and similar to Genesis 10,8 הוא החל להיות גבור, “he was the first to become a hero, a warrior.” Or, the word simply means “he began with this work of farming, as part of which he planted a vineyard.” The line may simply mean that Noach began to plant a vineyard, [in which case we gain the impression that this was his major concern at this time. Ed.] What leads to all these explanations is the repetition of two verbs in close succession ויחל ...ויטע, without the Torah telling us what Noach had done. We have such a construction in Genesis  28,10 ויצא יעקב מבאר שבע וילך חרנה, “Yaakov left Beer Shevah heading towards Charan,” where we are also forced to understand the second verb וילך as meaning ללכת, to go. This story has to be understood as portraying two separate subjects. First we have to remember that Canaan, Cham’s son and his offspring were a cursed tribe, cursed by Noach, that is. We observe throughout the Book of Genesis how careful our ancestors were not to intermarry with members of such a cursed part of mankind. Avraham not only went out of his way to forbid Eliezer to take a wife from such people for his son Yitzchok (Genesis 24,3) but Yitzchok and Rivkah both warned Yaakov against such liaisons (Genesis 28,1). The Torah introduces a story showing how Canaan was even worse than his father Cham, so that the Torah makes a point of calling Cham “the father of Canaan,” [although he was the youngest of his four sons. (10,6) G’d had foreseen already that the offspring of Canaan would be totally corrupt, depraved. This is why He had encouraged Noach to curse his own grandson. (compare our comment on verse 8 on the wording of G’d’s address to Noach) Seeing that Noach was a prophet, his curse came true. Another aspect of this story is to warn anyone drinking wine not to overindulge, as this will impair the functioning of his brain, that which separates him from the animals. Solomon in Proverbs 23,2 is extremely critical of people who drink to excess. Also the prophets, (Isaiah 5,22; 28,1, and Amos 6,6) are very outspoken about the detrimental effects of drinking too much intoxicating wine. If the first human being ever to drink wine, i.e. Noach, became so drunk that he was unaware that he had disrobed himself, this serves as a warning to all of his descendants to be very careful in the manner in which the treat such intoxicating drink.

              <p>IF A MAN ‘YIDOR NEDER’ (VOWETH A VOW). “[This means if] a person says: ‘May there be konam (The word konam is a substitute for korban (offering), and is used for a vow of abstinence, meaning, “May this object be forbidden to me in the same way as it is forbidden to have any benefit from a holy offering.”)  upon me that I shall not eat, or that I shall not do such-and-such a thing.’ I might think that even [if he vowed] that he would eat n’veilah (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.)  [which is forbidden by the Torah to be eaten] I apply to him [the verse], he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. (Verse 3.)  Scripture therefore says, to bind his soul with a bond, (Verse 3.)  which means [that he has the power] to forbid [upon himself] that which was [hitherto] permitted to him, but not to allow himself to do that which is forbidden [by means of vowing to do it].” This is Rashi’s language. But the text of the Sifre (Sifre, Matoth 153.)  is not so. Instead the Rabbis taught there [the following explanation] of [the expression] to bind his soul with a bond: (Verse 3.)  “I might think that even if ‘he swore’ (The words “he swore” show clearly that the Sifre is speaking about an oath, while Rashi applied it to a vow.)  to eat n’veiloth and treifoth, (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.)  abominable things and reptiles, I apply to him [the verse], he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. (Verse 3.)  Scripture therefore says, to bind his soul with a bond, (Verse 3.)  which means [that he has the power] to forbid [upon himself] that which was [hitherto] permitted to him, but not to bind himself to do that which is forbidden [by means of vowing to do that which is prohibited by the Torah].” Thus the Rabbis [in the Sifre] mentioned this matter in connection with shevuoth (oaths), and the Rabbi [Rashi] changed it to apply to nedarim (vows). (The language of the verse before us is as follows: If a man ‘voweth a vow’ unto the Eternal, or ‘sweareth an oath’ to bind his soul with a bond. Ramban’s intent is to point out that Rashi, who made his comment on the phrase if a man voweth a vow, and speaks of konam [a term used only in vows], is diverging from the Sifre who gives this explanation on the phrase or sweareth an oath. Since, as will be explained further on, there are important legal differences between vows and oaths, Rashi’s application of the Sifre to the case of a vow [instead of to an oath] is thus incorrect.)  And in my opinion he was not mindful [about this], (In my “Kuntros on Variant Readings in Rashi according to the first print, Reggio 1475,” p. 27 (printed in Berliner’s Rashi, Feldheim, Jerusalem, 5730) I have shown that on the basis of a minor emendation in the text of Rashi [as found in the Reggio edition], Ramban’s criticism of Rashi disappears.)  for the Rabbis have said (Nedarim 2b.)  that in the case of vows one makes the [actual] object [referred to in the vow] forbidden to oneself [as when one says: “May this bread be konam (The word konam is a substitute for korban (offering), and is used for a vow of abstinence, meaning, “May this object be forbidden to me in the same way as it is forbidden to have any benefit from a holy offering.”)  upon me”], and therefore [vows] do not take effect upon non-tangible matters, (Ibid., 13b.)  such as when one says, “A vow be upon me that I shall not speak to you, or that I shall not walk, or that I shall not sleep,” and similar expressions [affecting non-tangible matters]. Now this being so, it would appear that even in the case of a permitted object, if one said: “A vow be upon me that I shall eat today,” or “that I shall eat this loaf,” it is not a [valid] vow since this vow does not have any object at all on which to take effect, but [was expressed in such a way as to impose] a duty upon him [personally] to do it. (In other words, there is no question as to when a person “vows” to eat n’veilah [which is forbidden] that it is invalid, but even if he “vowed” to eat a permissible thing it is also invalid, since we do not find anywhere in the Gemara vows about matters which require one “to get up and do,” but only matters which require one to abstain from certain things. On the other hand, in the case of an “oath,” as where one says “I swear to eat this loaf,” the oath would indeed be valid. Since Rashi applied it to “vows,” it is therefore incorrect, as explained above. — The reason for this distinction between oaths and vows is as follows: An oath takes effect upon the person himself. Hence if he says, “I swear to eat the loaf,” he is obliged to do so. But a vow takes effect upon the object. Hence if he says, “This bread is ‘konam’ to me,” it is a valid vow and he may not eat it. But if he were to say, “A vow be upon me that I shall eat this loaf,” it would be invalid, since it is a contradiction in terms [the statement begins with a reference to a vow, but concludes with — “I shall eat …” — which is appropriate only for an oath].)  And we do not find mentioned anywhere in the Gemara vows about [matters which require one] to “get up and do” [a particular action, but only about matters which require one to abstain from certain things, such as when he says, “May this loaf be konam upon me,” in which case he must fulfill the vow by not eating it]. And although we find in the case of vows [to G-d Who is] on high [that they are valid if uttered in the following manner]: “I undertake upon myself [to bring] a burnt-offering,” (Kinim 1:1.)  or “I undertake upon myself [to bring] a peace-offering” [which would seem to indicate that vows do take effect when expressed as an obligation resting upon a person, and not, as explained above, that they only take effect upon a specific object which itself becomes forbidden], this [vow is valid] because [there is a general principle that] dedicating something [verbally] to the Sanctuary creates an obligation on one’s property exactly as if it had been handed over to an ordinary person. (Therefore when he says, “I undertake upon myself [to bring] a burnt-offering,” it is as if he had actually separated a specific animal to be an offering. Thus his vow attaches to a definite object, and therefore it is valid.)  Or [it may be that] this is a stringency (In other words, even if we are not to resort to the preceding explanation that a verbal promise to the Sanctuary is tantamount to actual delivery of the object, we may yet explain the reason why vows to the Sanctuary are valid, because of a stringency ordained by the Rabbis based on the fact that since ultimately he will set aside a specific animal for his offering, therefore the effect of the vow takes place immediately upon his utterance thereof, and all his property becomes mortgaged to the fulfillment of the vow.)  applicable [only] to vows to the Sanctuary, because they [such vows] involve an object which becomes forbidden to an ordinary person and invested [with sanctity] for the Sanctuary when [the object is actually] set aside [as an offering]; therefore right from the start [when he merely bound himself verbally to separate an animal as an offering at some future date], the obligation created by the vow takes effect upon his property. But the case of [ordinary] vows of utterance [about a secular matter] we have no such rule, because there is no [tangible] object existing at all, neither at the beginning [i.e., at the time of uttering the vow], nor at the end [i.e., at the time that the vow is to be fulfilled]. Similarly, [the expression of the Sifre mentioned by Rashi that] he can “forbid [upon himself] that which was [hitherto] permitted to him, but cannot allow himself to do that which is forbidden [by vowing to do that which is prohibited by the Torah]” is a statement which is not correct to make in connection with vows [as Rashi did], because they do take effect on matters of [religious] commandments, just as they do on secular matters [i.e., on matters which do not come within the scope of the commandments]. Thus someone who says in the form of a vow “I will not make a Booth [for the Festival of Tabernacles]” or “I will not put on phylacteries” is indeed forbidden [to make the Booth, or to put on the phylacteries] although he thereby violates a positive commandment. (The reason for this is that since a vow takes effect upon a particular object (see Note 21), he may forbid the use of the particular Booth or of the phylacteries in the fulfillment of the commandment. But he cannot prohibit their use by means of an oath, swearing not to use them, since the oath creates a prohibition on the person, and that is invalid for him to do, since “he has already sworn on Sinai” to fulfill the commandment, and an oath does not take effect upon another oath, as will be explained.)  Similarly a man who vowed not to have [sexual] intercourse with his wife is forbidden [to have such intercourse with her] although he thereby violates a negative commandment. (Exodus 21:10: her food, her raiment, and ‘her conjugal rights’ he shall not diminish. See Vol. II, pp. 356-357, where Ramban discusses at length the nature of this prohibition.)  Similarly, vows take effect to oblige one to observe a negative commandment [although, of course, he already is bound not to transgress it], such as if he vowed not to eat n’veilah (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.)  — [so that if he does it he violates two prohibitions: against eating n’veilah, and against breaking his vow, this principle being deduced] from the words of the Mishnah: (Nedarim 17a. The Mishnah there establishes the distinction that a vow may take effect upon another vow, but one oath may not take effect upon another. From this Ramban deduces the teaching that if an object is prohibited to a person for some reason, such as n’veilah or treifah (see Note 14 above), or indeed any other prohibition, another vow — not to eat it — can still take effect upon that object doubly prohibiting the person from eating it, so that if he does eat it, he violates two prohibitions: one for having eaten n’veilah, and one for having violated his vow.)  “A vow may take effect upon a vow etc.” Thus a vow takes effect to forbid [not only that which was previously permitted, but also to forbid] that which was [already] forbidden [such as when he vows not to eat n’veilah] (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.) , and [a vow takes effect] not to do [something] which he is [commanded to do and] forbidden to transgress [such as the duty to have sexual intercourse with his wife, (Exodus 21:10: her food, her raiment, and ‘her conjugal rights’ he shall not diminish. See Vol. II, pp. 356-357, where Ramban discusses at length the nature of this prohibition.)  as mentioned above], except that vows do not take effect to allow him to actively transgress a negative commandment. (Thus if he vowed to eat the flesh of n’veilah which is prohibited by a negative commandment, the vow takes no effect whatever, so that if he does not eat it he is not punishable for having violated his word.)  But oaths are only able to render forbidden that which was [hitherto] permitted, and they do not apply at all to matters involving commandments, neither to transgress [the prohibition of] a negative commandment [even passively, such as by swearing not to have intercourse with his wife], nor to strengthen its observance [such as by swearing not to eat n’veilah], (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.)  nor to neglect [the performance of] a positive commandment, such as [by saying]: “I swear that I will not make a Booth,” or “[I swear] that I will not put on phylacteries.” Even to strengthen the performance of a positive commandment [an oath] cannot take effect, so that if a person swears to fulfill a commandment and does not fulfill it, he is not liable for [breaking his] oath either to [the punishment of] stripes [if he deliberately neglects it] or to [bring] an offering [if he neglects it accidentally]. (The punishment for breaking an oath in optional matters deliberately is the same as for transgressing any negative commandment; i.e., stripes (Deuteronomy 25:1-3), and for accidentally breaking it, there is a duty to bring an offering (Leviticus 5:4-13). But if one swears to fulfill a positive commandment [e.g. “I swear to wear phylacteries”] the oath is invalid, because “he has already sworn at Mount Sinai” [to perform all the commandments of the Torah], and an oath does not take effect upon another oath (see Note 27). Therefore if he does not fulfill the commandment, he is responsible for neglect of a positive commandment, but is not subject to stripes or an offering for failure of fulfilling the additional oath, since his oath never took effect.)  But it is permitted for a person to encourage himself [to fulfill a commandment by swearing to do so], for it is written, I have sworn, and have confirmed it, to observe Thy righteous ordinances. (Psalms 119:106. See Nedarim 8a.)  Therefore it is only with reference to swearing [and not, as implied by Rashi, to vows] that one can interpret [the expression] to bind his soul with a bond (Verse 3.)  [as the Sifre does, that he may forbid upon himself that which was hitherto permitted to him, but may not allow himself to do that which is forbidden, by means of swearing to do it]. These are great [i.e., complex and important] laws, and the scholar will find them [explained in the Talmud] in their [proper] places.</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Numbers 30:3:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>YIDOR NEDER LA’SHEM (VOWETH A VOW ‘UNTO’ THE ETERNAL). The meaning of [the expression] ‘yidor neder la’shem’ is not like that of ‘asher nish ba la’shem (how he — David — swore ‘unto’ the Eternal), (Ibid., 132:2.)  for that [expression mentioned by David] is like ‘vayishava lo’ (and he swore ‘to him’) (This is in reference either to Genesis 24:9, where Eliezer swore to Abraham to find a wife for Isaac from the country of his birthplace, or to Genesis 47:31, Joseph swearing to Jacob that he would bury him together with his fathers. In both cases the meaning of the prepositional lamed [‘lo’] is its literal meaning — “unto him,” and the intention is to say that the oath was “for his benefit.” Likewise the prepositional lamed [in the word la’shem] used by David has its literal meaning — “for ‘the benefit’ [so to say] and glory of G-d,” since the oath concerned his determination to build the House of G-d.)  which means that he swore to him for his [the recipient’s] benefit. But [the use of the prepositional lamed in the case of vows is equivalent to the use of the preposition beth (“by”) (The gist of Ramban’s reasoning is as follows: The prepositional lamed in the case of oaths [in the examples cited above] has the meaning of “to” — to the benefit of the recipient, as is the case of Eliezer where the oath was for the benefit of Abraham. This principle, however, cannot be made to apply to vows, since in our verse it says if a man vows a vow ‘la’shem,’ and the verse is not speaking exclusively about vows to the benefit of the Sanctuary but refers to vows of all sorts, even of secular matters. Hence we must say that the prepositional lamed in vows has the same meaning as the beth [not the lamed] in oaths, which in both cases means “by” — by G-d. In other words, the prepositional lamed in vows and the beth in oaths are identical in meaning. Finally, Ramban will conclude that the Cabala does offer an explanation why a different preposition is used in each case. Thus it is shown that the mystic character of the Sacred Language is deeply embedded in the text of the Torah.)  in the case of oaths, for] in the case of oaths Scripture says: ‘u’vishmo’ (and ‘by’ His Name) shalt thou swear; (Deuteronomy 6:13.)  v’ashbiacha ‘ba’shem’ (and I will make thee swear ‘by’ the Eternal); (Genesis 24:3.)  as I swore ‘lecha’ (unto thee) ‘ba’shem’ (‘by’ the Eternal), the G-d of Israel, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me; (I Kings 1:30.)  swear ‘li’ (unto me) here ‘bei’Elokim’ (‘by’ G-d). (Genesis 21:23.)  But in the case of a vow Scripture does not say: “he vows ‘ba’shem’ (‘by’ G-d)” but la’shem (‘to’ G-d). The Sages in the Sifre have already alluded to the reason for this matter [the different terminology], saying: (Sifre, Matoth 153. See Vol. I, p. 66, where Ramban quotes this Sifre.)  “What is the difference between vows and oaths? Vows are like vowing (This is the text in the Sifre and in Ramban here. In Genesis, however, Ramban has “swearing” (Vol. I, p. 66). The intent of the texts in both places is equivalent.)  ‘by the life of the King;’ oaths are like swearing ‘by the King Himself.’ Although there is no [clear] proof for this explanation [in Scripture], there is an allusion to it: By the living G-d, and by the life of your soul. I will not leave thee.” (II Kings 4:30. See Vol. I, p. 66, Note 290 where this text is explained in detail.)  And the secret thereof is that the shevuah (oath) is derived from the word shivah [“seven” — alluding to the seven Emanations], for she [wisdom] hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars, (Proverbs 9:1.)  whereas the vow is on [the level of] understanding, the beginning of His way, the first of His works of old. (Ibid., 8:22.)  Thus you find that vows take precedence over the Torah, and therefore they apply to commandments just as to optional matters [as explained above]. Thus all vows are la’shem (“to” the Eternal), whereas all who swear [do so] “by” Him.</p>

                <h4>Tur HaArokh, Genesis 12:1:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>אל הארץ אשר אראך, “to the land which I will show you.” It is an additional hardship to be ordered to undertake a journey the destination of which has not been revealed beforehand. Avraham considered all this as easy, as he was anxious to fulfill G’d’s request out of a feeling of love for Him. Rashi queries that this commandment was not new, seeing that Avraham had already left his homeland a number of years ago when he went to Charan with his father? He therefore explains that we must understand what G’d is reported to have said here to Avraham to make an even more drastic break with his past by leaving his father’s house.
    Ibn Ezra views the basic commandment as having been formulated by G’d already when G’d said to him לך לך מארצך as well as ממולדך ומבית אביך, at a time when he was still in Ur Casdim. G’d had known that Terach, Avraham’s father, would not go beyond Charan. In fact, Terach died 60 years after Avraham had continued his journey to the land of Canaan.
    Nachmanides disagrees, writing that if correct, the paragraph describing the move from Ur Casdim should have portrayed Avraham as the principal, instead of describing Terach as having taken the other family members with him. (11,31) Clearly, at that time Avraham followed his father’s instructions, not G’d’s. No mention had been made of G’d having communicated with Avraham as yet. Furthermore, in the verse from Joshua 24,3 G’d is quoted as having said: “I have taken your father (Avraham) from beyond the river Euphrates.” If Ibn Ezra were correct, Joshua should have quoted: “I have taken your father from Ur Casdim, etc.” Still another proof that Ibn Ezra is not correct can be found in the instructions Avraham issued to his trusted servant Eliezer when he sent him to get a wife for Yitzchok. In Genesis 24,3 Avraham instructs Eliezer to take a wife for Yitzchok from ארצי ומולדתי, “my homeland and the place where I was born.” Eliezer proceeded to travel to Aram Naharyim, not to Ur Casdim in order to discharge his master’s mission. Ibn Ezra is wrong when he interprets the words in that verse as meaning ארצי=חרן and מולדתי as Ur Casdim. How could he say here that this directive was given to Avraham while he was still in Ur Casdim? Avraham had a number of countries that he called “his country” at different times, though he had only one birthplace and one father’s house. The fact is that Charan was both his homeland, his birthplace, and the location of his father’s house.

Dies die allgemeine Anforderung an den Charakter. Es können aber zwei ganz vortreffliche Menschen sein und passen doch in ihrer Individualität nicht zu einander, daher ferner: ליצחק, daß sie auch zu Jizchaks Individualität passe. Wenn Abraham die kanaanitischen Töchter verwarf und eine Tochter aus Aram für seinen Sohn wünschte, so ist wohl zu bedenken, daß sie auch in Aram Götzendiener waren. Nicht darum Kanaans Götzentum, sondern nur die kanaanitische sittliche Entartung konnte das Motiv gewesen sein. Götzentum ist zunächst eine Verirrung des Verstandes, die zu heilen ist. Allein sittliche Entartung ergreift das ganze Menschenwesen in der ganzen seelischen Tiefe des Gemütes, und dort konnte selbst ein Abraham nicht hoffen, ein keusches, sittenreines, unschuldiges Weib für seinen Sohn zu finden, das den Adel der Gesinnung und der Sitte als Perle mit ins Haus bringen würde.</p>

              <p>“Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his household, who was in charge of everything that was his: Please, place your hand under my thigh” (Genesis 24:2).  “Abraham said to his servant, the elder [zekan] of his household” – as the appearance of his face [ziv ikonin] was similar to his.  “Who was in charge of everything that was his” – [this means] that he had full control over his evil inclination, just as he [Abraham] did.  “Please, place your hand under my thigh” (Near the place of circumcision.)  – because it [the precept of circumcision] was given to them through pain, that is why it was beloved by them, and they would take an oath only by that.  “I will administer an oath to you by the Lord, God of the heavens and God of the earth, that you not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose midst I live” (Genesis 24:3).  “I will administer an oath to you by the Lord, God of the heavens [and God of the earth].” Rabbi Pinḥas said: Before I informed His creations about His existence, He was [called only] “God of the heavens”; (And this is why God is referred to only by this description in verse 7, where Abraham was referring to the time before he came to the Land of Canaan.)  but after I informed His creations about Him he is [called also] “God of the earth.”  “That you not take” – he cautioned him that he should not go to [seek as a bride] the daughters of Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre.  “Rather, you shall go to my land and to my birthplace, and take a wife for my son, for Isaac” (Genesis 24:4).  “Rather, you shall go to my land and to my birthplace” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Even if the wheat kernels in your city are darnel, (An inferior species of wheat.)  sow with them. (Although the members of Abraham’s family were not known for their righteousness, he had to make do with whatever was available to him.) </p>

              <p>You know this to be so from the fact that Abraham sought a wife for his son Isaac: And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his household, etc. (Gen. 24:2), and it is written also: I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven … that thou shalt go unto my country (ibid., vv. 3–4). Hence, it is apparent that Abraham was concerned with the observance of the law of Increase and multiply. Similarly, Isaac told Jacob: Arise! Go to Padan-aram (Gen. 28:2), to seek a wife proper for him. He did not wish him to be like the men of the generation of the flood, who wallowed in unchastity and indulged in sexual intercourse with species other than their own. Observe what is written concerning them: The sons of God saw the daughters of men … and took them wives, whomsoever they chose (Gen. 6:2). That was the reason they were obliterated from the earth.</p>

              <p>And after the death of Abimelech the people of Gerar took his son Benmelech, who was then ‎only twelve years of age, and they made him king in his father's place; and they called his ‎name Abimelech after his father, for such was their way of doing in Gerar. And Abimelech ‎ruled in the place of his father and he sat upon his throne. And Lot the son of Haran died also ‎in these days, in the thirty-ninth year of Isaac's life; and all the days that Lot lived were one ‎hundred and forty years when he died. And these are the sons of Lot, born unto him by his ‎daughters. The name of the first-born was Moab and the name of the second was Benamy. ‎And the two sons of Lot took unto themselves wives from the land of Canaan, and they bare ‎unto them children. And these were the children of Moab: Ed, and Majon, and Tarsus, and ‎Canvil, four sons, and they are the fathers of the children of Moab even unto this day. And all ‎the families of the children of Lot went forth to dwell wherever they should find a suitable ‎place, for they were very fruitful and they increased greatly. And they went out and built cities ‎unto themselves in the land of their habitation, calling the names of the cities which they built ‎after their own names. And Nahor son of Terah, Abraham's brother, died in those days, in the ‎fortieth year of the life of Isaac; and all the days of Nahor were one hundred and seventy-two ‎years, and when he died he was buried in Haran. And when Abraham heard of his brother's ‎death he was full of grief and sorrow and he mourned over him many days. And Abraham ‎called Eliezer, his head-servant, to give him orders concerning his house, and he came and ‎stood before him, and Abraham said unto him: Behold I am old, I do not know the day I may ‎die, for verily I am advanced in years. And now arise and go forth and do not take a wife for my ‎son from this place, nor from this land, from the midst of the daughters of the Canaanites ‎among whom we are dwelling. But go thou to my land and to my native place and take from ‎there a wife for my son. And the Lord God of heaven and earth who hath taken me from the ‎house of my father and brought me to this place; and who hath said unto me: To thy seed I will ‎give this land for an inheritance forever, he will send his angel before thee and give thee ‎success on thy way that thou mayest procure a wife for my son from my family and from the ‎house of my father. And the servant answered unto Abraham his master saying: Behold I will ‎go to thy birth-place and to thy father's house to take a wife for thy son from there. But per ‎adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me into this land; must I need bring thy son ‎again unto the land whence thou camest? </p>

            <summary>Abraham instructed Eliezer to find a wife for Isaac from the city of his birthplace, not necessarily from his family, as evident in the story of Rebecca. Moshe's exile to Midian was to a completely foreign place, unlike Ya'akov's exile, which was not completely foreign, allowing him to create bonds with his foreign wives. Ramban clarifies that Abraham was commanded to leave his country, birthplace, and father's house, which was Mesopotamia, not Ur of the Chaldees, as interpreted by Ibn Ezra. Abraham's journey to Canaan was based on his belief that it was the land of the Divine promise, where he eventually settled.</summary>

              <p>But rather go to my land and to my birthplace: And it is likely that Abraham did not say that he should go to [Abraham's] family, but just to the city in which he was born. And he should take a wife from there [for Issac], even if she is not from his family, as long as she is from that city. And hence he said that the maiden in whom he will see generosity to toil and water his camels is fit to get married to the son of Abraham. And it would certainly find favor in the eyes of the maiden and her father to marry into [the family of] Abraham. So there was no divination. It was only because Eliezer wanted to substantiate it for [Rebecca's family], that it was a certain decree and providence, [that] he said that Abraham commanded him to take [a wife] from his family and from the house of his father... And hence he also changed this, [to say] that he did not give her the bracelets until he asked, &quot;Whose daughter are you?&quot; As since, according to his words [here], the command from Abraham was only about his family, who would know if she was from his family [without asking her]? But in truth, Abraham only commanded him about the city in which he was born. And hence he gave [the bracelets] before he asked, &quot;Whose daughter are you?&quot; As whoever she was, she should marry the son of Abraham... And according to this, he did not divine what he said to them, to divine that she was from Abraham's family - like he had said before this, that he was also commanded about this by Abraham...</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 12:1:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>OUT OF THY COUNTRY, AND FROM THY BIRTHPLACE. Rashi wrote, (In Verse 2 here.)  “But had he not already departed from there together with his father and reached as far as Haran? (Above, 11:31.)  But thus, in effect, did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to him, ‘Go still further away from thy father’s house.’”And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained the verse as follows: “And G-d had already said to Abram, ‘Get thee out of thy country,’ since this command came to him when he was still in Ur of the Chaldees, and there He commanded him to leave his country, his birthplace and his father’s house, in which he was.”But this is not correct, for if so, it would follow that Abram was the central figure in the journey from his father’s house by command of G-d, while Terah his father voluntarily went with him. Yet Scripture says, And Terah took Abram his son, (Above, 11:31.)  which teaches us that Abram followed his father and that it was by his counsel that Abram went forth from Ur of the Chaldees to go to the land of Canaan! Furthermore, [according to Ibn Ezra, who says that the above command came to Abram when he was still in Ur of the Chaldees], the verse stating, And I took your father Abraham from beyond the river and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, (Joshua 24:3.)  should have stated, “And I took your father from Ur of the Chaldees and led him throughout all the land of Canaan,” for it was from there that he was taken, and it was there that he was given this command. In addition, the following difficulty may be put to Rashi and Ibn Ezra: when Abraham commanded Eliezer to get a wife for his son, he said to him, ‘But thou shalt go unto my country and to my birthplace,’ (Genesis 24:4. The word moladeti, generally translated “my kindred,” connotes, according to Ramban, both “my birthplace” and “my family.” This is made clear further on in the text.)  and he went to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor. (Ibid., Verse 10. Aram-naharaim is Mesopotamia. See Ramban above, 11:28.)  If so, that is his “country” and his “birthplace!” And there, Scripture further says [when Eliezer recounts Abraham’s charge to him], But thou shalt go unto my father’s house and to my family, (Ibid., Verse 38.)  thus clearly indicating that there (in Mesopotamia) were his father’s house and his family which is “his kindred.” This is not as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra erred in interpreting, “Unto my country, (Genesis 24:4. The word moladeti, generally translated “my kindred,” connotes, according to Ramban, both “my birthplace” and “my family.” This is made clear further on in the text.)  Haran; and to my birthplace, Ur of the Chaldees.” Now since Ibn Ezra says here that in Ur of the Chaldees it was said to Abraham, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, Abraham would thus have many countries! (Ramban points out the following contradiction in Ibn Ezra’s interpretation: Here in our verse he says that the command was given to Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees. Accordingly, Ur of the Chaldees is Abraham’s “country” for the verse says, from thy country. And further (Chapter 24, Verse 4) Ibn Ezra interprets my country as meaning “Haran,” which is Mesopotamia! Thus Ibn Ezra has “many countries” assigned to Abraham.)  But the essential principle you already know from what we have written in the preceding Seder, (Above, 11:28.)  namely, that Haran is Abraham’s country, and there is his birthplace, it having always been his father’s country, and there Abraham was commanded to leave them. In Bereshith Rabbah, (39:8. The Rabbis here interpret the double expression of the verse as signifying two departures which Abraham is to make: one from Mesopotamia generally, and one from his city in particular.)  the Rabbis similarly say “Lech lecha: one departure from Aram-naharaim, and one from Aram-nahor.”The reason for mentioning out of thy country, and from thy birthplace, and from thy father’s house is that it is difficult for a person to leave the country wherein he dwells, where he has his friends and companions. This is true all the more if this be his native land, and all the more if his whole family is there. Hence it became necessary to say to Abraham that he leave all for the sake of his love of the Holy One, blessed be He.UNTO THE LAND THAT I WILL SHOW THEE. He wandered and went about from nation to nation, from kingdom to another people, (Psalms 105:13.)  until he came to the land of Canaan, where He said to him, Unto thy seed will I give this land. (Verse 7 here.)  Then the promise, Unto the land that I will show thee, was fulfilled, and Abraham tarried and settled there. The verse which states, And they went forth to go into the land of Canaan, (Verse 5.)  means that he was not heading for Canaan for the purpose of settling there since he did not as yet know that he had been commanded concerning this land. Rather, the righteous one (Abraham.)  set his goal towards the land of Canaan for that was his intention as well as that of his father when they originally set forth from Ur of the Chaldees. This is the reason why Abraham later said, And it came to pass, when G-d caused me to wander from my father’s house: (Further, 20:13.)  he was indeed gone astray like a lost sheep. (Psalms 119:176.) It is possible to say that Abraham knew from the first that the land of Canaan was “the inheritance of the Eternal,” destined that His special Providence be bestowed upon it, and he believed that the Divine promise, Unto the land that I will show thee, alluded to the land of Canaan either in its entirety or to one of all those lands [which together comprise Canaan]. He set his direction towards the land of Canaan generally for [he was certain that] there was the land which He would indeed show him.</p>

              <p>Be that as it may, Moshe’s loneliness is not exactly the same as Ya’akov’s. Since Ya’akov had certain advantages in this regard, he is able to create bonds with his foreign wives that Moshe is not. One such advantage is that he is able to marry his cousins, even if he didn’t know them until he moved out of his home. Moreover, his exile was to a land that his grandfather Avraham could still refer to as “his land and his birthplace” (Bereshit 24:4; Bereshit 24: 7). (Bereshit 24:4, 7.)  Granted, it is neither Ya’akov’s land nor his birthplace, but neither was it completely foreign. In contrast, when Moshe goes to Midian, it is to an altogether foreign place and foreign family. Yet even after taking all these differences into account, Moshe’s highly unusual relationship with his wife and children needs further analysis.</p>

        <summary>Eliezer is concerned about finding a wife for Isaac who is willing to return with him to Canaan, with Abraham instructing him to find a wife from his own relatives if necessary. After prophecy ceased, even sages cannot change a commandment. In Bereshit Rabbah, Eliezer contemplates exploiting Isaac's status, but Abraham rejects the idea. Different interpretations of Moses' question about bringing water from the rock are given by Ramban, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, and Rashi. The Targum mentions Eliezer asking if the woman would return with him to the land, suggesting bringing Isaac back if she refused.</summary>

            <summary>Eliezer expresses concern about finding a woman willing to marry Isaac and return with him to Canaan, seeking clarification on what to do if she refuses. The use of the term &quot;return&quot; by Eliezer is explained as referring to Abraham's previous departure from Aram Naharayim, not Isaac's presence there. Abraham instructs Eliezer to find a wife for Isaac from his own relatives if the chosen woman does not agree to come to Canaan. The servant's question is justified as Isaac had never left Canaan, similar to Ruth &quot;returning&quot; to Israel with Naomi despite Ruth never having been there.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>ARE WE TO BRING YOU FORTH WATER OUT OF THIS ROCK? Far be it and [G-d] forbid that [we should explain this] as a question indicating impossibility! For Moses our teacher, who was trusted in all G-d’s house, (See above, 12:7.)  [knew] that nothing is too hard for Him; (See Genesis 18:14.)  and he together with all Israel had seen greater and more wondrous miracles than this, and especially since this [miracle of providing water from a rock] had already been done once before through him at the rock in Horeb! (Exodus 17:6.)  Now the commentators (R’dak on I Samuel 2:27.)  have said that there are certain questions which [by apparently doubting that which cannot be denied], have the force of an [impassioned or indignant] affirmation. Thus we find: Did I reveal Myself to the house of thy father?; (Ibid. The sense is: “Did I not reveal Myself, although your sons, by their actions appear to belie it!”)  The king said also unto Zadok the priest: ‘Seest thou?’; (II Samuel 15:27. The sense here is: “Do you not see [that it is best that you return to the city in peace]!”)  Wilt thou judge?; (Ezekiel 22:2. The meaning is: “Wilt thou not judge? Of course you will judge!”)  Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? (Genesis 3:11. The meaning is: “Have you not eaten? Of course you have eaten!”)  But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote [that the meaning of the verse is]: “Do we indeed have power to bring you forth water out of the rock?” He means thereby to explain that Moses said to them: “Hear now, ye rebels against G-d, who say, ‘and why have ye brought the assembly of the Eternal (Above, Verse 4.)  unto this evil place?’ (Ibid., Verse 5.)  Do we have the power by natural means to bring you forth water out of this flint? You should therefore recognize that this is all from G-d, for it is He Who took you out of Egypt, and brought you to this place, and it is He Who will feed you here.” This is similar to what he [Moses] told the people in the case of the manna, and ye shall know that the Eternal hath brought you out from the land of Egypt. (Exodus 16:6.)  In my opinion this letter hei [in the word hamin — “out of”] indicates a [real] query, [and the meaning thereof is as follows]: “Are we to bring you forth water out of this rock or not?” For sometimes Scripture explains a question in its positive and negative aspects, such as: whether there are trees therein or not?’ (Above, 13:20.)  whether thou wouldest keep His commandments, or not? (Deuteronomy 8:2.)  — and at other times it mentions only the positive aspect, [such as in the following verses]: Is this your youngest brother?; (Genssis 43:29.)  Know ye Laban the son of Nachor?; (Ibid., 29:5.)  Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself? (Zechariah 7:3. The reference is to the month of Ab, during which the First Temple was destroyed. When the Second Temple was built, the people asked the prophet whether they should still continue to observe the fast of the ninth of Ab.)  But this question here that Moses asked of them was a probing question [to test their true intention]. He said to them: “Hear now, ye rebels. — What do ye devise against the Eternal? (Nahum 1:9.)  — Are we to bring you forth water out of this strong rock? Will this event happen or not?” [i.e., “Do you believe that it is within His power to do it, or not?”] He thus stressed that their [behaviour was a serious] rebellion, telling them they were wanting in faith, and that the reason for their quarrelling with him was because they thought that G-d would not act wondrously for them, in a similar manner to that which it says, And they tried G-d in their heart … ‘Can G-d prepare a table in the wilderness … Can He give bread also?’ (Psalms 78:18-20.)  Similarly the Rabbis have said: (Aboth 5:4.)  “Ten times our ancestors in the wilderness tried the Holy One, blessed be He.” [Moses’ question was thus] like a query as to the belief of the person addressed, [of which we find examples] in many places in Scripture: Must I then bring thy son back? (Genesis 24:5.)  which means: “Is that your wish?” Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? (II Chronicles 18:5.)  which means, “If that is your advice.” Here too, [the meaning of Moses’ question is]: “Do you think that we shall bring you forth water out of this rock?” The same is also my opinion with regard to [the following verses]: Did I reveal Myself?; (Ibid. The sense is: “Did I not reveal Myself, although your sons, by their actions appear to belie it!”)  Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before Me? (I Kings 21:29.)  Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?; (Genesis 3:11. The meaning is: “Have you not eaten? Of course you have eaten!”)  Wilt thou judge? (Ezekiel 22:2. The meaning is: “Wilt thou not judge? Of course you will judge!”)  For all these are questions, but their purpose is to ask about [the truth of] something well-known, so that the person who is asked is compelled to admit [the truth of the fact] against his will. Thus [Did I reveal Myself? (Ibid. The sense is: “Did I not reveal Myself, although your sons, by their actions appear to belie it!”)  means]: “Have I revealed Myself to your father’s house and chosen you? Since you know this, then Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering?” (I Samuel 2:29.)  Do ye thus requite the Eternal (Deuteronomy 32:6.)  with such a requital! Similarly, “Hast thou eaten of the tree, about which I commanded you (Genesis 3:11. The meaning is: “Have you not eaten? Of course you have eaten!”)  [not to eat], and you are ashamed [and therefore you hid yourself], (See Genesis 3:8.)  or [if you did not eat of the tree], why then did you hide?” And in the same way the other [verses are to be explained]. However, the expression Seest thou? (II Samuel 15:27. The sense here is: “Do you not see [that it is best that you return to the city in peace]!”)  is a genuine inquiry about a matter [as to which the questioner is] in doubt, [David saying to Zadok the priest]: “If you ‘advise’ it, then return to the city,” [and the usage of the term ‘seest’ thou? means “do you see fit?”] as in the expression: “I see the words of Admon” (Kethuboth 109a.)  [which means: “I find the opinion of Admon correct”]. I have already explained this in Seder Bereshith. (Genesis 1:4 (Vol. I, p. 30).) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>לו ישטמנו means PERHAPS HE WILL HATE US. The word has many different meanings. There are examples of לו used to denote a petition, having the meaning of “Oh that!” as for instance: (Genesis 30:34) “Would (לו) it might be according to thy word”; (Genesis 23:13) “Oh that thou wouldst (לו) only hear me”; (Joshua 7:7) “Would that (לו) we had been content”; (Numbers 14:2) “Would that (לו) we had died”. ,There are examples of לו used in the sense of “if” and “אולי” as, (Deuteronomy 32:29) “If (לו) they were wise [they would understand this]”; (Isaiah 48:18) “If (לוא) thou wouldst hearken to my commandments, [then would thy peace be as a river]”; (2 Samuel 18:12) “If (לו) I would receive [a thousand pieces of silver] in my hands, [yet would I not put forth my hand etc.]”. There is an example of לו used in the sense of “perhaps”, — in our verse — “Perhaps he will hate us”, but there is no other example of its usage in this sense in Scripture. Here it corresponds in sense with the word אולי, “perhaps”, as for example in (Genesis 24:5) “אולי the woman will not be willing to follow me” which means “perhaps she will not etc.” As a matter of fact אולי has all the meanings of לו, for there are examples of אולי denoting a petition as for instance (2 Samuel 16:12) “Perhaps (אולי) the Lord will look upon mine eye”, (where the context shows that this involves a kind of petition that God should do this); (Joshua 14:12) “Perhaps (אולי) the Lord will be with me [and I shall drive them out]”, (involving also a petition that God should do this), where אולי has a similar meaning to לו in (Genesis 30:34) “Would (לו) it might be according to thy word”. Then again the word אולי has the meaning of “if”; for example, (Genesis 18:24) “Perhaps (אולי) there are fifty righteous [wilt Thou destroy etc.]” (which is equivalent to “if there are fifty… wilt thou destroy?”.)</p>

            <summary>Avraham's love for people allowed him to leave the Holy Land, while Yitzchok's reverence for God prevented him from doing so. It is permissible to fear God, but not to fear anyone else. Torah scholars, as extensions of God, deserve reverence. Love allows for admiration of those smaller than oneself, while reverence is reserved for those greater. This explains Shimon ben Amassuni's interpretation of the word &quot;et&quot; in the Torah and Rabbi Akiva's resolution of the issue.

              </summary>
              <p>Genesis ‎24,7. “do not bring my son back there under any ‎circumstances.!” We find that G’d confirmed Avraham’s ‎attittude concerning Yitzchok not leaving the soil of The Holy ‎Land, when He said to Yitzchok (Genesis 26,2) ‎אל תרד מצרימה, שכון ‏בארץ..גור בארץ הזאת‎, “do not go down to Egypt; reside in the ‎Land…even if you have to be a transient in this land!” We ‎have a standing rule according to which it is permissible to be ‎afraid of something or someone bigger than oneself, whereas it is ‎forbidden to be afraid of someone smaller than oneself. In other ‎words, whereas it is permissible to be afraid of G’d, it is not ‎permissible to be afraid of anyone other than G’d. This is why all ‎manner of idol worship is prohibited.‎ The attribute of love enables one to love those who are ‎‎“smaller” than we are, notably the members of our household ‎who depend on us. When we keep this rule in mind we will be ‎able to understand a story in the Talmud Kiddushin 57 ‎where it is related that Shimon ben Ammasuni undertook to ‎explain the meaning of each word ‎את‎ in the Torah, proving that ‎the word invariably includes something that the Torah had not ‎spelled out specifically. However, when he came to the line ‎‎(Deuteronomy 6,13) ‎את ה' אלוקיך תירא‎, “you are to revere the Lord ‎your G’d,” he was stymied, not knowing what the word ‎את‎ in that ‎line could possibly add, as it is forbidden to revere anyone other ‎than the Lord. His students asked him if he thought that all the ‎explanations that he had found for the other times that the word ‎את‎ occurs should be disregarded? He replied that “just as the ‎Torah promises a reward for explaining its intricacies, so it ‎rewards those who refrain from offering explanations that are not ‎appropriate.” In the meantime, Rabbi Akiva who had heard of ‎Shimon ben Ammasuni’s dilemma, said that even this ‎את‎ added ‎an additional meaning to the verse in which it appeared, ‎suggesting that the Torah scholars deserve to be revered also. ‎Rabbi Akiva was able to offer this explanation since Torah ‎scholars are “greater” than the ordinary people consulting them, ‎so that they fit the principle that it is allowed to revere, be in awe ‎of, people that are greater than oneself. This is a basic difference ‎between the attribute of reverence, ‎יראה‎, and the attribute of ‎אהבה‎, love. While it is in order to say: “I am afraid of you,” to ‎someone more powerful than oneself, a king for instance, it is not ‎in order to say to such a king: “I love you.” It is, however, ‎permissible to say to such a king: “I love to be in your house,” “I ‎love to serve you,” etc. The above distinction explains why Shimon ben Amassuni ‎had not found a problem with the word ‎את‎ in Deuteronomy 6,5 ‎where the Torah writes: ‎ואהבת את ה' אלוקיך‎, “you shall love the ‎Lord your G’d.” He understood this verse as not applying to G’d’s ‎essence, but to attributes of G’d, attributes worth emulating ‎because they make Him lovable. This is also why Rabbi Akiva was ‎able to resolve his difficulty when he suggested that reverence for ‎Torah scholars, who are an extension of G’d from Whom they ‎received their knowledge and stature, therefore qualify for a ‎portion of reverence that is due to their Master. Seeing that the ‎Torah scholar is a servant of G’d, he too is entitled to some of his ‎Master’s reflected glory.‎ Avraham’s major attribute was ‎אהבה‎, his love for people. This ‎attribute included even in their concerns with matters that did ‎not involve their relations to the Creator. This being so, G’d did ‎not object to his descending to Egypt, leaving the soil of the Holy ‎Land. His son Yitzchok’s primary attribute was ‎יראה‎, reverence ‎for the Essence of G’d; i.e. he concentrated all his faculties on how ‎to serve G’d. This being so, it would have interfered with his basic ‎character were he to leave the sacred soil of the land of Israel for ‎even a short period.‎</p>

              <p>[BEWARE.] When the word hishamer (beware) is penultimately accented it is related to the word shemirah (watching, guarding). (Thus when hishamer is penultimately accented it means be on guard, beware. This is the usual meaning of hishamer in Scripture. Cf. Deut. 8:11.)  However, when it is ultimately accented it is related to the word shemarim (lees). (In this case it means keep calm. Krinsky points out that Is. 7:4 is the only place in Scripture where hishamer is accented on the last syllable.)  Compare, hishamer (keep calm) in Keep calm (hishamer), and be quiet (Is. 7:4), which has the same basic meaning as shemarav (his lees) in And he hath settled on his lees (shemarav) (Jer. 48:11).</p>

            <summary>Abraham warns Eliezer not to return Isaac to his father's house or birthplace, as God had taken him from there and promised the land to his descendants. Rabbi Dosa suggests that a particular angel, possibly Metatron, was sent to help with the task. Two angels were designated to assist in finding Rebecca and accompanying Eliezer. If the woman did not wish to follow, Eliezer would be absolved from his oath, but only Isaac, not his grandson Jacob, would not return to Abraham's birthplace.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>“Abraham said to him: Beware lest you return my son there” (Genesis 24:6).  “The Lord, God of the heavens, who took me from my father's house, and from my birthplace, and who spoke to me, and who took an oath to me, saying: To your descendants I will give this land; He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there” (Genesis 24:7).  “Abraham said to him: Beware…the Lord, God of the heavens, who took me from my father’s house” – this refers to his father’s house. “And from my birthplace” – this refers to his neighborhood. “And who took an oath to me” – in Ḥaran. “And who spoke to me” – [at the covenant] between the pieces. (See Genesis 15:1–21.)  “He will send his angel before you” – Rabbi Dosa said: This refers to a particular angel. (Some say this refers to the archangel Metatron.)  At the moment that Abraham our patriarch said: “He will send his angel before you,” the Holy One blessed be He designated two angels for him; one to bring out Rebecca, and one to accompany Eliezer.  “And if the woman will not wish to follow you, you shall be absolved from this oath of mine; only you shall not return my son there” (Genesis 24:8).  “And if the woman will not wish…only [rak] you shall not return my son there” – rak is a term of exclusion, [intimating:] My son will not return there, but my grandson [Jacob] will return.</p>

            <summary>The Torah commands pilgrimages to be made three times a year, alluding to Isaac as an unblemished total offering, with the word Yireh mentioned three times in connection to the Akedah. The directive to be seen by the Lord in one spot corresponds to G-d selecting the lamb for the offering. The warning not to offer sacrifices elsewhere parallels Abraham's instructions not to bring Isaac back to Ur Kasdim, emphasizing that Isaac, as an unblemished offering, could not leave the land of Israel.</summary>

                <h4>Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Re'eh, Torah Ohr 13</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>When the Torah (16,16) commands that these pilgrimages have to be made on three occasions annually, this is an allusion to Isaac, an unblemished total offering. In connection with the עקדת יצחק the Torah mentions the word Yireh or Yera'eh three times (Genesis 22, 8-14-14). &quot;Three times a year every male of yours shall be seen by the Lord your G–d in the place G–d will select,&quot; corresponds to Genesis 22,8: &quot;G–d will select for Himself the lamb as the total offering my son.&quot; This is because the words in Exodus 34,23 &quot;את פני האדון ה' אלוקי ישראל&quot; are an expression of a decree by G–d the &quot;Master&quot; Who decreees that He wants to see them together in one spot. &quot;Three times as year every one of your males shall be seen by the Lord your G–d&quot; (Exodus 23,17), corresponds to the second time the word is used in connection with the עקדה. The third directive to make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem is in our verse here and corresponds to the third time the Torah used the expression יראה in connection with the binding of Isaac. It is a reference to the Mountain of G–d, Moriah. The warning השמר לך (12,13) in this portion not to offer sacrifices anywhere else, corresponds to similar words used by Abraham in his instructions to Eliezer (Genesis 24,6) not to bring Isaac back to Ur Kasdim whence Abraham had emigrated to the land of Canaan. The common denominator to all this is that Isaac, as an unblemished total offering, was not allowed to leave ארץ ישראל.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>In Genesis 3:2:1, Radak explains that Chavah misinterpreted the prohibition regarding the tree in the garden, adding her own idea that touching the tree would result in death as a safeguard against eating its fruit. The word פן in this context means &quot;maybe&quot; or &quot;perhaps.&quot; In Genesis 31:24:2, Radak interprets פן תדבר as a warning not to speak harshly or start a quarrel, similar to other instances in the Torah where פן is used as a precautionary measure.</summary>

                <h4>Radak on Genesis 31:24:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>פן תדבר, that you dare not speak. Do not start a quarrel with him planning to do harm to him as a result. Not only must you not harm him physically, but you must not even inflict verbal abuse on him. The correct meaning of the words פן תדבר is: “not to speak harshly.” Constructions with the prefix פן also occur in Genesis 3,3 as a warning, on pain of death, not to eat from the tree of knowledge, or in Genesis 24,6 פן תשיב את בני שמה not to bring Yitzchok back to Padan Aram.</p>

                <h4>Radak on Genesis 3:2:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>ותאמר, not so, said Chavah; G’d did not deny us the fruit of more than one single tree which is בתוך הגן שאמר לנו לא תאכלו מממנו ולא תגעו בו פן תמותון in the middle of the garden of which He has forbidden us to eat on pain of death. Perhaps it is in the nature of that tree  that its fruit causes death to anyone eating from it. The meaning of the word פן in that verse is the same as אולי or שמא , “maybe.” G’d told Adam that he would certainly die if he ate from it, as the Torah wrote literally in 2,17 “on the day you will eat from it you will certainly die.” Seeing that she had not quoted the prohibition correctly as G’d had not said anything about maybe dying as a result of eating from the tree, we must assume that Chavah had invented this word meaning for it to apply to touching the tree, an addition which had been altogether her own. She meant to say that G’d so loves us that He denied us to touch the  tree as a safeguard against eating from it.  An alternate way of explaining the words פן תמותון is similar to פן תשיב את בני שמה which Avraham warned Eliezer about (Genesis 24,6) which meant “do not bring back!” or Genesis 30,24) פן תדבר עם יעקב, “do not speak to Yaakov, etc.,” G’d warning Lavan.

            <summary>Abraham prays to God to send an angel to help Eliezer find a wife for Isaac, emphasizing that God had taken him out of his father's house and birthplace, indicating that Isaac should not return there. Rashi explains that &quot;li&quot; after the word &quot;dibur&quot; should be understood as &quot;concerning,&quot; not &quot;to me,&quot; as it is in the case of a prophecy. Chizkuni highlights that Abraham's statement reflects his recognition of God as the King of heaven and earth, even though at the time of his departure from his father's house, God was not acknowledged as such on earth.</summary>

                <h4>Chizkuni, Genesis 24:7:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>ה' אלוקי השמים, “the Lord, the G-d of heaven;” Rashi comments that Avraham did not add that this “G-d” was also the “G-d” of the earth. The reason was that the time frame Avraham spoke about was before he had preached monotheism to his peers, none of whom had until then recognised Him as their G-d. If that approach to G-d’s stature were correct, we would have to ask how G-d could have been referred to as the G-d of heaven in Genesis 1,1, when, according to tradition the heaven as we understand it was created only on the second day of the six days of creation? [In our daily prayers, אדון עולם, we commence by stating that that the Master of the universe was “king” before any creature had been created? In other words, the title “King” is not dependent on this King already having subjects over whom to rule. Ed.] The same point has been made by Isaiah 43,10: “before Me no god was formed and after Me none shall exist.” The point that the prophet makes is that G-d’s existence is dependent on His having loyal subjects. Only He is eternal. This is also the reason why the first blessing in our thrice daily amidah, שמונה עשרה, does not contain a reference to G-d as “king,” as do other blessings. It would be inappropriate to commence with the sequence: מלך העולם אלוקי אברהם וגו', “the King of the universe, the G-d of Avraham, etc.” seeing that in the chapter of the Torah whereAvraham is introduced He could not truthfully have been described as the “King” of the whole universe. When Avraham in our verse credited G-d with having taken him out of his father’s house, etc., he thereby “crowned” G-d as “king” also on earth, he being His first subject. Nonetheless this was a far cry from being recognised as king of mankind.</p>

This is why I am so certain that He will send His angel before you to make your mission successful.

              <p>אלוקי השמים, “the G–d in heaven, etc.;” we must note that Avraham did not, at this stage, describe G–d as also being the G–d acknowledged on earth. He described the situation as it was, i.e. that up until this time the G–d of Israel, or even the G–d of creation had not been acknowledged as such on earth. This fact is reflected in our central daily prayer the עמידה, consisting of 18 (+1) benedictions we do not refer to G–d as “King” in the opening benediction which describes Him as the G–d of Avraham and that of the other two patriarchs. [Whenever we recite a benediction before eating even a morsel or drinking a mouthful of water, we do add the fact that He is the King of the universe. Ed.] (Compare Sifrey on parshat Ha-azinu, section 313).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>FROM MY FATHER’s HOUSE, ‘UMEI’ERETZ MOLAD’TI’ (AND FROM THE LAND OF MY NATIVITY). Rashi comments: “From my father’s house — from Haran. And from the land of my nativity — from Ur of the Chaldees.” If this is so, the expression, Unto my country and to ‘molad’ti’ thou shalt go, (Verse 4 here.)  must also refer to Ur of the Chaldees. But Heaven forbid that the sacred seed should mix with the sons of Ham, (The Chaldees and the entire land of Shinar belonged to the sons of Ham. See Ramban, above, 11:28.)  the sinful one! (Above, 9:22-24.)  Even if one would say that Abraham had some family there from the seed of Shem, the fact is however that the servant went to Haran as his master said! Now perhaps the Rabbi [Rashi] thinks that eretz molad’to (Verse 4 here.) (the land of his birth) was Ur of the Chaldees, but molad’ti (Verse 4 here.)  means “my family,” and my country (Verse 4 here.)  means the land wherein he lived. But all these are futile words since here, in the verse before us, he said, And thou shalt take a wife for my son from there, [and according to Rashi, who explained ume’eretz molad’ti, mentioned in this verse, as meaning Ur of the Chaldees, it would follow that Abraham commanded Eliezer to go there to get a wife from the children of Ham]! Moreover, Abraham stayed in the land of Canaan for a longer period than he did in Haran, and so why should Haran be called his country simply because he lived there for some time? Instead, the meaning of the expression, unto my country and to ‘molad’ti’, (Verse 4 here.)  is “unto my country in which I was born,” [namely, Haran in Mesopotamia], for there he stayed and from there his ancestors came, as was already explained. (See Ramban above, 11:28 and 12:1.)  In Bereshith Rabbah we find: (59:13.)  “From my father’s house — this is the house of his father. And from the land of my birth — this is the environs [of his father’s house].” It is possible that unto my country and unto ‘molad’ti’ means “Unto my country and unto my family,” for he did not want a wife to be taken for Isaac even from the people of his country but only from his family. Similarly in the verse, And thou shalt take a wife for my son from there, [the word misham (from there)] alludes to the expression, from my father’s house, mentioned at the beginning of the verse. And so did the servant say when quoting Abraham, And thou shalt take a wife for my son of my family, and of my father’s house, (Further, Verse 40.)  and again he said, quoting his master. Then shalt thou be clear from my oath when thou comest to my family. (Ibid., Verse 41.)  These words were said by the servant to honor them so that they would listen to him.</p>

              <p>AND WHO SPOKE ‘LI’ (UNTO ME). Rashi comments: “The word li means ‘in my interest,’ just as in the verse, which He spoke ‘alai’ (concerning me). (I Kings 2:4.)  In the same way, in every case where li and lo and lahem follow the word dibur (speaking), they are to be explained in the sense of al (concerning). For proper usage of the verb dibur [in the sense of speaking to a person, the pronouns li and lo and lahem are not appropriate, and] only eilai and eilav and aleihem are appropriate, and their renderings in the Targum are imi and imei and imhon. In the case of the word amirah, however, the expressions li and lo and lahem are appropriate.” In the section of Vayeitzei Yaakov, Rashi brought [proof of his above mentioned principle which states that li or lecha, etc., following the word dibur, must be explained in the sense of al (concerning)] from that which is written there, that which ‘dibarti’ (I have spoken) ‘lach,’ (Further, 28:15.)  [which must be interpreted to mean “in thy interest and concerning thee”] since He had never spoken to Jacob before this occasion. But this difference is not valid for we find: And now go, lead the people unto the place of which ‘dibarti’ (I have spoken) ‘lach’; (Exodus 32:34. Here the word dibur is found in connection with lach, and yet it means “to you,” and not “concerning you,” as Rashi claimed.)  And the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic; (Daniel 2:4. This too is a case similar to the above.)  And thou shalt drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as the Eternal hath spoken unto thee. (Deuteronomy 9:3. This too is similar to the above.)  Similarly the verb amirah is used with both li and eilai: And they shall say ‘li’ (to me), What is His name? What shall I say ‘aleihem’ (to them)? (Exodus 3:13.)  And as for [the verse which Rashi mentioned as his proof], that which ‘dibarti’ (I have spoken) ‘lach,’ (Further, 28:15.)  [which must mean, as Rashi said, “concerning thee,” since He had never spoken to Jacob before this occasion], its interpretation is as follows: “that which I have said to you now that I will give the land to you and to your seed, and I will bless you.” [Thus the word lach (to you) follows the understood verb “give” and is not related to dibarti.]</p>

              <p>Oben V. 3, beim Schwure, hieß es auch: ואלקי הארץ, denn, indem der Schwörende, dem Begriff des הִשָבֵעַ zufolge, sich mit allem irdischen Seinen dem strafenden Gottesarm für den Fall des Wortbruches unterstellt, so ist dort der Ausdruck der unmittelbaren Gottesgegenwart auf Erden wesentlich an seiner Stelle. Wenn wir aber hier bei einem Ausspruch des hingebendsten Gottvertrauens, den Ausdruck der echtjüdischen unmittelbaren und speziellsten השגחה פרטית erwarten, die dem bestimmten Manne das bestimmte Weib zuführt, so weist ja auch Abraham auf Gottesoffenbarungen, auf alles das, was Gott speziell für ihn und an ihm getan, hin, welches alles noch weit mehr diese השגחה פרטית bekundet, als der verhältnismäßig noch allgemeine Ausdruck אלקי הארץ sagen würde. Der Gott des Himmels, der doch zugleich mich — nicht הוציאני — sondern לקחני, mich für seine besonderen Zwecke als Werkzeug herausgenommen hat und der דבר לי — nicht אמר לי, was eine Verheißung wäre, sondern — der eine Bestimmung über mich ausgesprochen, z. B. ושמרו דרך ד׳ וגוי ,והיה ברכה und für diese Bestimmung נשבע לי, mir die Verheißung gegeben, mein Same solle dieses Land haben (der hat mir freilich weder direkt verboten, meinem Sohne eine Frau von den jetzigen Bewohnern des Landes zu geben, noch meinen Sohn wieder in meine Heimat zurückwandern zu lassen; allein beides erkenne ich als natürliche Folge dieser Bestimmung und dieser Verheißung, beides als das einzige ihnen Gemäße), der — sei du nur ganz ruhig — der wird seinen Engel — nicht אתך, mit dir — sondern vor dir hersenden, du wirst gar nichts dabei zu tun haben; der mich aus meinem Vaterhause zu finden gewusst, wird auch für meinen Sohn dich das rechte Mädchen aus meiner Verwandtschaft finden lassen — ולקחת so gut wie לקחני.</p>

              <p>אלוקי השמים, “the Lord of the heavens.” In this verse Avraham did not refer to G’d as the “Lord of the earth,” according to Rashi, because when Avraham describes the state of mankind when he left Charan, G’d had not had a foothold on earth that could justify us in describing him as “the Lord of the earth.”
    Nachmanides says simply that the time frame described by Avraham in that verse refers to when he had resided outside the Holy Land, and we have a tradition that anyone residing outside the Holy Land is considered as if he did not have a G’d (protecting him individually)

              <p>אשר לקחני מבית אבי, “the One Who has taken me out of my father’s house, etc.” according to Rashi, the words מבית אבי refer to Charan, and the words מארץ מולדתי refer to Ur Casdim. Nachmanides considers this explanation flawed as if true, when Avraham instructed Eliezer to proceed to אל ארצי ואל מולדתי, he would in fact have instructed him to go to Ur Casdim, something Eliezer did not do. Avraham’s birthplace was Aram Naharayim and not Ur Casdim. G’d forbid that the seed of Avraham should become fused to a girl stemming from that region of the most blatant idolatry. Furthermore, why did Avraham call Charan ארצו, “his homeland,” when he did not even refer to the land of Canaan as “my homeland,” but described himself as a stranger there. He had lived in Canaan for over 60 years at that time, far longer than he and his father had stayed in Charan. Avraham’s birthplace had been Aram Naharayim, and this is where his family had resided from the earliest time. This is also how the matter is explained in Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer, the most ancient of our Midrashic texts where we read: “and take a wife from my family.”

Abraham prayed: Lord of the Universe, God of heaven who led me out of my father’s house and from the land of my birth, send an angel to go with Eliezer to take a wife for my son Isaac. Toldot Yizhak asks a question. Why does Abraham have to mention in his prayer that God took him out of his father’s house and out of the land of his birth? The explanation is, Abraham said in his prayer, because You took me out of my father’s house and the land of my birth, how should I take a wife for my son from my homeland? Therefore, Abraham said: it is just that You, God, must at least send an angel so that my son should take a wife from my birthplace, because I have fulfilled your commands and left my homeland.

            <summary>In the Guide for the Perplexed, it is discussed how the different motions of the spheres and stars point towards the existence of a Divine Being, as highlighted in various biblical verses. In the Akeidat Yitzchak, the thirteen attributes of God are explained in detail, including their use in different situations throughout history, such as with Abraham, Isaac, and the Jewish people in Egypt. The use of different names for God, such as the four-lettered name and Adon, is also explored in relation to seeking forgiveness and divine providence. Rabbi Yossi in the Midrash supports the view that these attributes of God are essential in understanding and seeking forgiveness and mercy.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>The author now proceeds to explain the thirteen attributes in the traditional way, including their use by G-d with the earlier generations, i.e. ever since Abraham until the time of the exile in Egypt, since Egypt up to that point, and their use in the future. The first use of the four lettered name expresses the essence of G-d as the Creator, the only existence prior to and subsequent to the existence of the universe. From this, the Rabbis in Berachot 60, deduce that this name is the source of mercy since He is the father of all creatures, and we ask Him to &quot;have mercy such as a father has on his children.&quot; Psalms 103, 13, mentions that G-d &quot;exercises mercy on all those who revere Him.&quot; It was this attribute of G-d that Abraham proclaimed in his time to his contemporaries. Whenever we read in the Torah &quot;He proclaimed in the name of the Lord,&quot; (using the four lettered name) this is the message that Abraham conveyed to his listeners. It was this attribute that G-d used in His dealings with Abraham, except on the occasion of the akeydah, when He commanded him to offer up his son. On that occasion, G-d employed the attribute of elokim. The second time the four lettered name is used in the thirteen attributes, it reflects the ongoing supervision of history as well as individual fates that G-d employs. Also, the fact that He relates to His creatures either with pleasure or displeasure, according to their deeds. This is why we find on occasion a combination of the four lettered name with the name elokim .(Deut. 3,24) By using the four lettered name, He excercises mercy on the sinner when the latter repents. Since no man is totally free from sin, our sages in Rosh Hashanah 17, express this in the words &quot;I, the four lettered attribute, am the same before the sin as I am after man sinned and repented.&quot; In the words of David, &quot;G-d has mercy on those who revere Him, since He knows our urges, our inner psyche.&quot; (Psalms 103, 13) The message then is that although man has sinned, G-d does not necessarily change His attitude to such a person. This is also the meaning of Samuel II 12, 13 &quot;G-d has removed your sin from you.&quot; G-d employed this attribute with Isaac when the latter was lying bound on the altar. In the blessing that Isaac bestowed on Jacob, he used both attributes, to teach his sons that G-d employs both attributes in His dealings with man. The third attribute &quot;keyl,” is an attribute denoting strength, such as when we read about eyle ha-aretz, (Kings II 24, 15); it also represents a form of the attribute of mercy, as we read &quot;the Lord your G-d is an eyl of mercy.&quot; The same meaning is used in Psalms 22,2, &quot;my eyl my eyl, why have You forsaken me?&quot; This term is employed when G-d needs to employ the attribute of mercy in order to suppress the attribute of justice that seems to be called for. It would be used either to assist those who have not sinned, or those who have sinned and repented. This was the attribute G-d used with Jacob on a regular basis. G-d also used it when He blessed Jacob. (Genesis 31, 13) &quot;I am the eyl of Beyt El, or (Genesis 33,20) &quot;He called Him the keyl, Lord of Israel.&quot; The fourth attribute, that of rachum, merciful, is used when a person or group of people have expressed incomplete repentance. This attribute was employed in Egypt, when the Jews had not completely repented their former way of life. When David describes G-d as having extended this kind of mercy to the Jewish people who had erred so frequently, this was also before they had repented fully. (Psalms 106,46) When G-d responded to the first outcry of the Jewish people in Egypt, and the Torah states &quot;G-d knew,&quot; that refers to the loving kindness implied in mercy. (Targum Exodus 2,25) We find that meaning of &quot;He knew&quot; also, in Ruth 2, 1, and other places. The fifth attribute, chanun, gracious, is used by G-d on people who have nothing to commend them. Our sages say that G-d showed Moses three treasures. Moses asked &quot;why do You need three treasures?&quot; G-d replied &quot;one is for those who study Torah and perform the commandments. The second is for those who perform deeds of loving kindness. The third is for those who perform neither the one nor the other, to whom however, I wish to give an undeserved gift.&quot; This is the meaning of &quot;I shall be gracious to whomsoever I shall be gracious to.&quot; (Midrash Rabbah Song of Songs 45) The Midrash in Parshat Va-etchanan says that &quot;righteous people, though they may possess all kinds of merits, ask G-d for free gifts.&quot; This attribute was employed by G-d when the Jews were promised great wealth upon leaving Egypt. G-d had said &quot;I will give the grace of these people in the eyes of Egypt.&quot; (Exodus 3, 21) Again, in chapter 12, 36, we read &quot;and G-d had given the grace of the people in the eyes of the Egyptians, and they lent to them.&quot; In the Haggadah of Passover, in the paragraph known as dayeynu, we thank G-d for all the favours He had performed for us, seeing that they were totally undeserved. The sixth attribute is erech apayim, long delayed anger, and refers to G-d’s relationship with unrepentant sinners suffering from heavy burdens of sins. If G-d were to treat them according to the principle of justice, their punishment would result in their utter destruction. G-d therefore exacts the punishment only a little at a time, even when He does employ a measure of the attribute of justice. He hopes that in this way, such sinners may eventually repent the sins they have committed. The reason the word apayim appears in the plural, is that it may refer both to tzaddikim and wicked people. (Baba Kama 50) Both have errors to account for. Or, it may refer to both reward and punishment, the former sometimes being parcelled out sparingly, so that it may be saved up for the world to come. This attribute was employed in dealing with Pharaoh as well as with Israel, whenever either acted rebelliously in Egypt, at the sea, or in the desert. An expression of G-d using this attribute can be found in His exclamation &quot;how long will this nation refuse to obey My commandments!&quot; ((Exodus 16, 28) The seventh attribute is rav chessed, favouring kind deeds, allowing them to be weighty. This concerns the treatment of people whose merits and demerits are in balance, and who require a tipping of the scales in their favour. This can be accomplished by weighing down the merits which would raise the demerit side, or vice versa. (Rosh Hashanah 17) The logic is discussed in Midrash shocher tov on Psalms 62. Rabbi Nehoray is quoted as saying that since wickedness is sterile by definition, does not produce growth by itself, whereas goodness is dynamic, productive by definition, the latter when in balance with the former, will eventually outweigh the former. The eighth attribute, emet, truth ,refers to the truthfulness and reliability of fulfilling promises made. We read in Chabakuk 2,3, &quot;if He tarries, wait for HIM, He will surely come, He will not be late.&quot; The Talmud Berachot 7, states that a promise of something good, even if given conditionally has never been withdrawn, as we know from Moses. One must realise, however, that this is based on the assumption that the recipient of such a promise has not meanwhile forfeited it through a change in his own behaviour. Proof can be found in Jeremiah 19. See also the discussion on this in chapter thirteen of this volume. G-d employed this attribute at the time the Torah was given to Israel, making good promises He had given to the ancestors and Moses. The ninth attribute is &quot;He preserves His kindness to thousands of generations.&quot; Just as the children of the wealthy, if not enterprising themselves, would starve or die were it not for their parental inheritance, so man, if devoid of the accumulated merits of his forefathers, would not have any spiritual capital to draw on, and would quickly forfeit his claim to continued existence. David expresses this thought in Psalms 17, 14 &quot;they will have lots of children and leave their abundance to their offspring.&quot; This attribute needed to be employed during the episode of the golden calf, when the attribute of &quot;slow to anger&quot; did not suffice, and Moses proceeded to invoke the merits of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Immediately he had done so, we read &quot;G-d reconsidered.&quot; This is beautifully illustrated in Shemot Rabbah 44. &quot;Moses asked G-d for permission to speak, which permission was granted. He said that if the Jewish people had violated the first half of YOUR commandment, will YOU violate the second half also?&quot; Moses referred to the &quot;you must not have any other deities,&quot; which had been violated by the Jewish people. He asked G-d &quot;will You now violate Your commandment of &quot;doing kindness for thousands of generations&quot; (in the same commandment)? The tenth, eleventh and twelfth attributes &quot;nosseh avon, va- fesha, ve-chata-ah,&quot; i.e. commuting various types of sins to levels that deserve less severe punishment, is usually understood as follows. avon is the sin committed deliberately, pesha is the sin that is committed to show one's rebellion against G-d’s legislation, whereas chata-ah is a sin committed unintentionally. During the episode of the golden calf, all three kinds of sin were committed. At any rate, G-d did not employ these attributes to forgive, merely to delay the punishment due for those sins, i.e. nosse, &quot;carries.&quot; The punishment was meted out at another place at another time. It is important therefore to recite these sins in the proper order at the time one confesses them, i.e. vidduy. Accordingly, the plain meaning is that G-d tolerates not only deliberate sins, but even sins representing rebellion against Him. Naturally, He tolerates unintentional sin. The Midrash says that if repentance is forthcoming, the first two categories will be considered as if they had been like the third category, i.e. inadvertent. In other words, He raises them to the level of mere chet. This is the translation of Yonatan ben Uzziel in Chabakuk on the word al shigegotay, for my unintentional sins. However, in the Shulchan Aruch (Tur Or Hachayim 621), the ruling is that the confession is to be recited in the reverse order, commencing with the chet, the most minor category of sin, and to proceed progressively to the most major, the most serious. Each group of sin requires an additional attribute to save the sinner from the total consequences of each misdemeanour. Moses employed these attributes after the sin of the spies, when he said &quot;as You have elevated the sins of the people ever since they came out of Egypt until now.&quot; (Numbers 14, 19) (7) The thirteenth attribute, venakkeh lo yenakkeh, He will consider innocent and yet not consider innocent. In our prayers, we separate the expression by a comma. There are serious doubts if that is the correct interpretation, however. We feel that there should not be a comma, that the whole expression is a single attribute, which is used in conjunction with any of the attributes ten, eleven or twelve. It means that G-d tolerates certain sins from time to time, without granting total forgiveness, since true pardon cannot take place without simultaneous repentance. Baba Kama 50, states that he who claims that G-d overlooks things, (ignores a sin completely) will cause his own life to be ignored. Psalms 25,8,states that &quot;G-d is good and straightforward,&quot; meaning that He teaches the ways of repentance to sinners even after they have sinned. The explanation of how one can reconcile the apparent contradiction in &quot;He visits the sins of the parents on the children,&quot; with the fact that G-d then not only punishes the perpetrators of the sins but also succeeding generations, lies in the delayed nature of the punishment. G-d waits until the fourth generation for actions that would give Him a reason to diminish the original punishment due the one who had perpetrated the sin. Therefore, this attribute is also one of mercy. This is why Moses mentions it at the time of the crisis with the spies. He asks: &quot;are You going to kill this whole nation simultaneously, at once?&quot; He continues &quot;and now, let the power of G-d be great,&quot; (Numbers 14, 17) invoking this attribute revealed to him at Mount Sinai. Accordingly, we find G-d responding &quot;I have forgiven according to your words.&quot; This means that by the time the land of Israel will have been entered, the punishment will have been exacted. The children suffered part of the punishment, having to wander in the desert for forty years. As the Torah states &quot;and they will have to bear your harlotry.&quot; (Numbers 14,33) This means that the children will have to suffer the infidelity of the parents' generation. Concerning the question if the attribute of &quot;visiting the sins on the children&quot; is a &quot;good&quot; attribute or a &quot;negative&quot; attribute, there is a dispute between Nachmanides and Ibn Ezra. The author tends to agree with the view of the Tosephta in Sotah chapter 4, seeing that it is being contrasted with the attribute of extending the reward for up to two thousand generations. If one considers this a &quot;good&quot; attribute, then it is number thirteen, and the nakkeh ve-lo yenakkeh prior to it, must be understood merely as an adjective applicable to attributes ten, eleven and twelve, respectively. This cocludes the thirteen attributes which reveal the manner in which G-d relates to man in His dealings with him. At the time of this revelation, the &quot;who elevates sins to a lesser level&quot; had to be invoked to insure survival of the people after the golden calf. (8) Why then did Moses suddenly switch to the name of Adon, when he said to G-d &quot;if I have found favour in Your eyes my Master, (adonay ) please walk in our midst&quot; This is a name for G-d not mentioned in this whole Parshah! The sages of the Kabbalah teach us that this is the name which is the gateway to G-d, as we read in the shirat hayam the Jewish people offered as thanksgiving after having crossed the sea and seeing that the Egyptians had been drowned. &quot;The temple of my Master, (adonay ) Your hands have firmly established.&quot; (Exodus 15, 17) The portal to the presence of G-d, the shechinah on earth, is via this appellation of G-d. This is why we preface the central prayer, the amidah with the words &quot;my Master, please open my lips!&quot; All supplicants enter via this name, this description of G-d. Sometimes the euphemism kol, all, is employed to describe G-d. This is to indicate that all is to be found within Him, that nothing is lacking. When Moses was told about the angel that would guide Israel towards the holy land in Parshat Mishpatim, the Torah says of that angel &quot;for My name is within him,&quot; and the reference is to that name adon, the name by which he is nearest to us, easiest to be reached by the worshipper. So, when Moses prayed concerning his own personal plea to be allowed to enter the holy land in Parshat Va-etchanan, he also uses that name. &quot;My Master, O Lord, You have begun to show Your servant ...&quot; (Deut. 3,24.) Daniel in chapter nine, also uses that name on several occasions. It would appear that by using that appellation, forgiveness can be obtained, as proven from the quote in Daniel and also Psalms 86,3, and 15. After this new found knowledge, Moses asks G-d for His personal Providence, using the proper channels that had been revealed to him. He underlines the fact that the Jewish people are &quot;a stiffnecked people,&quot; saying that because of this nosse avon, elevating their sin to a less serious level is not enough, that they require a complete pardon. An indication that Moses refers to this pardon is found in the request &quot;forgive our sins, (of rebellion) our intentional sins, and let us take possession of Your inheritance.&quot; (34,9) The emphasis on this inheritance implies total and unconditional survival while in possession of the original promise of the land of Canaan. It was at this point that Moses had realised that the original angel was G-d Himself, in His function as elokim, attribute of justice. He realised that when G-d had said in Mishpatim 23,21, &quot;be careful of this angel, listen to his voice, do not rebel against him, for he will not elevate your sins to a lesser degree of seriousness for My name is within him,&quot; that G-d had meant to tell him to be careful not to upset this method of Personal guidance by G-d, the attribute of not only elevating sin but the capacity to grant forgiveness. For this reason, during the episode of the sin of the spies, Moses said &quot;let the power of the four lettered name be great,&quot; meaning &quot;restore that kind of hashgachah to us!&quot; If Moses says at the same time &quot;and elevate the sin of this nation as You have done thus far,&quot; when he appears to refer only to G-d’s &quot;weaker&quot; attribute, he has in mind only the older generation of the Jewish people. For the younger generation he pleads for total forgiveness. G-d responds therefore by saying &quot;I have forgiven, in accordance with your own words (request).&quot; Moses’s further request, namely that G-d go with them, was because he wanted visible evidence that G-d had indeed forgiven them. This would be demonstrated by &quot;Your walking with us.&quot; (33, 16) We find something similar when Abraham prayed for Sodom. When G-d responds that if fifty righteous people are found, He would save the town, the term &quot;I will elevate&quot; is used to describe suspension of judgment. G-d Himself appears as the four lettered name. He had not said &quot;I will not do anything, but ve-nassati. When Abraham presses further, in the case of the forty five people, he omits reference to &quot;will You not at least elevate,&quot; but simply asks &quot;are You going to destroy?&quot; At that point, G-d reassures Abraham without qualification &quot;I will not do it.&quot; It is significant that Abraham had switched to the use of the adnut term for addressing G-d. In other words, Abraham wanted forgiveness not mere suspension of the penalty. G-d responded positively. When finally, at the end of the conversation, G-d departs from Abraham, the Torah describes the departure as the departure of the four lettered name, i.e. the attribute of mercy departing. This means that under the prevailing condition, the weaker attribute of mercy could no longer fulfil any function. Exodus Rabbah 32, quotes G-d as having said when He announced the appointment of the angel in Parshat Mishpatim &quot;He who looked after the fathers, is now looking after the children.&quot; Similarly, Abraham had reassured Eliezer on his mission to Padan Aarm, that the G-d who had looked after him would also look out for Eliezer. (Genesis 24, 7) Further examples are quoted to show that all the authors of the various Midrashim are agreed in their understanding of the function of the angel mentioned in Parshat Mishpatim. (9) The &quot;covenant&quot; mentioned in 34, 10 was, that an appeal to the thirteen attributes of G-d now revealed to Moses would not remain unanswered. &quot;I will perform miracles,&quot; as you Moses have asked. The Talmud Berachot 7, states that this implies that other nations will not have prophets to assist them. There are also many hints in this verse that future miracles that would be performed by men such as Joshua, who could arrest the orbits of the sun and the moon, would have the origin of their power in this authority granted Moses as a result of his prayer. See details in chapter thirteen. (10) Just as the name anee, I is used sometimes as a euphemism, kinnuy for &quot;G-d,&quot; so G-d reassures Moses here that the same personal supervision that the Jewish people enjoyed prior to the sin of the golden calf, (the angel of Mishpatim) will be active in accomplishing the expulsion of the seven tribes residing in the land of Canaan. To make sure that this point is understood, we have a review here of the same duties that had already been spelled out in Parshat Mishpatim when we first encounter the angel. This is also why the paragraph ends with the injunction &quot;do not make a cast image, a deity,&quot; as if to say &quot;what is done is done, the episode has come to an end.&quot; The additional legislation of the peter rechem, the laws about the first born, relates to the new situation created after the firstborn had failed in their normal duties at the sin of the golden calf. The redemption of such firstborn is now required in lieu of their appearance in front of G-d performing their duties. (Zevachim 115) (11) We are told by this legislation that although the situation had returned to normal, they were not exactly as they had been, when after the sacrificial rites had been performed, the atzilim could have visions of G-d, or at least His entourage. Now they no longer possessed the power to behold even the rays of light emanating from the face of Moses. Numbers Rabbah 11, illustrates this point. &quot;Behold the power of sin! As long as Israel had not sinned, the shechinah, though described as being &quot;like a consuming fire,&quot; did not bother or frighten the people. As soon as they had committed the sin of the golden calf however, they were frightened even of Moses’s appearance. The &quot;rays of glory&quot; are the wisdom. This is true in even greater measure of a person who has communicated with G-d in a &quot;face to face&quot; manner. Solomon says already in Kohelet 8, 1, &quot;a person's wisdom lights up his face.&quot; The Talmud Baba Batra 75, describes the face of Moses as resembling the face of the sun. </p>

              <p>Aristotle has proved that the difference of forms becomes evident by the difference of actions. Since, therefore, the motion of the elements is rectilinear, and that of the spheres circular, we infer that the substances are different. This inference is supported by Natural Science. When we further notice that substances with rectilinear motion differ in their directions, that some move upward, some downward, and that substances which move in the same direction have different velocities, we infer that their forms must be different. Thus we learn that there are four elements. In the same way we come to the conclusion that the substance of all the spheres is the same, since they all have circular motion. Their forms, however, are different, since one sphere moves from cast to west, and another from west to east; and their motions have also different velocities. We can now put the following question to Aristotle: There is one substance common to all spheres: each one has its own peculiar form. Who thus determined and predisposed these spheres to receive different forms? Is there above the spheres any being capable of determining this except God?</p>

              <p>The best proof for design in the Universe I find in the different motions of the spheres, and in the fixed position of the stars in the spheres. For this reason you find all the prophets point to the spheres and stars when they want to prove that there must exist a Divine Being. Thus Abraham reflected on the stars, as is well known; Isaiah (xl. 26) exhorts to learn from them the existence of God, and says, “Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things?” Jeremiah [calls God] “The Maker of the heavens”; Abraham calls Him “The God of the heavens” (Gen. 24:7); [Moses], the chief of the Prophets, uses the phrase explained by us (Part I., chap. lxx.), “He who rideth on the heavens” (Deut. 33:26). The proof taken from the heavens is convincing: for the variety of things in the sublunary world, though their substance is one and the same, can be explained as the work of the influences of the spheres, or the result of the variety in the position of the substance in relation to the spheres, as has been shown by Aristotle. But who has determined the variety in the spheres and the stars, if not the Will of God? To say that the Intelligences have determined it is of no use whatever: for the Intelligences are not corporeal, and have no local relation to the spheres. Why then should the one sphere in its desire to approach the Intelligence, move eastward, and another westward? Is the one Intelligence in the east, the other in the west? or why does one move with great velocity, another slowly? This difference is not in accordance with their distances from each other, as is well known. We must then say that the nature and essence of each sphere necessitated its motion in a certain direction, and in a certain manner, as the consequence of its desire to approach its Intelligence. Aristotle clearly expresses this opinion.</p>

              <p>(Gen. 49:28, cont.:) AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM WHEN HE BLESSED THEM. EACH ONE WITH HIS OWN BLESSING IS HOW HE BLESSED THEM. &quot;Him&quot; is not written here but HE BLESSED THEM. (Tanh., Gen. 12:17; Gen. R. 97, New Version, on 49:28 (= pp. 1227—1228 in the Theodor-Albeck edition); 99(100)4; Numb. R. 13:8; Cant. R. 4:7:1; cf. also Exod. R. 1:6, 16.)  Why so? Because (in Gen. 49:8-22) he gave Judah the strength of a lion, Joseph the strength of an ox, (Shor. Although the Masoretic Text of Gen. 49:22, from which this allusion is taken, vocalizes this word as shur, i.e., “wall,” the present context requires that Joseph be likened to some animal.)  Naphtali the lightness of a deer, and Dan the bite of a serpent. You might say that one is greater than another; &lt; so &gt; their commonality is &lt; mentioned &gt; at the end. EACH ONE WITH HIS OWN BLESSING … HE BLESSED THEM. Thus he distributed the land to them. He gave Judah the land which produces barley and Benjamin land which produces wheat. Even so, they had a commonality with each other in that they each would eat what belonged to the other. Ergo (in Gen. 49:28): AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM. &quot;Unto them&quot; is not written here but TO THEM. (Buber cites Samuel Jaffe ben Isaac Ashkenazi, Yefeh To’ar, a commentary on the Midrash Rabbah, Part I on Genesis (Venice, 1597—1606), who cites Rashi, on Gen. 24:7, and explains that “to them” (lahem) used with the verb “speak” (rt.: DBR), as opposed to its use with the verb “say” (rt.: ’MR), means that one is speaking “concerning them” rather than “with them,” which is what “unto them” (alehem) would have implied. So also Enoch Zundel ben Joseph in his commentary Ets Yosef, on Tanh., Gen. 12:16. For a suggested rendering, see the following note.)  (Ibid.:) AND THIS &lt; is how &gt; someone like me is going to bless you, and at the place where I have stopped he is beginning. Thus it is stated (ibid.): AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR FATHER SPOKE TO THEM. (Apart from the words AND THIS (in the sense of ALSO THIS), there is another hint there that the verse has a wider meaning in that Jacob is simply alluded to as THEIR FATHER instead of by name. Like Jacob, Moses is a father of Israel.)  When Moses arose, he opened (the blessing in Deut. 33:1) with AND THIS IS THE BLESSING &lt; WITH WHICH MOSES, THE MAN OF GOD, BLESSED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BEFORE HE DIED &gt;. &lt; He began &gt; from where Jacob had stopped. Ergo (in Gen. 49:28 also): AND THIS. He said these blessings for them. When did they come to pass for you? From the time that you received the Torah, about which it is written (in Deut. 4:44): AND THIS IS THE TORAH. Note the AND THIS. And also, with whatever &lt; expression &gt; Jacob had closed his blessing, Moses opened for them. Moses said (in Ps. 119:100): I HAVE GAINED UNDERSTANDING FROM THE ELDERS. When Isaac blessed Jacob, he said (in Gen. 28:3): MAY GOD ALMIGHTY BLESS YOU. With what did he finally close his blessing? With a calling (according to Gen. 28:1): SO ISAAC CALLED JACOB AND BLESSED HIM. So, in the case of Jacob, where his father had stopped, from there he had begun (according to Gen. 49:1): THEN JACOB CALLED HIS SONS. Then, Jacob stopped (in Gen. 49:28) with THIS; so Moses also, when he arose to bless the tribes, began with AND THIS (in Deut. 33:1): AND THIS IS THE BLESSING. And with what did Moses close? With BLESSED ARE YOU, as stated (in Deut. 33:29): BLESSED ARE YOU, O ISRAEL! WHO IS LIKE YOU? See &lt; how &gt; David opened (Ps. 1:1)! With BLESSED IS THE ONE. Ergo (in Ps. 119:100): I HAVE GAINED UNDERSTANDING FROM THE ELDERS.</p>

              <p>“Behold, I am sending an angel” (Exodus 23:20) – the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: The one who protected the patriarchs will protect the descendants. Likewise, you find with Abraham, when he blessed his son Isaac, he said to him: “The Lord, God of the heavens…He will send His angel before you” (Genesis 24:7). Jacob our patriarch, what did he say to his children? “The angel who redeems me [from all evil]” (Genesis 48:16). He said to them: ‘He redeemed me from Esau, he redeemed me from Laban, he fed me and supported me during the years of famine.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘Now, too, the one who protected the patriarchs will protect the descendants, as it is stated: “Behold, I am [sending an angel].”’  Every place that an angel is seen, the Divine Presence is seen, as it is stated: “An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire” (Exodus 3:2), and immediately, “God called to him” (Exodus 3:4). Moreover, when Israel cries out before Him, salvation will come to them. So it was at the bush, as it is stated: “Now, behold, the outcry of the children of Israel has come to Me” (Exodus 3:9). Likewise with Gideon, “An angel [of the Lord] came.… The angel of the Lord appeared to him…” (Judges 6:11–12). (Following this, in verse 13, Gideon complains to the angel about Israel’s oppression at the hands of Midian. The midrash will now cite the angel’s response to Gideon. )  “He said: Go with this strength of yours and save Israel” (Judges 6:14). Likewise, in the future, when he will reveal himself, redemption will come to Israel, as it is stated: “Behold, I am sending My messenger, and he will clear a way before Me” (Malachi 3:1).  </p>

              <p>All this is contained in the report of the Creation. The קליפה preceded light since the Torah speaks of Tohu vavohu and darkness as extant before G–d commanded &quot;let there be light.&quot; Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 2,4 understand the four words והארץ תהו ובהו חשך in that verse as alluding to the four periods of exile Israel would have to endure before the coming of the Messiah. The words יהי אור are the reference to that period in our history which will unfold at the end of the periods of exile. The true &quot;good,&quot; unmixed with evil, is represented by Jacob; he represents the very essence, &quot;kernel&quot; of the tree of life that is described as being in the &quot;center&quot; of the garden. When the Torah says וכל טוב אדוניו בידו, &quot;and all the goodness of his Master in his hand&quot; (Genesis 24,10), this Tuv instead of Tov, refers to absolute good, not something merely relatively good i.e. Tov. The word Tuv means &quot;goodness par excellence.&quot; Abraham explained this to Eliezer when he sent him on the mission to get a wife for Isaac and said &quot;the Lord, the G–d of Heaven who has taken me from my father's house and from my birthplace.&quot; Rashi says that the words מבית אבי, refer to Charan, whereas the words מארץ מולדתי, refer to Ur Kasdim. Our sages in Sanhedrin 19, commenting on Isaiah 29,22:&quot;Jacob who redeemed Abraham,&quot; say that G–d only saved Abraham from Nimrod's furnace on account of Jacob's merit. This whole statement will be explained in detail in פרשת תולדות. Thus it becomes clear that the whole purpose of Isaac's marriage was to enable Jacob to be born from that union. This is why Abraham hinted to Eliezer &quot;you must on no account bring my son there&quot; (24,6). The implication is that &quot;my grandson&quot; may return there. He will have to go back there to retrieve his &quot;lost&quot; part, i.e. Rachel, Leah, Zilpah and Bilhah. This is why Jacob שמר את הצאן, &quot;tended the flock,&quot; and our sages understand this term as similar to the Talmudic צאן ברזל, inalienable property. The letters in the word ברזל, correspond to the respective first letters in the names of Jacob's wives רחל-לאה-בלהה-זלפה.</p>

              <p>Our sages also say that He who guarded the patriarchs also will protect their children (Shir Hashirim Rabbah 32,8). Let us now simply view Eliezer's position in Abraham's household as analogous to Mattaron's position in G–d's &quot;household.&quot; Eliezer was described both as &quot;the senior member of Abraham's household in charge of all that belonged to Abraham,&quot; and as עבד, slave; he performed a dual task. When Abraham dispatched this senior member of his household on a mission down here on earth, G–d despatched someone of similar rank from His own &quot;household&quot; to assist Eliezer. When Abraham had assured Eliezer that &quot;G–d will send His angel ahead of you&quot; (Genesis 24,7), he had referred to Mattatron. We are entitled to view him in this connection as עבד עברי. Although Eliezer was a Caananite, we are entitled to to view him in this connection as an עבד עברי, for he was the physical property of a Jew, an עברי. G–d therefore dispatched an angel who embodied the mystical properties of עבד עברי.</p>

            <summary>The Kli Yakar on Genesis 1:1:3 discusses how the Torah and Israel are both called &quot;reshit&quot; and serve as an introduction to the knowledge of God's existence, which is publicized through faith in His creation and Divinity. The Ramban on Exodus 23:20:1 indicates that the Israelites were warned about sinning and God's withdrawal of His presence due to the golden calf incident. Rashi on Exodus 14:14:1 explains that &quot;He will fight on your behalf&quot; is the meaning of the phrase &quot;ילחם לכם.&quot; The Kli Yakar on Genesis 1:1:5 emphasizes the importance of recognizing God's existence through the transmission of knowledge and the Torah, while discussing how different levels of intellect perceive and sanctify God. The Kli Yakar on Genesis 14:19:1 explains how Melchizedek's title for Abraham reflects God's involvement in the world. Rabbeinu Bahya on Genesis 32:4:8 describes how Jacob sent both human and celestial messengers to Esau, and the Siftei Chakhamim on Exodus 32:34:1 discusses the use of &quot;לך&quot; in connection with the verb &quot;דבור.&quot; The Ramban on Genesis 17:1:1 explains the significance of the names &quot;E-il&quot; and &quot;Sha-dai&quot; in relation to God's power and miracles. Gevia Kesef 14:40 and 14:41 analyze the oath regarding the multiplication of Abraham's seed, and Da'at Zekenim on Exodus 33:12:1 highlights Moses' disappointment at not being informed about the angel sent to lead the Israelites.</summary>

              <p>ואתה לא הודעתני, “and You have not informed me;” Moses means that not only did G–d not inform me of details about the angel which He had said that He would send to walk ahead of the Jewish people (Exodus 32, 34) ; it is not only that You Yourself will not walk in front of us, but You did not even name the angel You have assigned for this task. We are now no better off than any human being on earth, each one of whom has an angel walking in front of him. (Compare Psalms 91,11) where David refers to this with the words: כי מלאכיו יצוה לך לשמר לך בכל דרכיך, “for He will order His angels to guard you wherever you go.” Seeing that this is so, how do I benefit from Your having told me that I have found favour in Your eyes? Even Avraham’s servant, Eliezer, had been assured of the same kind of angel, without having been told by G–d that he had found favour in His eyes? (Compare Genesis 24,7)</p>

              <p>One could ask why this reward and recompense is stated by the Lord as “because thou hast done this thing”; after all, what is promised here is the great multiplication of his seed, and that was something already promised to him by the Lord on many occasions—what does the Lord introduce here that is new? The answer is that what is new is contained in the words “By myself I have sworn,” (95. V. 16. This answer is similar to the answers of Ibn Ezra, Nachmanides, and Kimḥi. Kaspi, however, is the only one to adduce proof from Gen. 24:7.)  for up to that point the Lord had never taken an oath on this matter (regarding his seed) that meant to say that the decree (of multiplication of seed that had been previously mentioned) was as necessary as tomorrow’s sunrise. Accordingly this (oath) constitutes a great and merciful innovation.</p>

              <p>And also [difficult] is that the writer of the Akeida [commentary - R. Yitschak Arama] based this explanation on the midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 1:12), &quot;'And Your humility enlarges me' (Psalms 18:36); A king of flesh and blood mentions his name first and afterwards his acts, but the Holy One, blessed be He, mentioned His name after He mentioned His acts;&quot; and what His humility is in this needs to be understood; and that which it says &quot;made me great,&quot; in what way did He enlarge us and make us great? And what appears most likely to me, is to say that Rashi wanted to fix all of this when he said that &quot;this text says nothing if not 'interpret me' - [the term reshit, literally, the start or head of is used here] because of the Torah and Israel which are [both] called reshit;&quot; which means to say that it is impossible to know about God's existence, may He be blessed, except through the Torah and Israel. That's why they are called reshit, since they are both an introduction through which one comes to the knowledge of God's existence, may He be blessed [and so precede the name of God in the first sentence of the Torah.] Since the Torah publicizes faith in His creation and Divinity, may He be blessed. And Israel also knew to publicize the existence of God, may He be blessed, from the angle of the transmission that they received, one person from another, back to Adam who saw the world destroyed and built, and is a faithful witness to the creation of the world, which is a sign [indication] of its Creator; and this transmission was spread by the offspring of Avraham, Yitschak and Yisrael.</p>

              <p>However, not many will have the wisdom needed for this approach of investigation, to come to the secret of God, as a result of man's passage through this dimmed valley of the material world; hence it is enough for man to grasp His existence, may He be blessed, from the angle of the transmission as mentioned and from the angle of the Torah as mentioned. And about this the Sages, of blessed memory, have said (Chullin 91b) that the lower ones mention His name, may He be blessed, after two words, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:4), &quot;Hear Yisrael, the Lord,&quot; but the upper ones don't mention the Name until after three words, as it is stated (Isaiah 6:3), &quot;Holy, holy, holy [is] the Lord.&quot; Because the intellectual power of the upper ones is pure and clean and it is easy for them to handle the essence of the investigation of these three worlds; therefore they are not allowed to mention the Name except after three holinesses, which means that they first cognate the essence of all those that exist below and understand the place of each and, through this, sanctify Him, may He be blessed, below. And from there they go up to understand the essence of all those that exist in the middle world and they sanctify Him, may He be blessed, to reign also upon them. And from there they go up to also understand their own essence, and from there they go up to grasp His name, may He be blessed; hence they do not mention the Name until they sanctify Him first in all three worlds. But the lower ones' intellects are not so pure, and not every person is able to handle this investigation since it is great; hence it is enough for them to come to recognize the existence of God, may He be blessed after the two words, &quot;Hear Israel;&quot; since &quot;Hear&quot; is to listen to the words of this Torah which publicize His divinity, may He be blessed; &quot;Israel&quot; is the transmission that spread in Israel from Adam to Abraham, who announced and publicized His divinity, may He be blessed, as Rashi explained on the verse (Genesis 24:7), &quot;Lord God of the heavens that took me from the house of my father;&quot; and from [Avraham], His divinity, may He be blessed, was publicized in all of the offspring of Israel and Yehuda, as it is stated (Psalms 76:2), &quot;God is known in Yehuda, in Israel His name is great.&quot; Thus it is stated, &quot;In the beginning, created&quot; and afterwards, &quot;God,&quot; to hint to the three [ways of knowing God's existence]: since reshit [beginning of] indicates Israel and the Torah, that are [both] called reshit; and through the creation [hence the word &quot;created&quot;], God was made known [directly through the mode of investigation]. And this is the way of modesty, by which He - in a hint - had the name of Israel precede His name, may He be blessed, [since &quot;reshit&quot; precedes &quot;created&quot;] and that is truthfully glorious splendor and greatness [that He gave] to Israel; hence it is stated &quot;And Your humility enlarges me.&quot; And some say that this humility is what He was involved with at first, for the needs of His world, and [only] afterwards did He publicize His name, may He be blessed.</p>

              <p>וישלח יעקב מלאכים לפניו אל עשו אחיו ארצה שעיר שדה אדום “Yaakov sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau to the Mountain of Se-ir the land of Edom.” The word מלאכים includes both messengers dispatched by human beings and messengers dispatched by G’d. Seeing that at the time Yaakov had been forced to flee to Padan Aram due to his fear of his brother Esau, he now made an attempt to assuage Esau’s hurt feelings and to ask his goodwill by sending messengers, i.e. servants, members of his household. These messengers were accompanied by the messengers (angels) who had met him at Machanayim as we had read in the previous paragraph. In this matter he acted just as had his grandfather Avraham when he had sent Eliezer on an errand to secure a wife for Yitzchak when he had prayed to G’d and had assured Eliezer that a celestial messenger would assist him in his quest (compare Genesis 24,7 “He will send His angel ahead of you.”) I already explained in that connection that the angel preceded Eliezer at the well. Something similar happened here in that the angels G’d had sent to meet Yaakov and who went with the messengers whom Yaakov sent out with the gifts preceded the gifts and thus prevented Esau his brother from harming Yaakov. All of this is based on the fact that the word מלאכים can have either of the two meanings we mentioned earlier. If we need to look for proof that celestial messengers were involved here also, all we need to look at are the words: וישובו המלאכים אל יעקב לאמור, “the messengers returned to Yaakov saying, etc.” If these returning messengers had been human beings, the Torah should have reported: “the angels came to Esau and told him such and such; subsequently they returned to Yaakov reporting that they had carried out their instructions.” The Torah does not mention any of this. This proves that the messengers in question were celestial creatures and the words (verse 7) in which the Torah reports a reply by the messengers telling him that Esau approaches with 400 armed men indicate that they answered Yaakov (וישובו) without having bothered to first go there. They had been there and they knew that Esau approached with hostile intentions.  When the Torah continues in that same verse with the words באנו אל אחיך, “we have come to your brother,” this refers to human messengers; this is why the Torah had to report things in a sequential manner, i.e. that the messengers returned and told Yaakov they had completed their mission.</p>

              <p>‘E-IL SHA-DAI.’ These are two distinct Divine names, each one descriptive in itself. (And not as Abraham ibn Ezra has it, i.e., that they both constitute one descriptive noun: “a G-d who is almighty” and “an almighty G-d.”)  Now the meaning of the word eil is “mighty”, derived from the expression, Eilei Moab (the mighty ones of Moab). (Exodus 15:15.)  The meaning of Sha—dai, according to Rashi, is “He whose G-dship suffices for every creature.” In the book Moreh Nebuchim (I, 63 (toward the end).)  the Rabbi (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Rambam). See Seder Bereshith, Note 139.)  explained that the name Sha—dai signifies “he who is sufficient.” That is to say, He does not require the existence of what He created or the conservation of any other being; rather, His existence is self-sufficient. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained in the name of the Nagid (Shmuel Hanagid. In our text of Ibn Ezra, it appears anonymously as “And many explain.”)  that the name is from the root shodeid, meaning “victor and prevailer over the hosts of heaven.” This is the correct interpretation, for the name Sha—dai represents the attribute of power which conducts the world, concerning which the Sages have said that it is “the attribute of Justice of the world below.” (Bereshith Rabbah 35:4.)  The reason for mentioning this Divine Name now is that with it are done the hidden miracles (All miracles which a man can deny, saying that they are part of the natural order, are called “hidden,” while those that cannot be denied but are clearly the intervention of the power of G-d are called “open.” (Ma’or Veshamesh.) This concept is a major foundation in Ramban’s thinking. It will appear in many other places in a more developed manner. See e.g., further, 46:15; Exodus 6:2; Leviticus 26:11.)  for the righteous, to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine, (Psalms 33:19.)  as well as to redeem them in war from the power of the sword, (See Job 5:20.)  just as all the miracles done to Abraham and to the other patriarchs, and as all the blessings and curses mentioned in the Torah in the section Im Bechukothai (Leviticus 26:3-46.)  and in the section Vehaya Ki Thavo. (Deuteronomy 28:1-69.)  These blessings and curses are all miracles for it is not in nature that the rains should come in their due season (Leviticus 26:4.)  when we worship G-d, nor are the skies to be like iron (Ibid., Verse 19.)  if we plant our fields in the seventh year, and similarly all promises in the Torah. Rather, they are all miracles by which the disposition of natural law is overpowered, except that no change from the natural order of the world is noticeable, as was the case with the miracles done through Mosheh Rabbeinu with the ten plagues, the dividing of the Sea, the Manna, the well, and their like, for these are miracles which openly changed nature, and they were done with the Tetragrammaton which He told to him. It is for this reason that He now told Abraham our father that He is the Almighty, the Victor Who will prevail over his constellation of birth so that he will have a son, and thus there will be a covenant between Him and his seed forever, meaning that the portion of the Eternal is His people, (Deuteronomy 32:9.)  and that He will lead them at His own will, as they will not be under the rule of a star or constellation. Know and consider that our father Abraham did not mention the Tetragrammaton [Eternal] in any of his utterances except in combination with the Divine Name written [G-d], (Such as in 15:2 above.)  or in combination with E-il Elyon [G-d Most High], (Ibid., 14:22.)  but he did mention in his affairs the name Elokim [G-d]. Thus he will say, The Eternal, the G-d of heaven. (Further, 24:3.)  He said, however, the Eternal seeth, (Ibid., 22:14. In this case Abraham used the Tetragrammaton (Eternal) by itself. This would contradict the principle stated by Ramban above that Abraham never used this Divine Name except in some combination with another Name. Ramban answers that since the reference there is to the Sanctuary which was destined to be built on that mountain in the future and where the sacrifices were to be brought, the Tetragrammaton is the proper name to be used, as will be explained in the beginning of the book of Leviticus when sacrifices are discussed.)  because it refers to the place of the future Sanctuary. Jacob, on the other hand, always mentioned E-il Sha-dai [G-d Almighty], (Ibid., 43:14; 48:3.)  which Moses our teacher never mentions. If you will be worthy you will understand this entire matter from that which the Rabbis said in Tractate Yebamoth: (49b.)  “All prophets contemplated Deity through an unlucid speculum,” which is why Isaiah said, And I saw G-d, (Isaiah 6:1.)  [i.e., the Divine Name written Aleph Dalet]. “But Moses contemplated Deity through a lucid speculum.” This is why He said, For a man shall not see Me and live, (Exodus 33:20.)  whereas Isaiah’s verse, and I saw G-d, (Isaiah 6:1.)  is written with the Aleph Dalet. I will mention this theme again in Parshath Va’eira (Ibid., 6:2.)  if G-d will look upon my grief. (A personal reference of Ramban to the difficult times in his life when he was engaged in the writing of this work.) </p>

              <p>Be that as it may, Moshe’s loneliness is not exactly the same as Ya’akov’s. Since Ya’akov had certain advantages in this regard, he is able to create bonds with his foreign wives that Moshe is not. One such advantage is that he is able to marry his cousins, even if he didn’t know them until he moved out of his home. Moreover, his exile was to a land that his grandfather Avraham could still refer to as “his land and his birthplace” (Bereshit 24:4; Bereshit 24: 7). (Bereshit 24:4, 7.)  Granted, it is neither Ya’akov’s land nor his birthplace, but neither was it completely foreign. In contrast, when Moshe goes to Midian, it is to an altogether foreign place and foreign family. Yet even after taking all these differences into account, Moshe’s highly unusual relationship with his wife and children needs further analysis.</p>

Angels holding shofars search for lost sparks of holiness, and even tzaddikim can sometimes be lost in their search.

Look and see the wonders of our Torah, for the initial letters of the [first two and last two] words of this verse spell ELUL, and in the middle are the words “the woman is willing.” Through the concept of Elul, i.e., the deeper theme of Elul’s Kabbalistic meditations, the woman is willing, since this makes her want him.</p>

              <p>When a Man Rectifies the Blemish to the Covenant, if He is Unmarried He Finds His Wife, and if He is Married His Wife is in Accord with His Will / A Person Must Not Eat Unripe Fruit / Fruit that is Picked Before its Time Can Draw the Life Force of the Person Who Eats it / By Reciting the Blessing over Fruit with Concentration and Awe of God, One Can Find Lost Sparks of Holiness in it / Angels Holding Shofars Search for Lost Sparks of Holiness and Blow on Their Shofars When They Find Them / People Lose Sparks of Holiness Because of Their Desires / Even Tzaddikim Who Search for Lost Sparks of Holiness are Sometimes Lost Themselves In Elul a person should bear in mind the intention to rectify the blemish to the covenant. That rectification illuminates a “path in the sea.” Should a man does not achieve that rectification, if he is unmarried he may find it hard to find his wife. And even if he finds her, she may oppose him and not accept his will. This happens because he turned away from malkhut and did not illumine her. Thus, malkhut, as embodied in the form of a physical wife, has a will that opposes his. A man can rectify this in the month of Elul. Then he can find his wife and she will not oppose his will. Our patriarch Abraham imparted this secret to his servant Eliezer when he sent him to find a wife for Isaac. Abraham said, “If the woman is not willing to go after you (ואם לא תאבה האשה ללכת אחריך,Ve-im Lo toveh ha’ishah Lalekhet Acharekha)” (Genesis 24:8). The initials of the first two and last two words of this verse spell ELUL (אלול) and in the middle are the words toveh ha’ishah (תאבה האשה, the woman is willing). Through the mystical intentions of Elul, the woman is willing, since this makes her want him. A person must avoid eating fruit that is not fully ripe. Just as it is forbidden to cut down a tree before its time (Deuteronomy 20:19), one should not pick or eat a fruit before its time. As long as the fruit is on the tree, it has a “pulling” power with which it draws its nourishment and vitality. It loses this power after it fully ripens. If it is picked before its time, that “pulling” power is still present in it, and will draw the life force of the person who eats the fruit. Then that person can lose his soul. However, one who recites the blessing over the fruit with concentration and awe of God can be saved from this. One who is strong in his service of God can even extract more vitality from the unripe fruit and find lost sparks of holiness there. Cooking unripe fruit does not make it suitable to eat. One should allow it to ripen on its own before eating it. In general, a person should be careful about reciting the blessings over food and drink, and especially the blessings over fruit, because fruits contain many lost sparks of holiness that need to be extracted and elevated. There is an angel with many appointees, all of whom hold shofars in their hands. They stand and dig constantly, searching for lost sparks of holiness. As they dig and search, they sound the tekiah-teruahtekiah on their shofars. When they find something, it generates a great noise and much joy. People lose sparks of holiness as a result of their desires. Even the tzaddikim who search for these lost sparks of holiness are sometimes lost themselves. The verse, “The desire of the wicked will be lost” (Psalms 112:10) hints at the activity of the angels searching for lost things. The initial letters of the Hebrew words of this verse, Ta’avat Resha’im Toveid (תאות רשעים תאבד), stand for Tekiah-teRuah-Tekiah (תקיעה תרועה תקיע). The mystical intentions of Elul, which rectify the blemish of the covenant; the prohibition against eating unripe fruit; and the angels holding shofars and searching for lost sparks of holiness, are all one idea. For the Month of Elul Gather Your Scattered People “I am my Beloved’s and my Beloved is mine, Who shepherds among the lilies.” My Father in Heaven, “my King and my God, I pray to You.”</p>

            <summary>Abraham told Eliezer not to take a wife for Isaac from the daughters of Canaan, but rather from the daughters of Aner, Eshkol, or Mamre. If the woman refuses, Eliezer would be absolved from the oath, but Isaac must not be brought back to the land of Abraham's birthplace. The oath was specific to not marrying a Canaanite woman, which is why Eliezer was not released from the entire oath, just a part of it. Abraham wanted Isaac to remain in the land of Israel, as he was the root of the family.</summary>

He would still be obligated to look for a suitable wife for Yitzchok. According to this interpretation, we must assume that the “friends” of Avraham, Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre, were not of Canaanitic descent.</p>

              <p>רק את בני לא תשב שמה, “as long as you do not bring my son back to the land from which I emigrated.” The words: “bring back”, is somewhat strange seeing that Yitzchok had never been in Charan, having been born in Canaan. Although Yitzchok had indeed never been in Charan, the term שיבה for “returning” is applicable to him because of Eliezer who had been going to the land of Canaan with Avraham and now as Yitzchok’s emissary (accepting tokens of marriage) While it is true that this was not a return in the full sense of the word, Eliezer had already been there with Avraham before the latter left Charan. We find a similar situation in Ruth 2,6, when Ruth is “returning” to the land of Israel with her mother-in-law Naomi, and although Ruth had never been there before, she too is described by one of Boaz’s hired hands as “returning” from the land of Moab. The reason why she was so described was that she was accompanying her mother-in-law who was definitely returning in the full sense of the word.</p>

              <p>THEN THOU SHALT BE CLEAR FROM THIS MY OATH. Abraham did not permit him to take a wife for Isaac from the daughters of Canaan, but he would be free [from the oath if Isaac were to do it on his own] and the Eternal do that which is good in His sight. (II Samuel 10:12.)  But Rashi wrote, “And take a wife for him from the daughters of Aner, Eshkol or Mamre.” Now if they were Canaanites, far be it from him! And in truth they were of the seed of Canaan for Scripture says, Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshkol, and brother of Aner. (Above, 14:13.)  And in Bereshith Rabbah, the Rabbis have said: (59:11.)  “That thou shalt not take a wife, etc. (Verse 3 here.)  He warned him against the daughters of Canaan, Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre.” For it was with reference to Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre that Abraham said, Among whom I dwell, (Verse 3 here.)  since he did not dwell among all the Canaanites as they were many nations. But he warned him against these his confederates, and all the more against the others. But the verse, Then thou shalt be clear from this my oath, means that the servant would be free from the oath if Isaac would want to do it on his own, and Abraham relied on his knowledge that his righteous son Isaac would listen to his father and that he would beware of them and go instead to Ishmael or to Lot and the other nations. It is possible that from this my oath is a hint to that which he said, And thou shalt take a wife unto my son from there, (Verse 7 here.)  since perhaps the oath was for everything, [meaning that the oath covered two points: a) that he should not take for him a wife from the daughters of Canaan, and b) that he should go to his family. In case they refused, he would be free from the second oath, while the first oath would always remain in effect]. Accordingly, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath does not allude to that which Abraham told him, Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, (Verse 3 here.)  [since he never freed him from this oath]. This explains the word zoth (this) — [thou shalt be clear from ‘this’ my oath — implying there was another oath from which he was not freed]. Therefore, the servant said, That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left, (Further, Verse 49.)  and he did not say, “I would return [to the land of Canaan,” since he was not freed from the oath not to take a wife from the daughters of Canaan].</p>

              <p>ונקית משבועתי זאת, “and you will be absolved from this oath to me.” According to Rashi, this implied that under the circumstances just described, Eliezer would be free to take one of the daughters of Oner, Eshkol, or Mamre, Avraham’s closest allies I the land of Canaan..     Nachmanides is appalled at the thought that Avraham would have given his consent for Yitzchok to marry a daughter of these Canaanites, the Torah having described Mamre specifically as an Emorite (Genesis 14,13). In fact, according to Bereshit Rabbah, the warning not to marry Canaanite girls was aimed especially at these girls of Oner Eshkol and Mamre as Avraham had specifically described himself as dwelling in their land. (quoting from Eliezer’s speech at the house of Bethuel). Therefore, Avraham’s warning was directed specifically at girls from Yitzchok’s immediate environment. Seeing that Avraham entertained covenantal relations with these three Emorites it would have seemed natural to reinforce such ties by intermarriage between these families.     It is quite possible that Eliezer’s oath applied to all Canaanites, and that although Eliezer would be released from the part of the oath directing him to find a wife for Yitzchok from Avraham’s family, but he would not be released from the part forbidding him to select a Canaanite wife for him. This is why Avraha,m did not say (comprehensively) “you will then be released from your oath,” but משבועתי זאת, “from this (part) oath.” Eliezer had also threatened to “turn right or left,” he had not threatened to return to Canaan to look further. He could have had in mind either Ishmael, or the family of Lot.    </p>

              <p>“Abraham said to him: Beware lest you return my son there” (Genesis 24:6).  “The Lord, God of the heavens, who took me from my father's house, and from my birthplace, and who spoke to me, and who took an oath to me, saying: To your descendants I will give this land; He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there” (Genesis 24:7).  “Abraham said to him: Beware…the Lord, God of the heavens, who took me from my father’s house” – this refers to his father’s house. “And from my birthplace” – this refers to his neighborhood. “And who took an oath to me” – in Ḥaran. “And who spoke to me” – [at the covenant] between the pieces. (See Genesis 15:1–21.)  “He will send his angel before you” – Rabbi Dosa said: This refers to a particular angel. (Some say this refers to the archangel Metatron.)  At the moment that Abraham our patriarch said: “He will send his angel before you,” the Holy One blessed be He designated two angels for him; one to bring out Rebecca, and one to accompany Eliezer.  “And if the woman will not wish to follow you, you shall be absolved from this oath of mine; only you shall not return my son there” (Genesis 24:8).  “And if the woman will not wish…only [rak] you shall not return my son there” – rak is a term of exclusion, [intimating:] My son will not return there, but my grandson [Jacob] will return.</p>

            <summary>The Creation report in Shenei Luchot HaBerit discusses the concept of קליפה preceding light, symbolizing the periods of exile Israel would endure before the Messiah. Jacob represents unmixed goodness, as seen in the word טוב instead of טוב. Abraham's instructions to Eliezer regarding Isaac's marriage hint at Jacob's future role in retrieving his wives from his grandfather's homeland. Jacob's tending of the flock symbolizes his inalienable connection to his wives, as indicated by the letters in the word ברזל corresponding to their names.</summary>

                <h4>Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Chayei Sara, Torah Ohr 16</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>All this is contained in the report of the Creation. The קליפה preceded light since the Torah speaks of Tohu vavohu and darkness as extant before G–d commanded &quot;let there be light.&quot; Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 2,4 understand the four words והארץ תהו ובהו חשך in that verse as alluding to the four periods of exile Israel would have to endure before the coming of the Messiah. The words יהי אור are the reference to that period in our history which will unfold at the end of the periods of exile. The true &quot;good,&quot; unmixed with evil, is represented by Jacob; he represents the very essence, &quot;kernel&quot; of the tree of life that is described as being in the &quot;center&quot; of the garden. When the Torah says וכל טוב אדוניו בידו, &quot;and all the goodness of his Master in his hand&quot; (Genesis 24,10), this Tuv instead of Tov, refers to absolute good, not something merely relatively good i.e. Tov. The word Tuv means &quot;goodness par excellence.&quot; Abraham explained this to Eliezer when he sent him on the mission to get a wife for Isaac and said &quot;the Lord, the G–d of Heaven who has taken me from my father's house and from my birthplace.&quot; Rashi says that the words מבית אבי, refer to Charan, whereas the words מארץ מולדתי, refer to Ur Kasdim. Our sages in Sanhedrin 19, commenting on Isaiah 29,22:&quot;Jacob who redeemed Abraham,&quot; say that G–d only saved Abraham from Nimrod's furnace on account of Jacob's merit. This whole statement will be explained in detail in פרשת תולדות. Thus it becomes clear that the whole purpose of Isaac's marriage was to enable Jacob to be born from that union. This is why Abraham hinted to Eliezer &quot;you must on no account bring my son there&quot; (24,6). The implication is that &quot;my grandson&quot; may return there. He will have to go back there to retrieve his &quot;lost&quot; part, i.e. Rachel, Leah, Zilpah and Bilhah. This is why Jacob שמר את הצאן, &quot;tended the flock,&quot; and our sages understand this term as similar to the Talmudic צאן ברזל, inalienable property. The letters in the word ברזל, correspond to the respective first letters in the names of Jacob's wives רחל-לאה-בלהה-זלפה.</p>

            <summary>The Midrash Tanchuma relates the law of the leper to the power of the tongue, emphasizing that slander is more harmful than murder, adultery, or idolatry. Slander is compared to a dart that can harm from a distance, leading to spiritual death. Examples from Scripture, such as Doeg and Miriam, illustrate the consequences of speaking evil against others. The primeval serpent was cursed with leprosy for speaking slander against God, symbolizing the lasting consequences of harmful speech.</summary>

                <h4>Midrash Tanchuma, Metzora 2:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(Lev. 14:2:) “This shall be the law of the leper.” This text is related (to Prov. 18:21), “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” Everything depends on the tongue. [If] one is acquitted, he is acquitted for life; [if] one is not acquitted, he is condemned to death. [If] one is engaged in Torah with his tongue, he is acquitted for life, inasmuch as the Torah is a tree of life, as stated (in Prov. 3:18), “[Wisdom] is a tree of life to those who take hold of it.” It (i.e., the Torah) is also one's healing for the evil tongue (i.e., slander), as stated (in Prov. 15:4), “A healing tongue is a tree of life.” But if one is occupied with slander, his soul is condemned to death, since slander is more harmful than the shedding of blood. Thus whoever kills takes only one life, but the one who speaks slander kills three people: the one who tells it, the one who accepts it, and the one about whom it is told. (PRK 4:2; Lev. R. 26:2; Numb. R. 19:2; Deut. R. 5:10; M. Pss. 12:2; yPe’ah 1:1 (16a).)  Doeg spoke slander against Ahimelech; and he (i.e., Ahimelech) was killed, as stated (in I Sam. 22:16), “But the king said, ‘You shall surely die, Ahimelech.’” Saul also was killed, [as stated] (in I Chron. 10:13), “So Saul died for the treachery which he had committed against the Lord.” And thus did Saul say (in II Sam. 1:9, to a young man), “Please stand over me and slay me, for death throes have seized me.” [The young man was] the accuser (Gk.: kategoros.)  of Nob, the city of priests [against Saul]. Now death throes (shbts) can only denote priesthood, since it is stated (in Exod. 28:13 with reference to high-priestly dress), “And you shall make gold brocade (rt.: shbts).” Doeg also was uprooted (shrsh) from the life of this world and from all life in the world to come. Thus it is stated (in Ps. 52:7), “God will also tear you down for ever; He will seize you, tear you away from your tent, and uproot (shrsh) you from the land of the living. Selah,” [i.e., He will uproot you] from life in the world to come. Who is more severe? One who smites with the sword or [one who] smites with the dart? Say the one who smites with the dart. The one who smites with the sword is only able to kill his companion if he draws near to him and touches him; but in the case of one who smites with the dart, it is not so. Rather one throws the dart wherever he sees him. Therefore, one who speaks slander is comparable to the dart, as stated (in Jer. 9:7), “Their tongue is a sharpened dart; it speaks deceit.” It also says (in Ps. 57:5), “people, whose teeth are spears and darts, and whose tongue a sharp sword.” See how harmful slander is, in that it is more harmful than adultery, shedding blood and idolatry. (M. Pss. 52:2.)  Of adultery it is written (in Gen. 39:9, where Joseph is addressing Potiphar's wife), “then how shall I do this great evil and sin against God?” Of shedding blood it is written (in Gen. 4:13), “My sin is greater than I can bear.” Of idolatry it is written (in Exod. 32:31, with reference to the golden calf), “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin.” But when it (i.e., Scripture) mentions slander, it does not say &quot;great&quot; (in the masculine singular, as in Gen. 4:13), or &quot;great&quot; (in the feminine singular, as in Gen. 39:9 and Exod. 32:31), but &quot;great&quot; (in the feminine plural). Thus it is written (in Ps. 12:4), “The Lord shall cut off all flattering lips, [every] tongue speaking great things (in the feminine plural).” It is therefore stated (in Prov. 18:21), “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” [Another interpretation (of Prov. 18:21), “Death and life are in the power of the tongue”: Do not say, “Since I have license to speak, I am therefore speaking whatever I want.” See, the Torah has already warned you (in Ps. 34:14), “Keep your tongue from evil [and your lips from speaking deceit].” Perhaps you will say that you are suffering a loss. Are you not profiting instead? So the holy spirit proclaims (in Prov. 21:23), “The one who guards his mouth and his tongue guards his soul from trouble (tsarot).” Do not read this as “from trouble.” Instead [read it as], &quot;from leprosy (tsar'at).” Another interpretation (of Prov. 18:21), “Death and life are in the power of the tongue”: Slander is so harmful that one does not produce it from his mouth without denying the Holy One, blessed be He. (M. Ps. 52:2.)  Thus it is stated (in Ps. 12:5), “Those who say, ‘By our tongues we shall prevail; our lips are with us, who is to be our Lord?’” The Holy One, blessed be He, as it were, cried out against those who speak slander (in Ps. 94:16), “Who will stand for Me against evildoers…?” Who can stand against them? And who will stand against them? Geihinnom? But Geihinnom also cries out, “I am unable to stand against them.” [Then] the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “I [will come at them] from above and you (Geihinnom), from below. I will hurl darts from above; and you will turn on them with burning coals from below.” Thus it is stated (in Ps. 120:4), “Sharp darts of the warrior along with burning coals of broom wood.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Do you want to be delivered from Geihinnom? Keep yourselves far away from the deceitful tongue. Then you will be acquitted in this world and in the world to come.” Thus it is stated (in Ps. 34:13), “Who is the one who desires life….” And it is [then] written (in vs. 14), “Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit […].” Thus it is stated (in Lev. 14:2), “This shall be the law of the leper,” to teach you that one who speaks slander will have blemishes come to him, as it is stated, “This shall be the law of the leper (metsora'),” [i.e.] the one who proclaims evil (motsi' ra') (Above, 5:1; ySot. 2:1 (17d); ‘Arakh. 15b; Cf. Lev. R. 16:1.)  will find evil, in that he will have leprosy come upon him. See what is written about Miriam (in Numb. 12:1), “Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses.” Therefore (in vs. 10), “then Aaron turned unto Miriam, and there was [Miriam] with leprosy like the snow.” What is written elsewhere (in Deut. 24:9)? “Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam […].” And is it not all the more so? For if Miriam had this happen, when she only spoke against her beloved brother when he was absent (I.e., she spoke privately to Aaron with no desire to be hostile to Moses. Cf. Sifre, Numb. 12:1 (99:2).)  and was only intending to return him to his wife, how much the more so in the case of one who utters slander against his colleague? What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 24:8)? “Take care with the plague of leprosy [to watch diligently and do according to all that the priests and Levites shall teach…].” So the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, also afflicted with it Aaron, who was high priest. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 12:9), “And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, [i.e.] against Aaron and against Miriam.” Aaron, however, was healed immediately; but Miriam, after seven days, as stated (in Numb. 12:15), “So Miriam was shut up [outside of the camp] for seven days.” Ergo (in Lev. 14:2), “This shall be the law of the leper (metsora').” The one who proclaims evil (motsi' ra') is the one who finds evil (motse' ra'). And thus you find with the primeval serpent, because he spoke slander [to Eve] against his Creator, for that reason he became leprous. (Cf. Gen. R. 19:4.)  What did he say? R. Joshua ben Levi said (citing Gen. 3:5), “’For God knows that on the day that you eat from it, your eyes shall be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.’ He said to her, ‘Every artisan hates his fellow [artisan]. (The saying is proverbial. See Gen. R. 32:2; M. Pss. 11:6.)  Now when [the Holy One, blessed be He,] wanted to create His world, He ate from this tree. So he created His world. You [two] also eat from it. Then you will be able to create like Him.’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said to [the serpent], ‘You have spoken slander. Your end is to be stricken with leprosy.’” It is so stated (in Gen. 3:14), “So the Lord God said unto the serpent, “Because you have done this, more cursed shall you be than all the beasts of the field.” With what did he curse ('araroh) him? With leprosy. Now a curse can only be leprosy, since it is stated (in Lev. 13:52), “for it is a malignant (mam'eret) leprosy.” (The argument assumes that ‘arirah and mam’eret share the same root. So also Exod. R. 3:13.)  R. Huna said in the name of R. Joshua ben Levi, “The scales which are on the snake are his leprosy.” (Gen. R. 20:4.)  And not only that, but when all the deformed are cured in the world to come, the snake shall not be cured. (Tanh. (Buber), Gen. 11:9; Tanh., Gen. 11:8; Gen. R. 95:1.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 3:14), “more cursed shall you be than all the beasts.” From here [we learn] that they all shall be healed, but [the serpent] shall not be healed. People shall be healed, as stated (in Is. 35:5), “Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened….” It is also [written about] the wild beasts and the cattle (in Is. 65:25), “The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion like the ox shall eat straw, but the serpent's food shall be dust”; as he will never be healed, because he [was the one who] brought all mortals down to the dust. And what caused him to have [this punishment]? [It happened] because he had spoken slander.</p>

Rashi's interpretation of vows and oaths is criticized by Ramban, who clarifies that vows can forbid both permitted and forbidden actions, while oaths can only forbid what was previously permitted. Tur HaArokh discusses the lineage of Ard and Naamon, suggesting they were grandsons of Binyamin, and Or HaChaim questions why Joseph had to announce he would fulfill his father's request.

              <p>IF A MAN ‘YIDOR NEDER’ (VOWETH A VOW). “[This means if] a person says: ‘May there be konam (The word konam is a substitute for korban (offering), and is used for a vow of abstinence, meaning, “May this object be forbidden to me in the same way as it is forbidden to have any benefit from a holy offering.”)  upon me that I shall not eat, or that I shall not do such-and-such a thing.’ I might think that even [if he vowed] that he would eat n’veilah (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.)  [which is forbidden by the Torah to be eaten] I apply to him [the verse], he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. (Verse 3.)  Scripture therefore says, to bind his soul with a bond, (Verse 3.)  which means [that he has the power] to forbid [upon himself] that which was [hitherto] permitted to him, but not to allow himself to do that which is forbidden [by means of vowing to do it].” This is Rashi’s language. But the text of the Sifre (Sifre, Matoth 153.)  is not so. Instead the Rabbis taught there [the following explanation] of [the expression] to bind his soul with a bond: (Verse 3.)  “I might think that even if ‘he swore’ (The words “he swore” show clearly that the Sifre is speaking about an oath, while Rashi applied it to a vow.)  to eat n’veiloth and treifoth, (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.)  abominable things and reptiles, I apply to him [the verse], he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. (Verse 3.)  Scripture therefore says, to bind his soul with a bond, (Verse 3.)  which means [that he has the power] to forbid [upon himself] that which was [hitherto] permitted to him, but not to bind himself to do that which is forbidden [by means of vowing to do that which is prohibited by the Torah].” Thus the Rabbis [in the Sifre] mentioned this matter in connection with shevuoth (oaths), and the Rabbi [Rashi] changed it to apply to nedarim (vows). (The language of the verse before us is as follows: If a man ‘voweth a vow’ unto the Eternal, or ‘sweareth an oath’ to bind his soul with a bond. Ramban’s intent is to point out that Rashi, who made his comment on the phrase if a man voweth a vow, and speaks of konam [a term used only in vows], is diverging from the Sifre who gives this explanation on the phrase or sweareth an oath. Since, as will be explained further on, there are important legal differences between vows and oaths, Rashi’s application of the Sifre to the case of a vow [instead of to an oath] is thus incorrect.)  And in my opinion he was not mindful [about this], (In my “Kuntros on Variant Readings in Rashi according to the first print, Reggio 1475,” p. 27 (printed in Berliner’s Rashi, Feldheim, Jerusalem, 5730) I have shown that on the basis of a minor emendation in the text of Rashi [as found in the Reggio edition], Ramban’s criticism of Rashi disappears.)  for the Rabbis have said (Nedarim 2b.)  that in the case of vows one makes the [actual] object [referred to in the vow] forbidden to oneself [as when one says: “May this bread be konam (The word konam is a substitute for korban (offering), and is used for a vow of abstinence, meaning, “May this object be forbidden to me in the same way as it is forbidden to have any benefit from a holy offering.”)  upon me”], and therefore [vows] do not take effect upon non-tangible matters, (Ibid., 13b.)  such as when one says, “A vow be upon me that I shall not speak to you, or that I shall not walk, or that I shall not sleep,” and similar expressions [affecting non-tangible matters]. Now this being so, it would appear that even in the case of a permitted object, if one said: “A vow be upon me that I shall eat today,” or “that I shall eat this loaf,” it is not a [valid] vow since this vow does not have any object at all on which to take effect, but [was expressed in such a way as to impose] a duty upon him [personally] to do it. (In other words, there is no question as to when a person “vows” to eat n’veilah [which is forbidden] that it is invalid, but even if he “vowed” to eat a permissible thing it is also invalid, since we do not find anywhere in the Gemara vows about matters which require one “to get up and do,” but only matters which require one to abstain from certain things. On the other hand, in the case of an “oath,” as where one says “I swear to eat this loaf,” the oath would indeed be valid. Since Rashi applied it to “vows,” it is therefore incorrect, as explained above. — The reason for this distinction between oaths and vows is as follows: An oath takes effect upon the person himself. Hence if he says, “I swear to eat the loaf,” he is obliged to do so. But a vow takes effect upon the object. Hence if he says, “This bread is ‘konam’ to me,” it is a valid vow and he may not eat it. But if he were to say, “A vow be upon me that I shall eat this loaf,” it would be invalid, since it is a contradiction in terms [the statement begins with a reference to a vow, but concludes with — “I shall eat …” — which is appropriate only for an oath].)  And we do not find mentioned anywhere in the Gemara vows about [matters which require one] to “get up and do” [a particular action, but only about matters which require one to abstain from certain things, such as when he says, “May this loaf be konam upon me,” in which case he must fulfill the vow by not eating it]. And although we find in the case of vows [to G-d Who is] on high [that they are valid if uttered in the following manner]: “I undertake upon myself [to bring] a burnt-offering,” (Kinim 1:1.)  or “I undertake upon myself [to bring] a peace-offering” [which would seem to indicate that vows do take effect when expressed as an obligation resting upon a person, and not, as explained above, that they only take effect upon a specific object which itself becomes forbidden], this [vow is valid] because [there is a general principle that] dedicating something [verbally] to the Sanctuary creates an obligation on one’s property exactly as if it had been handed over to an ordinary person. (Therefore when he says, “I undertake upon myself [to bring] a burnt-offering,” it is as if he had actually separated a specific animal to be an offering. Thus his vow attaches to a definite object, and therefore it is valid.)  Or [it may be that] this is a stringency (In other words, even if we are not to resort to the preceding explanation that a verbal promise to the Sanctuary is tantamount to actual delivery of the object, we may yet explain the reason why vows to the Sanctuary are valid, because of a stringency ordained by the Rabbis based on the fact that since ultimately he will set aside a specific animal for his offering, therefore the effect of the vow takes place immediately upon his utterance thereof, and all his property becomes mortgaged to the fulfillment of the vow.)  applicable [only] to vows to the Sanctuary, because they [such vows] involve an object which becomes forbidden to an ordinary person and invested [with sanctity] for the Sanctuary when [the object is actually] set aside [as an offering]; therefore right from the start [when he merely bound himself verbally to separate an animal as an offering at some future date], the obligation created by the vow takes effect upon his property. But the case of [ordinary] vows of utterance [about a secular matter] we have no such rule, because there is no [tangible] object existing at all, neither at the beginning [i.e., at the time of uttering the vow], nor at the end [i.e., at the time that the vow is to be fulfilled]. Similarly, [the expression of the Sifre mentioned by Rashi that] he can “forbid [upon himself] that which was [hitherto] permitted to him, but cannot allow himself to do that which is forbidden [by vowing to do that which is prohibited by the Torah]” is a statement which is not correct to make in connection with vows [as Rashi did], because they do take effect on matters of [religious] commandments, just as they do on secular matters [i.e., on matters which do not come within the scope of the commandments]. Thus someone who says in the form of a vow “I will not make a Booth [for the Festival of Tabernacles]” or “I will not put on phylacteries” is indeed forbidden [to make the Booth, or to put on the phylacteries] although he thereby violates a positive commandment. (The reason for this is that since a vow takes effect upon a particular object (see Note 21), he may forbid the use of the particular Booth or of the phylacteries in the fulfillment of the commandment. But he cannot prohibit their use by means of an oath, swearing not to use them, since the oath creates a prohibition on the person, and that is invalid for him to do, since “he has already sworn on Sinai” to fulfill the commandment, and an oath does not take effect upon another oath, as will be explained.)  Similarly a man who vowed not to have [sexual] intercourse with his wife is forbidden [to have such intercourse with her] although he thereby violates a negative commandment. (Exodus 21:10: her food, her raiment, and ‘her conjugal rights’ he shall not diminish. See Vol. II, pp. 356-357, where Ramban discusses at length the nature of this prohibition.)  Similarly, vows take effect to oblige one to observe a negative commandment [although, of course, he already is bound not to transgress it], such as if he vowed not to eat n’veilah (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.)  — [so that if he does it he violates two prohibitions: against eating n’veilah, and against breaking his vow, this principle being deduced] from the words of the Mishnah: (Nedarim 17a. The Mishnah there establishes the distinction that a vow may take effect upon another vow, but one oath may not take effect upon another. From this Ramban deduces the teaching that if an object is prohibited to a person for some reason, such as n’veilah or treifah (see Note 14 above), or indeed any other prohibition, another vow — not to eat it — can still take effect upon that object doubly prohibiting the person from eating it, so that if he does eat it, he violates two prohibitions: one for having eaten n’veilah, and one for having violated his vow.)  “A vow may take effect upon a vow etc.” Thus a vow takes effect to forbid [not only that which was previously permitted, but also to forbid] that which was [already] forbidden [such as when he vows not to eat n’veilah] (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.) , and [a vow takes effect] not to do [something] which he is [commanded to do and] forbidden to transgress [such as the duty to have sexual intercourse with his wife, (Exodus 21:10: her food, her raiment, and ‘her conjugal rights’ he shall not diminish. See Vol. II, pp. 356-357, where Ramban discusses at length the nature of this prohibition.)  as mentioned above], except that vows do not take effect to allow him to actively transgress a negative commandment. (Thus if he vowed to eat the flesh of n’veilah which is prohibited by a negative commandment, the vow takes no effect whatever, so that if he does not eat it he is not punishable for having violated his word.)  But oaths are only able to render forbidden that which was [hitherto] permitted, and they do not apply at all to matters involving commandments, neither to transgress [the prohibition of] a negative commandment [even passively, such as by swearing not to have intercourse with his wife], nor to strengthen its observance [such as by swearing not to eat n’veilah], (N’veilah is an animal that has died a natural death, or was not properly slaughtered. Treifah is an animal suffering from a certain serious organic disease, even if it is properly slaughtered. Both are forbidden to be eaten by law of the Torah. See Vol. III, p. 343, Note 96.)  nor to neglect [the performance of] a positive commandment, such as [by saying]: “I swear that I will not make a Booth,” or “[I swear] that I will not put on phylacteries.” Even to strengthen the performance of a positive commandment [an oath] cannot take effect, so that if a person swears to fulfill a commandment and does not fulfill it, he is not liable for [breaking his] oath either to [the punishment of] stripes [if he deliberately neglects it] or to [bring] an offering [if he neglects it accidentally]. (The punishment for breaking an oath in optional matters deliberately is the same as for transgressing any negative commandment; i.e., stripes (Deuteronomy 25:1-3), and for accidentally breaking it, there is a duty to bring an offering (Leviticus 5:4-13). But if one swears to fulfill a positive commandment [e.g. “I swear to wear phylacteries”] the oath is invalid, because “he has already sworn at Mount Sinai” [to perform all the commandments of the Torah], and an oath does not take effect upon another oath (see Note 27). Therefore if he does not fulfill the commandment, he is responsible for neglect of a positive commandment, but is not subject to stripes or an offering for failure of fulfilling the additional oath, since his oath never took effect.)  But it is permitted for a person to encourage himself [to fulfill a commandment by swearing to do so], for it is written, I have sworn, and have confirmed it, to observe Thy righteous ordinances. (Psalms 119:106. See Nedarim 8a.)  Therefore it is only with reference to swearing [and not, as implied by Rashi, to vows] that one can interpret [the expression] to bind his soul with a bond (Verse 3.)  [as the Sifre does, that he may forbid upon himself that which was hitherto permitted to him, but may not allow himself to do that which is forbidden, by means of swearing to do it]. These are great [i.e., complex and important] laws, and the scholar will find them [explained in the Talmud] in their [proper] places.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>YIDOR NEDER LA’SHEM (VOWETH A VOW ‘UNTO’ THE ETERNAL). The meaning of [the expression] ‘yidor neder la’shem’ is not like that of ‘asher nish ba la’shem (how he — David — swore ‘unto’ the Eternal), (Ibid., 132:2.)  for that [expression mentioned by David] is like ‘vayishava lo’ (and he swore ‘to him’) (This is in reference either to Genesis 24:9, where Eliezer swore to Abraham to find a wife for Isaac from the country of his birthplace, or to Genesis 47:31, Joseph swearing to Jacob that he would bury him together with his fathers. In both cases the meaning of the prepositional lamed [‘lo’] is its literal meaning — “unto him,” and the intention is to say that the oath was “for his benefit.” Likewise the prepositional lamed [in the word la’shem] used by David has its literal meaning — “for ‘the benefit’ [so to say] and glory of G-d,” since the oath concerned his determination to build the House of G-d.)  which means that he swore to him for his [the recipient’s] benefit. But [the use of the prepositional lamed in the case of vows is equivalent to the use of the preposition beth (“by”) (The gist of Ramban’s reasoning is as follows: The prepositional lamed in the case of oaths [in the examples cited above] has the meaning of “to” — to the benefit of the recipient, as is the case of Eliezer where the oath was for the benefit of Abraham. This principle, however, cannot be made to apply to vows, since in our verse it says if a man vows a vow ‘la’shem,’ and the verse is not speaking exclusively about vows to the benefit of the Sanctuary but refers to vows of all sorts, even of secular matters. Hence we must say that the prepositional lamed in vows has the same meaning as the beth [not the lamed] in oaths, which in both cases means “by” — by G-d. In other words, the prepositional lamed in vows and the beth in oaths are identical in meaning. Finally, Ramban will conclude that the Cabala does offer an explanation why a different preposition is used in each case. Thus it is shown that the mystic character of the Sacred Language is deeply embedded in the text of the Torah.)  in the case of oaths, for] in the case of oaths Scripture says: ‘u’vishmo’ (and ‘by’ His Name) shalt thou swear; (Deuteronomy 6:13.)  v’ashbiacha ‘ba’shem’ (and I will make thee swear ‘by’ the Eternal); (Genesis 24:3.)  as I swore ‘lecha’ (unto thee) ‘ba’shem’ (‘by’ the Eternal), the G-d of Israel, saying: Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me; (I Kings 1:30.)  swear ‘li’ (unto me) here ‘bei’Elokim’ (‘by’ G-d). (Genesis 21:23.)  But in the case of a vow Scripture does not say: “he vows ‘ba’shem’ (‘by’ G-d)” but la’shem (‘to’ G-d). The Sages in the Sifre have already alluded to the reason for this matter [the different terminology], saying: (Sifre, Matoth 153. See Vol. I, p. 66, where Ramban quotes this Sifre.)  “What is the difference between vows and oaths? Vows are like vowing (This is the text in the Sifre and in Ramban here. In Genesis, however, Ramban has “swearing” (Vol. I, p. 66). The intent of the texts in both places is equivalent.)  ‘by the life of the King;’ oaths are like swearing ‘by the King Himself.’ Although there is no [clear] proof for this explanation [in Scripture], there is an allusion to it: By the living G-d, and by the life of your soul. I will not leave thee.” (II Kings 4:30. See Vol. I, p. 66, Note 290 where this text is explained in detail.)  And the secret thereof is that the shevuah (oath) is derived from the word shivah [“seven” — alluding to the seven Emanations], for she [wisdom] hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars, (Proverbs 9:1.)  whereas the vow is on [the level of] understanding, the beginning of His way, the first of His works of old. (Ibid., 8:22.)  Thus you find that vows take precedence over the Torah, and therefore they apply to commandments just as to optional matters [as explained above]. Thus all vows are la’shem (“to” the Eternal), whereas all who swear [do so] “by” Him.</p>

              <p>ויהיו בני בלע ארד ונעמן, ”The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman.” 
    [Our author refers to a Rashi on verse 36 in which Rashi quoted Rabbi Moshe Hadarshon who tried to account for the 5 missing families when we compare with the seventy members of Yaakov’s family that descended to Egypt and who are presumed to be the counterpart of the 70 families of the nations at large enumerated in Parshat Noach as the backbone of mankind. You will note that of the 10 sons of Binyamin enumerated in Parshat Vayigash 46,21, only 5 are appearing in our verse. Rabbi Moshe Hadarshon is quoted as saying that Ard and Naamon may have been in their mother’s womb at the time Yaakov traveled to Egypt, so that their inclusion in the families to whom land would be distributed would pose no problem, is itself problematic, as are other aspects. I will now continue to let the author speak. Ed.] 
    As to Rashi’s quoting Rabbi Moshe Hadarshon that Ard and Naaman descended with Yaakov to Egypt, while their mother was pregnant with them, he does so because he could not reconcile their being listed as heads of families, seeing only people who immigrated to Egypt are considered as such.
    Nachmanides writes that if it had been possible to argue that these two had indeed immigrated to Egypt at that time, Rabbi Moshe Hadarshon would not have faced any problem at all. As it is, if these two had been born prior to arrival of their fathers in Egypt, the Torah should have listed 72 descendants of Yaakov traveling, not 70, seeing that at that time 10 sons of Binyamin were alive. On the other hand, if they were born after arrival of their mother or father in Egypt, how could they qualify as heads of families that were entitled to a share in the land of Israel under that heading? This is why Rabbi Moshe Hadarshon concluded that they were in the womb of their mother while their mother traveled with her family to Egypt. If we accept this, we need also to accept the notion that Yocheved was born at the entrance to the gates of Egypt, so that she was included in the number 70 that without her is not complete. All of these explanations are extremely forced and difficult if not impossible to substantiate.
    We may say that Ard and Naamon, the real sons of Binyamin, died in Egypt after having married but before having had children, so that the levirate marriage was performed on their widows and the first child of each of these marriages was named after their deceased father. Seeing that their fathers had been of the family members of Yaakov descending to Egypt, they inherited the right to be regarded as founding members of the people in the distribution of shares in the land of Israel.
    The correct interpretation is that Ard and Naamon who had been listed in Parshat Shemot [there is no such in the Book of Exodus, I presume what is meant is Genesis Ed] as part of the 70 were in fact grandsons of Binyamin, as they are described here where they are listed as sons of Binyamin’s firstborn son Bela. They are listed similarly in Chronicles I [Ard appears there as Adar Ed.] On the other hand, we must remember that grandsons are often described as sons in the Bible. The best known example may be Genesis 29,5 where Lavan is described as the son of Nachor although we have met him as the son of Betuel, (Genesis 24,9) who was a son of Nachor.
    If we were to reconstruct history on the basis of what is logical, we must remember that the whole subject of distribution of the land is not dealt with only in terms of who arrived in Egypt and when, but also in terms of who left Egypt and at what age. The enumerating of “families,” משפחות, is not restricted to the ones who existed prior to the descent into Egypt. Examples are the families of Ephrayim and Menashe, whose founders were born in Egypt. It was an old established custom among the Israelites to establish family heads, a custom not as much in evidence among other tribes. It was a source of pride for the descendants of such family heads (founders) to be able to number themselves as members of their respective families. This custom intensified ever since after the Israelites settled in Egypt they began to multiply at an accelerated rate. It became a sort of unwritten law for everybody to know and treasure and correctly trace his ancestry. In view of the enormous growth of the Jewish people during the years they stayed Egypt, the only way to preserve such identities through a number of generations was to know who the founding father of the family had been. Those who were able to trace themselves back to Yaakov in Canaan did so, others traced themselves back to the most distant founding father that could be established with certainty, even if the founding father of that family did not date back to the period prior to the descent of Yaakov to Egypt. The fact is that most of the families mentioned here were able to trace themselves back to the period preceding Yaakov’s descent to Egypt.

        <summary>Eliezer took ten camels loaded with Abraham's possessions, including a document appointing Isaac as heir, to show the bride's family wealth she would marry into. The camels were muzzled to avoid grazing elsewhere, and were specially trained for Abraham's needs. Eliezer's departure was part of the journey preparations, taking silver and golden trinkets without permission. In Kabbalah, Metatron governs ten grades represented by camels. Midrash discusses Pinchas avenging Midianites for selling Joseph, Jacob setting out with a staff, and Abraham's camels being muzzled. Musar interprets Eliezer's mission to find Isaac's wife as enabling Jacob's birth. Radak, Tur HaArokh, Rashi, Ramban, Hizkuni, Second Temple, Targum, and Tosefta provide additional insights on the events.</summary>

            <summary>Eliezer took ten camels loaded with all of Abraham's valuable possessions, including a document appointing Isaac as his sole heir, to show the family of the potential bride the wealth she would marry into. The camels were muzzled to avoid grazing in other fields, and the camels were specially trained to answer Abraham's specific needs. Eliezer's departure was part of the preparations for the journey, and he took many silver and golden trinkets without needing permission, as all of Abraham's possessions were under his authority. The camels were used to carry the choicest of Abraham's possessions to persuade the bride to move away from her parental home.</summary>

              <p>The Torah adds: וכל טוב אדוניו, &quot;and all the good things of his master,&quot; to tell us that Eliezer took the choicest of all the precious possessions of Abraham. This was in order to persuade the girl in the event that she would initially refuse to move away from her parental home. Seeing that her husband-to-be possessed such wealth might change her mind. The word בידו means the same as שבידו, something that was under Eliezer's control (inasmuch as he was in charge of all of Abraham's possessions).</p>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Bereshit 24:10:1-2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>וכל טוב אדניו בידו, “and with all the bounty of his master in his hand.” Actually, for the sake of accuracy, the Torah should have written ומטוב אדניו, “and with (samples of) all the bounty of his master,” just as it goes on to say מגמלי אדניו from amongst the camels of his master,” (where the Torah also did not write that Eliezer took all the camels.)  According to the plain meaning of the text the verse describes the greatness and superior loyalty of Avraham’s servant. The Torah reveals that Avraham had entrusted all his wealth to be administered by Eliezer, everything was “left in his hand.” Eliezer was in full control. We may understand this verse as similar to Numbers 21,26 ויקח את כל ארצו מידו, “he took his entire land from his hand.” (The reference is to Sichon having taken all of Moav’s land) Clearly, the meaning of the verse is a figure of speech. Here too the Torah employs a figure of speech to describe the status Eliezer enjoyed in Avraham’s household. A Midrashic (Bereshit Rabbah 59,11) approach: the words וכל טוב אדוניו בידו, “all the bounty of his master in his hand,” refer to a document which Eliezer carried in his hand in which Avraham had appointed Yitzchak as his sole heir. Avraham had done this in order to encourage the parents of any bride Eliezer would choose to allow their daughter to marry out of the country. The Torah writes: “in his hand,” to inform us of this. The word וילך, “he went,” is also meant to draw attention to this, as obviously, Eliezer did not “walk” all that way but rode on one of the camels. The combined words וילך וכל טוב אדוניו בידו, are a clear hint that Eliezer walked while holding something in his hand. What did he hold in his hand? “The gift-certificate donating all of Avraham’s wealth to his son Yitzchak,” in the event that he would not be alive when the servant returned. The word וילך appears a second time in the same verse to show that Eliezer set out armed with such a document which was going to be helpful to his mission.  According to this interpretation, the words ויתן אברהם את כל אשר לו ליצחק, “Avraham (now) gave all that was his to Yitzchak,” a verse we find only in 25,5 have been repeated there only in order to forestall any claims by any other children of Avraham to part of his estate. The fact is he had already given his accumulated wealth to Yitzchak before the sons of Keturah had been born. They only shared in possessions Avraham acquired after he had remarried.</p>

              <p>ויקח...וכל טוב, not literally “all the good,” but most of the good things. The exaggeration here is similar to when the Torah describes כל הארץ, “the whole earth” as going to Egypt to buy grain. (Genesis 41,57) What is meant is: “most people from all over.” There are many such “exaggerations.” What the Torah meant was that Eliezer took with him samples of most of the precious possessions in Avraham’s household in order to show the family of the potential bride that she would be marrying into a wealthy family. Our sages (quoted by Rashi) explain the term וכל טוב as referring to a document in which Avraham had appointed Yitzchok as his sole heir. Eliezer brought this document with him, i.e. בידו, “in his hand.”</p>

              <p>AND ALL THE GOODS OF HIS MASTER BEING IN HIS HAND. Rashi comments: “This refers to a deed of gift of all his possessions which he wrote in favor of Isaac so that they would be eager to send him their daughter.” And so it is also stated in Bereshith Rabbah, (59:15.)  “He carried with him a disposition of property.” According to this opinion, the verse stating, And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac, (Further, 25:5.)  means that he caused him to take possession of the belonging at the time of his death so that the other children would not contest his ownership, just as it is said, And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived. (Ibid., Verse 6.)  If so, the word “taking” applies also to the first part of the verse, And the servant ‘took’ ten camels, and departed, and all the goods of his master he took in his hand. Perhaps [the words of the verse are to be transposed as follows]: “And the servant took ten camels and all the goods of his master in his hand, and departed.” Others (This interpretation is found in the commentary of Chizkuni.)  explain the sense of the verse as meaning that immediately upon being sworn, the servant himself went and took many camels from his master’s camels because all his master’s goods were in his hand, he being the officer and captain over all and authorized to take from him whatever he desired, just as the verse says, that ruled over all that he had. (Verse 2 here.)  The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the meaning of this verse is similar to that of the verse concerning Hazael, general of Aram, And Hazael went to meet him [Elisha the prophet], and took a present with him, and every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, (II Kings 8:9.)  [which means “and ‘of’ every good thing of Damascus].” Here too Scripture states that he took in his hand of all his master’s goods ten camels’ burden. The sense of the verse concerning Hazael is that the camels carried all that was good and excellent among those species of fruits and precious things that were found in Damascus or in his master’s house, and in addition they carried a present with them. In a similar sense is the verse, ten asses laden with the good of Egypt, (Further, 45:23.)  [which means laden with the good and excellent fruits of Egypt]. The verses, however, shorten expressions when the subjects are understood.</p>

Auch bei der Rückreise ging er nur zu Fuße und führte Rebekkas Kamel. Unsere Damen scheinen keine kavaliermäßig geübten Reiterinnen gewesen zu sein, sondern des Führers bedurft zu haben, so ja auch die Sunamiterin (Kön. II. 4, 24). Elieser trat also nicht als reicher Kaufmann mit etwa zehn beladenen Kamelen, sondern völlig als Knecht, als bepackter Knecht auf, der herrschaftliche Kamele irgendwohin zu führen hat. Nur so war ja auch die spätere Probe hinsichtlich des Charakters des Mädchens eine wirkliche. Was einem müden bepackten Knechte gegenüber von reiner Menschlichkeit zeugte, konnte einem reichen Kavalier gegenüber alles andere gewesen sein.</p>

              <p>They would go out only muzzled, out of concern for robbery... [Rashi knows this] because it is written (v. 32): “And he removed the muzzles the camels,” which implies that until now they were muzzled. [You might ask: Why was muzzling necessary?] Hashem does not bring wrongdoing to the animals of the righteous, as it says in Chulin 7a! An answer is: Hashem surely does not bring them wrongdoing but Eliezer muzzled them so they will not eat even [what is lying near] the sides of the road. Although the produce there is considered abandoned since the owners assumedly gave up hope [of recovering it], Eliezer the servant of Avraham was very pious and did not wish to benefit from another’s property even when permitted. But Re’m answers that one should not rely on a miracle. [Although Hashem usually protects,] it is different where harm is sure to happen, as the camels were going among other people’s fields. </p>

              <p>He wrote a gift-deed to Yitzchok of all his possessions... [Rashi knows this] because when the verse says: “He departed, and all the property of his master was in his hand,” a new point is being expressed: even though Eliezer departed, all his master’s property was still in his hand. If all the verse means is that the property remained in Eliezer’s possession, why does the verse even need to tell us this? [It would be obvious, so] what is the new point? Furthermore, why did Scripture not tell us this in the previous section, that all his master’s property was in his possession? Perforce, it means that Avraham gave a gift-deed to Yitzchok. But Re’m writes that [Rashi knows this] because there is no other way that all his master’s property would be “in his hand.” Avraham surely would not grant all his money to Eliezer! We need not ask: It is written later (25:5), “Avraham gave all that he possessed to Yitzchok.” Does this not imply that he did not give a gift-deed to Yitzchok beforehand? [An answer is:] Rashi explained there in the name of R. Nechemia [that Avraham gave Yitzchok] the blessing of Hashem, Who had said to Avraham, “And you will be [in control of the world’s] blessing.” Avraham then entrusted the blessings to Yitzchok. A further answer: Avraham acquired possessions after his gift-deed to Yitzchok, during the ten years following Sarah’s death. Avraham, upon his death, bequeathed them to Yitzchok.</p>

Although we already know (25,5) that Yitzchok had been appointed the sole heir, Avraham gave this document to Eliezer in order to encourage the family of the girl Eliezer would choose as Yitzchok’s bride to allow her to leave home and move to a distant land.
Some commentators feel that when the servant (Eliezer) had sworn to his master, he took 10 camels and loaded them with all of Avraham’s portable treasures as he had been instructed to do just that
Nachmanides explains the verse in line with the plain meaning of the text, i.e. that Eliezer took 10 of his master’s camels and loaded them with all the valuable chattels including exotic fruit which Avraham possessed.

            <summary>The text from the Zohar discusses the servant Metatron governing ten grades, represented by ten camels bearing a likeness to his master's camels. In Derech Etz Chayim, it is stated that man has the decision to educate himself and understand or remain without wisdom, with the intellect and Torah sharing similar functions in imparting intelligence.</summary>

              <p>...Behold, that goodness is in his hands and he controls the decision, whether to educate himself and understand or to remain naked of all wisdom, even though the heart and mind are contained within his body.  It is readily apparent that there are two things created sharing similar functions: Man's intellect and and The Torah that imparts the intelligence.  </p>

              <p>Come and behold, It is written, &quot;And the servant took&quot; (Beresheet 24:10). As we have learned, (this refers to Metatron); &quot;ten camels&quot; are the ten grades, which the servant governs. They are a likeness to the above. &quot;Of the camels of his master&quot; means they bear a likeness to his master's camels as we have learned. And this servant rules over them and is established through them.</p>

            <summary>In Sifrei Bamidbar 157:4, it is explained that Pinchas was chosen to take revenge on the Midianites because they had sold Joseph to Egypt. In Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Vayetzei 3:3, it is discussed how Jacob set out with only his staff, contrasting with how Abraham gave all he had to Isaac. Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael, Tractate Nezikin 5:16 and 13:12 explain that &quot;in his hand&quot; signifies possession. In Bereshit Rabbah 59:11, the camels of Abraham were muzzled to prevent them from eating others' vegetation. In Bereshit Rabbah 68:2, it is discussed how Jacob set out empty-handed and was pursued by Esau. Aggadat Bereshit 46:3 discusses how Jacob was protected by God when pursued by Esau. Finally, in Bereshit Rabbah 70:12, Jacob is seen weeping upon meeting Rachel, due to various reasons.</summary>

              <p>[3] Another interpretation: [Genesis 28:10-11] &quot;And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of that place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.&quot; The holy meaning of &quot;He will keep the feet of His holy ones&quot; (1 Samuel 2:9) is that the Holy One, blessed be He, will protect the righteous. This refers to Abraham, who pursued the kings. &quot;Who has stirred up one from the east, whom He calls in righteousness to His feet?&quot; (Isaiah 41:2) And the wicked shall be silent in darkness. These are the eighteen kings whom he slew in darkness, as it is said, &quot;And he divided himself against them by night&quot; (Genesis 14:15). Another explanation of &quot;He will keep the feet of His holy ones&quot; is Jacob, when he went out to go to Haran. For the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;Behold, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go&quot; (Genesis 28:15). &quot;And the wicked shall be silent in darkness&quot; refers to Esau, as it is written, &quot;All darkness is laid up for his treasures&quot; (Job 20:26). &quot;And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Esau for stubble&quot; (Obadiah 1:18). &quot;And the wicked shall be silent in darkness&quot; - when he went out to pursue Jacob in the tenth hour, and the Holy One, blessed be He, brought in the sun and made the day ten hours long, as it is said, &quot;And he lighted upon the place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set&quot; (Genesis 28:11), and Esau was standing in darkness and silence, not knowing where to go. Therefore, it is said, &quot;For by strength shall no man prevail&quot; (1 Samuel 2:9). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;Perhaps you are strong?&quot; Even in the future, He will do the same for Israel, as it is said, &quot;But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble&quot; (Proverbs 4:18-19). If you wonder about this matter, behold, it has already occurred in this world, as it is said, &quot;No man saw his brother&quot; (Exodus 10:23). &quot;May the footsteps of His pious ones be guarded.&quot; When Jacob left his father's house, he only took his staff in his hand, as it is stated: &quot;For with my staff, I crossed this Jordan&quot; (Genesis 32:11). The Holy One Blessed be He said to Isaac, &quot;Just as your father Abraham did, so do for yourself. He did not give you all that he had, as it is stated: &quot;And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac&quot; (Genesis 25:5). And similarly, &quot;And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had&quot; (Genesis 24:2). What is the meaning of &quot;who ruled&quot;? Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak said that he had control over all that Abraham had, and he even said to him, &quot;Even if you lose what I have, take a wife for my son from there.&quot; Immediately, the servant took ten camels and all the good things of his master were in his hand (Genesis 24:10). This demonstrates that the halacha was in his hand (as it is stated: &quot;And Abraham gave all that he had,&quot; Genesis 25:5), and furthermore, the servant began to distribute gifts. To this (i.e. Abraham's actions) we attribute the blessings, and to this (i.e. Isaac's actions) we attribute the rings. And Solomon cried out: &quot;There is one who scatters and yet increases more&quot; (Proverbs 11:24). May the Holy One Blessed be He be praised, as it is stated: &quot;And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). Look at all that Abraham did for Isaac, but Isaac did not do the same for Jacob. Instead, he sent him away empty-handed. The Holy One Blessed be He said to him, &quot;You have withheld from this poor man, from your own lack.&quot; As it is stated: &quot;And yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest; then your poverty will come as a robber, and your want like an armed man&quot; (Proverbs 6:10-11). If Jacob had nothing, the Divine Presence would have departed from him. And he could not speak with him except at the time of his death. Come and see what Esau did to Jacob; he saw him empty-handed and did not have mercy on him. Instead, he said, &quot;Let me go first, and if I cannot pass, then I will kill him.&quot; As it is stated: &quot;Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions...because he pursued his brother with the sword&quot; (Amos 1:11). Jacob turned his eyes to the Holy One Blessed be He and performed miracles for him. He placed his staff in the water, and the Jordan River split apart, as it is stated: &quot;With my staff, I crossed this Jordan&quot; (Genesis 32:11). Esau waited on the way, but Jacob did not pass by there. He felt that he had crossed the Jordan. What did Esau do? He pursued him and came ahead to the place of Makhpelah. Jacob said, &quot;I have neither bread nor anything else with me. I will go in and warm my body in this bath.&quot; Esau surrounded the bath so that Jacob could not leave. Jacob pretended to be dead so that he would not have to leave. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;You are joined against a wicked man. I said, 'Here I am with you, etc.' &quot; Jacob said to him at that time, &quot;You have done this for your name's sake; I am sure of it.&quot; And Jacob went out and encountered the place, and there was no encounter except prayer, as it is said, &quot;Do not pray and do not encounter me&quot; (Jeremiah 7:16). David said, &quot;Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in&quot; (Psalms 121:4-8).</p>

              <p>“The servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and he went, and all his master’s goods in his hand; he arose and went to Aram Naharayim, to the city of Naḥor” (Genesis 24:10).  “The servant took ten camels from the camels of his master…” – the camels of Abraham our patriarch were notable, [in that] everywhere that they would go out, they would go out muzzled. (So that they should not eat vegetation belonging to a private individual.)   “And all his master’s goods in his hand” – Rabbi Ḥelbo said: This refers to his will. (In it, he bequeathed all his belongings to Isaac.)   “He arose and went to Aram Naharayim” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: [He arrived] on that same day. This is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak [elsewhere]: “I came today to the spring” (Genesis 24:42) – today I departed and today I arrived.   “You made the land quake; You shattered it. Heal its shards, for it has toppled” (The Midrash interprets all these descriptions as references to incidents in which someone was able to reach long distances in a short amount of time, as if the ground itself contracted for him.)  (Psalms 60:4). “You made the land quake” – in the days of Abraham; (See Genesis Rabba 43:3.)  “you shattered it” – in the days of Eliezer; “heal its shards” – in the days of Jacob; (See Genesis Rabba 68:8.)  “for it has toppled” – in the days of Yishbi Benov. That is what is written: “Yishbi Benov, who was of the offspring of the giant” (II Samuel 21:16). He wielded his shield, and David leapt backwards eighteen cubits. (From the force of the shield.)  This one feared that one, and that one feared this one. This one [Yishbi Benov] feared [David], saying: ‘If this is how he leaps backwards, what can he do going forward?’ And that one [David] feared this one [Yishbi Benov], saying: ‘If he can wield his shield like this, how can I stand against him?’ David said: ‘If only I had one of my sister’s sons to come and aid me.’ Immediately, “Avishai son of Tzeruya came to his aid” (II Samuel 21:17). Was he standing behind the door [that he arrived so quickly]? That is a rhetorical question. The Rabbis say: Even if he was at the other end of the world, the Holy One blessed be He flew him and brought him in the blink of an eye, so that that righteous one [David] should not have to stand there in distress. That is what is written: “Avishai son of Tzeruya came to his aid and smote the Philistine and put him to death. Then David’s men took an oath [to him, saying]: You will not go out with us to battle [any longer], so that you not extinguish the lamp of Israel” (II Samuel 21:17).  “He made his camels crouch outside the city by a well of water at the time of evening, at the time that the women go out to draw water” (Genesis 24:11).  “He made his camels crouch outside the city” – he had them go on their knees.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman began: (The verse in Psalms is being interpreted as referring to Jacob.)  “A song of ascents. I lift my eyes to the mountains [heharim]” (Psalms 121:1) – I lift my eyes to the parents [hahorim], to my teachers, and to those who raised me. “From where will my help come?” (Psalms 121:1) – Eliezer, when he went to bring Rebecca, what is written in his regard: “The slave took ten camels…” (Genesis 24:10), but I [Jacob] do not have even one nose ring or one bracelet. Rabbi Ḥanina said: He [Isaac] sent him empty-handed. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: He sent with him, (And did not send him empty-handed.)  but Esau arose and took it from him. He then said: ‘What, will I lose my confidence in my Creator? God forbid, I will not lose my confidence in my Creator.’ Instead, “My help is from the Lord” (Psalms 121:2). “He will not let your foot give way; He who watches over you will not slumber” (Psalms 121:3). “Behold, [the Guardian of Israel] neither slumbers nor sleeps…” (Psalms 121:4). The Lord will guard you from all evil&quot; (Psalms 121:7) – from Esau and from Laban; “He will guard your life” (Psalms 121:7) – from the angel of death. “The Lord will guard your going and your coming” (Psalms 121:8) – “Jacob departed.”</p>

              <p>“It was when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the flock of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob approached, rolled the stone from the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother” (Genesis 29:10).  “It was when Jacob saw…Jacob approached, rolled the stone” – like one who is removing a stopper from the mouth of a jug.  “Jacob kissed Rachel, and raised his voice, and wept” (Genesis 29:11).  “Jacob kissed Rachel” – every kiss is for promiscuity except for three: A kiss of greatness; a kiss of reunion; a kiss of parting. A kiss of greatness – “Samuel took the flask of oil, poured onto his head, and kissed him” (I Samuel 10:1). A kiss of reunion – “He went and he met him at the mountain of God and he kissed him” (Exodus 4:27). A kiss of parting – “Orpa kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her” (Ruth 1:14). Rabbi Tanḥuma said: A kiss of kinship as well, as it is stated: “Jacob kissed Rachel,” who was his relative.  “And raised his voice, and wept” – why did he weep? He said: ‘Eliezer, when he went to bring Rebecca, what is written in his regard? “The servant took ten camels from the camels of his master…” (Genesis 24:10), but I do not have even one nose-ring or one bracelet.’  Another matter, why did he weep? It is because he saw that she would not enter into the grave with him. That is what she [Rachel] said to her [Leah]: “That is why he will lie with you tonight” (Genesis 30:15) – he will lie with you, and he will not lie with me. (Lie, in the sense of burial.)   Another matter, why did he weep? It is because he saw people whispering to one another because he kissed her, [saying]: ‘What, has this one come to introduce a matter of lewdness in our midst?’ This is because from the time that the world was stricken in the generation of the Flood, the nations of the world stood and distanced themselves from lewdness. That is what is said: The people of the East are distanced from lewdness.</p>

              <p>“Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebecca’s son, and she ran and told her father” (Genesis 29:12).  “Jacob told Rachel that he was [her father’s] brother, and that he was Rebecca’s son” – if being deceitful, “that he was her father’s brother”; if being righteous, “that he was Rebecca’s son.”  “And she ran and told her father” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A woman is always accustomed only to her mother’s house. He (One of the students.)  raised an objection: ‘But is it not written: “She ran and told her father”?’ He said to him: ‘It is because her mother had died. Who should she have told if not her father?’   “It was when Laban heard the news of Jacob his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, embraced him, kissed him, and brought him to his house. He related to Laban all these matters” (Genesis 29:13).  “It was when Laban heard…” – he [Laban] said: ‘Eliezer was the most defective one of the household, as it is written: “The servant took ten camels”  (The verse states that he was only a servant.)  (Genesis 24:10); this one, who is the most beloved of the household, all the more so. (He will have riches with him.) ’ When he did not see even a knapsack, “he embraced him” – he said: ‘They are dinars and they are in his belt.’ When he found nothing, “he kissed him” – he said: ‘Perhaps they are gems and they are in his mouth.’ When he did not see anything, Jacob said to him: ‘What do you think, that I came bearing money? I came only bearing words’ – “He related to Laban.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:9): HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS. When Jacob set out from his father's house, he set out with only his staff, as stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): FOR WITH &lt; ONLY &gt; MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN. The Holy One said to Isaac: Did your father, Abraham, do this to you? Did he not give you everything that he had? It is so stated (in Gen. 25:5): BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC. &lt; There is &gt; also this (in Gen. 24:2): SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE, THE ONE WHO RULED OVER ALL THAT HE HAD. R. Samuel bar Isaac said: What is the meaning of THE ONE WHO RULED? When he had made him a ruler over all that he had, he said: Even if you &lt; must &gt; give away everything that belongs to me, take a wife for my son from there. (Gen. 24:10:) THEN THE SERVANT TOOK TEN CAMELS FROM THE CAMELS OF HIS MASTER, AND WENT WITH ALL HIS MASTER'S GOODS IN HIS HAND. This refers to a diatheke (The Greek words means “covenant.”)  {gift certificate} which he carried in his hand. (See Gen. R. 59:11 and some versions of PRE 16. Both use the word diatheke in this context. Cf. Gen. R. 61:6.)  (Ergo, in Gen. 25:5:) BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC. The servant began distributing earrings to one woman, necklaces (Lat.: catellae.)  to another, and rings to still another. This is what the text means (in Prov. 11:24): THERE IS ONE WHO DISPENSES LIBERALLY AND STILL INCREASES. The Holy One has blessed him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:11): AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC. But Isaac did not do so for Jacob. Instead he had him set out empty-handed. The Holy One said (in Prov. 11:24, cont.): ANOTHER HOLDS BACK FROM WHAT IS RIGHT, YET THE RESULT IS WANT. And what happened to him (Isaac)? The Divine Presence departed from him. So you find him (the Holy One) speaking with him only when he died. Come and see what Esau the Wicked did to Jacob. He saw him empty-handed and did not show him mercy. Instead he said: See, I am ahead of him, and he cannot pass me on the way. So I will kill him there. And where is it shown? Where the prophet said so (in Amos 1:11): &lt; THUS SAYS THE LORD: FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF EDOM AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT RESCIND IT (the punishment) &gt; BECAUSE HE PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD. Jacob knew &lt; about it &gt; and raised his eyes to the Holy One. Now he had performed miracles with him (Jacob); so he put {his staff for him in his hand} [his staff into the Jordan]. Then the Jordan divided for him, and he crossed. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): FOR WITH MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN. So Esau was waiting on the way, but Jacob did not pass on the way. When Esau perceived that Jacob had fled and crossed the Jordan, what did he do? He pursued him and found him in a cave, a place like the bath that is in Tiberias. (Cf. Gen. R. 75:5.)  Jacob had said: There is no bread and no food at hand. I shall go in and get warm in the bath. Esau the Wicked came and had the bath surrounded the so that he would die in it. The Holy One said to him: &lt; Since &gt; you are the most wicked man in the world, are you to be paired (The verb is related to the Greek noun zeugos (“yoke of beasts”).)  against him? Immediately the Holy One said to Jacob: What are you afraid of? See, I am with you. Jacob said to him: Sovereign of the World, inasmuch as I am trusting you and you are making me a promise, I will have trust [and set out. (Gen. 28:10:) AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA].</p>

              </summary>
              <p>All this is contained in the report of the Creation. The קליפה preceded light since the Torah speaks of Tohu vavohu and darkness as extant before G–d commanded &quot;let there be light.&quot; Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 2,4 understand the four words והארץ תהו ובהו חשך in that verse as alluding to the four periods of exile Israel would have to endure before the coming of the Messiah. The words יהי אור are the reference to that period in our history which will unfold at the end of the periods of exile. The true &quot;good,&quot; unmixed with evil, is represented by Jacob; he represents the very essence, &quot;kernel&quot; of the tree of life that is described as being in the &quot;center&quot; of the garden. When the Torah says וכל טוב אדוניו בידו, &quot;and all the goodness of his Master in his hand&quot; (Genesis 24,10), this Tuv instead of Tov, refers to absolute good, not something merely relatively good i.e. Tov. The word Tuv means &quot;goodness par excellence.&quot; Abraham explained this to Eliezer when he sent him on the mission to get a wife for Isaac and said &quot;the Lord, the G–d of Heaven who has taken me from my father's house and from my birthplace.&quot; Rashi says that the words מבית אבי, refer to Charan, whereas the words מארץ מולדתי, refer to Ur Kasdim. Our sages in Sanhedrin 19, commenting on Isaiah 29,22:&quot;Jacob who redeemed Abraham,&quot; say that G–d only saved Abraham from Nimrod's furnace on account of Jacob's merit. This whole statement will be explained in detail in פרשת תולדות. Thus it becomes clear that the whole purpose of Isaac's marriage was to enable Jacob to be born from that union. This is why Abraham hinted to Eliezer &quot;you must on no account bring my son there&quot; (24,6). The implication is that &quot;my grandson&quot; may return there. He will have to go back there to retrieve his &quot;lost&quot; part, i.e. Rachel, Leah, Zilpah and Bilhah. This is why Jacob שמר את הצאן, &quot;tended the flock,&quot; and our sages understand this term as similar to the Talmudic צאן ברזל, inalienable property. The letters in the word ברזל, correspond to the respective first letters in the names of Jacob's wives רחל-לאה-בלהה-זלפה.</p>

              <p>When Eliezer wondered if his mission had indeed succeeded, i.e. הצליח, this is a reference to the two sons Rebeccah would bear, i.e. both Jacob and Esau. The words אם לא, which are not really necessary, refer to Esau, who represented the unsuccessful part of Eliezer's mission. According to Pardes Rimonim Shaar Heychaley Temarim 6, the tree of knowledge of good and evil is underneath the tree of knowledge of &quot;good.&quot;.

Tur HaArokh discusses the discrepancy in Abraham's birthplace, explaining that he originated from Aram, not Ur of the Chaldeans, and that the family moved to Ur from Cuthah. Rashi comments on the patriarchs' connection to Aram, while Ramban delves into the story of Jacob's ladder, interpreting the location of the events and the significance of Mount Moriah.

Similarly, we find the phrase צמח בלי יעשה קמח, “it grew without developing into flour,” without mentioning all the intermediary stages before relating the outcome. (Hoseah 8,7) The reason we have such formulations is because the author hastens to get to the point of the story.</p>

For had [Athaliah’s sons] not removed the sacred things from the House of the Lord for the Baals, they would have sufficed to repair the Temple. But because they did use them for the Baals, it was necessary to collect money from all Israel. Athaliah and her sons did not remove all the sacred things of the House of the Lord, only most of them. That is why the text says kol, which is to be understood as “most of,” as in “kol the bounty of his master” (Gen 24:10). The proof that some of the sacred things of the House of the Lord remained is that in the book of Kings, when Hazael initiates a battle on Jerusalem, it says, “King Joash of Judah took all the objects that had been consecrated by Jehoshaphat, Jehoram …” (2 Kgs 12:19). But Joash did not want to spend that remnant for the work, so that the treasury of the Lord would not be left empty. Had Athaliah and her sons not violated the Temple, it would still have been standing, because from the time the Temple was built until Joash repaired it, only one hundred and fifty-five years had passed, and a strong building like that would have stood far longer had they not violated it.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND HARAN DIED IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS FATHER TERAH IN THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH IN UR OF THE CHALDEES. In accordance with the words of our Rabbis, Rashi wrote, “Terah accused his son Abram before Nimrod of having broken his idols, and he cast him into a fiery furnace. Meanwhile Haran waited and said to himself, ‘if Abram proves triumphant I will be on his side, and if Nimrod wins I shall be on his.’ When Abram was saved, they said to Haran, ‘On whose side are you?’ He replied, ‘I am on Abram’s side.’ They therefore cast him into the fiery furnace, and he was burnt to death. It is to this event that the name Ur Kasdim (fire of the Chaldees) alludes. Menachem ben Saruk, (Menachem ben Saruk was a great grammarian who lived in the middle of the tenth century in southern Spain. He composed the first dictionary covering the entire field of the Biblical language. His work is called Machbereth (literally, “a joining of words”). Rashi, in his commentary on the Torah and other books of the Bible, made great use of this work.)  however, explained the word ur as meaning ‘valley.’ So also, Therefore glorify ye the Eternal ‘ba’urim’ (in the valleys), (Isaiah 24:15.)  and also, ‘me’urath’ (the den of) the basilisk. (Ibid., 11:8.)  Every hole or deep cleft may be called ur.” This matter received by our Rabbis through tradition is the truth, and I will elucidate it. Our father Abraham was not born in the land of Chaldaea. His ancestors were descendants of Shem, and Chaldaea and the whole land of Shinar were countries inhabited by the sons of Ham, (See above, 10:10-12.)  and Scripture states, And he told to Abram the ‘Hebrew,’ (Further, 14:13.)  not Abram the Chaldean. And it is further written, Your fathers dwelt in days of old beyond the river, Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor, (Joshua 24:2.)  the word mei’olam (of old) teaching that his origins were always from there. And again Scripture states, And I took your father Abraham from beyond the river. (Ibid. 3.)  Proof of the matter is that we find Nahor [Abraham’s brother] in Haran. (Genesis 29:4-5.)  Now if Terah’s place were in Ur of the Chaldees in the land of Shinar and Scripture relates that upon Terah’s going forth from Ur of the Chaldees he took with him only his son Abram, his grandson Lot the son of Haran, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, (Verse 31 here.)  then Nahor was left in the land of Chaldaea, [and yet we find that he was in Haran, (Genesis 29:4-5.)  which is in the land of Mesopotamia, as explained further]. But the truth of the matter is that the country of the birth of Abraham’s ancestors was the land of Aram, which is beyond the River Euphrates; this was always the habitat of his ancestors. Thus Scripture says concerning the children of Shem, And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, unto the mountain of the east, (Above, 10:30.)  this being a generic name applicable to all their countries, as it is written there, in their land, after their nations, (Above, 10:31.)  and again it is written, From Aram Balak bringeth me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the east, (Numbers 23:7.)  [proving that Aram is in the land of “the mountains of the east”]. Thus it is clear that Abram and his ancestors always lived in the land of Aram. Furthermore, we find in the Talmud (Baba Bathra 91a.)  that Abraham was imprisoned [by Nimrod because he broke the idols] in Cuthah, and that city is not in the land of Chaldaea, for it is written, And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath, (II Kings 17:24.)  and it is further written, And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal. (Ibid., Verse 30.)  But it would appear that Cuthah is a city beyond the river, in the land of Mesopotamia, for Haran is the name of a city in the land of Mesopotamia, as it is written, And he went to Aram-naharaim [Mesopotamia], unto the city of Nahor, (Genesis 24:10.)  which is Haran. Furthermore, we have investigated and know it from the word of many students (This alludes to the time during the last three years of his life when Ramban lived in the land of Israel and there gathered around him students from nearby countries. It was from these students, who came from the eastern countries, that he sought first-hand knowledge to illumine the problems he had in his commentary. Concerning this fascinating period in the life of Ramban, see his biography, pp. 191-206 in my Hebrew work, pp. 60-65 in the English edition.)  who lived in that country that Cuthah is a large city between Haran and Assyria, far from the country of Babylon. The distance between it and Haran is about that of a six-day journey. It is, however, included in the term, “beyond the river,” (Ibid. 3.)  because it lies between Mesopotamia and the River Euphrates — which is the border of the land of Israel (Genesis 15:18.)  — and the Tigris which goeth towards the east of Assyria. (Above, 2:14.)  Thus Terah begot his older sons, Abraham and Nahor, in the area “beyond the river,” the land of his ancestors. He then went with his son Abram to the land of Chaldaea, where his youngest son, Haran, was born. His son Nahor, however, remained “beyond the river,” in the city of Haran. It may be that he was born there or that he came to settle there from Cuthah. This is the meaning of [the verse here which says of Haran], in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, since that was the birthplace of Haran alone [among Terah’s children]. This matter received through tradition [that Cuthah was the birthplace of Abraham] is also found in a book called The Antiquities of the Nations, as the Rabbi (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Rambam or Maimonides). See Seder Bereshith, Note 139.)  wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim (III, 29. Ramban is following Al-Charizi’s translation, and not Ibn Tibbon’s. See notes in my Hebrew commentary, pp. 72-73.)  that in the book of Egyptian Agriculture it is mentioned that Abraham, who was born (“Born.” Ibn Tibbon has, “grew up.”)  in Cuthah, differed with the opinion of the people who worshipped the sun, and the king put him in prison, but he continued to argue against them for many days. At last the king was afraid that he might corrupt his land and turn the people away from their religion, and so he expelled him to the far land of Canaan, after confiscating all his wealth. Thus in any case it was in this place, the land of Chaldaea, that a miracle — or more exactly a hidden miracle (See Ramban further, 17:1, concerning the two kinds of miracles.)  — was done to our father Abraham, for G-d put it into the heart of that king to save him and not to kill him, and so he released him from prison to go where he desires. It may be that it was an overt miracle, (See Ramban further, 17:1, concerning the two kinds of miracles.)  i.e., that the king threw him into a fiery furnace, and he was saved, as our Rabbis have stated. (As mentioned in Rashi, quoted at the beginning of this verse.)  Let not Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra mislead you with his questions, (In Verse 26.)  saying that Scripture has not narrated this wonder, for I will yet give you (See Ramban further, 46:15.)  a reason for the omission and proof of the verity of this and other miracles like it. These peoples, however, did not mention it in their books because they differed with his [the Patriarch’s] opinion, and they thought his miracle was a deed of sorcery, just as was the case with our teacher Moses in his confrontation with the Egyptians at the beginning of his deeds. It is on account of this that Scripture no longer mentions this miracle [of Abraham] for it would have had to mention the words of those who differed with him, as it mentioned the words of the Egyptian magicians, and Abraham’s words were not as openly verified to them as were ultimately the words of our teacher Moses, [which were established by ten clearly revealed miracles]. Thus Scripture says, I am the Eternal that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it, (Genesis 15:7.)  for the word hotzeisicha (brought thee out) points to a miracle. It does not say, “that took thee from Ur of the Chaldees;” instead it says, that brought thee out, meaning that He brought out a prisoner from the dungeon (See Isaiah 42:7.)  just as in the verse: that brought thee out from the land of Egypt. (Exodus 20:2.)  And He said to Abraham, to give thee this land to inherit it, (Genesis 15:7.)  because from the time that G-d brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, it was His Will, exalted be He, to make him into a great nation and to give him this land of Canaan. From that day on which Abraham was saved, Terah — his father — and Abraham had in mind to go to the land of Canaan, a distant point far from the land of Chaldaea, out of fear of the king, since Haran, [the city of their inhabitance], was near them [the Chaldeans], and they were one people with one language since Aramaic was their common language. They [Terah and Abraham] wanted to go to a nation where their speech would not be understood by that king and his people. This is the meaning of the verse, And they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan, and they came unto Haran (Verse 31 here.)  where their families and ancestors ever lived, and they settled among them, staying there for many days. It was there that Abraham was commanded to do what he had intended, i.e., to go to the land of Canaan, and so he left his father, who later died there in Haran, (Verse 32.)  his country, and went with his wife and Lot, his brother’s son, to the land of Canaan. (Further, 12:5.)  Thus Scripture says, And I took your father Abraham from beyond the river, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, (Ibid. 3.)  for Abraham was commanded concerning this when he was yet “beyond the river,” and from there G-d took him and led him throughout all the land of Canaan. Now according to the opinion of our Rabbis [that Nimrod threw Abraham into a fiery furnace, the name] Ur Kasdim will be understood as the plain meaning indicates, [namely, “Fires of the Chaldees”], from the same expression: I am warm, I have seen ‘ur’ (the fire). (Isaiah 44:16.)  Scripture thus says, And they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, (Verse 31 here.)  even though Terah did not go forth from the fiery furnace. However, since Abram is the main [person of interest, it mentions Ur Kasdim although the name has reference to him alone]. It may be that on account of the miracle the place came to be so called, just as we find, And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, (Deuteronomy 9:22. — These places were so named because of the events that occurred there. See Numbers 11:3, 34. Exodus 17:7.)  and others. Scripture thus alludes that when Abram went forth from the fiery furnace, they all fled from that country. And the meaning of the verse, Glorify ye the Eternal ‘ba’urim,’ (Isaiah 24:15.)  is in my opinion consonant with that which the Rabbis have said [concerning Ur Kasdim, namely, that it means “the Fire of the Chaldees”], for urim are the high mountains on which they make fires and “kindle the flares” (Rosh Hashana 22b. The subject there concerns the kindling of flares on the tops of the hills to declare that the day of the New Moon had been declared.)  to make the new events known quickly in distant places, even as it says [in the second half of the verse]: In the isles of the sea, the name of the Eternal, the G-d of Israel. (Isaiah 24:15.)  The sense of that verse is thus that for the glory of G-d they should let the whole world know the miracle and the wonder which had been done to them. So also, ‘Me’urath’ the basilisk (Ibid., 11:8.)  means his [the serpent’s] hole, where his fire and great heat are, just as he is indeed called saraph [the serpent, but literally, “the burning one”]. And I have seen in the Midrash: (Pesikta d’Rabbi Kahana, 21.)  “Arise, ‘uri’ (shine). (Isaiah 60:1.)  Therefore glorify ye the Eternal ‘ba’urim.’ (Isaiah 24:15.)  How do you glorify Him? Rabbi Yeivo bar Kahana said, ‘With these torches such as the lanterns which burn in synagogues (This is one of the earliest sources for establishing the religious duty of kindling lights in a synagogue. See my edition of Kithvei Rabbeinu Bechaya, pp. 89-90.)  in all places, even in the isles of the sea, (Isaiah 24:15.)  to the glory of G-d.’” Thus it is clear that the Rabbis understood the word ba’urim as an expression of fire, in accordance with its simple sense.</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 28:17:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>THIS IS NONE OTHER THAN THE HOUSE OF G-D, AND THIS IS THE GATE OF HEAVEN. This refers to the Sanctuary which is the gate through which the prayers and sacrifices ascend to heaven. Rashi comments, Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra said, ‘This ladder stood in Beer-sheba and its slope (“Its slope.” In our text of Rashi: “the middle of its slope.” Ramban will explain later that the reference is to “the end” of the slope, which is the head of the ladder.)  reached unto the Sanctuary in Jerusalem. Beer-sheba is situated in the southern part of Judah, and Jerusalem is to its north on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin, and Beth-el was in the northern portion of Benjamin’s territory, on the boundary between Benjamin’s territory and that of the children of Joseph. It follows, therefore, that a ladder whose base is in Beer-sheba and whose top is in Beth-el has its slope (“Its slope.” In our text of Rashi: “the middle of its slope.” Ramban will explain later that the reference is to “the end” of the slope, which is the head of the ladder.)  reaching opposite Jerusalem. Now regarding the statement of our Rabbis that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘This righteous man has come to the place where I dwell, [namely, the Sanctuary in Jerusalem, and shall he depart without spending the night?’], (Chullin 91b.)  and with regard to what they also said, ‘Jacob gave the name Beth-el to Jerusalem’ (Pesachim 88b.)  this place which he called Beth-el was Luz and not Jerusalem! And whence did they learn to say so, [implying that Luz is identical with Jerusalem]? I therefore say that Mount Moriah [the Temple site in Jerusalem] was forcibly removed from its place and came here to Luz, and this movement of the Temple site is ‘the springing of the earth’ which is mentioned in Tractate Shechitath Chullin. (“The slaughtering of unconsecrated beasts.” This tractate is now generally called Chullin (Unconsecrated Beasts). 91b.)  It means that the site on which the Sanctuary was later to stand came towards Jacob to Beth-el. And this too is what is meant by vayiphga bamakom (and he met the place): (Verse 11 here.)  [as two people meet, who are moving towards each other]. If you should ask, ‘When our father Jacob passed the site of the Sanctuary [on his way from Beer-sheba to Haran] why did He not detain him there?’ The answer is: If it never entered his mind to pray at the place where his fathers had prayed, should Heaven make him stop there? He had journeyed as far as Haran, as we say in the chapter of Gid Hanasheh, (“The sinew of the hip.” It is the seventh chapter of Tractate Chullin (see Note 18) 91b.)  and Scripture itself helps us clarify this point by saying, And he went to Haran. (Verse 10 here.)  When he arrived at Haran he said, ‘Is it possible that I have passed the place where my fathers prayed without praying there myself?’ He decided to return and had returned as far as Beth-el, whereupon the ground of the Temple site sprang for him until Beth-el.” All these are the words of the Rabbi. (Rashi. See also Note 139, Seder Bereshith.)  But I do not agree with them at all for ‘the springing of the earth’ which the Rabbis mention in connection with Jacob is like that which they have said happened to Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, namely, that he reached Haran in one day. As they have said in Tractate Sanhedrin, (95a.)  “The earth sprang for three persons: Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, our father Jacob, and Abishai the son of Zeruiah.” (II Samuel 21:17. In coming to the rescue of David, a miracle occurred, and he reached him at once though he was far away from him.)  And the Rabbis explained: “Eliezer, the servant of Abraham — for it is written, And I came this day unto the fountain, (Above, 24:42.)  which teaches that on that very day he embarked on his journey. Jacob — for it is written, And he met the place. (Verse 11 here.)  When he arrived at Haran he said, ‘Is it possible that I have passed the place where my fathers prayed without praying there myself?’ As soon as the thought of returning occurred to him, the earth sprang for him, and immediately he met the place.” Thus the Rabbis explicitly say that as soon as the thought to return occurred to him in Haran, the earth sprang for him and he met the place where his fathers prayed, but not that he returned to Beth-el, nor that Mount Moriah sprang and came there to Beth-el. In Bereshith Rabbah (59:15.)  the Rabbis further equated them both [Eliezer and Jacob] with respect to “the springing of the earth.” Thus they said: “And he arose, and went to Aram-naharaim (Above, 24:10.)  — on the very same day. And I came this day unto the fountain (Above, 24:42.)  — this day I embarked on the journey, and this day I arrived.” With respect to Jacob the Rabbis interpreted in a similar vein: “And he went to Haran (Verse 10 here.)  — the Rabbis say on the very same day.” And furthermore, what reason is there for Mount Moriah to “spring” and come to Beth-el, as Rashi claims, after Jacob had troubled himself to return from Haran to Beth-el, a journey of many days? (If such a miracle was to be performed, why did not Mount Moriah spring all the way to Haran?)  Moreover, Beth-el does not lie on the border of the Land of Israel which faces towards Haran for Haran is a land which lies to the east [of the Land of Israel while Beth-el lies in its western part]. (Above, 12:8.)  Additionally, the middle part of a ladder is not referred to as its “slope.” (Thus Rabbi Elazar who said that “its slope” reached to the Sanctuary did not refer to its middle, as Rashi has it.)  And, finally, what reason is there for the middle of the ladder to be opposite Beth-el, [where, according to Rashi, the side of the Sanctuary had been transported], when the middle part of an object does not possess significance beyond that of its whole? There is, however, another intent to these Midrashim. The Rabbis have said in Bereshith Rabbah, (68:6.)  “Rabbi Hoshayah said, ‘It has already been stated, And Jacob hearkened to his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram. (Above, 28:7.)  What then does Scripture teach by repeating, And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba? (Verse 10 here.)  Rather, the redundancy teaches us that Jacob said, “When my father desired to leave the Land of Israel, at what location did he seek permission for it? Was it not in Beer-sheba? I, too, shall go to Beer-sheba to seek this permission. If He grants me permission, I shall leave, and if not, I shall not go.” Therefore Scripture found it necessary to state, And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba.’” (Verse 10 here.)  The intent of this Midrash is that the Rabbis were of the opinion that Jacob was blessed by his father in Hebron, the land of his father’s sojournings, and it was to Hebron that he came when he returned to his father from Paddan-aram, as it is said, And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba — the same is Hebron — where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. (Further, 35:27.)  Now if so, the verse stating, And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba (Verse 10 here.)  teaches that when his father commanded him to go to Laban (Above, 28:5.)  he went to Beer-sheba to receive Divine permission, and that is the place wherein he spent the night and saw visions of G-d, and it was there that He gave him permission to exit from the Land of Israel, even as He said, And I will keep thee wherever thou goest and will bring thee back unto this land. (Verse 15 here.)  And the ladder which he saw, in the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra, he saw with its feet in Beer-sheba, in the very place where he lay, and with the end of its slope which is the top of the ladder reaching to a point opposite the Sanctuary. It was supported by heaven at the gate through which the angels enter and exit. The revered G-d stood over him, and therefore he knew that Beer-sheba was the gate of heaven, suitable for prayer, and the Sanctuary was the house of G-d. And in the morning Jacob continued his journey from Beer-sheba and arrived at Haran on the same day, and this was “the springing of the earth” mentioned with respect to Jacob. This is the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra who said in Bereshith Rabbah, (69:5.)  “This ladder stood in Beer-sheba and its slope reached to the Sanctuary, as it is said, And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba; (Verse 11 here.)  And he was afraid and said, How fearful is this place.” (Verse 17 here.)  And the stone which he erected as a pillar (Verse 18 here.)  he did not erect in the place where he slept, for Beer-sheba is not Beth-el and it was in Beth-el that he erected it, and there he went upon his return from Paddan-aram, as it is said, Arise, go up to Beth-el … and make there an altar unto G-d who appeared unto thee, etc. (Further, 35:1.)  But he erected it [after carrying the stone from Beth-el to Jerusalem] (Thus comments Rabbi David Luria (R’dal) in explanation of Ramban’s words. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 160.)  opposite the slope, at the place where the head of the ladder stood, which he had called the house of G-d, and this is the city which had previously been called Luz. (Verse 19 here.)  Thus in the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra, Luz was Jerusalem which Jacob called Beth-el. (Verse 19 here.)  Possibly this may be so, according to the verses in the book of Joshua. (The source intended is not clear to me. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 160, for further discussion of this matter.)  It is certainly true that it is not the Beth-el near Ai (Above, 12:8. Whereas the Beth-el referred to here had previously been called Luz.)  for that Beth-el was originally so named in the days of Abraham (Above, 12:8. Whereas the Beth-el referred to here had previously been called Luz.)  and prior to that. But Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Shimon differs there (Bereshith Rabbah 69:8.)  with Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra, and he says: “This ladder stood upon the Sanctuary site and its slope reached to Beth-el. What is his reason? And he was afraid, and said, (Verse 17 here.)  etc. And he called the name of that place Beth-el.” (Verse 19 here.)  Thus in the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Shimon the verse stating, And he lighted upon the place, (Verse 11 here.)  means Mount Moriah. And he tarried there all night, because the sun was set for him not at its proper time [so that he should spend the night there], for as our Rabbis have stated: (Chullin 91b.)  “[The Holy One, blessed be He, said], ‘This righteous man has come to the place where I dwell. Shall he then depart without staying there over night?’” And so Jacob saw the ladder with its feet standing in that place, and its slope, which is its top, reached to a point which was opposite that particular Beth-el [which was mentioned in connection with Ai during Abraham’s era], (Above, 12:8. Whereas the Beth-el referred to here had previously been called Luz.)  and that was the city of Luz. And Jacob said that the very place where he spent the night was the house of G-d, and the slope of the ladder was the gate of heaven, thus Mount Moriah is excellent for prayer, and Beth-el also is a suitable place for the worship of G-d. And he erected the pillar in Beth-el, for in the opinion of all Rabbis he erected it opposite the slope of the ladder. The opinion of Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Shimon, [i.e., that Jacob slept on Mount Moriah, and he erected the pillar in Beth-el], is in agreement with the Midrash in the Gemara of the chapter concerning Gid Hanasheh, (“The sinew of the hip.” It is the seventh chapter of Tractate Chullin (see Note 18) 91b.)  and that of Chapter Cheleck, (“Portion,” i.e., in the World to Come. This is the tenth chapter of Tractate Sanhedrin, 95b.)  which states that Jacob left Beer-sheba and came to Haran, and when he reconsidered and decided to return and pray at Mount Moriah, the place where his fathers had prayed, then the earth “sprang” for him and he lighted immediately upon Mount Moriah. Perhaps it is the Rabbis’ opinion that the earth “sprang” for him both when going from Haran to Mount Moriah and when returning from Mount Moriah to Haran. This would be in agreement with the opinion of the Rabbi who says: (Bereshith Rabbah 68:9.)  “And he went to Haran (Verse 10 here.)  — on the same day. And he lighted upon the place (Verse 11 here.)  — at once, very suddenly.” I found it more explicitly in Pirkei Rabbi Eliezer Hagadol: (Chapter 35.)  “Jacob was seventy-seven years of age when he left his father’s house, (He was sixty-three when he was blessed by his father (Megillah 16 a), and for the following fourteen years he was secluded in the house of Shem and Eber for the purpose of studying Torah. This makes Jacob seventy-seven years old when he left Haran. The Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer refers to it as “when he left his father’s house,” but the intent is as explained. (Rabbi David Luria.))  and he followed the well that travelled before him from Beer-sheba to Mount Moriah, a two-day journey, and he arrived there at midday, etc. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘Jacob, you have bread in your travelling-bag, the well is before you, enabling you to eat and drink and lie down in this place.’ Jacob replied, ‘Master of all worlds, the sun has yet to descend fifty stages, and shall I lie down to sleep in this place?’ Prematurely, the sun then set in the west. Jacob looked and saw that the sun had set in the west, so he tarried there all night, because the sun was set. (Verse 11 here.)  Jacob took twelve stones from the stones of the altar upon which his father Isaac had lain bound as a sacrifice (Above, 22:9.)  and put them under his head. By the fact that his resting-place contained twelve stones, G-d informed him that twelve tribes were destined to be established from him. But then all twelve stones were transformed into one stone to inform him that all twelve tribes were destined to become one nation in the earth, as it is said, And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth? (II Samuel 7:23.)  In the morning Jacob awoke with great fright, and said, ‘The house of the Holy One, blessed be He, is in this place,’ as it is said, And he was afraid, and said: How fearful is this place! (Verse 17 here.)  From here you learn that whosoever prays in Jerusalem is considered as if he prayed before the Throne of Glory, for the gate of heaven is open there to receive the prayer of Israel, as it is said, And this is the gate of heaven. (Verse 17 here.)  Jacob then wanted to collect the stones [which he had used as a resting-place for his head in order to build an altar], but he found them all to be one stone, and so he set it up as a pillar in that place. Thereupon oil flowed down for him from heaven, and he poured it on top of the stone, as it is said, And he poured oil upon the top of it. (Verse 18 here.)  What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? With His right foot He sank the anointed stone unto the depths of the abyss to serve as the key-stone of the earth, just as one inserts a key-stone in an arch. It is for this reason that it is called Even Hashethiyah (The Foundation Stone), (On this stone, the Ark of G-d, which contained the two Tablets of the Law, rested in the Holy of Holies in the Sanctuary in Jerusalem. (Yoma 53b.))  for there is the center of the earth, and from there the earth unfolded, and upon it stands the Temple of G-d, as it is said, And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be G-d’s house. (Verse 22 here. The use of the present tense in the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer — “and upon it stands the Temple of G-d” — may either be a reference to the remains of the ancient Sanctuary and its environs, which were still visible in the days when the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer was composed, or it may preferably indicate that although the Temple is now in ruins the place thereof is still deemed sacred as in the days when the House of G-d was firmly established on the sacred mountain.)  From there he [Jacob] went on his journey, and in the twinkling of an eye he arrived in Haran.” Thus far [extends the quotation from the Pirkei Rabbi Eliezer Hagadol]. Thus, all Midrashim — despite some minor differences among them — acknowledge that “the springing of the earth” occurred to Jacob through which he travelled a journey of many days in the twinkling of an eye. It is possible that all Midrashim concede to one another, and that on all these journeys of his — when going from Beer-sheba to Haran, when he desired to return to Mount Moriah, and when he left there to go to Haran — the earth “sprang” for him. But there is not one of all these Midrashim which says, as Rashi said, [that Mount Moriah was forcibly removed from its location and was transported to meet him in Beth-el].</p>

                <h4>Tur HaArokh, Genesis 11:28:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>בארץ מולדתו באור כשדים, “in the country of his birth in Ur of the Chaldaeans.” According to Nachmanides these last words refer back only to Haran, whereas Avraham himself was not born in Ur, seeing that his forefathers were descendants of Shem, whereas the Chaldaeans were descended from the descendants of Cham. Compare Genesis 14,13 where Avraham is described as an Ivri, and not as a “Casdi.” We also have clear evidence from Joshua that the forefathers of the Israelites had originally resided on the east bank of the river Euphrates. (Joshua 24,2) If, at the time when Terach took Avraham, and Haran and family leaving Nachor behind, and settled in Charan which is hundreds of miles north east of Shinor the land of the Casdim, how could Eliezer who was bidden to seek out Avraham’s family, have looked for Rivkah in Charan rather than in Ur? The truth is that Terach and family originated in the land of Aram that is east of the Euphrates. (Ur, downstream, was immediately west of the Euphrates) When Bileam commenced his blessing in Numbers 23,7 he described how Balak had brought him all the way from Aram, which he defines as הררי קדם, the range of mountains in the east, hardly identical with the Mesopotamian valley in which Ur was situated.
    The Talmud (Baba Batra 91) reports that Avraham had been jailed for 10 years, 3 of them in a town called כותא. It is common knowledge that this town was in the land of the Casdim (lower Mesopotamia, near Ur) as we have a verse describing the King of Ashur as coming from Babylon and Kuta as well as from Gaza and Chamat.(Kings II 17,30) In these verses the exile of the ten tribes is described. It is clear that Kuta would not have been situated anywhere near the route described in Kings II as taken by the King of Ashur who had taken the ten tribes prisoner, and who was about to repopulate the cities of Samaria with people from elsewhere, so that the land he had captured would not become desolate. Apparently, Kuta was a town in the general region of Aram Naharayim, the town in which Nachor, grandfather of Rebeccah had made his home (compare Genesis 24,10) Kuta was a large city in those days between the land of Israel and the river Tigris. Terach had moved with his older son Avraham from there downstream to the land of the Casdim (Ur) .Haran, his younger son was born in Ur. Whereas Nachor had remained in what is referred to as עבר הנהר, the Torah testifies only concerning Haran that he had been born in Ur Casdim. This information has also been recorded independently in books dating back to ancient times as pointed out by Maimonides in his Moreh. He writes that Avraham who had been born in Kuta had disagreed with the religions of his contemporaries Most of them were sun worshippers. The king incarcerated him for his refusal to toe the theological line deemed politically correct in his time. After many years when the king became afraid that the people might adopt some of the views Avraham had spread, he exiled him to an area bordering on the land of Canaan. This occurred after he had first deprived him of all his earthly belongings. At any rate, the region still belonged to that known as Ur Casdim. Avraham experienced either a manifest miracle, by being saved from the persecution of the king, or at least he experienced what is known as a נס נסתר, a “hidden miracle,” such as a sudden unaccountable change of heart by the king not to sentence him to death and to release him from jail allowing him to emigrate to a country of his choice. Alternately, he might even have thrown him into a furnace from which G’d saved him by direct intervention in his fate. The nations of the world in those days did not record this miracle in their records as it did not suit them to publicize proof which would cause people to question their beliefs. They were not as truth-loving as Pharaoh’s advisers, the magicians who openly admitted that the G’d in heaven had manifested Himself when working the ten plagues. Moreover, even assuming that they had witnessed this miracle, they would not attribute it to Divine intervention by Avraham’s G’d, but would see in this the work of magicians, or invisible forces in nature.
    Do not allow Ibn Ezra to confuse you with his various questions on this subject, especially the fact that the Torah failed to mention such an outstanding miracle as G’d saving Avraham from a fiery furnace. The magicians of Pharaoh, until the third plague, that of the lice and vermin, also thought that Moses was a superior magician rather than an emissary from G’d who could call on G’d to perform miracles. Had the Torah reported on the miracle of Avraham’s survival of that experience in Nmirod’s furnace, it would also have had to devote some space reporting the refusal of the onlookers and especially Nimrod’s theologians, to acknowledge that this had proven the existence of an invisible G’d who was the Creator, and therefore able to control laws of nature.
    It suffices for the believers that the Torah wrote (Genesis 15,7) “I am the Lord Who has taken you out from Ur Casdim to give you this land (Canaan) as an inheritance.” The very expression הוצאתיך, “I have taken you out,” alerts the reader to the fact that the Torah refers to something supernatural, to a miracle. Ever since G’d had saved Avraham miraculously, He had had in mind to commence the process that would lead ultimately to Avraham’s descendants inheriting the land of Canaan. From that day on, both Terach and his son Avraham had intended to get away as far as possible from lands under the control of Nimrod. Their arrival in Charan must be viewed as a way station (halfway house) on the way to the land of Canaan. The advantage of Charan was the fact that they had relatives there, people who spoke their language. As a result, what was intended as a brief stopover became a prolonged stay in Charan. While he was in Charan, G’d commanded Avraham to do what had been in his mind already, namely to emigrate to the land of Canaan. He therefore left his aging father behind in Charan. Whereas Terach died in his birthplace Charan, Avraham took his wife and his nephew Lot to move to Canaan with him. This is what Joshua had in mind when he reminded the people shortly before his death of their origins, and how G’d had taken their forefather Avraham from a region called עבר הנהר, “the far side of the river Euphrates.” (Joshua 24,2-7) The reference to that region was meant to tell the people that this is where Avraham was commanded to begin his pilgrimage. G’d made Avraham traverse the entire length of the land of Canaan
    According to our sages (who say that Nimrod had thrown Avraham into a fiery furnace for his refusal to toe the theological line of his time) the words אור כשדים are to be understood literally, i.e. “the fire of the Chaldaens.” This expression is used in a similar sense in Isaiah 44,16חאח, חמותי, ראיתי אור, “hurrah, I am warm, I can feel the heat.” Terach had not been thrown into the furnace, so he did not need to be saved. The Torah concentrates on the principal personality in that episode, leaving out some details. The principal character was Avraham, hence it was only he to whom G’d referred to when He reminded him of the purpose for which he had been saved.
    Alternately, the reason why that place was namedאור כשדים, was on account of the miracle which had occurred there when Avraham was saved. We have numerous occasions when locations where the Israelites stopped on their journey through the desert were given names based on what had occurred there, such as תבערה, (Numbers 11,3; or קברות התאוה, Numbers) The verse in our portion would allude to the fact that when Avraham came out of the furnace the whole family fled from that region. This would be parallel to the use of the wordאורים in Isaiah 24,15 באורים כבדו ה' where it means: “therefore honour the Lord in the lands of the mountains where they light signal fires to communicate news items over long distances.” This would be a veiled reference to communicating the miracle that had happened to Avraham in the fiery furnace of Nimrod. The expression מאורות צפעוני, is a description of the lair of a serpent whose poison is as burning as hot fire. This serpent is also known as שרף, [from שרפה, “burning.” Ed.]

I have become wealthy, and God has blessed me on account of you.&quot; Before Joseph descended to Egypt, the house of Potiphar was not blessed. Once he descended, what does it say, but (Gen. 39:5), &quot;And God blessed the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph.&quot; Before Jacob descended to Egypt [after Joseph sent for him], there was famine, as it says (Gen. 45:6), &quot;For it is two years now that the famine has been in the midst of the land, etc.&quot; Once he descended, what does it say, but (Gen. 50:31), &quot;And now, do not fear, for I will sustain you and your little children, etc.&quot; It says here &quot;sustain,&quot; and it says there (Gen. 45:11) &quot;sustain,&quot; just as &quot;sustain&quot; over there is in reference to the famine, so too &quot;sustain&quot; over here is in reference to the famine.

    he had the camels kneel, in contrast to horses and donkeys that generally drink while standing, outside the city by the well of water at evening time, at the time the women who draw water come out. Since the servant could not knock on every door searching for an appropriate wife for his master, he thought that visiting the well at this time of day would give him a good opportunity to see the local girls.</p>

              <p>“The servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and he went, and all his master’s goods in his hand; he arose and went to Aram Naharayim, to the city of Naḥor” (Genesis 24:10).  “The servant took ten camels from the camels of his master…” – the camels of Abraham our patriarch were notable, [in that] everywhere that they would go out, they would go out muzzled. (So that they should not eat vegetation belonging to a private individual.)   “And all his master’s goods in his hand” – Rabbi Ḥelbo said: This refers to his will. (In it, he bequeathed all his belongings to Isaac.)   “He arose and went to Aram Naharayim” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: [He arrived] on that same day. This is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak [elsewhere]: “I came today to the spring” (Genesis 24:42) – today I departed and today I arrived.   “You made the land quake; You shattered it. Heal its shards, for it has toppled” (The Midrash interprets all these descriptions as references to incidents in which someone was able to reach long distances in a short amount of time, as if the ground itself contracted for him.)  (Psalms 60:4). “You made the land quake” – in the days of Abraham; (See Genesis Rabba 43:3.)  “you shattered it” – in the days of Eliezer; “heal its shards” – in the days of Jacob; (See Genesis Rabba 68:8.)  “for it has toppled” – in the days of Yishbi Benov. That is what is written: “Yishbi Benov, who was of the offspring of the giant” (II Samuel 21:16). He wielded his shield, and David leapt backwards eighteen cubits. (From the force of the shield.)  This one feared that one, and that one feared this one. This one [Yishbi Benov] feared [David], saying: ‘If this is how he leaps backwards, what can he do going forward?’ And that one [David] feared this one [Yishbi Benov], saying: ‘If he can wield his shield like this, how can I stand against him?’ David said: ‘If only I had one of my sister’s sons to come and aid me.’ Immediately, “Avishai son of Tzeruya came to his aid” (II Samuel 21:17). Was he standing behind the door [that he arrived so quickly]? That is a rhetorical question. The Rabbis say: Even if he was at the other end of the world, the Holy One blessed be He flew him and brought him in the blink of an eye, so that that righteous one [David] should not have to stand there in distress. That is what is written: “Avishai son of Tzeruya came to his aid and smote the Philistine and put him to death. Then David’s men took an oath [to him, saying]: You will not go out with us to battle [any longer], so that you not extinguish the lamp of Israel” (II Samuel 21:17).  “He made his camels crouch outside the city by a well of water at the time of evening, at the time that the women go out to draw water” (Genesis 24:11).  “He made his camels crouch outside the city” – he had them go on their knees.</p>

Eliezer prayed for God's kindness to fulfill Abraham's prayer for a suitable wife for Isaac, directing his prayer towards God's attribute of kindness. The Midrash praises Eliezer's faith and wisdom in choosing to serve Abraham, highlighting Isaac's dedication to God. Musar reflects on the attributes of the patriarchs seen in securing a wife for Isaac, connecting Abraham's kindness and Isaac's strength to Eliezer's prayer and Rebekah's actions. The Talmud lists seven patriarchs who died in honor without being affected by worms and maggots, along with seven individuals who entered Paradise alive due to specific merits. Targum references both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mentioning the servant of Abraham praying to God to find a suitable wife for Isaac.</summary>

              <p>‎Genesis (24,12) We need to examine why Betuel and family at first ‎agreed to Rivkah’s becoming Yitzchok’s bride, (verse 50) but ‎apparently changed their minds subsequently. (Verse 55). We ‎must remember that both Lavan and Betuel, even when ‎appearing to agree, had evil intentions. (see Rashi, ‎according to whom they planned to assassinate Eliezer) Their ‎principal motivation was to prevent Yitzchok from having ‎children that would grow to maturity and survive. (Gittin 64) ‎The Talmud there discusses the subject of a betrothal by means of ‎an emissary, in the absence of a face to face meeting between ‎bride and groom. According to the halachah, as long as the ‎emissary is still on the way, i.e. has not returned from his mission, ‎the sender (Yitzchok) is not allowed to marry any other woman. ‎The reason for this is that he might, unwittingly marry someone ‎forbidden to him for reasons of incest. (In the event that his ‎emissary had already carried out his mission) For this reason, ‎Rivkah’s family first expressed their willingness, so that Yitzchok ‎was “married,” and then by killing him hoped to prevent him ‎from returning to his sender and announcing that he had ‎completed his mission.‎</p>

He therefore stipulated that the girl to be regarded as suitable for Isaac should proceed to do more than he asked of her by also offering to water his camels. This would be characteristic of a girl who was related to Abraham. In fact Rebeccah described herself immediately as a daughter of Bethuel (verse 24).</p>

Es liegt dem jüdischen Begriff ,,מקרה&quot; nichts ferner, als die Vorstellung, die wir mit dem Worte &quot;Zufall׳ verbinden; ihm dürfte gerade nichts weniger &quot;zufällig&quot; sein, als das, was er mit dem Worte מקרה bezeichnet. Erzählt jemand כל הקורות oder קוראות אותו, so sind dies ja alle diejenigen Lebensmomente, die er nicht herbeigerufen, die ihn vielmehr in ihre Richtung hineinrufen, die nur er nicht erwartet, berechnet, beabsichtigt hat, die aber umsomehr die höchste absichtsvolle Sendung des sein können, der alles fügt und schickt. נקריתי בהר הגלבע (Sam.

              <p>Am deutlichsten erscheint dies, wo uns aufgegeben wird, ein מקרה zu veranstalten. והקריתם לכם heißt es Bamidbar 35, 11 von den Zufluchtsstädten, die wir im Lande also gelegen bestimmen sollen, daß sie den unabsichtlichen Totschläger in leichter Weise zu sich laden und führen, wie dies ganz ausdrücklich in dem תכין לך הדרך (Dewarim 19, 3) ausgesprochen ist (siehe Makkot 9b). Der Unglückliche hat es nicht beabsichtigt, einen Menschen gerade in der Nähe einer zur Zufluchtsstadt führenden Straße zu töten, die ganze Handlung war ja eine unabsichtliche; daß er sich in der Nähe einer solchen Straße befindet, ist ihm gewiß etwas zufälliges. Allein von vornherein war dafür gesorgt, daß in entsprechenden Abständen eine gebahnte Straße zu einer עיר מקלט führte. Kohelet hat daher vollkommen Recht, daß den Weisen wie den Toren מקרה אחד יקרה את כלם, daß auch der Weise sich nicht dem מקרה entziehen kann; denn auch der Weiseste, wenn man will der Klügste, hat Lebensereignisse, ja auch der vielleicht größte Teil der seinigen sind solche, die er weder erwartet, noch vorausgesehen, am allerwenigsten mit Absicht herbeigeführt, die ihn vielmehr in Verhältnisse und Beziehungen hineinrufen, die ganz außer seiner Berechnung lagen.</p>

              <p>It is written: “A wise servant will dominate a shameful son and will share in an inheritance among brothers” (Proverbs 17:2). “A wise servant” – this refers to Eliezer. What was his wisdom? He said: (Before he became Abraham’s slave.)  ‘He (Referring to himself.)  already has the curse of that man upon him, (“Cursed be Canaan; a slave of slaves shall he be to his brothers” (Genesis 9:25). Eliezer was a descendant of Canaan (see Bereshit Rabba 59:9).)  perhaps a Kushite or barbarian will come along and enslave me. It is preferable to be enslaved in this household [of Abraham] and not in any other household.’ “Will dominate a shameful son” – this refers to Isaac, (Abraham gave him control over Isaac in the sense that he was entrusted to choose a bride for him.)  who put all the idolaters to shame when he was bound atop the altar. (With his complete dedication to God’s will, he put all the idolaters to shame.)  “And will share in an inheritance among brothers” – among Israel; just as they mention the merit of the patriarchs [in their prayers], so, too, this one mentioned the merit of the patriarchs [in his prayer]: “He said: Lord, God of my master Abraham…”  “And perform kindness with my master Abraham” – [Eliezer said:] ‘If you begin something, finish it.’ (This is a popular saying. Eliezer applied it in his prayer to God: ‘You shortened my path for Abraham’s sake, help me complete the mission.’)  Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Everyone requires kindness. Even Abraham, for whose sake [divine] kindness spreads throughout the world, required kindness, as it is stated: “And perform kindness with my master Abraham” – if you begin something, finish it.</p>

              <p>“Isaac said to his son: How is it that you were so quick to find it, my son? And he said: Because the Lord your God coordinated it before me” (Genesis 27:20).  “Isaac said to Jacob: Please approach, that I may feel you, my son, are you my son Esau or not?” (Genesis 27:21).  “Isaac said to his son: How is it that you were so quick to find it, my son?” – you were so quick to find the blessing, my son? Your father was blessed at seventy five years old, (God blessed Isaac after Abraham’s death. Abraham died at age one hundred and seventy-five. Isaac was born when Abraham was one hundred years old.)  and you are sixty-three years old. (See Bereshit Rabba 62:5.)   “And he said: Because the Lord your God coordinated it before me” – Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, one of them said: If for your offering, the Holy One blessed be He provided for you, as it is stated: “Abraham lifted his eyes and saw that behold, there was a ram” (Genesis 22:13); for your food, all the more so. The other said: If for your mate He provided for you, as it is stated: “Please arrange it for me today” (Genesis 24:12), and it is written: “Behold, he saw camels coming” (Genesis 24:63); for your food, all the more so.  “And he said: Because the Lord your God coordinated it before me” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is analogous to a raven that brought fire to its nest. When he said: “Because the Lord your God coordinated it before me,” Isaac said: ‘I know that Esau would not mention the name of the Holy One blessed be He; this one mentions. This is not Esau, but Jacob.’ When Isaac said to Jacob: “Please approach, that I may feel you, my son,” water spilled on his [Jacob's] thighs, (He urinated in fear.)  and his heart was as soft as wax. The Holy One blessed be He appointed two angels for him, one to his right and one to his left, and they were holding his elbow so he would not fall. That is what is written: “Do not waver [tishta], as I am your God” (Isaiah 41:10) – do not become wax [tishva].</p>

            <summary>The attributes of the patriarchs are reflected in the story of securing a wife for Isaac. Abraham's kindness is seen in Eliezer's prayer for kindness from G–d, while Isaac's attribute of strength is alluded to in Rebekah's offer to draw water for the camels. Kabbalists connect Isaac's name to the praise of G–d in the נשמת prayer on ראש השנה, with the words forming the name יצחק. Similarly, the name רבקה is found by aligning specific words in the prayer in a similar manner.</summary>

              <p>You will find the respective attributes of the patriarchs alluded to in the story of this journey to secure a wife for Isaac. In 24,11 Eliezer prays that G–d should perform an act of חסד, kindness, i.e. Abraham's cardinal virtue, for Abraham. In 24,19 we read: ותאמר גם לגמליך אשאב, &quot;I shall also draw water for your camels.&quot; The letters אגלא are the name of the attribute גבורה, Isaac's special characteristic. The Kabbalists have adopted this name from the words in our daily prayer אתה גבור לעולם א-דני. Kabbalists have used this to explain why we change the order of praise for G–d in the last part of the נשמת prayer on ראש השנה. Seeing that Rosh Hashanah is called יום הדין, Day of Judgment, the words in the paragraph בפי ישרים תתרומם, etc. are arranged so that by reading the words ישרים, צדיקים, חסידים, קדושים placed one on top of the other, we get the name יצחק. When you do the same with the words תתרומם, תתברך, תתקדש, תתהלל, and you place them above each other in the corresponding stanza, the third letters in each of these words together spell רבקה, Isaac's soul mate.</p>

            <summary>In Genesis 19:16, the shalsheleth cantillation mark appears due to the rule of pausals, as seen in other instances in the Tanakh such as Genesis 24:12, Genesis 39:8, Leviticus 8:23, Isaiah 13:8, Amos 1:2, and Ezra 5:15. In Genesis 24:12, Eliezer struggles with loyalty to Abraham and personal ambition, as seen in his mission to find a wife for Isaac. Similarly, in Genesis 27:20, Esau uses the same phraseology as Eliezer, showing how certain events are arranged by God for specific purposes. The use of a shalshelet in Genesis 24:12 also highlights the ambivalence of the characters involved.</summary>

              <p>One instance occurs in Genesis 24:12. Abraham has sent his servant (not identified in the text, but taken by the commentators to be Eliezer) to find a wife for his son Isaac in the city of Haran. Arriving at the town’s well, Eliezer proposes a test: the woman who comes to draw water, offers some to the traveller, and in addition gives water to his camels, will be the one chosen by God for his master’s son. Over the “and he said” introducing his request of God that this test should succeed, the masoretic tradition has placed a shalshelet.</p>

              <p>כי הקרה ה' אלוקיך לפני, “because the Lord your G–d has so arranged it for my benefit on this day.” Esau used the same phraseology that Eliezer had used when on his way to find a wife for Yitzchok (Genesis 24,12) The ram which was entangled by its horns in Genesis 22,3 was also something that G–d had made happen just for that occasion, so that Avraham would not feel that he had come all the way without G–d accepting an offering from him. The root קרה occurs only in connection with things which occurred without visible preparation for use at a certain moment. (B’reshit Rabbah, 65,19) According to the Midrash there, the moment the person before him used the tetragram when referring to G–d, Yitzchok knew that that person could not be Esau.</p>

              <p>The second occurs when Abraham asks his servant – ­traditionally identified as Eliezer – to find a wife for his son Isaac. The commentators suggest that Eliezer feels a profound ambivalence about his ­mission. Were Isaac not to marry and have children, Abraham’s estate would eventually pass to Eliezer or his descendants. Abraham had already said so before Isaac was born: “Sovereign Lord, what can You give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” (Gen. 15:2). If Eliezer succeeds in his mission, bringing back a wife for Isaac, and if the couple has children, then his chances of one day acquiring Abraham’s wealth would disappear completely. Two instincts war within him: loyalty to Abraham and personal ambition. The verse states: “And he said: Lord, the God of my master ­Abraham, send me…good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham” (Gen. 24:12). Loyalty wins, but not without a deep struggle. Hence the shalshelet.</p>

              <p>BARAITHA. Seven patriarchs died in universal honour, and the worms and maggots had no power over them, viz. Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Amram the father of Moses, Benjamin the son of Jacob, Jesse and Chileab. (The second son of David (2 Sam. 3, 3, who is named Daniel in 1 Chron. 3, 1). Cf. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, I, p. 22.)  Some add: David, as it is stated, Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety. (Ps. 16, 9.)  Seven entered Paradise in their lifetime, viz.: [Seraḥ [the daughter of Asher], (She showed Moses the place in the Nile where Joseph’s coffin lay hidden, thus enabling him to take it with him when the Israelites left Egypt (Ex. 13, 19). Cf. Ginzberg, op. cit., II, pp. 116, 181; V, pp. 96, 165, 356, n. 295, 359, n. 321. See also Soṭah 13a (Sonc. ed., p. 67).)  Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, (Cf. 1 Chron. 4, 18; Meg. 13a (Sonc. ed., p. 74); Ginzberg, op. cit., II, p. 270; V, p. 401, n. 60.)  Hiram, king of Tyre, (Because he was of great help to Solomon in the building of the Temple. Cf. 1 Kings 5; Ginzberg, op. cit., IV, p. 155; V, pp. 96, 165; VI, p. 425.)  Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, (He rescued the prophet Jeremiah when his life was in danger. Cf. Jer. 38, 11ff.; Ginzberg, op. cit., IV, pp. 318ff.; VI, pp. 387, 409f., 411f.)  Eliezer [the servant of Abraham], (op. cit., I, p. 297; V, pp. 96, 165, 263, n. 301.)  the grandson of Judah the Prince, (op. cit., V, p. 96, where he refers to R. Judah’s ‘slave’, not his grandson.)  Jabez (op. cit., V, p. 96; VI, p. 187, n. 30, where Jabez is identified with R. Judah’s grandson.)  and some add, R. Joshua b. Levi]. (op. cit., V, pp. 31, 96, 165.)  GEMARA. Seraḥ, as it is written, I am of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel (2 Sam. 20, 19, E.V. we are of them, etc.; the words which the wise woman spoke in the name of the people of the city. Here the words are applied to another wise woman, Serah.)  [which is interpreted,] It is I who completed the number of entrants to the Garden of Eden. Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, as it is written, And his wife Hajehudijah bore Jered the father of Gedor … and these are the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh whom Mered took. (1 Chron. 4, 18.)  God said, ‘I will call Moses by no other name than she called him’, (Cf. Ex. 2, 10.)  as it is stated, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said: Moses, Moses. (ibid III, 4.)  To this David alluded when he exclaimed, He sent from on high, He took me; He drew me out of many waters. (2 Sam. 22, 17; Ps. 18, 17.)  [It is written,] And she called his name Moses, and said: Because I drew him out of the water. (Ex. 2, 10.)  The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘Because she caused salvation to come to Israel and brought them forth to life, behold, I will prolong her life’. He [also] said, ‘I have made a covenant with your fathers and they followed in the path of their fathers. This woman, however, who has forsaken her royal status and attached herself to you, shall I not reward her?’ In what did Hiram, king of Tyre, earn his merit? Because he built a Tabernacle as Moses did; as it is written, Even all these vessels. (1 Kings 7, 45. In the Heb. text the word for these is so spelt that it could be read ’ohel which is reminiscent of the ’ohel mo‘ed, ‘the tent of meeting’, which Moses erected.)  To what does the word these allude? To the tent of meeting. [Why did] Ebed-melech the Ethiopian [enter Paradise alive]? Because he brought up Jeremiah [from the dungeon], as it is written, And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, etc. (Jer. 38, 12f.)  [Why did] Eliezer [enter Paradise alive]? Because he prayed on Abraham’s behalf. On what occasion? When he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray Thee, good speed this day, (Gen. 24, 12.)  and it is further written, Because the Lord thy God sent me good speed. (ibid. XXVII, 20. Jacob said this to his father.)  And whence do we know that the latter one (Jacob.)  [entered Paradise alive]? For it is written, And he brought him wine, and he drank; (ibid. XXVII, 25.)  and it further states, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed. (ibid. 27, i.e., the Garden of Eden. Jacob, according to tradition, brought the vine from the Garden of Eden; cf. Midrash Rabbah, Genesis, LXV, 22 (Sonc. ed., p. 599): ‘When Jacob went in to his father, the Garden of Eden entered with him’.)  And the grandson of R. Judah the Prince? For this we have a tradition. And R. Joshua b. Levi? For this too we have a tradition. And whence do we know it of Jabez? For it is written, And Jabez called on the God of Israel … and that Thy hand might be with me. (1 Chron. 4, 10.)  Some derive it from here, And that Thou wouldest work deliverance from evil, that it may not pain me. (ibid.)  Whence do we know that evil means death? As it is written, The righteous is taken away from the evil to come; (Isa. 57, 1.)  and it has been taught: But for the ills that come upon the world, the righteous would not be taken away before their time. And Jabez prayed concerning himself, That it may not pain me, [and then it is written,] And God granted him that which he requested. (1 Chron. 4, 10.) </p>

              <p>Genesis ‎24,13-15. “Here I am standing at the well…and the ‎daughters of the residents of the town are coming out… and ‎through her I will know that You have performed a loving ‎kindness for my master.” “and behold Rivkah who had been ‎born for Bethuel son of Milkah, was coming out, ‎etc.” When looking at the precision with which the Torah ‎describes every detail surrounding this encounter, we must ask ‎ourselves what need there was for Eliezer to refer to the other ‎daughters of Aram Naharayim at all? What part did they play in ‎the story? Furthermore, why did the Torah write the word ‎ילדה‎ ‎with a dot in the letter ‎ל‎, suggesting that the birth of Rivkah was ‎connected to a cause other than Bethuel merely impregnating his ‎wife with his semen? The vowel kubutz under the letter ‎י‎, ‎instead of the vowel kametz, also adds to the impression ‎that there were external factors involved in Rivkah’s birth. [The ‎reader will note that when Rivkah identified herself to Eliezer in ‎verse 24, she only used the word ‎ילדה‎ in an active mode with the ‎vowel kametz, when she referred to her grandmother ‎Milkah having born her father for Nachor. Ed.] According to ‎the approach that we have followed in explaining these verses in ‎terms of G’d’s largesse and how it is transmitted to our part of the ‎universe to the righteous, none of these nuances are difficult. We ‎have explained that Avraham’s spiritual level in this world was ‎one that enabled him to elevate mankind by stages to higher ‎spiritual levels, i.e. bringing them closer to their Creator. He did ‎this by opening channels of G’d’s largesse to flow directly, ‎without detours, to the society within which he was active. ‎Eliezer, Avraham’s servant was well aware that the local ‎population of Aram Naharayim consisted of wicked people. In ‎order to examine whether the young lady who was to become ‎Yitzchok’s wife belonged to the wicked part of this population, he ‎had to devise a special scheme. If he were to find among the ‎virgins that came forth from the town to draw water one who ‎distinguished herself by the characteristic of loving kindness, i.e. ‎the same characteristic that distinguished his master Avraham, ‎he felt certain that such a girl must have had her roots in ‎Avraham’s family. She must have been blessed with such an ‎attribute through the activities of Avraham on this earth. When ‎he described himself as “standing at the well,” he positioned ‎himself in such a manner that he had a chance to test the girls ‎concerning their characteristics such as offering help beyond the ‎absolute minimum to an unknown stranger such as himself. Such ‎a girl, by definition, was destined to continue to be active ‎practicing the virtues for which Avraham his master was famous.‎ The words: ‎והנה רבקה יוצאת אשר ילדה לבתואל‎, are to alert ‎us that from the generous attitude displayed by Rivkah it became ‎manifest that a contributing factor to her birth had been the ‎benevolent influence Avraham had exerted on the people of his ‎time, and especially on members of his family. A girl who would ‎voluntarily exert herself on behalf of a stranger’s camels would ‎demonstrate the attribute of ‎חסד‎, loving concern for others, that ‎characterized Avraham and his deceased wife, Sarah.‎</p>

              </summary>
              <p>הנה אנכי נצב על עין המים, ”here I am standing at a fountain of water, etc.” We have to be alert to the fact that this whole paragraph appears to be merely a repetition of what the Torah already told us. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 60,8 have explained that this teaches that the small talk of the servants of the patriarchs was dearer to G-d than some of the profound Torah insights of the children of the patriarchs. We can prove this from the fact that the Torah was very expansive in reporting everything the servant did, whereas it was most concise in relating some very basic legislation which applies to the Jewish people throughout the ages. Sometimes, such legislation is merely hinted at in the text so that if it had not been revealed to Moses orally we would never have found it in the written text. The whole matter is further proof that the patriarchs were carriers of G-d’s “chariot,” i.e. that their stature exceeded that of the angels who had preceded them as the carriers.  There can be no doubt that the Torah did not repeat this whole report of Eliezer’s prayer and his dialogue with Rivkah without an ulterior motive. I will explain this as we proceed with the text of this entire paragraph. I advise you the reader to keep your eyes open as all these matters were directly related to the success of Eliezer’s mission.  For instance: the Torah speaks of the עין המים, the well (fountain) of water three times, each time varying the syntax somewhat. In our verse here the well is simply described as עין המים, “a fountain of water.” In 24,42 the servant is reported as saying: ואבא היום אל העין, “I arrived this day at the well.” in 24,16 the Torah says of Rivkah: ותרד העינה, “she descended to the well.” In other words, the Torah speaks of the same well in three slightly different versions, עין, העין, העינה. We need to understand the precise reason for each of these nuances. [The author leaves it there, but Rabbi Chavell quotes that according to תורת חיים the combination of the word עין (numerical value 70) plus two more times the same word equals an allusion to the name of G-d consisting of 72 letters. The additional letters ה, either at the beginning of the word or at the end, allude to the last letter ה in the Ineffable Name, a reference to G-d’s attribute of חסד. Eliezer invoked this attribute in order to secure for Yitzchak the mate who was appropriate for him.]</p>

His reasoning was that if a girl behaves in a modest manner at home this was a reflection on her mother, whereas if she behaved modestly away from home she displayed her own virtue thereby, and not fear of being reprimanded by her mother.

              <p>“Behold, I am standing by the spring of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water” (Genesis 24:13).  “May it be that the girl to whom I will say: Tilt your jug please, and I will drink, and she will say: Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink; it is she You have confirmed for Your servant, for Isaac, and through her I will know that You have shown kindness to my master” (Genesis 24:14).  “It was before he concluded to speak, and behold, Rebecca was coming out, who was born to Betuel, son of Milka, wife of Nahor, brother of Abraham, and her jug is on her shoulder” (Genesis 24:15).  “Behold, I am standing by the spring of water and the daughters of the men of the city…May it be that the girl to whom I will say: Tilt…” – there are four people who made inappropriate demands [of God], three were granted appropriate responses, one was granted an inappropriate response. They are: Abraham’s servant Eliezer, Caleb, Saul, and Yiftaḥ. Eliezer said: “May it be that the girl to whom I will say….” What if some maidservant would emerge and give him to drink, would he have taken her to marry his master’s son? That is a rhetorical question. Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him: “It was before he concluded to speak, and behold, Rebecca was coming out…”   Caleb said: “Whoever smites Kiryat Sefer and captures it, I will give him Akhsa my daughter as a wife” (Judges 1:12). What if some slave would have conquered it, would he have given him his daughter? Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him, as it is stated: “Otniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s…brother, captured it; and he gave him Akhsa his daughter as a wife” (Judges 1:13).  Saul said: “It shall be, that whichever man smites him [Goliath], the king will enrich him with great wealth, and he will give him his daughter as a wife” (I Samuel 17:25). What if some Kushite or idolater or slave had emerged and smitten him, would he have given him his daughter? Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him, as it is written: “David, the son of that nobleman” (I Samuel 17:12).  Yiftaḥ [said:] “It shall be that whatever emerges…I will offer it up as a burnt offering” (Judges 11:31). What if some dog or cat had emerged, would he have offered it up as a burnt offering? And the Holy One blessed be He made an inappropriate arrangement for him. That is what is written: “Yiftaḥ came…and behold, his daughter came out to greet him” (Judges 11:34).  Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He [Yiftaḥ] was obligated to pay for monetary consecration. (When his daughter came out to greet him, although he was of course not obliged to sacrifice her, he was obligated to redeem her with money, as one redeems consecrated property that cannot be used.)  Reish Lakish said: He was not even obligated to pay for monetary consecration, as we learn in a mishna: (Temura 5:6.)  If one said regarding an impure animal or a blemished animal: ‘These are hereby [consecrated as] a burnt offering, it is as if he has said nothing at all.’ [But if he said:] ‘These are hereby [consecrated] for use towards a burnt offering,’ they are to be sold, and he must bring a burnt offering with their money. (Yiftaḥ’s statement was analogous to the first case, so his declaration was null and void.)   Pinḥas [the high priest] was not there to abrogate his [Yiftaḥ’s] vow for him. Instead, Pinḥas said: ‘It is he who requires my services; shall I go to him?’ And Yiftaḥ said: ‘I am the head of the chieftains of Israel, shall I go to Pinḥas?’ Between the two of them, that young woman was lost. (Yiftaḥ did fulfill his vow through his daughter, although this was not in accordance with Torah law, as explained in the previous paragraph.)  This accords with [the saying] that people say: Between the midwife and the mother in childbirth, the son of the wretched woman is gone. (If the baby dies, each one blames the other.)    Both of them [Pinḥas and Yiftaḥ] were punished for the blood of the young woman. Yiftaḥ died as a result of his limbs falling off. Everywhere he would go, one of his limbs would fall off and they would bury it there. That is what is written: “Yiftaḥ died and he was buried in the cities of Gilad” (Judges 12:7) – “the city of Gilad” is not stated, but rather, “the cities of Gilad.” (Indicating that he was buried in several cities.)  As for Pinḥas, the Divine Spirit was stripped from him. That is what is written: “Pinḥas son of Elazar had been chief over them” (I Chronicles 9:20) – “is chief over them” is not written here, but rather, “had been chief.” “In earlier times the Lord had been with him” (I Chronicles 9:20).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>R. Samuel b. Nachmeni, in the name of R. Jonathan, said: Three men made an unreasonable demand (making their actions dependent on chance); two of them were answered desirably (Providence favored their ways), but one was answered according [to his unreasonableness]. They are: Eliezer, the servant of Abraham; Saul, the son of Kish; and Jephthah, of Gilead. Concerning Eliezer it is written (Gen. 24, 13) … and the daughters of the men of this city come out to draw water, etc. Now, such a maiden might have been blind or maimed, nevertheless he was answered desirably when Rebekah came [providentially] to him. Concerning Saul, the son of Kish, it is written (I Sam. 17, 25) And it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, etc. It might have happened that a slave, or an illegitimate son, might accomplish the feat, nevertheless he was answered desirably; and David came [providentially] to him. Concerning Jephthah it is written (Jud. 11, 31) Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house … I will offer it up for a burnt-offering. An unclean animal might have come forth [which would not be a proper sacrifice] . He was therefore answered undesirably, for his own daughter came [providentially] to meet him. This is meant by the words of the prophet (Jer. 8, 22) Is there no mere balm in Gilead? Or, is no physician there? And further, it is written (Ib. 19, 5) which I had not commanded nor spoken, and which had not come into my mind; i.e., which I had not commanded refers to the son of Mesha, the King of Moab, as it is said (II Kings, 3, 27) Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stand, and offered him for a burnt-offering upon the wall. And there came great wrath upon Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their own land; nor spoken, refers to the daughter of Jephthah, the Gilodite; and which had not come into my mind, refers to Isaac, son of Abraham.&quot; R. Berachia said: &quot;The congregation of Israel also made an unreasonable demand, but the Holy One, praised be He! answered it in a desirable manner, as it is written (Hos 6, 3) And let us know, eagerly strive to know the Lord; His going forth is sure as the morning; and He shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth. The Holy One, praised be He! said: 'My daughter, thou askest a thing which is sometimes desirous and sometimes superfluous, nevertheless I shall be to thee as a thing which is needed all the time; as it is said (Ib. 14, 6) I will be as the dew unto Israel. Another time did the congregation of Israel make an unreasonable demand, saying: 'Sovereign of the universe! (Songs 8, 6) Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm.' Whereupon the Lord said: 'Thou askest me to do a thing which sometimes can be observed and sometimes cannot; but I will set thee as a seal in such a place that you will always be observed'; as it is said (Is. 49, 16) Behold, upon the palms of my hands have I engraved thee.&quot; </p>

              </summary>
              <p>The two different items that were pledged—habol tahbol. (Though Exod. 22:25 speaks only of night garments, the repetition of the word haval (havol tahbol) indicates that two different pledges are referred to, and thus that it also refers to implements required in the daytime.)  The verse teaches us that if one borrows the pin of a plow, he must return it upon awakening. In one verse Scripture says: Thou shalt restore the garment unto him before the sun goeth down (Exod. 22:25). And another verse states: Neither shall the sun go down (Deut. 24:15). From these verses you can conclude that just as you must return the garment in which a man sleeps in the evening, as it is said: When the sun goeth down, so you must return the pin of the plow to him in the morning, before the sun goeth down. Furthermore, In the same day thou shalt give him his hire (Deut. 24:15). Why? Since he is poor. It states likewise: For that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin, wherein shall he sleep? (Exod. 22:26). If he does not have his garment, he will suffer from the cold during the night and will cry unto Me and I will hear him (ibid.). Two matters, similar to each other, are treated here, a pledge and a man’s hire.</p>

            <summary>Solomon teaches that a righteous person may falter momentarily in the face of evil, but will regain composure and dignity, likening it to murky waters in a well that clear up on their own. The comparison between a murky well and a polluted fountain is explained through the concept of tears originating in the brain, and the idea that G'd is the ultimate source of life-giving water. Maimonides clarifies that setting signs for oneself is permitted, contrary to a mistaken interpretation, and emphasizes that righteous figures like Eliezer and Jonathan would not approve of such a misunderstanding. The Chizkuni commentary notes the inverted use of the male pronoun for a female in Deuteronomy 21:3:1, similar to Genesis 24:13.</summary>

              <p>So, too, is one who sets certain signs for himself etc. This is a gross error, for such thing is, indeed, permitted. Perhaps the text (Hullin, 95b) misled him, as he saw there, saying: &quot;Such divination which is not like the divination of Eliezer (Gen. 24. 13–14) and Jonathan (I. Samuel, 20. 21–22) is not considered divining&quot;, and he evidently thought that the subject there is concerning a charge against such practice. Whereas it is not all so, for the meaning thereof is this: It is not proper to depend upon it. I wonder how he could think that way of such righteous men. Indeed, had they been present when he said it, they would have applied tongues of fire to his face. (Maimonides does not quote the text verbatim, as he omits Jonathan. Eliezer was of the sons of Noah, against whom no charge of divination holds. He really acted in full reliance upon the sign he set for himself by giving her the presents without inquiring as to who she was. Such is forbidden to an Israelite. Jonathan merely set a sign to caution his lad. He did not practice divination, as he was righteous in his observance of the laws of the Torah. The text (Hullin, 95b) does refer to a charge against such practice, what Jonathan did, if one believes it divination. Maimonides deserves no tongues of flame in his face; here as everywhere he shines like a beacon of light. C. G.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>According to Bereshit Rabbah 75,2, Solomon taught us something here about the true measure of a righteous person. When you observe such a person falter in the face of the superior might of a wicked person, such a weakness is only momentary; it does not represent a capitulation of the righteous in face of evil. He will recover from such weakness (with the help of G’d.) This is why Solomon already wrote in Proverbs 24, 16: “For the righteous will rise even if he falls seven times.” In the end he will regain his composure and his honour and dignity. The whole matter can be compared to a well of spring water which someone steps into and momentarily causes the waters in that well to become murky. After a short while of leaving those waters to themselves they will become clear again. Similarly, the righteous will regain his composure and hence his dignity. The wicked is unable to permanently suppress the superior qualities of the righteous.  Why did Solomon, or the sages who interpreted these verses of Proverbs, choose this comparison between a murky well and a polluted fountain? It is a well known fact that a river is fed by a fountain whereas the fountain draws on an original source of water. Both are recipients of their respective waters. The reason why the fountain is called מעין, i.e. something derived from עין, and we have the expression עין המים, (Genesis 24,13 where Eliezer met Rivkah) is that the eye, i.e. עין receives its water from the דמעה, the tear. Tears originate in the brain. When someone indulges in too much weeping he causes his brain to dry out. The מקור, “the source,” does not rely on outside sources for its input. It is a “self-starter.” Its waters keep increasing and never stop flowing. This is why the name מקור is an apt name applied to G’d, seeing that He is the fountainhead of everything, and seeing that because of this there is no danger that this source will ever fail. This is reflected in Jeremiah 17,13 מקור מים חיים את ה', that “the source of (life-giving) spring water is G’d Himself.” We also have Psalms 36,10 where the psalmist describes the source of such water as being with G’d, i.e. כי עמך מקור חיים, “with You is the fountain of life.” These considerations prompted Solomon to describe a righteous person who falters in the presence of a wicked person as comparable to murky waters and a polluted fountain. Both of these defects are temporary in nature and the force of the clear water is bound to reassert itself in time.</p>

Eliezer's reliance on character traits over omens is highlighted, contrasting with Rav's refusal to rely on divination. Eliezer, Caleb, Saul, and Yiftaḥ made unreasonable requests to God, with varying consequences. Moses' role as a provider for his people is likened to that of the angel Mattatron.

The concept of spiritual influence from righteous individuals, such as Avraham, is highlighted through the example of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and the description of Avraham as a dispenser of largesse, even influencing individuals like Betuel. The idea of an immaculate birth for Rivkah, symbolizing the overflow of Avraham's good deeds to those around him, is emphasized to explain how she could become a righteous matriarch despite her father and brother's character. Eliezer's recounting of events at the well during the meal with Betuel also reflects a rewriting of history to avoid directly implying Betuel's connection to Avraham's spirit.</summary>

              <p>והנה רבקה יוצאת אשר ילדה לבתואל‎, “and behold, here ‎Rivkah who had been born for Betuel was coming forth.” She ‎had been born for Betuel, due to beneficial, though indirect, ‎input by Avraham. Betuel was not the originator of Rivkah, but ‎merely a vessel used by G’d as an intermediary. [There is no other ‎verse in the Bible where the expression ‎אשר ילדה‎, “who she bore,” ‎is not connected to the mother who bore that child. Ed.] The ‎Torah alludes to Avraham’s role in that “birth” by using the ‎vowel kubutz, which implies “external influence.” The ‎reason why Eliezer immediately gave Rivkah jewelry even before ‎enquiring who she was, shows that he realized that her attribute ‎of ‎חסד‎ had revealed that she had much in common with his ‎master Avraham, and that there must be a biological link between ‎her and Avraham. This is also what Rashi had in mind when ‎he wrote: (verse 23) “after he had given her the bracelets, because ‎he was certain of his master Avraham’s merits.”‎</p>

              <p>Genesis ‎24,14. “and through her I shall know that You have done a ‎kindness with my master.” These words of Eliezer have been ‎explained in the Zohar where the author states that in the ‎time of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai even small children possessed ‎some special wisdom that enabled them to know what other ‎adults do not know. [The children being innocent. Ed.] They were ‎endowed with this superior wisdom as part of the spiritual rays ‎radiating from the saintly personality of Rabbi Shimon bar ‎Yochai. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is quoted as an example of the ‎influence exerted on his environment by every righteous person, ‎each one in varying degrees according to his spiritual stature. ‎They are to be perceived as a microcosm of Hashem, Who as ‎the macrocosm, disseminates spiritual influence throughout His ‎universe through His very existence. There is no question but ‎that Avraham’s major attribute was ‎חסד‎ and that he had a ‎profound influence on his immediate environment, not only ‎recognized but paid tribute to, by the people of Kiryat Arba, ‎when they described him as a “prince of G’d” in their midst. ‎‎(Genesis 23,6) Avraham personified on earth, what the Creator ‎personifies in the entire universe, i.e. the dispensing of ‎largesse. The expression ‎ילדה‎ is not appropriate for males, as ‎they only ‎הוליד‎, beget, plant seed, but do not bring it to gestation. ‎The proper meaning of the word “yuldah” as it appears ‎here suggests an immaculate birth, a birth that had not been ‎preceded by insemination. Seeing that this is a difficult process ‎for us to grasp, the idea that Avraham’s good deeds “spilled over” ‎even to people such as Betuel, is meant to set our mind at ‎rest over the fact that Rivkah, with a father such as Betuel, and a ‎brother such as Lavan, could have been such a righteous ‎matriarch as she clearly was. During the meal, Eliezer recounts ‎what had occurred at the well, and anyone who has read the ‎Torah’s report of what transpired is aware that Eliezer rewrote ‎some of this “history,” i.e. the sequence of events. Rashi ‎points this out (in his commentary on Genesis 24,47) implying ‎that during the meal, in the presence of Betuel, Eliezer could not ‎bring himself to imply that this man had been endowed with part ‎of Avraham’s soul. [Perhaps the fact that if even a Betuel could ‎exclaim that this match had been made in heaven (Genesis 24,50) ‎is the best support for our author’s theory that some of ‎Avraham’s spirit had spilled over even into the soul of a Betuel. ‎Ed.]‎</p>

            <summary>Eliezer prayed for the girl at the well to be a sign of God's kindness to Abraham, hoping she would be generous and kind, suitable to marry Isaac. Eliezer's test was based on the girl's character traits, not relying on omens or divination. He gave the jewelry to Rebekah only after confirming she was from Abraham's family. The girl's actions at the well would prove her suitability as a wife for Isaac. Eliezer's prayer was not considered inappropriate, as it focused on the girl's kindness and character.</summary>

              <p>והיה הנערה, Eliezer now refers to how he will test a girl who at first glance appears to him as a suitable prospect, seeing that he cannot ask all the girls to draw water his camels; The use by Eliezer of the masculine mode in connection with the word נערה, is most puzzling. The word therefore must refer to some word or subject the Torah has omitted. This is not as unusual as it sounds, as we have another example of something like this in Deuteronomy 22,23: כי יהיה נער בתולה מאורשה לאיש, “when there will be a young girl who is a virgin betrothed to a man, etc;” in that line also the word יהיה, which is in the masculine mode, cannot refer to the girl in question but to the subject matter. In our verse here, Eliezer addresses a subject matter he has not spelled out, such as such, his examination of the girl’s character.</p>

              <p>ואמרה שתה, and she says: “go ahead and drink!” Eliezer is not engaging in ניחוש, divination, but he was looking for an omen, something permitted by Jewish law. He did not rely on this as a reason to give Rivkah the jewelry as he had first enquired about her immediate family history and it had turned out that she was a member of Avraham’s family. He had only made the jewelry ready in the event that it turned out that the girl offering him water to drink should turn out to be a member of Avraham’s family.</p>

              <p>ובה אדע, “and through her (conduct) I will know, etc.” according to Rashi, this wording is a kind of plea by Eliezer. This presents an apparent conflict with a statement by Rabbi Sh’muel son of Nachmeni in the Talmud, tractate Taanit, folio 4, according to which the Bible names three people whose requests from G–d were considered as inappropriate, Eliezer’s request here being one of the three. When we examine Eliezer’s request, if a blind girl had performed the tasks he had requested as proof of her worthiness to become the wife of Yitzchok, he would have had to choose her. According to Rashi’s interpretation, there was nothing inappropriate in Eliezer’s request.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>SHE THAT THOU HAST APPOINTED. The servant relied on the efficacy of the prophet’s (Abraham.)  prayer. (Thou hast appointed implies that God had already chosen a bride for Isaac. How did the servant know this? I.E. suggests that the servant believed that God had accepted Abraham’s prayer (Krinsky). Or I.E.’s point is that the servant did not set up a test to see if the Lord set aside a damsel for Isaac. He trusted that God had because he relied on Abraham’s prayer (Filwarg). Throughout this section I.E. refers to the servant as “the servant.” He apparently was uncertain as to whether to identify him with Eliezer, as the Midrash and other medieval commentators did.)  He was certain that God accepted it and sent an angel, the latter being God’s very own messenger, to help him by appointing a damsel in a dream. (I.E.’s comment is vague. Weiser suggests that an angel appeared to Rebekah and directed (appointed) her to go out to the well. According to Krinsky the angel appeared to Rebekah’s family in a dream and told them to appoint a damsel for Isaac.)  The servant reasoned that there was no family as charitable as his master’s. (Hence a girl saying, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also would most probably be of Abraham’s family (Krinsky).)  Many are perplexed  (Taanit 4a.)  because they say that the servant expressed his request improperly. (In other words they claim that the servant selected an improper omen as proof of God’s choice. “What would the servant have done if a lame or a blind girl would have offered to give him and his flocks water? What would he have done if she was not of Abraham’s family and kindred” (Taanit 4a)?)  I, however, do not see anything wrong in what he said, for had it been another damsel, one not of Abraham’s family, who offered to give him drink and water his camels, he would have left her and nothing would have been lost, for the verse and said; Whose daughter art thou means he had previously said, before he gave the ring and bracelets to Rebekah, whose daughter art thou ? (Verses 22 and 23 state that the servant first gave Rebekah a golden ring and two bracelets and then said, Whose daughter art thou ? This implies that he took Rebekah for Isaac before he knew who she was. This contradicts what I.E. has just said, hence his interpretation.)  Scripture similarly states, And I asked her, and said: Whose daughter art thou? And she said: The daughter of Bethuel…And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands (v. 47). The sum of the matter is the servant prayed that God would appoint for Isaac a young lady from the family of his master, the sign of God’s choice being that the damsel would act graciously as a woman of noble character should. (Cf. Cant. 7:2 (bat nadiv).)  God heard his prayer. However, the case of Jonathan is totally different. (I.E.’s point is that the servant did not really set up a test to determine God’s will. He merely offered a prayer that God send him what he was looking for. His choice was not dependent on what the girl would do. If she acted in a certain way then he would investigate further. However, Jonathan set up a test. If such and such would happen he would act thus; if it did not, he would act differently. Jonathan’s test related to his attacking the Philistines. Jonathan said, If they say thus unto us: Tarry until we come unto you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. But if they say thus: Come up unto us; then we will go up; for the Lord hath delivered them unto our hand; and this shall be the sign unto us (I Sam. 14:9, 10).) </p>

              <p>She You have proven for Your servant, for Yitzchak. Rashi explains, she is worthy for him that she is a doer of chessed. This topic is juxtaposed with the topic of Ephron the Chiti, because he too was from the family of Cana'an, and Ephron was begrudging of eye and therefore he [God] commanded to stay far from the Cana'anim, for they were begrudging [lit. evil of eye], because money will answer and testify to all, and every person is recognized through his pocket, if his actions are pure and straight, and there is no better test or &quot;crucible&quot; for a person than gold and silver. And thus said Shlomo (Mishlei 17:3) &quot;A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold...&quot; because one who wishes to test a person will go to the money and see what his nature is. For if he will remain in his righteousness in the business of money, then in every insight it will be revealed that he is complete [honest], and vice versa. And from here Eliezer learned that he didn't need to check Rivkah except with this trait--if she is generous [lit. has a good eye] and does kindness, and there he said &quot;I will not demand from her anything but that she give me to drink, and if she responds, 'drink, and I will also give your camels to drink' then certainly she is a doer of kindness, that she will give me more than what I ask, and if so she You have proven for Your servant, for Yitzchak, for his entire household is garbed in salvation for other creatures&quot;</p>

And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, &quot;Any bride whose eyes are beautiful does not require examination of her whole body.&quot; But this is something that the senses contradict; as how many ugly women are there in the world who have beautiful eyes? And there is another difficulty: Why did the Sages, may their memory be blessed, see fit to give advice to ascertain this external beauty - is it not that 'charm is false and beauty is vanity?' Rather it is certain that they gave advice to ascertain her deeds. And this is the advice that was advised: That he check if she has a kind eye and purveys acts of loving-kindness. For if her eyes are kind to the creatures, then she is, without a doubt, perfect in all of her character traits. </p>

              <p>והיה הנערה אשר אומר אליה הטי נא כדך, “let it be that the maiden to whom I shall say: ‘please lower your jug so that I may drink,’ etc.” We have learned in Taanit 4 that there were three people who did not phrase a request to G-d in an appropriate manner. The three were: Eliezer, the servant of Avraham, Saul, son of Kish; and Yiftach from Gilead. Concerning Eliezer the Torah writes: (quoting our verses) “the criteria Eliezer listed to enable him to choose a bride for Yitzchak could have been met by a blind or lame girl.” [Eliezer surely did not mean for a girl with either one of such a handicap to become the bride of Yitzchak. Ed.]. Nonetheless, G-d arranged for the girl whom Eliezer met to be Rivkah, i.e. an eminently suitable choice. Saul, son of Kish requested victory over Goliath the Philistine blasphemer, promising the man who would kill Goliath his daughter as well as material wealth (Samuel I 17,28). If a slave or a bastard had taken up the challenge and succeeded, Saul would have been bound by a promise so carelessly formulated. G-d was kind enough to send him David who took up the challenge. In the case of Yiftach, we are told (Judges 11,31) that he foolishly vowed to offer as a sacrifice to G-d the first living creature which would come to meet him when he returned victoriously from battle. As it happened, his only daughter came out to welcome him. He had laid himself open to having to sacrifice any animal that was not even permitted to be offered as a sacrifice. G-d arranged that his daughter should meet him instead of what he had had in mind. This was the mystical dimension of Jeremiah 8,22 הצרי אין בגלעד אם רופא אין שם? “is there no balm in Gilead, no physician either?” The prophet points out that Yiftach could have had his vow annulled by the High Priest Pinchas or even by someone else had he not been too proud to do so. This thought [that there is not the slightest reason to honour a vow when it involves human sacrifice. Ed.] is underlined by the same prophet in Jeremiah 19,5 אשר לא ציויתי ולא דברתי, ולא עלתה על לבי, “which I have not commanded, nor spoken about, nor even thought about.” In other words, it was not G-d’s fault, or the fault of G-d’s legislation about honouring one’s vows which led to the death of Yiftach’s daughter.</p>

Its interpretation however is as follows: “Make it happen to me this day that the girl to whom I will speak be the one that You have appointed for Your servant Isaac, and with this, show kindness to my master Abraham for with this I will know that You have shown kindness to him if she be of his family and of good mind and of beautiful appearance.” And so he said [when recounting the events of the day]: And let it come to pass, that the maiden, etc., let the same be the woman whom the Eternal hath appointed.

              <p>Die Weisen wollen übrigens (Taanit 42a) Eliesers Verfahren keineswegs als eine mustergültige Weise, eine Frau zu wählen, empfohlen wissen. Wohl nur ein Elieser, den die Zuversicht eines Abraham auf einer solchen Sendung geleitet, daß Gott schon seinen Engel vor ihm hersenden und ihm das rechte Mädchen zuführen werde, durfte in einer solchen Zuversicht also handeln. Daß sein Verfahren, welches Chulin 95b. formell als Beispiel für das verbotene ניחוש aufgeführt wird, nicht eigentlich unter diesen Begriff falle, hat schon ר&quot;ן zur Stelle erläutert. ניחוש ists, wenn Entschlüsse von Vorgängen abhängig gemacht werden, die in keinerlei vernünftigem, natürlichem Zusammenhang zu ihnen stehen. Allein das Merkmal, an welchem Elieser die für Jizchak geeignete Frau erkennen wollte, gehört ja den Charaktereigentümlichkeiten an, die noch heute das charakteristische Kennzeichen der Nachkommen Jizchaks und Rebekkas bilden, und die wir unter dem Begriff von גמילות הסד zusammenfassen. Diese überall hilfreich beizuspringen bereite Menschenliebe, die erst durch die Sendung der Abrahamiden mittelbar und unmittelbar auch in die nichtabrahamitische Welt sich allmählich Bahn gebrochen, hatte Elieser in Abrahams Hause kennen gelernt, sie war das charakteristische Merkmal des Abrahamzeltes, sie mußte den hervorstechendsten Zug in dem Charakter der künftigen Frau dieses Hauses der rechten Gattin Jizchaks bilden, und wohl durfte Elieser glauben, daß nur in der Familie Abrahams sich noch eine solche Gemütsanlage finden dürfte und darauf sein Verfahren gründen. Sie muss doch jedenfalls eine seltene gewesen sein, sonst hätte sie überall für ihn kein Kennzeichen abgeben können. — לעברך ליצחק, mit großer Feinheit sagt er לעבדך וגוי, nicht לאדני oder לבן אדני; eben der Gedanke, daß Jizchak, für den er eine Frau sucht, עכר ד׳ ist, lässt ihn ein solches Merkmal wählen, und zugleich hoffen, daß Gott ihm die rechte zuführen werde. Ist es ja der dem Dienste Gottes Geweihte, dem er eine Genossin sucht. Die Förderung der Gottessache selbst ist durch die glückliche Wahl bedingt. —</p>

              <p>אותה הוכחת לעבדך ליצחק, “her You have designated for Your servant, for Yitzchok.” Rashi understands the word הוכחת here as meaning “suitable.” Eliezer meant that a girl who would not only agree to draw water for him, the stranger, but would volunteer to also water his camels (although he was an able-bodied man capable of doing this by himself) had proven a fit successor for Yitzchok’s mother Sarah. 
    Nachmanides explains that the words אותה הוכחת וגו' are all still part of Eliezer’s prayer which started with the words הקרה נא, (verse 12) He would consider what appeared like a coincidence מקרה not as such but as a sign from G’d that this was indeed the girl he had been searching for. This sign would prove that G’d had shown an special kindness to his master. If the girl were to be a member of Avraham’s family, this would be an additional sign.
    If you were to object, pointing out that even non Jews are forbidden to practice any kind of witchcraft or reliance on omens, so that Eliezer’s having given the jewelry to Rivkah before she had told him whose family she belonged to, you would have to answer that he did not give her the bracelets and nose-ring until he knew whose family she belonged to. We have a rule that the Torah is not obligated to report events in their chronological order, hence the fact that here the Torah has chosen to report Eliezer as giving jewelry to Rivkah on the strength of her having helped him, even before reporting who she was, is not so surprising.
    Another approach could be the fact that actually the Torah describes Eliezer only as ויקח נזם זהב וגו', “He took a golden nose-ring, etc.,” i.e. it does not state that he had already handed over the jewelry or put it on her hands as we hear in verse 47 when the servant recounted his experiences at the well, when he describes this as something he had done after having identified her as a member of Avraham’s family. Maybe, at this stage he showed the jewelry to Rivkah and asked her about her family before giving it to her and placing the bracelets on her hands. The words על ידיה would then describe the function of the צמידים, the bracelets.
    A third possibility is that the whole question of ניחוש, reliance on magical devices, omens, subjective criteria, etc.’ to establish the truth of something, is not an issue either with Eliezer or with Yonathan, David’s friend. It is only when one bases one’s course of action exclusively on coincidences, magic formulas, etc., that one violates the Torah’s commandment not to do so. Eliezer used the criteria he had set himself to examine the character of the girl as a guideline, but not as determining the issue to the extent of abandoning his own evaluation as to her suitability. Similarly, Yonathan used the arrows to encourage the lad to search further not to determine David’s course of action a fateful course. (Samuel I chapter 20)
    Ibn Ezra wrote that many people are astounded at Eliezer’s conduct, considering it as inappropriate. He does not understand how these people’s minds work. After all, it is quite clear that if the first girl who had agreed to Eliezer’s request and beyond that had turned out not to be a member of Avraham’s family, he would look further.

              <p>“The one whom You have decreed for Your servant Isaac” [24:14]. He said: when the maiden will act with kindness at the well, then she is proper for the house of Abraham, since great kindness is done there for guests. Hizkuni asks a question. Why did Eliezer pray that he should recognize if the maiden does acts of kindness at the well? He could have recognized if the maiden is pious and clever in her house. The explanation is that Eliezer thought that in her father and mother’s house one couldn’t recognize what the maiden is. Her father and mother tell her everything. That is, present yourself before the guest as clever, in the hope that you will please him. Sometimes, many girls are foolish and evil at home, but their father and mother emphasize the cleverness. Therefore, Eliezer prayed that he should learn the cleverness of the maiden when she will be at the well alone, that she should be able to respond with wisdom by herself. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:13.)  Hizkuni also writes. He took ten camels for ten men to ride, for the blessings of the wedding, so that there should be a minyan. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:10.) </p>

            <summary>Rav tested propitiousness using a ferry but did not rely entirely on the results, understanding that the Blessed One can change everything. Augury is forbidden only to those who rely implicitly on it, as demonstrated by Rav's refusal to eat meat he had unlawfully resorted to augury for. An augurer must rely on their augury as Eliezer and Jonathan did to be considered legitimate, which Rav did not do, only using the ferry as an indication of potential success rather than a decisive factor in his actions.</summary>

              <p>And if one would ask: if one is forbidden to resort to these signs and is called an augurer if he does so, how are we to understand (Chullin 95b): &quot;Rav would test [propitiousness] by means of a ferry&quot; [if it came towards him, he would see it as a propitious sign]. What difference is there between a ferry and a deer crossing one's path? — the answer is: though Rav tested propitiousness by means of a ferry, he did not make his future action entirely dependent upon the result of that test, but only sought some indication of whether he would meet with success; and even if the sign was that he would not, he would not, because of this, abandon his undertaking, knowing as he did that the Blessed One can change everything according to His will. Augury is forbidden only to him who relies upon it implicitly, as is made clear there (Ibid): &quot;And even so [even though the meat in question had been under constant surveillance], Rav did not eat of that meat. Why not, if it had been under constant surveillance? It must be because he had [unlawfully] resorted to augury [and therefore banned to himself the fruits, as it were, of that augury]. But did not Rav himself say that any augurer who is not like Eliezer the servant of Abraham and Jonathan the son of Saul is not an augurer?&quot; That is: if he does not rely implicitly upon his augury as did Eliezer the servant of Abraham, who said (Genesis 24:14): &quot;And it will be that maiden to whom I say: 'Hand down your pitcher that I may drink' — and who answers: 'Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink' — she is the one whom You have designated for your servant Isaac,&quot; and as Jonathan the son of Saul, who said (I Samuel 14:10): &quot;And if they say thus: 'Come up to us' — then we shall go up, for the L-rd has given them into our hand&quot; — if one does not rely implicitly upon his augury as these did, then he is not considered an augurer. And Rav did not rely implicitly upon his augury but only said: &quot;A ferry is coming towards me — it is a good day for wayfarers.&quot; He did not say that if a ferry came towards him he would go, and that if it did not, he would not.</p>

Eliezer asked for a sign regarding Isaac's wife, Caleb promised his daughter to whoever captured a city, Saul offered his daughter to whoever killed Goliath, and Yiftaḥ vowed to sacrifice whatever came out of his house, leading to the tragic death of his daughter. Pinḥas and Yiftaḥ were both punished for the blood of Yiftaḥ's daughter. In Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 16:8, it is emphasized that everything is revealed before God, such as the fact that Rebecca was destined to marry Isaac.

              <p>“Behold, I am standing by the spring of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water” (Genesis 24:13).  “May it be that the girl to whom I will say: Tilt your jug please, and I will drink, and she will say: Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink; it is she You have confirmed for Your servant, for Isaac, and through her I will know that You have shown kindness to my master” (Genesis 24:14).  “It was before he concluded to speak, and behold, Rebecca was coming out, who was born to Betuel, son of Milka, wife of Nahor, brother of Abraham, and her jug is on her shoulder” (Genesis 24:15).  “Behold, I am standing by the spring of water and the daughters of the men of the city…May it be that the girl to whom I will say: Tilt…” – there are four people who made inappropriate demands [of God], three were granted appropriate responses, one was granted an inappropriate response. They are: Abraham’s servant Eliezer, Caleb, Saul, and Yiftaḥ. Eliezer said: “May it be that the girl to whom I will say….” What if some maidservant would emerge and give him to drink, would he have taken her to marry his master’s son? That is a rhetorical question. Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him: “It was before he concluded to speak, and behold, Rebecca was coming out…”   Caleb said: “Whoever smites Kiryat Sefer and captures it, I will give him Akhsa my daughter as a wife” (Judges 1:12). What if some slave would have conquered it, would he have given him his daughter? Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him, as it is stated: “Otniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s…brother, captured it; and he gave him Akhsa his daughter as a wife” (Judges 1:13).  Saul said: “It shall be, that whichever man smites him [Goliath], the king will enrich him with great wealth, and he will give him his daughter as a wife” (I Samuel 17:25). What if some Kushite or idolater or slave had emerged and smitten him, would he have given him his daughter? Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him, as it is written: “David, the son of that nobleman” (I Samuel 17:12).  Yiftaḥ [said:] “It shall be that whatever emerges…I will offer it up as a burnt offering” (Judges 11:31). What if some dog or cat had emerged, would he have offered it up as a burnt offering? And the Holy One blessed be He made an inappropriate arrangement for him. That is what is written: “Yiftaḥ came…and behold, his daughter came out to greet him” (Judges 11:34).  Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He [Yiftaḥ] was obligated to pay for monetary consecration. (When his daughter came out to greet him, although he was of course not obliged to sacrifice her, he was obligated to redeem her with money, as one redeems consecrated property that cannot be used.)  Reish Lakish said: He was not even obligated to pay for monetary consecration, as we learn in a mishna: (Temura 5:6.)  If one said regarding an impure animal or a blemished animal: ‘These are hereby [consecrated as] a burnt offering, it is as if he has said nothing at all.’ [But if he said:] ‘These are hereby [consecrated] for use towards a burnt offering,’ they are to be sold, and he must bring a burnt offering with their money. (Yiftaḥ’s statement was analogous to the first case, so his declaration was null and void.)   Pinḥas [the high priest] was not there to abrogate his [Yiftaḥ’s] vow for him. Instead, Pinḥas said: ‘It is he who requires my services; shall I go to him?’ And Yiftaḥ said: ‘I am the head of the chieftains of Israel, shall I go to Pinḥas?’ Between the two of them, that young woman was lost. (Yiftaḥ did fulfill his vow through his daughter, although this was not in accordance with Torah law, as explained in the previous paragraph.)  This accords with [the saying] that people say: Between the midwife and the mother in childbirth, the son of the wretched woman is gone. (If the baby dies, each one blames the other.)    Both of them [Pinḥas and Yiftaḥ] were punished for the blood of the young woman. Yiftaḥ died as a result of his limbs falling off. Everywhere he would go, one of his limbs would fall off and they would bury it there. That is what is written: “Yiftaḥ died and he was buried in the cities of Gilad” (Judges 12:7) – “the city of Gilad” is not stated, but rather, “the cities of Gilad.” (Indicating that he was buried in several cities.)  As for Pinḥas, the Divine Spirit was stripped from him. That is what is written: “Pinḥas son of Elazar had been chief over them” (I Chronicles 9:20) – “is chief over them” is not written here, but rather, “had been chief.” “In earlier times the Lord had been with him” (I Chronicles 9:20).</p>

              <p>Four opened with vows; three made unreasonable requests but the Holy One blessed be He responded favorably, and one made an unreasonable request and the Omnipresent responded to him unfavorably. These are they: Eliezer, servant of Abraham; Saul; Yiftaḥ; and Caleb. Eliezer made an unreasonable request, as it is stated: “It will be that the girl to whom I shall say: Tilt your jug please…[it is she You have confirmed for Your servant, for Isaac]” (Genesis 24:14). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: Had a Canaanite maidservant or a prostitute emerged, would you have said: “It is she You have confirmed for Your servant, for Isaac” (Genesis 24:14)? But the Holy One blessed be He acted on his behalf and arranged for Rebecca to [come to] him.  Caleb made an unreasonable request, as it is stated: “Caleb said: To whoever smites Kiryat Sefer and captures it, I will give Akhsa my daughter to him as a wife” (Joshua 15:16). The Holy One blessed be He responded to him: Had a Canaanite, a mamzer, or a slave captured it, would you have given him your daughter? What did the Holy One blessed be He do? He arranged for his brother to capture it, as it is stated: “Otniel ben Kenaz, [brother of Caleb,] captured it” (Joshua 15:17).  Saul made an unreasonable request, as it is stated: “It will be that the man who smites him, the king will enrich him with great wealth, and he will give him his daughter” (I Samuel 17:25). (Saul offered his daughter in marriage to the man who would smite Goliath. )  The Holy One blessed be He said: Had an Amonite, a mamzer, or slave killed him, would you have given him your daughter? The Holy One blessed be He arranged for David [to kill Goliath], and [Saul] gave him his daughter Mikhal.  Yiftaḥ made an unreasonable request, as it is stated: “It will be, that whatever emerges from the doors of my house […I will offer it up as a burnt offering]” (Judges 11:31). The Holy One blessed be He said: Had a camel, a donkey, or a dog emerged, would you have presented it as a burnt offering? The Holy One blessed be He responded to him unfavorably and arranged for his daughter [to emerge] for him.  “It was upon his seeing her that he rent his garments” (Judges 11:35) – he could have had his vow dissolved and gone to Pinḥas. He said: I am a king; shall I go to Pinḥas? (Yiftaḥ considered it beneath his dignity for him to have to go to Pinḥas to dissolve his vow. )  Pinḥas said: I am the High Priest and the son of a High Priest; shall I go to this ignoramus? In the meanwhile, that miserable one (Yiftaḥ’s daughter; see Judges 11:35–40. )  died, and both of them were liable for her blood. Pinḥas, the Divine Spirit left him. That is what is written: “Pinḥas son of Elazar had been the chief official over them in the past; the Lord was with him” (I Chronicles 9:20). Yiftaḥ’s limbs fell off one by one and were buried. That is what is written: “He was buried in the cities of Gilead” (Judges 12:7). It is not written, “In the city of Gilead,” but rather, “in the cities [of Gilead].” It teaches that his limbs fell off one by one, and he was buried in many places.  Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan: Reish Lakish said: He was obligated to give money and to sacrifice upon the altar. (When Yiftaḥ’s daughter emerged, he should have just taken a sum of money corresponding to her value and used it to purchase animals for sacrifice. )  Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He was not obligated to give money, as we learned: An item that is fit to be sacrificed atop the altar, shall be sacrificed; an item that is not fit to be sacrificed atop the altar, shall not be sacrificed atop the altar. (Thus, his vow did not take effect at all upon his daughter. Some add, based on Tanḥuma, that the text here should state: The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: If you bring your valuations before Me, I consider it as though you sacrificed your souls [nafshotekhem] before Me. That is why it is stated: “If a man articulates a vow in accordance with the valuation of persons [nefashot] to the Lord” (Etz Yosef). )  Moreover, anyone who vows and fulfills his vow, merits to pay his vow in Jerusalem. That is what is written: “I will pay my vows to the Lord” (Psalms 116:18). Where? “In the courtyards of the house of the Lord, in your midst, Jerusalem. Halleluya” (Psalms 116:19), and it says: “Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, for His kindness is forever” (Psalms 118:1).    </p>

              <p>When Eliezer examined who would be a suitable match for Isaac, he tested Rebeccah for precisely these traits. He did not have to examine Rebeccah concerning jealousy, seeing that Isaac had already been consecrated and could therefore never marry a slave girl, as distinct from Abraham. Rebeccah would therefore never have cause for that kind of jealousy. This is why he only examined whether Rebeccah was generous of heart and whether she was humble and modest. The signs that he determined this by are listed in 24,14. Rebeccah demonstrated generosity of spirit when she not only gave water to Eliezer and his men but also to his camels, and when she immediately volunteered lodging once she had been asked whether there was room in her house. When she responded to the question in 24,23: &quot;is there room in your father's house ללין (to spend one night),&quot; she offered lodging for more than one night, i.e. ללון. Rebeccah demonstrated her modesty when she addressed Eliezer as &quot;my lord,&quot; and hastened to comply with his request for personal service. As soon as Eliezer noted this, he said &quot;this girl is suitable for the house of an Abraham,&quot; and he viewed her like a lily amongst thorns; Laban was her exact opposite, just as Bileam was the exact opposite of Abraham. All of Laban's fawning on Eliezer was only so as to receive a generous monetary reward.</p>

              <p>We have explained on several occasion that the שר העולם, the angel to whom G–d has entrusted the proper allocation of the food- supply in our world, is called Mattatron, or נער. Moses' function too, was to provide for the needs of his people. He is already referred to as נער when the daughter of Pharaoh found him, although normally he should only have been referred to as ילד (Exodus 2,6). Our commentators have said that Moses' voice was like that of a נער. The very name משה is also an acronym for מטטרון שר הפנים. On Exodus 24,1: ואל משה אמר עלה אל ה' our sages comment that Moses' name was Mattatron, just like the name of his teacher. When the Torah commenced the Book of Leviticus with the words ויקרא, this is a choice expression for all those who are מושפעים, direct recipients of G–d's favor. This is another dimension of Proverbs 9,1-3 which we discussed on page 739, i.e. נערותיה תקרא, that Moses called out to Aaron and his sons, etc. The latter were also comparable to angels, as pointed out by Malachi 2,7 that the priest is an angel of the Lord. Every time the Torah refers to a girl as נערה, the word is spelled without the feminine ending, i.e. it is written נער, although we read it as נערה. The description of Moses as נער then is an allusion to his function being similar to that of Mattatron.</p>

              <p>AND SHE ALIGHTED (‘VATIPOL’) FROM THE CAMEL. Rashi comments: “She let herself slide towards the ground, as the Targum renders it, ‘She inclined herself [towards the earth but did not actually reach the ground]. Similarly, Let down thy pitcher (Above, Verse 14.)  was translated by Onkelos to mean ‘incline.’ And He bowed down the heavens (Psalms 18:10.)  — the Targum translates: ‘and He bent.’ A similar case is the verse, Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, (Ibid., 37:24.)  which means though he bends himself towards the earth, yet he shall not touch the ground.” But Onkelos’ opinion is not that she let herself slide off the camel to the earth, for if so, she actually fell off the camel and did not just incline herself. Similarly, all expressions of “inclining” merely mean a bending towards one side. Onkelos’ opinion, however, is that on the camel upon which she was riding she bent herself towards one side in order to turn her face away from him. A similar case, in my opinion, is the verse: And when Naaman saw one running after him, ‘vayipol’ from upon the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? (II Kings 5:21.)  The word vayipol here only means that he bent himself in the chariot towards the runner who was on the ground to ask of him whether all is well. And so indeed it is said there, When the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee. (Ibid., Verse 26.)  It is possible that as far as Onkelos is concerned, the expression, from on the camel, is like “on the camel,” [the letter mem in the word mei’al (from on) being redundant]. A similar case is the verse, For great ‘mei’al’ the heavens is Thy mercy, (Psalms 108:5.)  [which means “for great on the heavens is Thy mercy,” and not “from on the heavens”]. A redundant letter mem like this is also found in these verses: There shall be no more ‘misham’ an infant of days, nor an old man, (Isaiah 65:20.)  [which means “there shall be no more there,” and not “from there”]; Ye waters that are ‘mei’al’ the heavens, (Psalms 148:4.)  [which means “ye waters that are on the heavens,” and not “from on the heavens”]. In line with the plain meaning [of Scripture, however, the letter mem in the word mei’al is not redundant, but instead] it is like the mem in the verse, And, behold, there came many people ‘miderech’ (from a way) round-about. (II Samuel 13:34.)  [And thus in the verse before us, mei’al hagamal would mean that she alighted “from on the camel.”] There are many similar verses.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND SHE CALLED HIS NAME SHELAH, AND HE [Judah] WAS AT CHEZIB, WHEN SHE BORE HIM. Rashi wrote: “I am of the opinion that because it was there that she ceased bearing children, the place was called Chezib (deceit). It is similar in expression to the verse, Wilt thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful (‘achzav’) brook. (Jeremiah 15:18.)  If this be not so, what is the verse teaching us by mentioning that Judah was in Chezib?” Now I do not know why a place should be named for that reason, [i.e., because there she ceased bearing children], there being nothing outstanding in such an event as three sons were sufficient for her. (Had she been barren that would be a tragedy of some significance.)  Moreover, at the time she gave birth to the third son it was not yet known whether she had ceased bearing or would give birth afterwards. Only at the time of her demise did it become established [that she had ceased bearing with the third son]. (Why then would the place have been called Chezib at the time she gave birth to the third son?)  Now some scholars (R’dak in his commentary. Also in Da’ath Z’keinim ba’alei Tosafoth.)  say that it was their custom for the father to name the firstborn, and the mother the second one. It is for this reason that Scripture states concerning the first son, And he called his name, (Verse 3 here.)  and concerning the second one, And she called. (Verse 4 here.)  Now concerning the third son, [the naming of whom was the father’s prerogative, Scripture nevertheless] says, And she called, explaining that this was because Judah was in Chezib when she gave birth to him, and he was not there to name him. This interpretation lacks rhyme or reason. In the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra Scripture relates where they were born; the statement, when she bore ‘him,’ is as if it had said ‘them,’ as all three sons were born in one place. In my opinion, the name Shelah is an expression meaning a thing which stops and deceives. Thus, do not ‘thashleh’ (deceive) me, (II Kings 4:28.)  which the Targum there renders as, “Let not your word deceive your handmaid.” Perhaps it is related to the concept of error, for he who commits an error deceives his thinking. Thus Scripture is saying that she called him Shelah, [a word which is traceable to the root of the Hebrew word meaning ‘error,’] because of the name of the place, as he was in Chezib — [a word which means ‘deceive’] — when she bore him. And [the word v’hayah (and he was), although it should really be saying, v’haytha, (and she was), is identical with the expression ‘V’hayah hana’arah’ (And the damsel shall be). (Above, 24:14. There, too, it should be saying, v’haytha hana’arah in the feminine, except that the word v’haya does not refer to na’arah but to the event itself and is therefore to be understood as: “And it shall come to pass that the damsel, etc.” Here, likewise, it is to be so understood.)  This is the intent of the saying of the Rabbis in Bereshith Rabbah: (85:5.)  “Paskath was the name of the place.” (This contradicts the opinion of Rashi, who maintains that it was the mother who named the place Chezib because she ceased bearing children.) </p>

Similarly in (Genesis 24:14) “let down thy pitcher, I pray thee”, the word הטי let down, Onkelos translates by ארכיני “incline”, and (Psalm 18:10) “He bowed (ויט) the heavens” he translates by וארכין which means “He bent them towards the ground”. A similar idea is (Psalms 37:24) “Though he fall (יפול) he shall not be utterly cast down” which is as much as to say, “though he bends himself towards the earth yet he shall not touch the ground (i. e. shall not fall entirely)” (Genesis Rabbah 60:15). </p>

              <p>From here … is solicitous of the [Israelites’] property. You might ask: From where did Rashi derive this? Perhaps Hashem was answering their request when they asked why they and their livestock should die there, and Hashem answered, “Give drink to the community and their livestock.” The answer is that the term השקית (lit. &quot;you will give water&quot;) refers to animals, as it is written in Parshas Chaye Sarah (Bereishis 24:14) “וגם גמליך אשקה” [&quot;And I will also water your camels&quot;]. Thus the Torah should have said “וישתו העדה” [&quot;Let the community drink&quot;] as it writes shortly (v. 11) “ותשת העדה” [&quot;And the community drank&quot;] because the term שתייה [&quot;drinking&quot;] refers to people, as it is also written “שתה אדוני” [&quot;Let my master drink&quot;] (Bereishis 24:18). However, since Scripture modifies its wording and writes והשקית [&quot;And give drink&quot;] it is certainly because “[Hashem] is solicitous of the Israelites’ property.” (Mahari) Also one may answer that Rashi is answering the question: Why is it necessary for the Torah to state “And their livestock”? For in Parshas Beshalach (Shemos 17:3) when Hashem answered Moshe’s request for water, He answered only that the people would drink, and the answer was despite Yisroel having said “To kill me and my children and my livestock [through thirst].” If so, why does it state, “And their livestock”? Rather it was because “[Hashem] is solicitous…” (Kitzur Mizrochi) Hashem said בעירם [&quot;their livestock&quot;] with a mem. Thus we learn that He is solicitous of them because they are the Israelites’ livestock, and not merely because they are animals. For if not so, it should have said “Give drink to the community and the animals”! This answer is also apparent from Divrei Dovid.</p>

Since Rav did not rely on the omen in his decision making, he did not violate the prohibition against divination, and there was no reason for him to penalize himself.

              </summary>
              <p>ויהי הוא טרם כלה לדבר, “and it was before he had finished speaking, etc.” We need to understand the need for the apparently extraneous word הוא in this verse. All the Torah had to write to tell us that Rivkah appeared before Eliezer had completed his prayer was ויהי ככלותו לדברו, “as soon as he had finished speaking, etc.” Actually, the word הוא in this verse is not a personal pronoun, i.e. “he,” but a name of G-d. (compare Genesis 19,33 where we encountered this word in that context) We have numerous examples of the word הוא being a reference to a name of G-d, such as Psalms 100, 3 הוא עשנו ולו אנחנו, “He has made us and we belong to Him;” Numbers 18,23 ועבד הלוי הוא, ”and the Levite will serve G-d, etc.;” the word הוא in that verse means that Eliezer enjoyed G-d’s special assistance in his mission by means of the angel concerning whom Avraham had prayed to G-d that He should make Eliezer’s mission successful (verse 7).The angel, was at hand already before Eliezer had completed praying and he arranged for Rivkah to be the maiden whom Eliezer would address first with his request for water. This is why the Torah wrote: והנה רבקה יוצאת, “and here Rivkah was already in the process of coming out, etc.” The word והנה means that what follows was the result of a special arrangement, invitation. If the servant immediately ran towards her (verse 17) it was because he had noticed the water of the well rising to meet Rivkah on her descent. This is what our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 60,5 have derived from the wording in our verses here.  At that moment Eliezer already understood what Avraham had meant when he had said to him that G-d would send His angel ahead. This is also what he related once he was in Bethuel’s house when he told the family that Avraham had assured him already before he set out on his journey that G-d would send His angel ahead and that he would succeed (verse 40). In view of this it is easy to understand that from the moment that Eliezer had become aware that the angel was supporting him the Torah refers to him no longer as עבד, servant, but as איש, a man of stature. Up until then we read about וישם העבד, “the servant placed;” ויקח העבד, “the servant took;” וירץ העבד, “the servant ran.” From this point on the Torah keeps referring to Eliezer as האיש until he leaves the house of Bethuel with Rivkah. The expressionהאיש is applied to the angel Gavriel in Daniel 9,21. It is also applied to the angel who told Joseph that his brothers had moved away from Shechem, (Genesis 37,17) and that they had been overheard as planning to move to Dothan. In other words, as of the time the angel joined Eliezer in his quest, he himself assumed the role of the angel in an executive manner.  The words והאיש משתאה לה (verse 21) which appear to be somewhat problematical if we assume Eliezer and the angel to have become as one, must be understood as “he was waiting for her;” he did so as he had become aware that his mission was about to be crowned with success. Having done so, the Torah from now on refers to him constantly as האיש, such as when we read (verse 22) ויקח האש, or (verse 26) ויקוד האיש, or (verse 30) כה דבר אלי האיש, etc. When, a little while later, Lavan and Bethuel gave their consent for Eliezer to take Rivkah (verse 51) and they said הנה רבקה לפניך קח ולך, “here Rivkah is in your presence, take her and go,” at which point Eliezer’s mission had been completed, the Torah reverts to describe Eliezer as עבד instead of as האיש. In verse 53 when Eliezer is reported as sharing out gifts, as well as in every subsequent move of his, the Torah speaks of העבד, “the servant,” seeing that the angel’s assistance was no longer required for that part of his activity. Avraham’s prayer which invoked the assistance of an angel had been answered in full.  If you were to ask that when Lavan and his mother asked Rivkah if she were willing to go עם האיש הזה, “with this man,” and this occurred only in verse 58, after verse 51 which we described as the point at which Eliezer’s mission had basically been completed, the answer is simple. The words reported in verse 58 were not spoken by the Torah but by Lavan and his mother. They certainly were not bound by the considerations we described before. How could they be expected to refer to someone as “this slave,” when the person in question was distributing lavish gifts to every member of their household, not to mention to Rivkah herself? Would it not have been a gross insult to their sister to ask her is she were willing to leave her parental home in order to travel to a distant land “with this slave?”  Concerning verse 61 in which both Rivkah and her maids are reported as traveling אחרי האיש, which appears to contradict the explanation I have offered that Eliezer had reverted to being an עבד the moment consent had been obtained for her to become Yitzchak’s bride, this wording was chosen by the Torah in honour of Rivkah. It would not have looked respectful if she had been described as riding “behind the slave.”  Another approach to the words והאיש משתאה לה. It is an allusion to the angel who had tarried and waited at the well until the arrival there of Rivkah. From that moment on Eliezer took over the task of the angel; hence he is referred to as האיש from that moment on. Support for this theory is found in the text near the end of the episode where the Torah said (verse 61) “they walked behind האיש, “and the עבד took Rivkah and he went.” This verse makes it crystal clear that the subjects איש and עבד respectively could not have been one and the same.</p>

And because the girl mentioned her father’s mother first, as it says, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah (Further, Verse 25.)  — for such was customary among the girls, analogous to the verse, And she told her mother’s house (Verse 28 here.)  — therefore Scripture mentions in the verse before us that he [Bethuel] was the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor. But the servant later said, And she said, The daughter of Bethuel Nahor’s son, (Verse 47 here.)  for he corrected the matter as is ethically proper. However, he did say, whom Milcah bore unto him, (Verse 47 here.)  in order to state that Bethuel was the son of the mistress and not the concubine.</p>

              <p>Voller konnte Abrahams Wunsch wohl kaum in Erfüllung gehen. Betuel war in doppelter Weise mit ihm verwandt. Bethuels Vater war Abrahams Bruder, seine Mutter Abrahams Brudertochter und zugleich Saras Schwester. In diesem Berichte tritt eigentümlich Milka, Rebekkas Großmutter, hervor, ebenso in Rebekkas Antwort; von Rebekkas Mutter wird geschwiegen. Sie, die Mutter, scheint nicht von abrahamitischer Familie und auch nicht von abrahamitischem Geiste gewesen zu sein. Es scheint, in Rebekka lebte der Geist der Großmutter weiter, die Mutter sah wohl ihr geistiges Ebenbild im Sohne. Der Verfolg der Erzählung lässt erkennen, daß beide, Mutter und Sohn, das Regiment im Hause führten, der — abrahamitisch gesinnte — Betuel aber, — wahrscheinlich als ein alter gutmütiger &quot;Jude&quot;, der nicht so am Gelde klebte, — bei Seite geschoben war.</p>

            <summary>The commentary on Akeidat Yitzchak 5:1:14 raises several questions regarding the text, including the mention of the descendants of heaven, the timing of rain in relation to the creation of man, the purpose of the mist that rose from the ground, and the use of the word &quot;terem&quot; in the verse.

                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 5:1:14</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Problems in the text of this chapter: 1) Why does it state in chapter 2,4 &quot;When they were being created&quot; (if one ignores the Midrash on this)? 2) What do the toldot hashamayim, descendants of heaven, mentioned in that verse refer to? If it is a reference to the whole six-day cycle of creation, then the words &quot;on the day G-d made them&quot; is contradictory! If these words are connected with what follows, however, i.e. the state of vegetation prior to rainfall, i.e. that all vegetation is the direct result of rainfall, then the letter vav at the beginning of verse five does not make sense! 3) At any rate, why does the Torah report what went on before there had been any rain? Why was there a need for rain as long as man for whose sake the rain was needed had not yet been created? 4) If it did not rain because there was not yet anyone who needed the rain, i.e. man did not need to till the earth, why bother with the eyd, mist that rose from the ground? This all the more so since rain is the result of vapors that rise from the ground! 5) The customary use of the word terem suggests that something has been omitted, namely whatever went on before &quot;terem.” Examples are Genesis 19,4, &quot;Before they could lie down, the men of Sodom had already arrived,&quot; or Genesis 24,15, &quot;Before he had finished talking, Rebeccah arrived.&quot; What is the meaning of the word in our verse? 6) The normal syntax would have required a sentence such as &quot;Before there was rainfall no grass could grow on earth.&quot; Why does the Torah employ such a cumbersome syntax? </p>

              <p>“Behold, I am standing by the spring of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water” (Genesis 24:13).  “May it be that the girl to whom I will say: Tilt your jug please, and I will drink, and she will say: Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink; it is she You have confirmed for Your servant, for Isaac, and through her I will know that You have shown kindness to my master” (Genesis 24:14).  “It was before he concluded to speak, and behold, Rebecca was coming out, who was born to Betuel, son of Milka, wife of Nahor, brother of Abraham, and her jug is on her shoulder” (Genesis 24:15).  “Behold, I am standing by the spring of water and the daughters of the men of the city…May it be that the girl to whom I will say: Tilt…” – there are four people who made inappropriate demands [of God], three were granted appropriate responses, one was granted an inappropriate response. They are: Abraham’s servant Eliezer, Caleb, Saul, and Yiftaḥ. Eliezer said: “May it be that the girl to whom I will say….” What if some maidservant would emerge and give him to drink, would he have taken her to marry his master’s son? That is a rhetorical question. Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him: “It was before he concluded to speak, and behold, Rebecca was coming out…”   Caleb said: “Whoever smites Kiryat Sefer and captures it, I will give him Akhsa my daughter as a wife” (Judges 1:12). What if some slave would have conquered it, would he have given him his daughter? Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him, as it is stated: “Otniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s…brother, captured it; and he gave him Akhsa his daughter as a wife” (Judges 1:13).  Saul said: “It shall be, that whichever man smites him [Goliath], the king will enrich him with great wealth, and he will give him his daughter as a wife” (I Samuel 17:25). What if some Kushite or idolater or slave had emerged and smitten him, would he have given him his daughter? Yet the Holy One blessed be He made an appropriate arrangement for him, as it is written: “David, the son of that nobleman” (I Samuel 17:12).  Yiftaḥ [said:] “It shall be that whatever emerges…I will offer it up as a burnt offering” (Judges 11:31). What if some dog or cat had emerged, would he have offered it up as a burnt offering? And the Holy One blessed be He made an inappropriate arrangement for him. That is what is written: “Yiftaḥ came…and behold, his daughter came out to greet him” (Judges 11:34).  Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He [Yiftaḥ] was obligated to pay for monetary consecration. (When his daughter came out to greet him, although he was of course not obliged to sacrifice her, he was obligated to redeem her with money, as one redeems consecrated property that cannot be used.)  Reish Lakish said: He was not even obligated to pay for monetary consecration, as we learn in a mishna: (Temura 5:6.)  If one said regarding an impure animal or a blemished animal: ‘These are hereby [consecrated as] a burnt offering, it is as if he has said nothing at all.’ [But if he said:] ‘These are hereby [consecrated] for use towards a burnt offering,’ they are to be sold, and he must bring a burnt offering with their money. (Yiftaḥ’s statement was analogous to the first case, so his declaration was null and void.)   Pinḥas [the high priest] was not there to abrogate his [Yiftaḥ’s] vow for him. Instead, Pinḥas said: ‘It is he who requires my services; shall I go to him?’ And Yiftaḥ said: ‘I am the head of the chieftains of Israel, shall I go to Pinḥas?’ Between the two of them, that young woman was lost. (Yiftaḥ did fulfill his vow through his daughter, although this was not in accordance with Torah law, as explained in the previous paragraph.)  This accords with [the saying] that people say: Between the midwife and the mother in childbirth, the son of the wretched woman is gone. (If the baby dies, each one blames the other.)    Both of them [Pinḥas and Yiftaḥ] were punished for the blood of the young woman. Yiftaḥ died as a result of his limbs falling off. Everywhere he would go, one of his limbs would fall off and they would bury it there. That is what is written: “Yiftaḥ died and he was buried in the cities of Gilad” (Judges 12:7) – “the city of Gilad” is not stated, but rather, “the cities of Gilad.” (Indicating that he was buried in several cities.)  As for Pinḥas, the Divine Spirit was stripped from him. That is what is written: “Pinḥas son of Elazar had been chief over them” (I Chronicles 9:20) – “is chief over them” is not written here, but rather, “had been chief.” “In earlier times the Lord had been with him” (I Chronicles 9:20).</p>

              <p>בתולה, “a virgin;” according to the view that Rivkah was only three years old, why the Torah needed to add that she was “a virgin”? since the Talmud (Niddah 44) says that any three years old girl that had been violated by someone, her hymen will grow again! (something that was known to people in those days).</p>

              <p>NEITHER HAD ANY MAN KNOWN HER. It is extremely unlikely that Scripture speaks of abnormal intercourse. (Cf. Rashi’s comment on this verse.)  The verse rather refers to a certain intercourse method wherein it is possible to sleep with a virgin and even to impregnate her without deflowering her. However, it is unseemly to describe how this can be done.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ותרד העינה ותמלא כדה ותעל. “She descended to the well, filled her jug, and she came up.” The crucial word “she drew water,” is missing in this verse. On the second occasion when Rivkah again descended (verse 20) to provide water for Eliezer’s camels the Torah does insert the words ותרץ עוד אל הבאר לשאב, ותשאב וגו’, “she ran to the well once more in order to draw water; she drew water, etc.” These fine differences in the text prompted our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 60,6 to say: “all the women go down to the well to fill (their jugs). This one, as soon as the waters saw her they rose up to meet her.” G-d said to her: “just as the waters have seen fit to rise in your honour so other waters will rise in honour of your children.” [The reference is to Numbers 21,17 אז ישיר ישראל את השירה הזאת עלי באר, “then the Israelites broke out in song: “rise up, O well,- sing to it, etc.”]  This also explains the unusual verse 17 “the servant ran towards her, etc.” As soon as Eliezer had noticed the strange phenomenon that the waters rose to meet this girl, (verse 16) he hastened to meet her. You ought to realise that here we encounter for the first time that the 72-lettered version of the 4-lettered Ineffable Name is alluded to. The first letters in the words כדה ותעל spell 26 in numerical value. The numerical value of the 4-lettered Ineffable name י-ה-ו-ה when spelled in letters only equals 26. When these four letters are spelled out as words i.e. יוד הי ויו הי, the result is 72. Such permutations of the holy name of G-d exert their influence on water and the waters which responded to the arrival of Rivkah did so as a result of being sensitive to such considerations. At a later time, when the Israelites were on the edge of the sea of reeds the water was able to rise in the form of walls to let the Israelites pass through in response to Moses’ staff which had this name of G-d (72 letters) inscribed on it. A similar consideration enabled Moses to strike the rock and to bring forth water from it (Exodus 17,6). [Rabbi Chavell cites Targum Yonathan on Exodus 14,21 as the source of our author.]</p>

              <p>ותמלא כדה, which she had drawn from the well, and which was filled with water. Seeing that the water from this well was only marginally below the surface of the earth the” well” is referred to as עין, “fountain,” although one did have to go down some steps to get at the water. Some scholars derive from allusions in the text that the water actually rose toward Rivkah, seeing that the text speaks only of ותמלא כדה, “she filled her jug,” instead of saying “she went down and drew water and filled her jug.” A similar formulation, without using the word “she drew water,” is used in 21,19 where Hagar was filling the hose with the newly discovered well. [one would have to say that when giving water to camels Rivkah did not enjoy this heavenly assist as in verse 20 she did have to “draw water.” Ed.]

              <p>“The maiden was very beautiful, a virgin whom no man had known” [24:16]. The virgin was very beautiful and no man had slept with her. That is to say, there were many of the nations who engaged in illicit sexual relations, but protected their virginity, that their virginity should remain intact. However, Rebecca did not sleep with any man and that is why the verse says, “a virgin whom no man had known” [24:16]. That is, she was a virgin and no man slept with her at all. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:16.)  Toldot Yizhak writes. This verse teaches is that the Holy One had accepted Eliezer’s prayer and caused Rebecca to come to the well. She was a beautiful maiden who did not normally go to the well, because she was afraid of the young men. Not only that, but she did not even normally go to the well in her house. One could not see her since she was very modest. No man could see her, as the verse says, “no man knew her.” (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:16.)  Hizkuni asks a question. What is new in Scripture telling us that Rebecca was a virgin, if she was three years old? The Talmud says that if one sleeps with a three year old, her virginity grows back. (B. Nidah, 44b.)  What does the verse tell us when it says that Rebecca was a virgin? That is, that she did not have sexual relations and even if she did have sexual relations, she could still be a virgin, since she was three years old at the wedding. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:16.)  Hizkuni gives no explanation to the question, but one can say that the verse teaches us that Rebecca was pious and modest, and was a virgin. Do not think that she could be a virgin even if she did have illicit sexual relations, since her virginity would come back because she was only three years old. That is why the verse says, “no man knew her.” That is, she was a virgin and that no man had slept with her. That is to say, do not think that she slept with someone and was called a virgin because her virginity returned. Therefore, the Torah testifies about Rebecca that she was more honest and pious. Other maidens, who were more than three years old, were recognized by their virginity, that they had kept themselves honest. However, concerning Rebecca, one could say that she might have had sexual relations and her virginity had come back. Therefore, the Torah testifies, “and no man knew her,” about Rebecca. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:16.)  God testified about Rebecca.</p>

              <p>“The girl was of very fair appearance, a virgin, and a man had not been intimate with her; she went down to the spring, she filled her jug, and came up” (Genesis 24:16).  “The girl was of very fair appearance, a virgin” – we learn in a mishna: (Ketubot 1:3.)  The marriage contract of a woman whose hymen was ruptured by wood is two hundred [zuz], these are the words of Rabbi Meir. (Her legal status is that of a virgin, whose marriage contract must be two hundred zuz at a minimum.)  The Rabbis say: The marriage contract of a woman whose hymen was ruptured by wood is one hundred. (Her legal status is that of a non-virgin, whose marriage contract is only one hundred zuz.)  Rabbi Ḥanina in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: The source for Rabbi Meir is: “[A virgin,] and a man had not been intimate with her” – implying that if a girl’s hymen had been ruptured by wood, she is [still considered] a virgin. (According to Rabbi Meir, the words “a man had not been intimate with her” is intended to be the definition of the previous statement, “a virgin.”)  The source for the Rabbis is: “A virgin” – implying that if her hymen had been ruptured by wood, she is not a virgin. (According to the Rabbis, “a virgin” and “a man had not been intimate with her” are intended to be two separate statements.)   Rabbi Yoḥanan said: No one other than Rebecca was the first woman to consort with someone who was circumcised at eight days. (Of all those who were circumcised by Abraham (see Genesis 17:26–27), only Isaac was circumcised at the prescribed age of eight days (see Genesis 21:4).)   Reish Lakish said: Because the daughters of idolaters preserve themselves in the place of their virginity but are lax regarding their other orifices, [the Torah tells us that] this one was “a virgin” from the place of the hymen, “and a man had not been intimate with her” from other orifices.   Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From the fact that it states: “Virgin,” do we not know that “a man had not been intimate with her”? (The literal translation of the phrase is: “no man had known her.”)  The explanation is that she was not even propositioned by any man, in accordance with the verse: “Indeed, the rod of wickedness [will not rest upon the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous set their hands to wrongdoing]” (Psalms 125:3).  “She went down to the spring, she filled her jug, and came up” – all the women were going down and drawing water from the spring, but this one, when the water saw her it immediately rose up [towards her]. (The verse does not say that Rebecca drew the water from the well, but rather that she merely “filled her jug,” implying that she did not have to lower it down into the well.)  The Holy One blessed be He said to her: ‘You are a precursor for your descendants; just as you, when the water saw you it immediately rose up, so, too, your descendants, when the well will see them, it will immediately rise up.’ That is what is written: “Then Israel sang this song: Rise up, well; give voice for it” (Numbers 21:17).</p>

              <p>You shall offer it terms of peace (Deuteronomy 20:10): Rabbi Levi said, &quot;Moshe did three things and the Holy One, blessed be He, agreed with him. And these are them: It is written (Exodus 34:7), 'visits the iniquity of the fathers upon children.' But Moshe said (Deuteronomy 24:10), 'Fathers will not be put to death for children [and children will not be put to death for fathers].' And from where [do we know] that the Holy One, blessed be He, agreed with him? As it is stated (II Kings 14:6), 'But he did not put to death the children of the assassins, in accordance with what is written in the Book of the Torah of Moshe, [...] &quot;Parents shall not be put to death for children, etc.&quot;' And the second was when he broke the tablets. And [the third] was in the days of Sichon and Og. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Go and fight with him, block his acqueduct.' But Moshe did not do so, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 2:26), 'And I sent messengers.' The Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'By your life, you have done as is fitting, as I agree with you.'&quot; Therefore Moshe warns Israel and says to them (Deuteronomy 20:10), &quot;When you approach a town to attack it, you shall offer it terms of peace.&quot; &quot;You shall offer it terms of (for) peace (leshalom).&quot; In peace (beshalom) is not written here, so that they would go forth with peace and return in peace. As Avner  and Avshalom about whom it is written, &quot;in peace,&quot; did not return. But Moshe  to whom Yitro said, &quot;for peace,&quot; went and returned. Another interpretation [of] &quot;You shall offer it terms of peace&quot;: It is speaking about the days of the king messiah, who opens to them with peace, as it is stated (Zechariah 9:10), &quot;He shall speak peace to the nations, and his rule shall extend from sea to sea.&quot; &quot;If it responds peaceably&quot; (Deuteronomy 20:11); if they bind themselves, as it is stated (Isaiah 2:4), &quot;And they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not take up sword against nation; they shall never again learn war.&quot; &quot;All the people present there shall be as tribute and serve you&quot;(Deuteronomy 20:11); that they should bring you tribute. As it is stated (Psalms 68:32), &quot;Tribute-bearers (chasmanim) shall come from Egypt,&quot; as they shall hurry (chasim) and bring their gifts; &quot;Cush shall hasten (tarits) its gifts to God,&quot; as they shall run (ratsim) and bring their gifts. &quot;But if it shall not make peace with you&quot; (Deuteronomy 20:12). [If] a strange spirit enters into them and they rebel against the king messiah, he kills them immediately; as it is stated (Isaiah 11:4), &quot;he shall strike down a land with the rod of his mouth, and slay the wicked with the breath of his lips.&quot; And he shall only leave Israel, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 32:12), &quot;The Lord guided him alone, and there is no alien god with him.&quot;</p>

              </summary>
              <p>A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever. Rav said: &quot;From the day the Temple was destroyed, a decree was issued against the homes of the righteous to be destroyed, as it is said, 'In the ears of the Lord of hosts, if not many houses shall become desolate'&quot; (Isaiah 5:9). Rabbi Yochanan said: &quot;The Holy One, blessed be He, will restore them to their settlements, as it is said, 'A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever'&quot; (Psalm 125:1). Just as God will restore Mount Zion, so too He will restore the homes of the righteous. For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous. Reish Lakish expounded: &quot;A man is not matched with a woman except in accordance with his deeds, as it is said, 'For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous'&quot; (Psalm 125:3). Rabbi Yochanan said: &quot;From what is said about Rebecca, 'Behold, she is a virgin' (Genesis 24:16), I do not know that no one knew her, but rather that even though a man did not marry her for her own sake, because the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous,&quot; (Psalm 125:3). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: &quot;He has no rest in the company of a group of righteous people, but in the company of a group of wicked people. Why does the rod of the wicked not rest on the lot of the righteous? This refers to Potiphar's wife, who was wicked, and to the fate of Joseph, who was righteous.&quot; &quot;The Lord is good to the good. Good will come and receive good from good for the good. The good that will come is Moses, as it is said, &quot;And she saw him, that he was good&quot; (Exodus 2:2). The good from which this comes is the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, &quot;The Lord is good to all&quot; (Psalm 145:9). And the good that will receive is the Torah, as it is said, &quot;For I give you good doctrine&quot; (Proverbs 4:2). These good ones are the Israelites, as it is said, &quot;The Lord is good to the good and to the upright in heart&quot; (Psalm 125:4). The Lord is good to the good, and anyone who engages in the study of the Torah can say, &quot;and to the upright in heart.&quot; But those who cause trouble will be led away by the Lord. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, &quot;Anyone who speaks ill of the disciples of the wise will fall into Gehenna, as it is said, 'And the perverseness of their transgressions will lead them away' (Proverbs 5:22). Peace be upon Israel, even when the Lord leads away the workers of iniquity.&quot; Rabbi Yishmael taught, &quot;If you see a disciple of the wise committing a transgression at night, do not think badly of him during the day, for perhaps he has repented. Shouldn't it be obvious that he has repented?&quot; Speak about the person's physical body, but in matters of money, how long should you wait for the lender to return?&quot;</p>

              <p>ויהי יצחק בן ארבעים שנה, Rashi’s comment on this apparently historically irrelevant detail, is that the Torah informed us that Yitzchok, after marrying Rivkah, waited for three years until she was old enough to engage in intercourse and become pregnant. (14 years old) [In his commentary on Genesis 24,16, item 91 Rabbi Kasher in his Torah Shleymah, deals at length with the conflicting opinions about Rivkah’s age at marriage. Sifri on Deuteronomy 34,7 claims that Rivkah lived to the age of 133 years, same age as that of Kehat, son of Levi. Our author calculates that if Rivkah had only been 3 years at the time when she was married that calculation would be wrong by eleven years. He proceeds to give details tracing the various ages of our patriarchs and matriarchs down to the birth of Kehat. He also understands the Midrash according to which Avraham heard about the fact that Betuel had fathered Rivkah as not meaning that this had occurred at the same time as the akeydah, but that Avraham had belatedly heard about this. As proof that Rivkah could not have been only 3 years old when Eliezrer met her, he cites the fact that her brother and mother refer to her as a נערה, a term never applied to someone younger than 12 and a half years of age. The well known traditional historic text known as seder olam in its first chapter, also writes that when Avraham returned from the Akeydah he was told that Rivkah had been born. The meaning of that Midrash was that she had been born some time ago. Another proof that she was of age is that we have an iron clad rule that parents must not marry off a girl who has already reached puberty unless she has been asked and given her consent.] The fact that in our chapter Rivkah’s family proceeds to ask for her consent proves that without it the parents could not have married her off.</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Exodus 25:7:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>AVNEI SHOHAM’ (ONYX STONES) ‘V’AVNEI MILU’IM’ (AND STONES FOR SETTING). “Because they used to make a setting for the stone in gold — a kind of indentation — and they placed the stone there to fill the indentation, they are called avnei milu’im (stones for filling-in), and the place of the indentation is called mishbetzet (setting). FOR THE EPHOD AND THE BREASTPLATE. The onyx stones were for the ephod, and the stones for setting were for the breastplate.” This is Rashi’s language. Similarly Rashi explained: “They shall be inclosed in gold in their settings, (Further, 28:20.)  — surrounded by gold settings of such a depth that each setting shall be filled by the thickness of the stone. This is the meaning of the word milu’otham (their filling), (Further, 28:20.)  and this is the meaning of every expression of milui (filling) mentioned in this connection.” But it does not appear to me to be at all correct to say that Scripture calls them already now avnei milu’im, because in some time as yet in the future He was to command that the indentations made for them were to be filled with these stones! Moreover, the onyx stones were also enclosed in settings of gold, (Ibid., Verse 11 — in the case of the ephod.)  and yet He did not call them milu’im. Again, our Rabbis have already said in the Gemara: (Sotah 48b.)  “These stones (The onyx stones for the ephod, and the stones for setting in the breastplate. Ramban will later suggest that the reference perhaps is only to the stones for setting in the breastplate. See further, Note 76.)  are not incised with a chisel, (For the purpose of writing the names of the tribes upon the stones (further, 28:12, and 21).)  for it is said b’milu’otham (Further, 28:20.)  (in their filling).” Now if the explanation b’milu’otham would be, [as Rashi has it], that they fill the indentations with the stones, there would have been no proof at all from this verse that they should not incise the names [of the tribes] on them with a chisel. Besides, the manner of the setting of the stones which the Rabbi [Rashi] mentioned, namely that it was made in a kind of indentation, is not correct. Instead, it is as Onkelos rendered it: [meshubatzim zahav — inclosed in gold] meramtzan didhav, (Further, 28:20.)  which means that they made at the bottom a gold setting according to the measure of the stone, and from it they projected a fork-like shape of three prongs which would hold the stone. [The word meramtzan mentioned by Onkelos] is similar to the expressions of the Sages: “and they take it out beramtza (with a pointed tool) made of iron;” (Niddah 62a.)  “as when he bored a hole in it beramtza (with a pick) made of iron.” (Shabbath 103a.)  This is how they also do it today when they set precious stones in rings, in order that they be seen from all angles and that their beauty and splendor should not be hidden in the indentations. You may know that this is so, for the two gold chains inserted in the two rings of the breastplate were attached to the mishb’tzoth on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod. (Further, 28:24-25.)  Now if mishb’tzoth were [as Rashi said] frames for the setting of the stone, how would they attach to them the chains? And even [if there were there other mishb’tzoth not for the setting of the stone but for the purpose of inserting the chains] how would the indentations serve that purpose [as they were not perforated for the chains to go through]? Rather, the mishb’tzoth are the fork-like prongs as we have said and the holes for the chains were made in them. Associated with the word mishb’tzoth is, in my opinion, [Saul’s expression, Slay me] for ‘hashabatz’ hath taken hold of me (II Samuel 1:9.)  these being the men who hold spear-like weapons with mounted forks on top to catch those that flee the battle-field, just as it is said, and lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him. (Ibid., Verse 6.)  And the meaning of musaboth mishb’tzoth (Further, 28:11.)  is that he should fix the gold prongs “around it.” And in the opinion of Onkelos who translated [musaboth as] meshak’on [literally: “depressed,” “sunk”], the stones were sunk into the frames from which came forth prongs surrounding them above and holding them in place. But the sense of the word milu’im is that the stones be whole as they were created, and that they should not be hewn stones which were cut from a large quarry, or from which anything has been chipped off. It is also known in the natural sciences that the complete powers of precious stones and the particular qualities that distinguish them, exist only when in their natural state, as when smooth stones are taken from the river. This is why Onkelos translated [avnei milu’im — avnei] ashlamutha (stones of perfection). But the term milui (filling of) vessels or an indentation [Onkelos] translates literally, — thus: 'va’t'malei' (and she filled) her pitcher, (Genesis 24:16.)  Onkelos translated: u’mleiah (and she filled), and similarly in all other cases — but here he translated the term milui to mean shleimuth (perfection). Similarly, he translated the verse, ‘milei’ (He filled) them with wisdom of heart (Further, 35:35.)  — ashleim (“He perfected” them with wisdom of heart), as wisdom is not something that you can fill a vessel with, but instead it denotes perfection, that they [i.e. Bezalel and Oholiab — who did the workmanship of the Tabernacle] were perfect in wisdom. This is the intent of the verse, and in cutting of stones 'l’maloth' (Ibid., 31:5.)  — that they knew how to engrave like the engravings of a signet upon stones in their [natural] perfect state. Now in the case of the stones of the ephod it is said, however, with the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the children of Israel (Ibid., Verse 11 — in the case of the ephod.)  [but it does not say here b’milu’otham — “in their perfect state”], because they made an incision in them when writing the names [of the tribes upon them] as stone engravers do, and thus the stones were no longer in their [natural] perfect state. But in the case of the stones for the breastplate it is written, ‘umileitha’ in it ‘miluath’ of stone, (Ibid., 28:17.)  and again it is written of them, they shall be ‘b’milu’otham;’ (Ibid., Verse 20.)  and the stones [of the breastplate] were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names (Ibid., 38:14.)  — not the work of engravers [who make incisions upon the stones]. Therefore Moses our teacher could find no way [of inscribing the names of the tribes of Israel upon the twelve stones in the breastplate] except by means of the shamir [a worm that cuts stones with its glance] which our Rabbis mentioned, just as they have said in Tractate Sotah: (Sotah 48b.)  “These stones (I.e. the stones of the breastplate. See above Note 61.)  are not written upon with ink, for it is said, like the engravings of a signet, (Further, 28:21. “And this means carving” (Rashi, ibid., Sotah). — The verse is mentioned in connection with the stones of the breastplate.)  and they are not incised with a chisel, for it is said b’milu’otham (in their perfect state). (Ibid., Verse 20. — Also in connection with the stones of the breastplate.)  But instead [Moses] brought the shamir and showed it the stones and they split of their own accord.” Now the word b’milu’otham is said only in connection with the stones of the breastplate. Do not be troubled by what is mentioned in the Agadah (homily, tradition) that the Rabbis said to Solomon: (Gittin 68a. In preparing to build the Sanctuary, Solomon asked the Rabbis: “How shall I accomplish the cutting of the stones without using iron tools?” They replied: “There is the shamir etc.”)  “There is the shamir with which Moses cut the precious stones of the ephod.” [From this you might argue that the stones of the ephod also had to be b’milu’otham — in their perfect natural state — which would be contrary to what we have said above, that this applied only to the stones of the breastplate! Do not be troubled by this statement,] for the breastplate is called ephod by the Rabbis by way of metaphor, because the breastplate is attached thereto. It is also written, Bring hither the ephod, (I Samuel 23:9.)  and it was of the breastplate that they asked [for guidance]. (See Ramban further, 28:30.)  Thus the explanation of the verse before us is as follows: “onyx stones three — two for the ephod (Further, 28:9.)  and one for the breastplate; (Ibid., Verse 20.)  and stones of ‘milu’im’ for the breastplate.” And in case the opinion of our Rabbis was that the stones of the ephod also had to be in their full natural state [as the stones of the breastplate], then both the onyx stones and the stones of ‘milu’im’ were for both, for the ephod and for the breastplate. (In other words, if that be the opinion of the Rabbis that the stones of the ephod also had to be b’milu’otham (in their full natural state), then they derived it from this verse as explained in the text. For — the ephod and the breastplate — had both the onyx stones and the stones of milu’im. Of the ephod it is clearly written that it had two onyx stones (further, 28:9), and according to the Rabbis these were also b’milu’otham (in their full natural state). In the case of the breastplate b’milu’otham is clearly mentioned (ibid., Verse 20) and so is the onyx stone (ibid.). Thus the verse before us, stones of onyx and stones of ‘milu’im’ means that both were for the ephod and for the breastplate.) </p>

                <h4>Ramban on Leviticus 27:29:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>NONE DOOMED WHO SHALL BE DOOMED OF MAN, SHALL BE REDEEMED. “[This means that] if a person is about to be executed [by the court], and someone else says, ‘I take upon myself to pay his valuation [to the Temple treasury],’ his vow is of no effect.” HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. “For you see he is going to die. Therefore he is not to be redeemed; he has neither a market-price nor a fixed valuation” [as fixed by the Torah on the basis of his age]. This is Rashi’s language. But our Rabbis have differed on this matter, some saying (Arakhin 6 b. The name of the Sage holding this opinion is Rabbi Yishmael.)  that it constitutes an admonition in connection with those who are liable to the death-penalty, that one must not take a ransom from them in order to free them. It is possible that He mentions this admonition here in order to state that he [the condemned] cannot give money to [the Temple of] G-d as other devoted things [are given], and thereby go free of punishment. By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the verse is stating that whatever a man devotes of his belongings, whether man or animal or field of his possession, it is holy unto the Eternal, meaning that they become devoted things of the priests, and there is no redemption for them. But if he devotes people who are not his, such as those who go to war against their enemies and utter a vow, If Thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then will I utterly destroy their cities, (Numbers 21:2.)  then all the people found in them are to die. The reason for this is that the intention of those making such a vow is not that [the captives] be given to the priests, but rather that it be forbidden to derive any benefit from them, since their purpose is to utterly destroy the enemies. Thus we find in the case of the men of Jabesh-gilead who transgressed the oath of the assembly by not coming to Mitzpah [to take part in the battle against Gibeah for the outrage they had committed], (See Judges Chapter 19.)  that it is written, And the congregation sent thither ten thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them saying: ‘Go and smite the inhabitants with the edge of the sword’. (Ibid., 21:10.)  And common sense does not allow [us to say] that the whole congregation perpetrated such an evil deed, killing many people of Israel who were not guilty of death! And Phinehas was there, (Ibid., 20:28.)  and by word of his mouth the whole affair was done! I have further found in the Agadah, in the [Midrash] Yelamdeinu: (I have found this in the Yalkut Shimoni, Shoftim 76. On “Yelamdeinu” see in Seder Bo (Vol. II, p. 131, Note 196).)  “We have been taught: Rabbi Akiba says, Cheirem (‘doomed to destruction’) is an oath, and an oath is cheirem. The men of Jabesh transgressed the cheirem, and thus they became liable to the death penalty.” Therefore I say that it was from this verse [before us] that they deduced this law — that if any king of Israel, or the Great Sanhedrin [of seventy-one judges] in the presence of all Israel, who have the authority to institute ordinances [for the good of the people], if they declare a certain city cheirem, to be warred on, and likewise if they declare a certain matter cheirem, he who violates it is liable to the death-penalty. This indeed was the guilt of the men of Jabesh-gilead [as mentioned above], and of Jonathan, to whom his father [Saul] had said, ‘G-d do so and more also, thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.’ (I Samuel 14:44.)  Now on the basis of what legal authority did these people deserve death, if not because of this source [in Scripture]? And this was the mistake that Jephthah made with his daughter. (See Judges 11:30-34, where it is related that Jephthah vowed that whosoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the Eternal’s, and I will offer it up as a burnt-offering, and it was his daughter who came out to meet him first.)  For he thought that just as a cheirem [“doomed” object] of the chief of Israel is valid and takes effect to put [certain] people to death, and [also] anyone who transgresses it is liable to the death-penalty, so [Jephthah thought] that if he uttered a vow at a time of war, to make an offering of a certain person or persons, the vow is valid; but he did not know that a cheirem declared by the king and Sanhedrin is valid [only] regarding the destruction of rebels, or against one who transgresses their decrees and ordinances. But that a vow should take effect to make a burnt-offering of something not appropriate for G-d, [as Jephthah thought] — Heaven forbid! Therefore the Rabbis have said in Bereshith Rabbah (Bereshith Rabbah 60:3.)  that [Jephthah] was not even obliged to pay the price of her market-value to the Temple treasury [as his vow was totally invalid], and he was punished for her [innocent] blood! Now do not let yourself be misled by Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra’s (The source is unknown to me since we have no commentary of Ibn Ezra on the Book of Judges. This interpretation, however, is found in the commentary of Ralbag.)  empty words, when he says that the meaning of the expression and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering (Judges 11:31.)  is “or I will offer it up,” as if to say: “if that which comes forth of the doors of my house be a man or woman, that person shall be holy to G-d, inasmuch as he will abstain from the ways of the world, to stand to minister in the Name of the Eternal (Deuteronomy 18:5.)  in prayer and thanksgiving to G-d; but if it be something fit for an offering, I will make it a burnt-offering.” Accordingly [Ibn Ezra’s interpretation continues, since Jephthah’s daughter was the first to come out to meet her father], he built her a house outside the city where she resided in seclusion, and he provided her with sustenance all her days, and no man knew her, (Genesis 24:16.)  so that his daughter remained shut away [from the world all her life]. All this are words of emptiness. For if he vowed that [whatsoever comes forth of the door of his house] shall be the Eternal’s, (Judges 11:31.)  this does not mean that he should be a recluse [from the world], but instead he is to be like Samuel, of whom his mother said, and I shall give him unto the Eternal, (I Samuel 1:11.)  and he was a servant in the House of G-d, not a recluse. And according to the ordinances of the Torah, no man can utter a vow which will bind the persons who come out of the door of his house to live thereafter in seclusion, just as he cannot bring them as an offering. And if the matter be so [as Ibn Ezra put it] then Jephthah’s daughter would be bewailing her virginity with her companions with her, (Judges 11:38.)  like harlots enhancing their hire! (See Ezekiel 16:31.)  Heaven forbid that this be a custom in Israel, to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year (Judges 11:39-40. Ramban’s comment here is typical of Jewish teaching which abhors celibacy.)  because she did not marry and she worshipped G-d in purity! Rather, this whole subject is to be understood in its plain meaning [that Jephthah actually brought her as an offering], and his mistake was as I have explained. And according to the opinion of our Rabbis, of blessed memory, it is possible that this verse [before us] includes many [different] subjects, similar to the verse, Ye shall not eat with the blood; (Above, 19:26. See Ramban there.)  and like the verse, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children (Deuteronomy 24:16.)  which the Rabbis interpret (Sanhedrin 27 b. The meaning of the verse is thus: a parent cannot be condemned on the evidence of his children.)  as invalidating the testimony of relatives, and Scripture further states concerning it: But the children of the murderers he [King Amaziah of Judah] put not to death, according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as the Eternal commanded, saying, ‘The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers.’ (II Kings 14:6. Here it is obvious that the Rabbis also understood the verse in its literal sense — that children are not to be put to death for the sins of their parents, and vice versa.)  Similarly this verse [before us] includes the law of one who vows to give to the Temple treasury the valuation of a person who is liable to the death-penalty [as explained above], the law of those against whom a cheirem is declared at a time of conquest, as we have said, and the law of one who transgresses the cheirem of the Great Court or of the king of Israel, as was the case in the incident of Saul [and Jonathan mentioned above]. It is with reference to that that it is said there, So the people rescued Jonathan, that he die not, (I Samuel 14:45.)  for since the Torah states, he shall not be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death, (In Verse 29 before us.)  it says there, So the people rescued Jonathan, that he die not; (I Samuel 14:45.)  [meaning] that since a miracle happened through him [i.e., that the Philistines suffered a great defeat on that day], they knew that it was in error that Jonathan had acted [contrary to the cheirem of his father]. And this is the sense of the expression [of the people in speaking on behalf of Jonathan], who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel. (I Samuel 14:45.)  And so likewise did Yonathan ben Uziel translate this expression: “For before the Eternal it is revealed that he [Jonathan] acted in error on that day, and so the people rescued Jonathan.”</p>

              <p>“The maiden was very beautiful, a virgin whom no man had known” [24:16]. The virgin was very beautiful and no man had slept with her. That is to say, there were many of the nations who engaged in illicit sexual relations, but protected their virginity, that their virginity should remain intact. However, Rebecca did not sleep with any man and that is why the verse says, “a virgin whom no man had known” [24:16]. That is, she was a virgin and no man slept with her at all.

                <h4>Zevach Pesach on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, First Fruits Declaration 14:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>And He saw our affliction&quot; (Deut. 26:7) – this refers to the separation from the way of the world, as it is stated, &quot;And God saw the Children of Israel and God knew.&quot; (Ex. 2:25) &quot;And our toil&quot; (Deut. 26:7) – this refers to the killing of the sons, as it is stated, &quot;Every boy that is born, throw him into the Nile and every girl you shall keep alive.&quot; (Ex. 1:24) &quot;And our duress&quot; (Deut. 26:7) – this refers to the pressure, as it is stated, &quot;And I also saw the duress that the Egyptians are applying on them.&quot; (Ex. 3:9) At first, it would appear that the sentence should have been interpreted so that these three expressions, “our affliction,” “our toil,” and, “our duress” are all synonyms, different words expressing the same idea. “He saw our affliction,” should have been interpreted the same as, “And they afflicted us; and “Our duress” should have been interpreted as referring to hard labor. However, the Maggid realized that if “And He saw our affliction, and our toil and our duress,” was similar to the interpretation of, “And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us and imposed hard labor upon us,” then one of these verses would be unnecessary and it would have been fitting to say, “The Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and placed hard labor upon us and we cried out to God… and God heard… and God saw what they did to us in Egypt and God took us out.”  Why was it necessary to repeat the language itself with, “God saw our affliction, our toil and our duress?” The Maggid comes to interpret each expression differently. The first verse (“The Egyptians dealt ill with us…”) refers to what the Egyptians did to the Israelites publically: they afflicted them with bricks and mortar, building cities for the king, and crushing work which the Egyptians imposed on them. The passage then continues, “God saw our affliction, our toil and our duress.” Besides the well-known things which the Egyptians openly did to the Israelites, God saw the secret plans and hidden strategies that the Egyptians carried out and which were not known publically. Thus, the expression, “He saw our affliction” refers to the forced separation of the sexes. Many Israelite men separated from their wives so that they would not give birth in vain nor give birth to a child idly. (If they gave birth to children, the Egyptians would then kill them. To avoid the death of their children they simply stopped having sexual relations with their wives.)  The sages said that forcing couples to refrain from having intimate relations was an “affliction.” The sages explain, “If you ill-treat (afflict) my daughters,” (Gen. 31:50) to mean refraining from sexual relations. The Maggid quotes the verse, “And God saw the Israelites and God knew.” (Ex. 2:25) God saw that the men were separating from their wives so He caused them to feel sexual desire so they would have relations and thereby would have more children. The sages interpreted the verse, “Under the apple tree I aroused you…” (Song 8:5) to mean that the women would come to the field to serve their husbands, tend to them and then they would have relations with them. The verb ‘know’ refers to intimate relations, as in, “Adam knew Eve, his wife.” (Gen.4:8) Similarly we find, “The maiden was very beautiful, a virgin whom no man had known.” (Gen 24:16) The word yeda, then, hints at this meaning in Exodus 2:25. The Maggid also came up with this interpretation by verbal analogy (gezera shava). (Gezera Shava is a hermeneutic rule used by the sages primarily in the interpretation of Jewish law. When a similar word appears in two verses, the sages assumed there was a connection between the two verses. In this case, Abarbanel uses this rule of interpretation for non-halachic purposes.)  The word vayar, “And He saw” appears in both verses: here, “And God saw our affliction” (Deut. 26:7) and there, “And God saw the Children of Israel and God knew.” (Ex. 2:25) Just as there it means that he gave them the desire to know their wives, so too here, it has this meaning. When it says, “And God knew” regarding intimate relations it says so because no being can know what happens between a man and his wife except God. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>Rebbi Jeremiah and Rebbi Ammi asked (The text is impossible as it stands. It must have been either “R. Jeremiah (fourth generation) said that R. Immi (second generation) asked” or “R. Yasa and R. Immi asked”. The sequel would support both versions.) : What is the difference between her (The woman whose hymen was impaired by a mechanical accident, who is declared eligible to marry a High Priest.)  and one who had sex with a finger (Either she or another person perforated her hymen with his finger in sexual activity without penetration by a penis.) ? Is the one who had sex with a finger not disabled for priesthood (The high priesthood. Only the High Priest is required to marry a virgin.) ? Rebbi Haggai said, explain it that there was no penetration (If the girl had sexual experience without any penetration, she will qualify for a virgin’s ketubah.) . Rebbi Haggai wanted to change his mind; Rebbi Abba said to him, do not change your mind. Why did Rebbi Haggai want to change his mind? Because of the verse (Lev. 21:13, speaking of the high priest. The complicated expression אִשָּׁהבִבְתוּלֶיהָ “a woman in her virginities” instead of simpy בְּתוּלָה “a virgin” calls for an explanation.) : “But he shall marry a wife in her virginities,” only if she is a virgin in both respects (She must be a virgin without any sexual experience; cf. Babli Yebamot 59a.) . Similarly, “a virgin and no man had known her. (Gen. 24:16; here again the double expression calls for an explanation. In Gen.rabba 60(5), the explanation is ascribed to R. Simeon ben Laqish.) ” A virgin, with respect to penetration. No man had known her, without penetration. Rebbi Isaac ben Eleazar said, [no man] ever had wanted to touch her hand, for it was said (Ps. 125:3. In Gen.rabba 60(5), this explanation is ascribed to R. Joḥanan.) : “The staff of evil shall not rest on the just’s lot.” Why did Rebbi Haggai want to change his mind? He could explain it by “touching”. Why does (Rav Yosef) [Rebbi Yasa] (Since the author here cannot be the fourth generation Babylonian Rav Joseph (bar Ḥiyya), most likely he is Rebbi Yasa (cf. Note 163).)  not explain it by “touching”? Rebbi Mana said, because it presented a problem for him: Rebbi Yasa asked: What is the legal status of “touching” (The touching of the genitals of two persons, whether there was penetration or emission or not. “Touching” is the legal definition of the sex act both for marriage (cf. Yebamot4:2, Note 59; Mishnah 6:1) and for criminal law (Mishnah Keritut 2:4; cf. Soṭah 1:2, Notes 97,98). The same question is asked in Qiddušin 1:1 (59c 1. 14).)  with a male? “Touching” with an animal? When Rebbi Jeremiah heard that of Rebbi Haggai, he said, that was not Rebbi Ammi’s problem (That solution is too obvious not to have occured to R. Ammi, and it does not address his question which asks for the difference between a hymen split by mechanical means or by the girl’s own finger. In both cases, no male was involved.) .</p>

                <h4>Tractate Soferim 21:9</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(From this point to the end of the tractate is an aggadic addendum.)  The greatest man among the Anakim (Josh. 14, 15.) —among the Anakim refers to our father Abraham whose height was equal to that of seventy-four men; his eating and drinking were of a similar proportion, equal to those of seventy-four men; so too his strength. What did he do? (This is probably a reference to Gen. 25, 6, But unto the sons of the concubines … Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away … eastward, unto the east country.)  He removed the sixteen (So GRA in accordance with Gen. 25, 2-4. V, M and H incorrectly ‘seventeen’.)  sons of Keturah, built for them a walled city of iron and settled them in it. The sun never penetrated into it because it was exceedingly high, so Abraham handed to them disks of precious stones and pearls of which use will be made (So GRA. V, M and H read, ‘and they will be used’.)  in the hereafter when the Holy One, blessed be He, will cause the sun and moon to be confounded, as it is written, When the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, (Is. 24, 23.)  because use will be made of these [disks as luminaries]. Og (King of Bashan; Deut. 3, 11.)  is identical with Eliezer, (Abraham’s servant; cf. Gen. 15, 2, XXIV, 2ff.)  and [he was so huge that] he could hide Abraham’s feet in the palm of his hand. Once he was rebuked [by Abraham] and from fright his tooth fell out. Abraham picked it up and made ivory beds of it in which he slept. Others say that he made of it a chair which he used (lit. ‘and sat in it’.)  all his life. Who gave him to Abraham? Nimrod. (Mentioned in Gen. 10, 8ff.)  Og went and built sixty cities, the smallest of which was sixty miles high, as it is stated, Threescore cities, all the region of Argob. (Deut. 3, 4.)  And what did he eat? A thousand oxen and the same [number of] other animals, and his drink consisted of a thousand measures. A (So GRA. V, M and H read ‘and what was the’.)  drop of his semen weighed thirty-six pounds. (V and H add ‘and so for all generations’, which makes no sense.)  It was taught: What did our father Jacob do when his sons brought him the coat [stained] with blood? (Cf. Gen. 37, 31ff.)  He did not believe them at all. Whence do we infer this? For it is written, But he refused to be comforted, (ibid. 35.)  because no consolations are acceptable for a living person. One, however, who is dead passes naturally from the mind, (lit. ‘he is forgotten from the heart of his own accord’.)  as it is stated, I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind. (Ps. 31, 13.)  What then did he do? He proceeded to make a test with sheaves, (GRA transposes the order of V, M and H by putting the test of the sheaves before that of the stones, and omits ‘according to the first opinion’.)  writing upon them the respective names of the tribes, their constellations and the months, and said to them, ‘I order you to prostrate yourselves before Levi because he wears the Urim and Thummim’, (Cf. Ex. 28, 30.)  but they did not stand up. ‘Before Judah who is king’, but they did not stand up; but when he mentioned Joseph to them, they all stood up and bowed before Joseph. But it was not yet quite clear that he was alive. So Jacob went to the mountains, hewed twelve stones, arranged them in a row, and wrote on each the name of its tribe, the name of its constellation and the name of its month. On one stone he wrote ‘Reuben, lamb, Nisan’ (The name of the tribe, constellation and month.)  and similarly on every stone. He began from Simeon and said to them, ‘I order you to stand up for Reuben’, but they did not stand up. ‘For Simeon’, but they did not stand up. ‘For every tribe’, but the stones did not stand up. As soon, however, as he mentioned the name of Joseph to them, they stood up at once and bowed before Joseph’s stone. (The translation follows the text of GRA.)  For this reason, all the tribes were written on Joseph’s stone. Similarly, all Israel are called by Joseph’s name, as it is stated, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock. (Ps. 80, 2 where Joseph is a synonym of all Israel.)  So also all the heads of the families of the priests and Levites, [e.g.] Eliashib, (Neh. 3, 1.)  because of the phrase lahashibo ’el ’abiw; (In the story of Joseph (Gen. 37, 22), E.V. to restore him to his father. The name Eliashib is broken up in three parts corresponding in sound and meaning to these three Heb. words. From ‘For this reason’ to ’abiw is the reading of GRA. V and H have instead: ‘but from the mishmaroth, Eliashib the priest’.)  Elḳanah, (Connected with ḳanah, ‘he bought’.)  because Potiphar had bought him [as it is stated,] And Joseph ms brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar … bought him. (Gen. 39, 1. V inserts in parentheses, And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Ẓaphenath, paneah, etc. (ibid. XLI, 45), which has no relevance to the subject.)  When Rebekah left her father’s house (Cf. ibid. XXIV, 59ff.)  she was three years old, (V, M and H add ‘and three days’.)  because it is customary among kings, when a daughter is born to them, to hear of it after three days; (H reads ‘after three years and three days’.)  but as her father did not hear [of her birth] he did not defile her up to that time; and now a miracle happened to her in that her father died so that he should not defile her, as it is written, Neither had any man known her, (Gen. 24, 16.)  and by man only her father could be meant, (From ‘he did not’ to ‘meant’ is GRA’s reading. V, M and H read: ‘therefore a miracle happened to her that she should not be defiled’.)  for such was the practice of the Arameans to lie with their virgin daughters after they were three years of age, (‘After … age’ is inserted by GRA; omitted in V, M and H.)  and then to give them away in marriage. (V, M and H add: ‘on account of that which is written, Neither had any man known her, and by man only her father could be meant’.)  Dinah was six years old when she bore Asenath from [her association with] Shechem, (Cf. Gen. 34.)  corresponding to (lit. ‘the number of’.)  the six years which Jacob served Laban in payment for the flock, (ibid. XXXI, 41.)  thus completing (lit. ‘until’.)  the twenty years of his service. [The Archangel] Michael then descended and took her away to the house of Potiphar. From here onward let the man of understanding increase knowledge. (From ‘completing the twenty years’ to ‘knowledge’ is GRA’s text. V and M have instead: ‘and he added twenty years, because he died. From this point onwards let the man of understanding increase knowledge. And Michael descended and led her to Potiphar’s house’.) </p>

        <summary>Various commentaries highlight different reasons for Eliezer running towards Rebekah at the well, such as her worthiness indicated by the rising water, her beauty, and her prompt response to his request. The path of the wise involves finding balance in traits, displaying anger only when necessary, and maintaining a composed sense of joy. The Midrash discusses righteous eating habits and atonement for sins through sacrifices, promising a great table in the World to Come for the righteous. In Musar, Eliezer is accompanied by the angel Mattatron on his mission, reflecting on the success of his mission based on Heavenly input. The Talmud debates the liability for carrying out milk based on the amount swallowed in one gulp, with a discussion on the spelling of kedei gemia. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both mention Eliezer running to meet Rebekah and asking for water from her pitcher in Genesis 24:17.</summary>

            <summary>Rashi explains that the servant ran towards Rebekah because he saw the waters rise in the well as she approached it, indicating her worthiness. Eliezer asked for only a little water to make it easy for Rebekah to meet his request, realizing she was destined for Isaac. Radak emphasizes that the servant ran towards Rebekah due to her beauty and the prompt answer to his request. Siftei Chakhamim notes that Eliezer ran towards Rebekah because the water rose towards her, indicating she was worthy of the House of Abraham. Rav Hirsch describes Rebekah's actions as a true act of kindness and humility, showing her worthiness to take Sarah's place.</summary>

              <p>הגמיאיני נא מעט מים, &quot;let me please sip a little water, etc.&quot; Eliezer actually asked for less than he had originally stipulated, seeing he meant to ask her &quot;to incline her jug in order to let him drink (extensively).&quot; Not only did he only ask to take a sip, but he stressed that he wanted only a little water. He also failed to ask her to incline her jug in order to give him to drink. Our sages (Bereshit Rabbah 60,5) explain that Eliezer saw that the waters rose towards Rebeccah. This is when he realised that she was not a Canaanite girl and that she was destined for Isaac. He became afraid that he might forfeit an opportunity by insisting on the conditions he had made in his prayer, and proceeded to ask for the minimum possible. He wanted to make it easy for the girl to meet his request.</p>

              <p>AND THE SERVANT RAN TO MEET HER. Rashi comments: “Because he saw that the waters rose in the well when she approached it.” In Bereshith Rabbah the Rabbis said, (60:6.)  “And she filled her pitcher, and came up. (Verse 16 here.)  All the women went down and filled their pitchers from the well. But this one, as the waters saw her they immediately rose. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her, ‘You are a sign of blessing to your children.’” (When Israel wandered in the desert, the waters in the well would rise as soon as they approached it. See Numbers 21:17 and Midrash Rabbah, ibid.)  It would appear that the Rabbis derived this interpretation upon observing the language, And she filled her pitcher, and came up, (Verse 16 here.)  for it does not say, “and she drew water and filled [the pitcher].” Now this miracle happened to her only the first time for afterwards it is written, and she drew. (Verse 20 here.)  The servant, when recounting the day’s events to them, said: And she went down unto the well, and drew water. (Verse 45 here.)  That was because he thought that perhaps they would not believe in the miracle.</p>

Hätte Rebekka dies gleich gesagt, es hätte ein Charakterzug gefehlt, der den wahren גומל חסד und das wahre jüdische Weib kennzeichnet; sie wäre eine eitle Schwätzerin gewesen, die sich auf ihr Gutestun etwas zu gute tut. Und nun erbietet sie sich nicht, auch den Kamelen etwas zu trinken zu geben, was doch auch schon eine ziemliche Mühe gewesen wäre, auch nur ein Krug für jedes Kamel gäbe zehn Wege und zehnmaliges Schöpfen, sondern: sie will schöpfen und in die Tränke schütten bis zehn Kamele sich voll getrunken haben!! Ein Kamel trinkt mit einemmale so viel, daß es auf viele Tage genug hat und des Wassers entbehren kann, vielleicht daher ja sein Name. Dabei, wie ist sie behend und hurtig, ותמהר ,ותמהר, sie besinnt sich nicht lange und ist nicht schwerfällig, zumal wo es gilt, ein menschenfreundliches Werk zu vollbringen. Was Elieser in dem Krug gelassen hatte, schüttet sie zuvor in die Tränke. Sie hätte es darin lassen oder auf die Erde schütten können. Allein die jüdische menschenfreundliche Natur ist so ökonomisch mit Kräften und Werten, wie sie verschwenderisch damit ist. Eben weil ihr alles, auch das Geringste, Mittel zur מצוה, zur Pflichterfüllung ist, ist ihr alles heilig. Nutzlos verschwendet sie nicht den geringsten Splitter Kraft und nicht den geringsten Tropfen Wasser. Für einen guten Zweck kennt hingegen ihre Hingebung mil Kraft und Gut keine Grenzen.</p>

              <p>Because he saw the water rise toward her. Rashi is answering the question: Why does the verse say: “Toward her”? Since she already filled the pitcher and came up from the well, it should say he ran after her, as he had been standing by the well next to her, as it is written (v. 13): “Behold, here I stand by this well of water.” Perforce, “toward her” means he ran after her because of the water which rose toward her. (cited in the name of R. Avraham of Prague) Maharshal explains: It seems that Eliezer was not standing right at the well, but some distance from it. And Rashi deduced [his comment] from the fact that it is written, “The servant ran.” Why is it not written, “He ran,” similar to the preceding verses? Perforce, [it comes to say] that since he was Avraham’s servant he knew that Avraham was used to such miracles, as seen in (21:30) שבע כבשות האלה [where Rashi explains: “And the waters rose towards Avraham.” Thus,] Eliezer ran toward her, thinking: “She is worthy for the House of Avraham since the water even rises toward her, like for Avraham.”</p>

              <p>וירץ העבד לקראתה, “the servant ran towards her.” He did so after witnessing that the waters in the well had risen in response to her approach. Our sages derive this from the wording of our verse ותמלא כדה ותעל, “she filled the jug and ascended.” There is no mention here of her having “drawn water,” ותשאב, something the Torah emphasis in verse 20 when she descended again in order to draw water for Eliezer’s camels. No miracle occurred in order to facilitate the watering of the camels. The first time the miracle occurred in order that Eliezer focus on the unusual speed with which this girl came up from the well, her jug already filled with water. 
    Although, when Eliezer recounts the events at the table of Bethuel and Lavan he did not mention the miracle which had occurred, but described Rivkah as having drawn the water normally, (verse 45) he omitted mention of the miracle as he was afraid Lavan and Bethuel would not believe him and would consider his having fabricated that event in order to enhance his chances of obtaining their consent for Rivkah to travel back with him to the land of Canaan.

                <h4>Mishneh Torah, Human Dispositions 1:4</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>The straight path: (This expression is also used in Avot 2:1. In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam cites his explanation of the middle path in the fourth chapter of Shemonah Perakim.)  This [involves discovering] the midpoint temperament of each and every trait that man possesses [within his personality.] (i.e., a path develops out of a series of midpoints.)  This refers to the trait which is equidistant from either of the extremes, without being close to either of them. (These statements echo the opening remarks of the fourth chapter of Shemonah Perakim: The good acts are those balanced ones midway between two extremes. Both of the extremes are bad - one reflects excess and the other, want. The virtues [good traits] are temperaments and habits which are midway between these two bad tendencies. These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits. Despite the similarity between the Rambam's statements here and those quoted, there is a slight difference. Here, the Rambam focuses on good traits, while in Shemonah Perakim, he emphasizes good actions.)  Therefore, the early Sages instructed a man to evaluate his traits, (The Rambam appears to be referring to Sotah 5b: &quot;Whoever evaluates his paths in this world will merit and witness God's salvation.&quot;)  to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path, (At the conclusion of Chapter 4 of Shemonah Perakim, the Rambam writes: When a man weighs his actions constantly and directs them towards their midpoints, he will be on the most elevated human plane possible. He will thereby approach God and grasp His will. This is the most perfect path in the service of God. Constant introspection is a necessary element in any program of personal and spiritual growth. Even when a person has the highest goals, unless he frequently looks himself squarely in the mirror and examines his behavior, he may make gross errors.)  so that he will be sound {of body}. (We have enclosed the words &quot;of body&quot; with brackets because they are not found in authoritative manuscripts of the Mishneh Torah and are problematic. Though a properly balanced temperament may also lead to physical health, this does not appear to be the Rambam's intent. If the Hebrew bigufo is omitted as suggested, the meaning of shaleim would be altered from &quot;sound&quot; to &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;perfect.&quot;)  For example: he should not be wrathful, easily angered; nor be like the dead, without feeling, rather he should [adopt] an intermediate course; i.e., he should display anger (Our translation is based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3. (Note also the commentary of the Knesset HaGedolah.))  only when the matter is serious enough to warrant it, (The Rambam appears to be referring to matters which evoke personal feelings. Nevertheless, the Misrat Moshe interprets this passage as referring to an instance in which Torah law would require a display of anger - e.g., a colleague's transgression of Torah law.)  in order to prevent the matter from recurring. Similarly, he should not desire (This refers to physical desire.)  anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [Proverbs 13:25] states: (The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the &quot;intermediate traits;&quot; perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist. However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. Deuteronomy 8:10 teaches: &quot;You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord.&quot; Based on that verse, Berachot 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in Hilchot Berachot 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in Shemonah Perakim, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism. Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess. This is a dominant theme in the sections on diet in Chapter 4, and those describing the conduct of a Torah sage in Chapter 5.)  &quot;The righteous man eats to satisfy his soul.&quot; (The verse continues: &quot;But the belly of the wicked will want.&quot; The commentaries note that the contrast between the two does not center on the quantity of food they eat, but on the attitude with which they eat it. Because the righteous are not given over to pursuit of gratification, they can be satisfied. Conversely, it is the gluttony of the wicked which actually causes their want. Note also the Midrashic interpretations of this verse: &quot;The righteous...&quot; This refers to Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: &quot;Let me sip a little water&quot; (Genesis 24:17) - a single sip. &quot;And the belly of the wicked will want.&quot; This refers to Esau, who said to Jacob: &quot;Stuff me...&quot; (Genesis 25:30). Rabbi Yitzchak ben Zeira said: he opened his mouth agape like a camel and said: &quot;I will open my mouth and you put it in&quot; (Tanchumah; Pinchas 13; BaMidbar Rabbah 21:18).)  Also, he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [Psalms 37:16] states: (Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions. It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note Proverbs 6:6: &quot;Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;&quot; and Berachot 8a: He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: &quot;If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good&quot; (Psalms 128:2). &quot;You are fortunate&quot; - in this life, and &quot;will possess the good&quot; - in the world to come. The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in Hilchot Talmud Torah 3:11. Thus, the Rambam is not criticizing a person for working hard, but rather teaching us that work and its profits should not be our greatest priorities.)  &quot;A little is good for the righteous man.&quot; (The verse in its entirety expresses a contrast: &quot;A little is better for the righteous man than the great wealth that many [of the] wicked possess.&quot; Note the commentary of ibn Ezra: &quot;The righteous man will be happier with his small lot than the wicked with their great wealth.&quot;)  He should not be overly stingy (The printed editions of the Mishneh Torah have yikfotz (close his hand). However, most manuscripts use the term: yikabetz (gather). Yikfotz recalls Deuteronomy 15:7: &quot;Do not close your hand from your needy brother.&quot; Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. Yikabetz, like vikubatz in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift. The variant texts might reflect a difference of opinion as to which opposing extremes the Rambam had in mind.)  nor spread his money about, but he should give charity according to his capacity (See Hilchot Arachin 8:12-13, which places restrictions on the extent of one's generosity.)  and lend to the needy as is fitting. (Lending is also a form of charity. In Hilchot Matnot Ani'im 10:7, the Rambam lists eight degrees of charity. The highest is the support of a fellow Jew who has become poor by giving him loans or the like.)  He should not be overly elated and laugh [excessively], (Such expressive &quot;happiness&quot; is often a sign of inner discontent and suffering.)  nor be sad and depressed in spirit. Rather, he should be quietly happy at all times, (his joy should be a composed sense of satisfaction. [In this context, see the Ramah's conclusion of his notes to Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim (697:1) in which he quotes Proverbs 15:15: &quot;A good-hearted person is always celebrating.&quot;])  with a friendly countenance. (In his commentary on Avot 1:14, the Rambam defines &quot;a friendly countenance&quot; as &quot;a spirit of will and gentility.&quot;)  The same applies with regard to his other traits. (In Shemonah Perakim, Chapter 4, the Rambam mentions many other &quot;intermediate traits.&quot; Among them: Courage is the midpoint between arrogance and fear. Humility is the intermediate between pride and meekness. Earnestness is the intermediate between boasting and lowliness....Patience is the intermediate between rashness and insensitivity...)  This path is the path of the wise. (i.e., those whose behavior is controlled by their intellect)  Every man whose traits are intermediate and equally balanced can be called a &quot;wise man.&quot; (Note the contrast to the &quot;pious&quot; of the following halachah. Though the published editions of the Mishneh Torah include this line as the final concept in our halachah, many of the authoritative manuscripts place it as the beginning of Halachah 5.) </p>

It also highlights Ruth's satisfaction with little food compared to the gluttony of the wicked, symbolized by a gentile's lavish banquet missing only one item. The Midrash also explains the sacrifice of two lambs in the morning and afternoon as atonement for sins, emphasizing that no one stayed in Jerusalem with sin on their hands.

              <p>“[My offering, My food…], you shall observe to present to Me at its appointed time” (Numbers 28:2) – this is what the verse said: “The righteous eats to his own satisfaction” (Proverbs 13:25). This is Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: “Please let me sip a little water from your jug” (Genesis 24:17) – a sip. “And the belly of the wicked will lack” (Proverbs 13:25) – this is Esau, who said to Jacob: “Please pour for me [haliteni]” (Genesis 25:30). Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Rabbi Ze’eira said: He opened his mouth wide like a camel. He said: ‘I will open my mouth, and you will insert it.’ There we learned: “One may not forcibly overfeed a camel, and one may not force feed it; however, one may place food into its mouth [malitin]. ( Shabbat 155b.)   “The righteous eats to his own satisfaction” (Proverbs 13:25) – this is Ruth the Moavite, in whose regard it is written: “She ate, was satiated, and left over” (Ruth 2:14) – there was blessing in the mouth of that righteous woman. (Although she ate little, she was satiated.)  “And the belly of the wicked will lack” (Proverbs 13:25) – these are the nations of the world. There was an incident involving an idolater who invited all the residents of his city. Rabbi Dostai said: He invited me to that feast with all the residents of his city, and of all the delicacies in the world only brittle nuts were lacking. What did he do? He took from before us the board of the table, which was worth six silver talents, and he broke it. (He broke the board because he was angry that the brittle nuts were lacking.)  I said to him: ‘Why did you do that?’ He said to me: ‘You say that this world is ours and the World to Come is yours. If we do not eat now, when will we eat?’ I read in his regard: “And the belly of the wicked will lack.”</p>

Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: There was never a person in Jerusalem with iniquity attributed to him. How so? The continual offering of the morning atones for transgressions that were at night, and [that] of the afternoon atones for transgressions that were performed during the day. In any case, no person lodged in Jerusalem with an iniquity attributed to him, as it is stated: “Righteousness lodged in it…” (Isaiah 1:21).  The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘In this world you present before Me the showbread and offerings.

You anoint my head with oil; my cup is full” (Psalms 23:5). Likewise it says: “Behold, My servants will eat, and you will starve; behold, My servants will drink, and you will be thirsty” (Isaiah 65:13).</p>

(Since he saw the water rise for her, he realized she must be exceptionally righteous.)   “Please allow me to sip a little water from your jug” – [just] one sip.  “She said: Drink, my lord, and she hastened to lower her pitcher into her hand, and she gave him to drink” (Genesis 24:18).   “When she had finished giving him to drink, she said: I will draw for your camels also, until they have finished drinking” (Genesis 24:19).  “She hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels” (Genesis 24:20).  “The man was astonished at her; he was silent, to know whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not” (Genesis 24:21).  “The man was astonished at her…” – Rabbi Yoḥanan of Tzippori said: He was squinting (To see her more clearly.)  and looking at her [to see] if “the Lord had made [his journey] successful.”  “When the camels concluded drinking, the man took a gold nose ring whose weight was one half shekel, and two bracelets to put on her hands, whose weight was ten gold shekels” (Genesis 24:22).  “When the camels concluded drinking, [the man] took…” – Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Yosef: There was a precious stone in it that weighed half a shekel.  “And two bracelets to put on her hands” – corresponding to the two tablets [of the Ten Commandments]. “Whose weight was ten gold shekels” – corresponding to the Ten Commandments.  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night?” (Genesis 24:23).  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. [Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night [lalin]?]” – a stay for one night.  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka, whom she bore to Naḥor” (Genesis 24:24).  “She said to him: Both straw and feed is plentiful with us, as well as room for lodging” (Genesis 24:25).  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka…as well as room for lodging [lalun]” – to lodge for several nights. (Although he asked her about staying over for one night, she replied that he could stay for many nights.)  “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” (Genesis 24:26).   “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” – from here we learn that one should express thanks [to God] for good tidings.  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness and His truth from my master; I, the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master’s brethren” (Genesis 24:27).  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness…” – from the fact that the path was miraculously shortened, I knew that “the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master's brethren.”</p>

              <p>(Numb 28:2:) “Guard to offer it to Me at its set time.” This text is related (to Prov. 13:25), “The righteous man eats to satiate his soul.” This is Eliezer who said to Rebekah (in Gen. 24:17), “Please let me sip a bit of water,” enough to sip. (Prov. 13:25, cont.:) “But the belly of the wicked is lacking.” That is Esau who said to Jacob (in Gen. 25:30), “Please stuff me (haliteini).” R. Isaac bar Zeira said, “He opened his mouth wide like a camel and said, ‘I will open my mouth and you put it in.’” It is taught there (Mishnah Shabbat 24:3), “One may not forcibly overfeed a camel on Shabbat and one may not force-feed it. However, one may place food into its mouth (malitin).” Another interpretation (of Prov. 13:25), “The righteous man eats to satiate his soul”: This is Ruth about whom it is written (in Ruth 2:14), “and she ate her fill and had some left over.” As blessing dwelt in the mouth of that righteous woman. (Prov. 13:25, cont.:) “But the belly of the wicked is lacking.” That is the gentiles. There was a story about a gentile who made a banquet for all the people of his city: R. Dustai said, “He invited me to that banquet, with all the people of his city, and his table was not lacking any of the tasty foods of the world except for perekh nuts alone. What did he do? He took the serving table that was in front of us that was worth more than sixty talents of silver and he broke it. I said to him, ‘Why did you do this?’ He said to me, ‘You say that this world is ours and the next world is yours. If we do not [get to] eat now, when will we eat [it[?’ I read [as being] about him (Prov. 13:25, cont.), ‘but the belly of the wicked is lacking.’” (Numb. 28:3:) “And you shall say to them, ‘This is the burnt offering which you shall offer to the Lord: two yearling lambs without blemish.’” Not two simultaneously, but (as in vs. 4), “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the second lamb you shall offer at twilight.” R. Judah bar Simon said, “None ever lodged in Jerusalem with sin on their hands. (Numb. R. 21:21.)  How so? The sacrifice of the morning atoned for the transgressions which were committed during the night, and the daily sacrifice at twilight atoned for transgressions which were committed during the day.” In any case none lodged in Jerusalem with sin on their hands, as stated (in Is. 1:21), “righteousness lodges (Although the biblical context requires a past tense for this verb, the sense of the midrash assumes a present or a future. Such a translation also fits the later use of the imperfect tense used here.)  there (i.e., in Jerusalem).” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the Israelites, “In this world you offer shewbread, but in the world to come I will prepare a great table for you, with the idolaters looking on in shame. It is so stated (in Ps. 23:5), “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies….” It also says (in Is. 65:13), “Behold, My servants shall eat, [but you shall go hungry]….”</p>

              <p>We perceive Eliezer setting out on his mission with Mattaron hovering over him, invisibly. Whenever the Torah employs the word עבד in this narrative, the reference is to Eliezer the earthly עבד. Whenever the Torah mentions the word האיש in the narrative, the reference is to the עבד עברי של מעלה, to Mattatron. We have other examples when such an angel is referred to by the Torah as איש, and our sages have defined such an איש as מלאך, an angel. One such example is Genesis 37,15. Rashi, quoting Midrash Tanchuma, says that this was the angel Gabriel. In 24,17, we find “וירץ העבד לקראתה, followed in verse 21 by והאיש משתאה לה.” Onkelos translates this latter verse as meaning that Eliezer remained standing looking on silently. He was reflecting on whether the Heavenly input indicated that his mission was succesful or not. The word לדעת, to know, in verse 21 is a veiled reference to the tree of knowledge.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Abraham the author declares: It is the style of those who speak Hebrew to express their thoughts very clearly at times. However, at other times it is their style to say what they must in as few words as is necessary for a person to understand their meaning. Note that words are like bodies and their meanings are like souls. The body is, as it were, a vessel for the soul. Hence all the wise men of all nations (Literally, tongues. In other words, all wise men who speak a different language.)  are in the habit of preserving the ideas conveyed by a word (I.E. literally reads: The wise men…preserve meanings.)  and are not concerned with changes in wording when the meaning remains one and the same. I will now offer you a number of examples. (Of instances in Scripture where the same idea is conveyed in different words.)  God told Cain: And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from the ground… When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth (Gen. 4:11,12). Cain replied: Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land (Gen. 4:14). Now who is so simple as to think (Vat. Ebr. 38 reads: Now he who is simple thinks.)  that the latter verse does not convey what the former verse does because of the change in words. Look, Eliezer said, Give me to drink (hagmi’ini), I pray thee (Gen. 24:17). However, he quoted himself as saying, Let me drink (hashkini), I pray thee (Gen. 24:45). Moses said, the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon (Ex. 12:29). However, it is earlier written, the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill (Ex. 11:5). In Deuteronomy, Moses quoted the prayer which he offered on behalf of Israel because of the golden calf (Deut. 9:26-29). Now to the unintelligent, this prayer appears totally different from the one recorded in the Torah portion Ki Tissa (Ex. 32:11-14). The general rule is, one will find the same meaning in different words whenever anything is repeated in Scripture, such as the dreams of Pharaoh (See Gen. 41:1-7; 17-24.)  and Nebuchadnezzar, (See Dan. 4.)  and many other things. Now Scripture, as I noted, sometimes abridges and other times elaborates. It does the same with prefixes. (Literally, servile letters.)  At times it adds them. At other times it leaves them out. However, the meaning remains the same. Thus God said, and blue, (Hebrew, u-tekhelet.)  and purple (Ex. 25:4). However, Moses said, blue, (Hebrew, tekhelet.)  and purple (Ex. 28:6). God said, onyx stones (Hebrew, avne shoham.)  (Ex. 25:7). However, Moses said, and onyx stones (Hebrew, ve-avne shoham.)  (Ex. 35:9). There are many such instances. Either way is correct, as the verse which leaves out the vav is employing a concise style. There is no harm in it. (For it does not change the basic meaning of the verse.)  Similarly, the verse which has a vav in it does no harm because it adds clarity. Now one does not search for a reason that a vav, which is enunciated by the mouth, (Such as the vav of ve-avne, or u-tekhelet.)  is sometimes left out, sometimes written, and sometimes added. (That is, it is a superfluous vav. See Vol. 1, Introduction, p. XVII.)  For any of the aforementioned (Ways of writing.)  is correct. We do not look for the reason why an enunciated vav was written. (Or was left out.)  This being the case, why should we look for reasons regarding (The omission or non-omission of.)  the silent vav which is not enunciated? For example, we should not ask why the word le-olam (forever) (Olam can be spelled with or without a vav.)  is written with or without a vav. (The vav in olam is silent.)  Now people want reasons for full and also for deficient spellings. I would have kept silent if they wanted reasons for each one of them, (For every full or deficient spelling (Weiser).)  or if there was only one way to spell these words. (And they found it spelled otherwise.)  I will give you an example. Suppose someone tells me, “Write the following to my friend: I so and so love you forever;” and I spelled ploni (so and so) without a vav, and also ohevekha (I love you) without a vav and le-olam (forever) deficiently. (That is, without a vav.)  Then Reuben came to me and asked me why I wrote deficiently. Now my concern is to write what I was told to write. I am not concerned with full or deficient spellings. (A person uses the spellings that come to mind. There is no hint of anything special or any allusion in the type of spelling that one chooses to employ.)  Perhaps Levi will come along and teach me how to write. (That is, when to use full or deficient spellings. Levi obviously cannot, for there are no rules regarding the use of full or deficient spellings.)  I do not want to dwell on this. However, the intelligent will understand what I mean. (I.E. apparently believed that Moses had some discretion in choosing the spelling to be employed in writing the Torah.)  I will now explain the above-noted difficulties. (The questions raised by I.E. at the beginning of his comments on this verse.)  </p>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Bamidbar 28:7:4</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>את קרבני לחמי, “My offering, My bread.” The words שנים ליום, mean “two sheep per day, one in the morning and one in the evening,” not both at the same time (verse 4).  We find that King Solomon consumed far more than that as is spelled out in Kings 5, 2-3: “Solomon’s daily provisions consisted of 30 kors of semolina, 60 kors of ordinary flour; 10 fattened oxen, 20 pasture-fed oxen, 100 sheep and goats, besides deer, gazelles, roebuck and fatted geese.” The author (of Kings) appears to contrast Proverbs 13,25: “a righteous person eats (enough) to satisfy his soul (life-force), whereas the belly of the wicked will always feel in need.” Eliezer, Avraham’s trusted servant is an example of the righteous mentioned by Solomon, seeing that he asked Rivkah to only let him sip a little water from her jug (Genesis 24,17). Esau, on the other hand, demanded from Yaakov that he let him “gulp down the red stuff” (Genesis 25,30).  We find that in Job 37,23 Elihu tells Job that “Shaddai we cannot attain to Him, He is great in power and Justice,” whereas in Job 36,22 the same Elihu proclaims: “see, G’d is beyond reach in His power; who governs like Him?” [This suggests we can appreciate His greatness. Ed.]. How can these two verses be reconciled? When G’d gives to us He gives according to His power; when He asks of us He asks much less than is due Him, demanding only that we give according to our means. To illustrate: the Torah writes in Exodus 26,1 that the coverings for the Tabernacle be made of ten carpet-like strips of cloth; this is an illustration of the verse in Job 37,23, seeing “we cannot attain to Him, providing Him with His needs.” Similarly, when the Torah asks the Jewish people to provide olive oil for the Menorah in the Tabernacle (Exodus 27,20) the request is one well within the power of the Israelites to fulfill. Similarly, the Torah asks the farmer to present merely the first ripe fruit of his orchard to the Lord (Exodus 23,19). On the other hand, when the Bible describes G’d’s largess to man, such as in Ezekiel 47,12 the wording is: “all kinds of trees for food will grow up on both sides of the river. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fall; they will yield new fruit every month; each tree will produce new ‘first-fruit’ every single month.” This is a perfect illustration of the imbalance of what G’d asks of us and what He is prepared to provide for us. The author quotes a few more verses depicting the generous measure of G’d’s largess.</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Deuteronomy 21:14:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>[AND IT SHALL BE, IF THOU HAVE NO DESIRE FOR HER,] THEN THOU SHALT LET HER GO WHITHER SHE WILL. The Rabbis have said thereon in the Sifre: (Sifre, Ki Theitzei 214.)  “But not to her fathers’ house.” Now, I do not know whether the intent thereof is to state that she is a Jewess and that we do not allow her to leave the law of Israel and go back unto her people, and unto her gods, (Ruth 1:15.)  or whether it means to state that he is not to send her to her father’s house with attendants, for in that case he would be assisting those who commit a transgression. Instead he is to send her out of his house to sojourn wherever she could find a place, (Judges 17:8.)  for perhaps she will remain in the Land and follow the young men (Ruth 3:10.)  and be married to one of them. Now, since Scripture states that he is to let her go where she pleases, and warns that he not sell her for money and that he not treat her as a slave, (In Verse 14 before us.)  we deduce that she needs no divorce from him. Rather, Scripture considered her to be a married woman as long as she was with him; when he hates her he may send her away like a rape victim. (Thus the question raised by Ramban at the beginning of this section [whether she is considered a Jewess or not — see text] is resolved in favor of the second alternative: she is not considered a Jewess, and is not required to be released from him by a divorce.)  It is possible that the sense of the verse is to state that, if he cohabits with her and desires her, she shall become his wife. If he cohabits with her, however, and she is not enticing to him and he does not desire her, similar to the affair of Amnon with Tamar, (II Samuel 13:15.)  he must let her go where she pleases, everything depending upon this cohabitation. For, if after he cohabited with her [the first time] she tarried with him for days and he cohabited with her, and then changes his attitude and hates her, like a man who hates his wife, she had already become his wife, and thus she is Jewish and can be sent away only with a bill of divorce. (Further, 24:1.) </p>

                <h4>Ramban on Deuteronomy 21:14:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>THOU SHALT NOT ‘THITH’AMEIR’ (DEAL AS A SLAVE) WITH HER. This is like the expression ‘v’hith’amer’ (and he deal with him as a slave), and sell him. (Ibid., Verse 7.)  Onkelos in both cases rendered it as an expression of “trading,” and our Rabbis in the Sifre (Sifre, Ki Theitzei 214.)  and in the Gemara (Sanhedrin 88b.)  explained it as a term of “serving.” Thus it is an express negative commandment (See “The Commandments,” Vol. II, pp. 249-250.)  against making any use of her as a bondmaid, and if he did put her to such service he is to be scourged. It appears to me in line with the simple meaning of Scripture that thou shalt not ‘thith’ameir’ [spelled with an a’yin] is like “thou shalt not thith’ameir” [spelled with an aleph], as in the expression, all the workers of iniquity ‘yith’amru’ (bear themselves loftily). (Psalms 94:4. The word yith’amru is spelled with an aleph.)  So also, Thou hast ‘he’emarta’ (acknowledged) the Eternal this day; (Further, 26:17. He’emarta is written with an aleph.)  and in their splendor ‘thith’yamaru’ (you shall gain grandeur) (Isaiah 61:6.)  — exchanging the aleph for a yod — are all expressions of exaltedness and greatness. ‘He’emarta’ the Eternal this day (Further, 26:17. He’emarta is written with an aleph.)  means that “you have exalted and magnified Him to be thy G-d.” (Further, 26:17. He’emarta is written with an aleph.)  And the Eternal ‘he’emircha’ this day (Further, 26:18. He’emircha is written with an aleph.)  means that “He exalted and magnified you above all peoples to be His own treasure.” (Further, 26:18. He’emircha is written with an aleph.)  All of these expressions are derived from the phrase in the top ‘amir’ (of the uppermost bough). (Isaiah 17:6. Amir is written with an aleph.)  Thus the verse here states, “Do not exalt yourself nor magnify yourself, by acting as her master to sell her or to use her as a bondmaid. Similarly in Arabic they call a master amir. And the usage of the a’yin and the aleph is often identical in the [Sacred] Language. ‘Peda’eihu’ (deliver him) from going down the pit (Job 33:24.)  [the word peda’eihu spelled with an a’yin] is like peda’eihu [spelled with an aleph — “deliver him”], as I have explained with reference to the word petha (suddenly). (Numbers 12:4.)  So also, cherubim of ‘tza’atzuim’ work (II Chronicles 3:10.)  [written with an a’yin] is like [the same word spelled] with an aleph, from the word ‘hatze’etzaim v’hatzfioth’ (Isaiah 22:24.)  meaning “the sons and the daughters,” for [Onkelos] translated the Hebrew word keruvim (cherubim) as k’ruvaya (Genesis 3:24. See also Vol. II, p. 450.)  [“like children” — and hence cherubim of ‘tza’atzuim’ work (II Chronicles 3:10.)  written with an a’yin is identical to the same word written with an aleph, thus meaning “work in the image of children”]. And in the language of the Sages [the a’yin and aleph] are used interchangeably, such as: omdoth (appraised) written with an a’yin, and omdoth written with an aleph; (Yerushalmi Nazir, end of Chapter IX. Both usages are found there. — See my Hebrew commentary, p. 444, Note 65.)  beki’in (experts) written with an aleph, and beki’in written with an a’yin; (See my Hebrew commentary p. 444, Note 66.)  adin (yet) written with an a’yin and adin written with an aleph; (See ibid., Note 67.)  orchei (advocates) who advise their clients on how to plead before the judges, (Aboth 1:8.)  written with an a’yin and archi (a court) (Kiddushin 76a.)  written with an aleph; aris (See my Hebrew commentary p. 444, Note 69.)  (a share cropper) written with an a’yin and aris written with an aleph. And we are taught [in the Mishnah]: (Shabbath 76b.)  “Milk enough for gmiah [“a gulp” — if enough milk for one gulp was taken from one domain to another on the Sabbath, whoever took it is culpable]. And in the Gemara (Ibid., 77a.)  they asked: “Is the word gmiah written with an a’yin or an aleph, and the Rabbis resolved it by quoting the verse, ‘hagmi’ini’ (give me to drink), I pray thee, a little water (Genesis 24:17.)  [the word hagmi’ini written with an aleph] and yet they use the same term m’gama (taking a drought) written with an a’yin, such as: “[If his teeth pain him he should not] quaff vinegar through his teeth and spit it out but m’gameia (he may take a quaff) and swallow it” [the word m’gameia written with an a’yin]. And in the Mishnah of Tractate Keilim in the Tosephta (See Vol. III, p. 179, Note 124.)  thereof we are taught (Tosephta Keilim Baba Bathra 3:5.)  concerning a mardeia (the handle of the plough) written with an aleph (In our version of the Tosephta, though it is written with an a’yin.)  in place of mardeia written with an a’yin. Thus the Rabbis were not at all concerned about interchanging these two letters [the aleph and the a’yin], and so also in many places. Now, Rashi wrote: “Thou shalt not ‘thith’ameir’ with her — you shall not use her as a slave. In the Persian language, work and service are termed amirah. I have learned this from the work of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher.” (See Vol. IV, p. 62, Note 146.)  This is true, for I have seen in the Yerushalmi in [Tractate Shabbath] Chapter “Rabbi Akiba said” (Yerushalmi Shabbath IX, 1.)  and in [Tractate Abodah Zarah] Chapter “All Images” (Yerushalmi Abodah Zarah III, 6. It is not found there in our text of the Yerushalmi.)  the following text: “There [in Babylon] they call a good worker amira.” It is also commonly used in the Aramaic language, as is written in the Scroll of Susanna: (One of the books of the Apocrypha. See in Ramban’s Introduction to the Commentary on the Torah (Vol. I, p. 12) where he refers to The Great Wisdom of Solomon, another of the books of the Apocrypha. In our version of the Apocrypha the text referred to here by Ramban is found, with changes, in Judith 1:8.)  “And the king of Assyria sent to all amira (servants) of Nineveh and to all d’amrin (who serve) on the sea coast, and to the servant of Carmel and Gilead [to come with him to the war], but all the servants of the land disregarded the commandment of Nebuchadnezzar and they were not afraid of him.” So also in many places of that book the inhabitants of a land are called “amurei of the land,” meaning those who are servants to the land and make use thereof. Or it may mean that the king of Assyria commanded the soldiers, these being called “the servants of the land,” for they are subject to the king to go with him in his wars, and they are his soldiers and his horsemen, similar to the expressions: they ‘served’ Chedorlaomer; (Genesis 14:4.)  and many nations shall ‘serve’ him.

The symbolism of offering water to the Righteous-One and his camels is discussed in Tikkunei Zohar, while Vayikra Rabbah emphasizes the importance of staying faithful to God and Torah in times of challenge. Rashi derived Hashem's concern for the Israelites' possessions from the mention of animals in Numbers 20:8, supported by the specific mention of livestock when providing water.

Instead of tilting the jug while it was still on her shoulder, Rebecca took the extra effort of removing the heavy container from her shoulder, so that it would be easier for the servant to drink. 8</p>

              <p>“The servant ran toward her, and he said: Please allow me to sip a little water from your jug” (Genesis 24:17).  “The servant ran toward her” – toward her good deeds. (Since he saw the water rise for her, he realized she must be exceptionally righteous.)   “Please allow me to sip a little water from your jug” – [just] one sip.  “She said: Drink, my lord, and she hastened to lower her pitcher into her hand, and she gave him to drink” (Genesis 24:18).   “When she had finished giving him to drink, she said: I will draw for your camels also, until they have finished drinking” (Genesis 24:19).  “She hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels” (Genesis 24:20).  “The man was astonished at her; he was silent, to know whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not” (Genesis 24:21).  “The man was astonished at her…” – Rabbi Yoḥanan of Tzippori said: He was squinting (To see her more clearly.)  and looking at her [to see] if “the Lord had made [his journey] successful.”  “When the camels concluded drinking, the man took a gold nose ring whose weight was one half shekel, and two bracelets to put on her hands, whose weight was ten gold shekels” (Genesis 24:22).  “When the camels concluded drinking, [the man] took…” – Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Yosef: There was a precious stone in it that weighed half a shekel.  “And two bracelets to put on her hands” – corresponding to the two tablets [of the Ten Commandments]. “Whose weight was ten gold shekels” – corresponding to the Ten Commandments.  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night?” (Genesis 24:23).  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. [Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night [lalin]?]” – a stay for one night.  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka, whom she bore to Naḥor” (Genesis 24:24).  “She said to him: Both straw and feed is plentiful with us, as well as room for lodging” (Genesis 24:25).  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka…as well as room for lodging [lalun]” – to lodge for several nights. (Although he asked her about staying over for one night, she replied that he could stay for many nights.)  “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” (Genesis 24:26).   “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” – from here we learn that one should express thanks [to God] for good tidings.  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness and His truth from my master; I, the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master’s brethren” (Genesis 24:27).  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness…” – from the fact that the path was miraculously shortened, I knew that “the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master's brethren.”</p>

              <p>Another matter, “and a woman, if her bloody discharge will flow many days” – that is what the verse said: “For many days, Israel was without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without Torah” (II Chronicles 15:3). Who prophesied this verse? Azarya ben Oded the prophet said: ‘Days are destined to befall Israel “without the true God,” as the attribute of justice will not be implemented in the world.’ (Therefore, the wicked will not be punished and the righteous will suffer. )  “Without a teaching priest,” as the high priesthood is destined to be abolished. “And without Torah,” as the Sanhedrin is destined to be abolished. When that generation heard this, their hands weakened. (They became discouraged. )  A Divine Voice emerged and said: “Strengthen weak hands” (Isaiah 35:3).  Rabbi Yudan and Rabbi Pinḥas, Rabbi Yudan said: “Strengthen weak hands,” hands that appeared as though they are weak. “And support failing knees” (Isaiah 35:3), that appear as though they are failing. (Rabbi Yudan interprets the verse as referring to God. The prophet thus says to Israel: Increase your good deeds so that God, who now appears in this world as though He were weak, will reveal His power (Rabbi David Luria). )  Rabbi Pinḥas said: “Strengthen weak hands,” as you have weakened yourselves with your wicked deeds. “And support failing knees,” as you have failed through your wicked deeds.  “Say to the impetuous [lenimharei] of heart” (Isaiah 35:4), Rabbi Hoshaya Rabba said: To the brokenhearted, as it is stated: “They will destroy [yemaharu] its wall” (Nahum 2:6). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Like those who seek to hasten the end, (The end of the exile, the salvation.)  as it is stated: “She hastened [vatemaher] and lowered her jug” (Genesis 24:18). “Be strong, do not fear” (Isaiah 35:4) – Because Israel was saying: “My tears have been my bread day and night, when they say to me all day long: Where is your God?” (Psalms 42:4), a Divine Voice emerged and said to them: “Behold, your God will come with vengeance” (Isaiah 35:4). The One who is destined to give the nations of the world their just deserts, “the retribution of God, He will come and save you” (Isaiah 35:4).  “For many days, Israel” (II Chronicles 15:3) – were they, in fact, many days? Rather, because they were days of suffering, he characterized them as many. Similarly, “Many days passed and the word of the Lord was with Elijah, in the third year, saying” (I Kings 18:1) – Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Ḥelbo in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Three months in the first [year], three months in the last, and twelve months in the middle; that is eighteen months. Were they, in fact, many days? Rather, they were days of suffering; therefore, he characterized them as many. Similarly, “It was during those many days” (Exodus 2:23); were they, in fact, many days? Rather, it is because they were days of suffering. Similarly, “many days, one hundred and eighty days” (Esther 1:4); were they, in fact, many days? Rather, it is because they were…  And this verse, “And a woman, if her bloody discharge will flow many days…” – Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “Days,” two; “many,” three. (Thus, although the verse refers to only three days, the phrase “many days” is used because they are days of suffering. )  From then on, she is not a menstruant, but rather, afflicted. (Some suggest that this sentence is based on the continuation of the verse: “not at the time of her menstruation.” If a woman experiences bleeding during the time of her menstruation she has one set of laws (those of a nidda); if she experiences bleeding more than seven days but less than eighteen days after the onset of her last menstrual cycle, she has a different set of laws (those of a zava) (Midrash Rabba HaMevoar). )  “The menstruant in her menstruation” is not written here, but rather, “one who is afflicted [hadava] in her menstruation” (Leviticus 15:33). (The word dava is Aramaic for zava (Matnot Kehuna). )  Rabbi Simlai said: The Holy One blessed be He inflicted great suffering on this woman, who, after she observes the day of discharge, sits and observes seven days of menstruation. (By Torah law, a woman who experiences menstrual bleeding (a nidda) is impure for seven days. A woman who experiences bleeding on three consecutive days when it is not the time for her menstrual period (a zava) must observe seven clean days before she can become pure, parallel to the entire time in which a nidda is impure. )  The Torah calls her a menstruant [nidda]; “one who is afflicted in her discharge” is not written here, but rather, “one who is afflicted in her menstruation.”  Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: If this woman, because she withdraws for two or three days, the Torah calls her nidda, (This is a term with connotations of ostracism.)  we, who have withdrawn from the House of our sanctity and our glory (The Temple. )  for numerous days and numerous years, numerous epochs and numerous eras, all the more so.</p>

          </summary>
          <details>
            <summary>Rashi derived that Hashem is solicitous of the Israelites' property from the use of the term השקית (&quot;you will give water&quot;) in Numbers 20:8, which refers to animals. This is further supported by the fact that Hashem specifically mentioned the Israelites' livestock when providing water, indicating His concern for their possessions.</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>
                <h4>Siftei Chakhamim, Numbers 20:8:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>From here … is solicitous of the [Israelites’] property. You might ask: From where did Rashi derive this? Perhaps Hashem was answering their request when they asked why they and their livestock should die there, and Hashem answered, “Give drink to the community and their livestock.” The answer is that the term השקית (lit. &quot;you will give water&quot;) refers to animals, as it is written in Parshas Chaye Sarah (Bereishis 24:14) “וגם גמליך אשקה” [&quot;And I will also water your camels&quot;]. Thus the Torah should have said “וישתו העדה” [&quot;Let the community drink&quot;] as it writes shortly (v. 11) “ותשת העדה” [&quot;And the community drank&quot;] because the term שתייה [&quot;drinking&quot;] refers to people, as it is also written “שתה אדוני” [&quot;Let my master drink&quot;] (Bereishis 24:18). However, since Scripture modifies its wording and writes והשקית [&quot;And give drink&quot;] it is certainly because “[Hashem] is solicitous of the Israelites’ property.” (Mahari) Also one may answer that Rashi is answering the question: Why is it necessary for the Torah to state “And their livestock”? For in Parshas Beshalach (Shemos 17:3) when Hashem answered Moshe’s request for water, He answered only that the people would drink, and the answer was despite Yisroel having said “To kill me and my children and my livestock [through thirst].” If so, why does it state, “And their livestock”? Rather it was because “[Hashem] is solicitous…” (Kitzur Mizrochi) Hashem said בעירם [&quot;their livestock&quot;] with a mem. Thus we learn that He is solicitous of them because they are the Israelites’ livestock, and not merely because they are animals. For if not so, it should have said “Give drink to the community and the animals”! This answer is also apparent from Divrei Dovid.</p>

              <p>We may view the matter also in light of what the Talmud teaches in Berachot 40, based on Deuteronomy 11,15 that one must feed one's animals before eating oneself. This ruling applies only when there is no danger to the life of the person involved. If his life is in danger, concern for his own health takes precedence over the wellbeing of his animals. When Rebeccah heard Eliezer ask for some water she concluded that she faced a man whose need for water was immediate. This is why she said to him: &quot;drink!&quot; As soon as she had given him sufficient water to ensure he was not in danger of dehydrating she suggested giving water to his camels, the ones which normally should have been looked after first. This is why the Torah phrases Rebeccah's action in such a way that we understand that as soon as was practicable she turned her attention to the camels, giving them to drink. She added that she would continue until the camels had finished drinking, meaning that in the case of the camels she was not going to rely on her personal judgment of when the animals had had enough to drink. She kept drawing water for the camels until they stopped drinking.</p>

              <p>ותאמר גם לגמליך אשאב, she said: “I will also draw water for your camels.” The physical strength required for Rivkah to draw water for all of Eliezer’s camels could only be explained if she enjoyed divine assistance. This is all the more so if we accept the opinion of the sages in the Seder Olam that at that time Rivkah was only three years old. The whole matter can be viewed only as part of the success of which Avraham had assured Eliezer at the outset when he told him: “He will send His angel ahead of you and make your mission successful.” (24,7) This is the reason you find an allusion to G-d’s great name in our verse the name we have discussed in the previous paragraph. The fact that the letter ג in the word גמליך has a dagesh is additional evidence of an allusion to the attribute of גבורה being involved in what transpired at this well.</p>

(Although he asked her about staying over for one night, she replied that he could stay for many nights.)  “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” (Genesis 24:26).   “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” – from here we learn that one should express thanks [to God] for good tidings.  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness and His truth from my master; I, the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master’s brethren” (Genesis 24:27).  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness…” – from the fact that the path was miraculously shortened, I knew that “the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master's brethren.”</p>

            <summary>Sforno explains the construction &quot;עד אשר אם&quot; in Numbers 32:17 as similar to other biblical verses, such as Proverbs 8:26 and Genesis 24:19. Radak interprets the expression &quot;עד...אם&quot; in Genesis 31:52 as if the Torah had written &quot;שאני&quot; and &quot;שאתה.&quot; Or HaChaim discusses the reversal of the usual order of giving animals to drink before oneself in Numbers 20:8 to emphasize the importance of human life over animal needs. Rashi provides examples of the word &quot;אם&quot; being used in a similar manner in Job 42:8 and Isaiah 4:4.</summary>

              <p>העדה ובעירם, &quot;the congregation and their beasts.&quot; We have a rule (Berachot 40) that one gives one's animals to drink (and to eat) before drinking oneself. In this instance the Torah reverses the usual order to teach that the rule mentioned applies only when the life of the human being is not in danger. Whenever there is a danger that a human being may come to harm by first looking after the needs of his livestock, such a rule is suspended. I refer the reader to my comments in connection with Rebeccah giving Eliezer to drink before she gave his camels to drink in Genesis 24,19.</p>

Various commentators reference the pouring out of a vessel in different biblical verses to explain the act of giving or sacrificing, emphasizing the importance of performing deeds with alacrity. In the Second Temple period, Rebecca's actions are portrayed as kind and generous, showing perfection in her care for others. The Targums also highlight Rebecca's swift and efficient actions in providing water for Eliezer and his camels.</summary>

And in relation to Rebecca, “And she hastened and spilled her pitcher…” (Genesis 24:20).

              <p>R. Levi opened [his discourse] (with Ps. 9:6), “You have rebuked the nations; you have destroyed the wicked one”: “You have rebuked the nations.” This refers to Amalek, of which it is written (in Numb. 24:20), “First among the nations (to attack Israel) was Amalek.” (PRK 3:5; cf. PR 12:5.)  (ibid., cont.:) “You have destroyed the wicked one.” This refers to Esau, of whom it is stated (in Mal. 1:4), “and they shall call them (i.e., Edom) a country of wickedness.” If someone says to you, “Jacob also is included [among the wicked one],” say to such a one, &quot;’You have destroyed wicked ones (in the plural)’ is not written here, but ‘You have destroyed the wicked one (in the singular).’” (Ps. 9:6, cont.:) “You have blotted out their name for ever and ever,” as stated (Deut. 25:19), “You shall blot out the remembrance [of Amalek]….” (Ps. 79:12:) “And return sevenfold unto the bosom (heq) of our neighbors [their taunt with which they have taunted you, O Lord].” R. Judan bar Gadya, R. Joshua ben Levi, and the masters [differ]. (PRK 3:6; Lam. R. 3:64 (9); PR 12:10; 13:1.)  R. Judan bar Gadya said, “Remember what [our neighbor Amalek] did to us in the penis, which is attached to the lap (heq) [i.e., to the center] of a man.” And this agrees with what R. Hanina bar Shilqa, R. Joshua ben Levi and R. Jochanan said, “What did the House of Amalek do to Israel? (Below, section 14.)  They cut off their penes and flung them heavenward, as they said, ‘This is what You have chosen, take for Yourself what You have chosen.’ This is related to the verse (in Ps. 9:6), ‘their taunt with which they have taunted You, O Lord.’” R. Joshua [ben Levi] said, “It should be remembered what they did in the Torah, as it is written about it (in Ps. 12:7), ‘refined sevenfold.’” And the masters said, “It should be remembered what they did to the Temple, which was the bosom (heq) [i.e., the center] of the earth, as stated (with reference to the Temple in Ezek. 43:14), ‘And from the lap (heq) of the earth (A more usual translation would read: AND FROM THE BASE ON THE GROUND.)  to the lower ledge, two cubits.’” When Samuel came, he repaid them, as stated (in I Sam. 15:33), “then Samuel hewed Agag.” What did he do to him? R. Abba bar Kahana said, “He cut olive-sized pieces from his flesh and fed them to ostriches. This is what is written (in Job 18:13), ‘It shall consume pieces of his flesh; the firstborn of death shall consume his pieces’; (Job 18 may well have seemed related to Agag’s fate in that vs. 17 mentions the perishing of HIS REMEMBRANCE, an expression linked with Agag (here in I Sam. 15:2) and Amalek (in Deut. 25:17–19). See Braude and Kapstein, Pesikta de Rab Kahana, p. 49, n. 42.)  in that [Samuel] chose a cruel (mar) (Braude and Kapstein, ibid., n. 43. also point out here that mar in Aramaic is an honorific title suitable for a king like Agag.)  death for him.” But the masters say, “[Samuel] set up four poles (Gk.: kontoi.)  and stretched him upon them.” It also says (in I Sam. 15:32), “and Agag said, ‘Surely the bitterness (mar) of death is at hand (sr),’” [meaning,] “Do they thus put princes (sr) (This SR is spelled with a sin and is a homonym for the SR in I Sam. 15:32, which is spelled with a samekh.)  to death with harsh deaths?” R. Samuel bar Avdimi said, “He judged him by the justice of the peoples of the world (instead of by Torah) without witnesses and without a warning.” Rabbi said, “He castrated him (rt.: srs) him, as stated (in I Sam. 15:33), ‘But Samuel said, “As your sword has made women bereaved, so shall your mother be bereaved among women.”’” R. Levi said, “Moses also gave a hint to Israel in the Torah (about Agag's castration), since it is stated (in Deut. 25:11-12), ‘When two men get into a fight with each other, and the wife of one draws near [to save her husband from the hand of the one smiting him, if she puts out with her hand and grabs [the other man] by his genitals.] Then you shall cut off her hand….’ What is written after that (in vs. 17), ‘Remember what Amalek did to you.’” Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, are You telling us to remember? (PRK 3:7; PR 12:10; 13:1.)  You remember; as forgetfulness is common among us. But with You there is no forgetfulness.” Thus (in Deut. 25:17), “Remember what Amalek did to you.” He did to us, and he did not do to You? (Ps. 137:7:) “Remember against the children of Edom, O Lord, the day of [the destruction of] Jerusalem, [how they said, ‘Aru, 'aru (rt.: 'rh, rt.: 'rh) her to the foundation].’” Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said, “'Aru, 'aru [means], paggeru, paggeru (destroy, destroy), even as [the word is] used (in Jer. 51:58), ‘Babylon's broad wall shall be utterly demolished ('ar'er tit'ar'ar, rts.: 'rr, 'rh).’” R. Levi said, “['Aru, 'aru means,] empty, empty, even as [the word is] used (in Gen. 24:20), ‘She hastened to empty (te'ar, rt: 'rh) her jar into the trough.’” In the opinion of the one who said, “paggeru, paggeru (destroy, destroy),” ['aru, 'aru means] to its foundations is intended (meaning, down to them but not to the foundation per se). [But] in the opinion of the one who said, “pannun, pannun (empty them, empty them)” [the words mean,] empty its foundations. What is the meaning of Amalek ('mlq)? People ('m) of the locust (ylq). (PRK 3:8. The translation is following Buber’s suggestion here in n. 71, who would read YLQ (“locust”) instead of LQ (“lapping” or “greedy”). Buber also notes that he suggests the same emendation in his edition of PRK 3:8, n. 98. The emendation is also made by Zundel in ‘Ets Yosef, citing such a textual variant in Yalkut Shimoni.)  They spread out like the zahla locust. [Alternatively] Amalek ('mlq) is a people ('am) who came to lap up (l’leq) the blood of Israel like a dog. (Cf. PR 12:12.)  R. Levi said in the name of R. Simeon ben Halafta, “To what may Amalek be likened? To a fly who is inflamed [with passion] after an [open] wound. So was Amalek inflamed like a dog [with passion] after Israel.” (Cf. PR 12:12.)  As the Israelites went out of Egypt, [Amalek] heard that they were redeemed, and came against them upon the [Reed] Sea. But [Israel] mentioned the explicit name [of God], and [Amalek] was bewildered, as stated (Exod. 15:15), “Then the captains of Edom were bewildered.” (Deut. 25:17:) “On the way as you came out of Egypt.” It is taught (in a baraita) in the name of R. Nathan: Amalek came four hundred parasangs (i.e., a little over 900 miles) to fight with Israel in Rephidim, as stated (in Numb. 13:29), (See Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Exod. 17:8; Mekhilta deRabbi Ishmael, ‘Amaleq, 1.)  “Amalek dwells in the land of the Negeb […].” And he [dwells] in the interior beyond all of them (i.e., beyond all the tribes listed in this passage). (The description hardly fits the geography. For an explanation of what the text seems to mean, see Enoch Zundel in his commentary ‘Ets Yosef on Tanh., Deut. 6:9, who says that when the Israelites came out of Egypt, they were west of the land of Israel with Amalek dwelling in the southern horn to the east and with all the other peoples on the west side. There are four hundred parasangs from the land of Amalek to the place where Israel entered the Negeb. Moreover, the land of Israel midrashically is four hundred parasangs square.)  (Deut. 25:17:) “On the way as you came out of Egypt.” (PRK 3:9.)  R. Levi said, “He came upon them from the wayside like a bandit.” (Gk.: lestai, reading lestes for lestim in accord with Buber’s n. 77. The confusion between the two forms is common. See Jastrow, s.v. LYSTYS.)  It is comparable to a king who had a vineyard which he had enclosed with a fence and in which he had put a biting dog. The king said, “Whenever anyone comes to break through the fence, the dog will bite him.” One day the king's son came and broke through the fence. The dog bit him. Whenever he wanted to bring to mind the transgression of his son who broke through to the vineyard, he would say to him, “You remember how the dog bit you.” Similarly, whenever the Holy One, blessed be He, wants to bring to mind the sin of Israel - what they did in Rephidim, when they said (in Exod. 17:7) “Is the Lord present among us or not” - He says to them (in Deut. 25:17), “Remember what Amalek did to you.” (Deut. 25:18:) “How he encountered you [on the way].” R. Judah, R. Nehemiah, and the masters [differ]. (PRK 3:10; cf. PR 12:13.)  R. Judah says, “’How he encountered (qr, rt.: qrh) you, [i.e.,] defiled you. [It is] just as you say (in Deut. 23:11), “who is unclean because of what he encounters (rt.: qrh) at night (i.e., a nocturnal emission).’” R. Nehemiah said, “He actually called (qr') you. What did Amalek do? He went down to the Egyptian hall of records (Gk.: archeion; Lat.: archivum.)  and obtained the records (Gk.: tomoi.)  on the tribes, where their names were inscribed against them for the number of bricks. Then he would stand outside [Israel's protective] cloud and call out (rt.: qrh) to them, ‘Reuben, Simeon, Levi, come out, for I am your brother; and I want to transact business (Gk.: pragmateia.)  with you.’ When they came out, he killed them.” And the masters say, “He cooled (qr) you, i.e., he made Israel [appear] lukewarm (rt.: qrr) before others.” R. Huniya said, “A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a boiling bath (‘MBTY: Gk.: embate.)  into which no creature is able to descend. A certain ruffian came and leaped down into it. Even though he was scalded, he made it cool to others. So also when Israel came out of Egypt, and the Holy One, blessed be He, divided the sea before them, while the Egyptians were drowned in its midst, fear of them fell upon all the peoples, as stated (in Exod. 15:15-16), ‘Then were the chiefs of Edom bewildered…. [Terror and fright fell upon them].’ When Amalek came and joined in battle with them - even though he received his [scalding] at their hands - he made [Israel appear] lukewarm (in battle) before the peoples of the world.”</p>

                <h4>Midrash Tehillim 137:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>On the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept, as we remembered Zion. Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav: This teaches us that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed David the destruction of the First Temple and the destruction of the Second Temple. The First Temple was on the rivers of Babylon, while for the Second Temple, the verse states, &quot;Remember, O Lord, what the Edomites did on the day Jerusalem fell.&quot; (Lamentations 4:22) When Jeremiah reached the Euphrates River, Nebuzaradan said to him, &quot;If it is good in your eyes to come with me to Babylon.&quot; Jeremiah thought to himself, &quot;If I go with them to Babylon, there will be no comfort for the remaining exiles.&quot; The exiles covered their eyes and saw Jeremiah leaving them. They all cried and said, &quot;Our teacher Jeremiah is leaving us here, as it is stated, 'On the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept.'&quot; Jeremiah replied, &quot;I swear by Heaven and Earth, you cried one cry until you reached Zion. 'There we sat and wept' teaches us that they had no place to sit from the time they left Jerusalem until they reached the Euphrates.&quot; They said to him, &quot;May the Merciful One have mercy on them.&quot; And once they had shown Him their faces, He had mercy on them, lest they repent and all unite and call upon their God and be helped, and we would not have been exalted. Therefore, they were forced and hurried along against their will, as it is stated, &quot;We were pursued on our necks.&quot; (Lamentations 5:5)  Our pursuers were light, even as they chased us. (Lamentations 4:19) They also oppressed us. Why did the Israelites cry over the rivers of Babylon? Rabbi Yochanan said that the killing of one Euphrates fish in Israel was more grievous than all the evil that Nebuchadnezzar wrought. When Israelites were in their own land, they drank only from rainwater, natural springs, and well water. But when they were exiled to Babylon, they drank from the waters of the Euphrates and died. Therefore, they wept over those who were killed by their enemies, those who died on the journey, and those killed by the Euphrates. Furthermore, Nebuchadnezzar and all his nobles and officials were on a ship, along with all kinds of musicians, as it says: &quot;The Chaldeans are coming with their ships, and their men of war come against her&quot; (Isaiah 43:14). All the kings of Judah were thrown into iron chains and made to walk naked on the banks of the river. Nebuchadnezzar, the wicked one, raised his eyes and saw them, and said to his servants, &quot;Why are these people walking upright without any burden on their shoulders?&quot; At that moment, they brought books and made them into pillows, filled them with sand, and placed them on their shoulders until they bent over. They said to themselves, &quot;We are pursued on our necks,&quot; as it says: &quot;We have pursued on our necks&quot; (Lamentations 5:5). At that time, all Israel wept until their cry reached the heavens. Rabbi Acha bar Abba said that at that moment, God wanted to return the world to chaos and void, but he said: &quot;Everything I have created, I have created for these people,&quot; as it says: &quot;I will also beat My fists together, and I will cause My wrath to rest; I the Lord have spoken.&quot; (Ezekiel 21:22) The verse (2 Samuel 2:26) says: &quot;Therefore I said, 'Turn away from me; let me weep bitterly. Do not try to comfort me for the destruction of my people.'&quot; David said to his attendants that their words of comfort are like insults to him, and he would rather be left alone to mourn. But the angels descended and lifted the burden of mourning from him. They did not only include the ministering angels but also God himself, as it says: &quot;For your sake, I sent Babylon to bring you down...&quot;. When the exiles returned to Jerusalem, they were met by the people of Be'eri and other neighboring cities who saw them naked. The sons of Barai stripped their slaves and maidservants and offered them as a gift before Nebuchadnezzar, saying, &quot;Perhaps you are a king who loves the naked.&quot; He told them to go and clothe the Israelites. As a reward for their kindness, God bestowed upon the sons of Barai kindness from all the land of Israel, and they became more beautiful. They said that anyone who enters there does not seek to leave without sinning. They also cried and mourned with them, and God cried with them too. &quot;On its ruins we hung our harps,&quot; for there we asked of our captors words of song. Nebuchadnezzar said to them, &quot;Why are you sitting and crying?&quot; They prepared themselves until we eat and drink. &quot;I ask that you stand and play before me and before this foreign worship with your harps, as you would play before your God.&quot; They looked at each other and said, &quot;It is not enough that we destroyed His Temple, but now we are about to play before this idol and this foreign worship.&quot; Rabbi Yitzhak Bar Tabla says: &quot;To what is this matter similar? It is similar to a human king who married a daughter of another king. He said to her, 'Stand before me and let me give you a cup to drink.' She refused to drink the cup, and he became angry with her and banished her from his house. She went and married a leper. The king said to her, 'Stand before me and let me give you a cup to drink.' She replied, 'I was a princess and married to a king, and when he told me to drink a cup, I refused, and he banished me from his house. If you had given me a cup to drink, I would have added to my honor. Now you tell me to stand before you and drink a cup.' All the people stood up and took matters into their own hands, grabbing the upper parts of their garments and biting them. They sang for us the Song of Zion. We will not sing, but we will say how we will sing. They pointed their fingers and said, 'We used to clap our hands and cut off our fingers.' This is what is meant by the verse in Ezra 8:15, 'I assembled them by the river that flows towards Ahava.' I did not find any Levites there. They were there, but they could not play the harps. How did the Levites who were exiled among them return? As it is stated in Ezra 3:12, 'But many of the priests and Levites and heads of the fathers' houses, old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes.' When Nebuchadnezzar knew this, he went and hung the corpses of those who had been killed. Nevertheless, they rejoiced that they did not sing before an idol, as it says, 'We hung up our harps.'&quot; At that hour, God swore to Israel, &quot;You have ruled yourselves and cut off your right fingers. Even I, as it is written in Lamentations 2:3, have turned back my right hand because of the enemy, and I will not return it except to remind you, as it is said, 'If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.' It is taught in the Talmud, Sotah 49b, that a person should forsake everything he has in his house and leave only a small reminder of Jerusalem, and a woman should make jewelry as a reminder of Jerusalem, as it is said, 'If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its skill.' When the Temple was destroyed, many Pharisees in Israel stopped eating meat and drinking wine. Rabbi Joshua inquired of them, &quot;Why do you not eat meat or drink wine?&quot; They replied, &quot;We used to eat meat every day, as there was always a daily offering on the altar, and we used to drink wine every day, as it was poured on the altar. But now it is abolished.&quot; Rabbi Joshua responded, &quot;Even figs and grapes are not eaten solely for their own sake, but because they bring the first fruits, bread is not eaten solely for its own sake, but because it brings the two loaves on Shavuot and the showbread every Sabbath. Water is not drunk solely for its own sake, but because it is poured out on the holiday. Be silent.&quot; He told them not to mourn excessively, for it is impossible to mourn excessively. Rabbi Joshua said, &quot;A decree is not issued unless the majority of the congregation can uphold it.&quot; What is the verse that supports this? Rav Adda bar Ahavah said, &quot;You are arrogant, you have said, 'It is useless to serve God. What have we gained by keeping his requirements and walking mournfully before the Lord Almighty?'&quot; (Malachi 3:14) There is no nation without its share of troubles, but the sages said, &quot;A person should arrange their house with a set budget, and should keep only a small amount of unnecessary items.&quot; This is stated in the Talmud (Bava Batra 65b). With this method, a person can make all the necessary preparations for a meal while keeping only a few unnecessary things. What is the reason for this? Rav Papa said, &quot;It is like the chair of the blacksmith. Just as a blacksmith creates everything he needs on his chair and keeps only a few things, so should a person arrange their home.&quot; Rav Batzada said, &quot;This is similar to the verse 'If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill' (Psalms 137:5). What does this mean? It refers to the ash on the head of the groom. Rav Papa asked Abaye, &quot;Where should we place it?&quot; Abaye responded, &quot;In the place of tefillin, as it says, 'For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until her righteousness shines like a bright light, and her salvation, like a blazing torch' (Isaiah 62:1).&quot; Rabbi Dosa said, &quot;If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill, so that I cannot perform miracles.&quot; Rabbi Zeira said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, &quot;When the sins of the people caused the nations to enter Jerusalem, they took the mighty men of Israel and forced them to turn their hands behind their backs. God said, 'I am with them in their distress' (Psalms 91:15). The sons of Nathan were in distress, and I see it as if their right hand has been pushed back because of the enemy.' In the end, they were revealed to Daniel (Daniel 12:13), and he said, 'Go your way.'&quot; He said to him, &quot;There is no judgment and no accounting.&quot; He said to him, &quot;Rest.&quot; He said to him, &quot;It is forever stagnant.&quot; He said to him, &quot;At the end of days or at the end of the right.&quot; He said to him, &quot;At the end of the right, which is subservient.&quot; He said to him, &quot;I have given the right to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. As long as my children are subservient, let the right be subservient with them. I have redeemed my children with the right, my right.&quot; As David said, &quot;That Your beloved ones may be delivered, help with Your right hand, and answer us.&quot; The Lord of the universe did this for them on behalf of Your beloved ones, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and as long as they have no merit, He did it for them on behalf of Your right hand and answer us. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &quot;I will do it,&quot; as it says, &quot;Reveal Your arm, the Holy One.&quot; And it is written, &quot;Save with Your right hand, and answer me.&quot; &quot;Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem.&quot; Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He, &quot;Master of the Universe, You tell us to remember, but forgetfulness is present within us. You remember, for there is no forgetfulness before Your throne of glory.&quot; Those who said, &quot;Arise, Arise, until the foundation is destroyed in it.&quot; Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said, &quot;They are ruined, they are ruined,&quot; as it says, &quot;The wall of Babylon will fall.&quot; Rabbi Levi said, &quot;Punishment, punishment,&quot; as it says, &quot;And she emptied her vessel into the trough.&quot; &quot;Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem.&quot; When its foundations will be uprooted from it, those who said, &quot;Arise, Arise, until the foundation is destroyed in it,&quot; will be asked. They asked Rabbi Eliezer: Are the later generations superior to the earlier ones? He said to them, &quot;You are compared to the chosen house that proves its ancestors. They removed the plaster, as it says, 'And he revealed the covering of Judah.' But we have chipped away at the walls, as it says, 'Those who said, &quot;Arise, Arise, until the foundation is destroyed in it.&quot;' To teach you that any generation that does not build the Temple in its time, it is considered as if they destroyed it. What is the reason? Because they did not repent (`aseh teshuvah).&quot;</p>

First she let Eliezer drink. When some water was left over in the jug, she did not know what to do. She debated whether to give the left-over water to the camels. In doing this, however, she would place man and beast on the same level by letting both of them drink from the same vessel. If, on the other hand, she would pour out the left-over water, this would also be a lack of respect, since drinking water would be demoted to the status of dirty waste water. What did she do? She &quot;ran&quot; as if to give the camels to drink. While running, she pretended to fall, so that the water spilled from the jug. She then had an excuse to fill the jug anew from the well.

How, the Law itself shall show. “The damsel,” it says, “was very fair to look upon: she was a virgin, no man had known her. And she went down to the spring and filled her pitcher and came up. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water out of thy pitcher. And she said, Drink, sir. And she hasted and let down her pitcher on to her arm, and gave him drink, until he ceased drinking. And she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they all have drunk. And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran to the well and drew water for the camels” (Gen. 24:16–20).</p>

        <summary>In Genesis 24, Eliezer is astonished by Rebekah's kindness and generosity, remaining silent until she finishes providing water for the camels. The servant recognizes her righteousness, expresses gratitude to God for guiding him, and gives her valuable gifts. The Talmud discusses uncommon expressions in the Torah, such as &quot;שאה&quot; and &quot;גָּרָב,&quot; with unique meanings.

            <summary>Ibn Ezra explains that &quot;mishta’eh&quot; means &quot;astonished&quot; or &quot;awe-struck,&quot; coming from roots meaning &quot;wasted.&quot; Sforno states that the servant was amazed at Rebekah's zeal, while Or HaChaim notes that he remained silent to test her kindness. Radak adds that the servant kept silent until Rebekah finished providing water for the camels, while Rashi clarifies that &quot;mishta’eh&quot; means &quot;wondering&quot; or &quot;perplexed.&quot; Steinsaltz highlights that the servant was astonished at Rebekah's actions and was waiting to see if his mission was successful. Chizkuni interprets &quot;mishta’eh&quot; as meaning &quot;about her.&quot;</summary>

Mishta’eh (looked steadfastly) means the same as mishtomem  (Both mishta’eh and mishtomem come from roots meaning wasted and themselves mean astonished, perplexed or awe-struck.)  (astonished, awe-struck). It comes from the same root as sha’u and tisha’eh (waste) in Until cities be waste (sha’u) (Is. 6:11), (Mishta’eh tisha’eh and sha’u come from the root shin, alef, heh.)  and And the land become utterly waste (tisha’eh shemamah) (Is. 6:11). </p>

              <p>The meaning of lah (on her) is because of her. (The word lah usually means to her. However, it cannot be so translated in our verse. The servant was not astonished to her; he was astonished because of her.)  Then Daniel…was appalled (eshtomam) for a while (Dan. 4:16) is similar. (Daniel was perplexed or astonished. In this verse, too, a word (eshtomem) from a root meaning waste (shin, mem, mem) is used to describe one who is awe-struck or astonished. See note 31.)  The tav of mishta’eh is not part of the root of the word but is the sign of the hitpa’el conjugation. It is like the tav of nitra’eh  (The root of nitra’eh is resh, alef, heh. The tav of nitra’eh is the tav of the hitpa’el.)  in let us look (nitra’eh) one another in the face (II Kings 14:8). Mishta’eh definitely does not come from the root shin, tav, heh (drink). (Some versions of Onkelos read, and the man was drinking. See Krinsky. According to this interpretation the man acted as if he was drinking, but he was really looking at Rebekah (Cherez).) </p>

              <p>והאיש משתאה לה מחריש, And the man was amazed at her, remaining silent, etc. The Torah explains here that though Eliezer had no longer any reason to await Rebeccah's completing her task of watering the camels seeing she had already done much more than he had stipulated in his prayer, he kept his peace. One of the reasons he waited before enquiring from her about who she was may have been that he wanted to test whether she would indeed complete the onerous task of drawing water for all the ten camels as she had promised to do, or if she would tire in the process and carry out less than she had promised. As soon as she completed watering all the camels he gave her the jewelry intended for Isaac's bride.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>והאיש משתאה, the word is derived from Isaiah 6,11 תשאה שממה, and the letter ת is similar to the letter ת in the word ישתבח which is derived from שבח, or the ת in the word וישתמר in the phrase וישתמר חוקות עמדי, which is derived from the root שמר, (compare Micah 6,16). Here the word משתאה means the same as משתומם, being amazed at this girl volunteering that she would also draw water for his camels. From these words of her he understood that G’d had heard his prayer. Commentators who understand the word משתאה as being related to שתייה, drink, are in error. Such an interpretation is impossible, seeing that the letter א in that word cannot be related to שתייה at all. Furthermore, Rivkah had not mentioned anything about watering the camels until after he himself had finished drinking already. At that point Eliezer began to wonder.

              <p>משתאה WAS WONDERING — The word really has the idea of being waste and desolate, as (Isaiah 6:11) “Until cities be waste (שאו) and the land become utterly desolate תשאה.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>משתאה means he was astonished and perplexed, because he saw that what he had said was nearly successful only that he did not know whether she belonged to Abraham’s family or not. Do not be puzzled by the ת in the word משתאה for you will find no word (verb) whose first root letter is ש where, when it is used in the Hithpael, the ת of the Hithpael-prefix does not come between the first two letters of the root, as e.g. משתאה (here) and (Isaiah 59:15) משתולל of the same root as שולל, and (Isaiah 59:16) וישתומם of the same root as שממה and (Micha 6:16) “For the statutes of Omri are kept (וישתמר )” from the same root as וישמר —so, also, here משתאה is of the same root as תשאה. Now, just as you find the expression שמם (which really means waste and desolate) applied to a person who is perplexed and speechless (with amazement) and sunk in deep thought (about what is happening) — e. g., (Job 18:20) “They that come after shall be astonished (נשמו) at his day”, and (Jeremiah 2:12) “Be astonished (שומו) ye heavens”, and (Daniel 4:16) “He was appalled אשתומם for a time” — so too you may explain the expression שאה (which also really means waste and desolate) in all its verbal or noun forms as referring to a person who is perplexed and sunk deep in thought. Onkelos translates it in the sense of lingering — “the man lingered” — i. e. he wailed, standing on one spot, to see “whether God had made his journey prosperous”. But one should not read in the Targum שתי in place of שהי, as the Targum of משתאה, (as evidently some versions of the Targum read), for the word משתאה certainly does not mean drinking, for א has no place in the Hebrew words which mean drinking root (שתה).</p>

(Since he saw the water rise for her, he realized she must be exceptionally righteous.)   “Please allow me to sip a little water from your jug” – [just] one sip.  “She said: Drink, my lord, and she hastened to lower her pitcher into her hand, and she gave him to drink” (Genesis 24:18).   “When she had finished giving him to drink, she said: I will draw for your camels also, until they have finished drinking” (Genesis 24:19).  “She hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels” (Genesis 24:20).  “The man was astonished at her; he was silent, to know whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not” (Genesis 24:21).  “The man was astonished at her…” – Rabbi Yoḥanan of Tzippori said: He was squinting (To see her more clearly.)  and looking at her [to see] if “the Lord had made [his journey] successful.”  “When the camels concluded drinking, the man took a gold nose ring whose weight was one half shekel, and two bracelets to put on her hands, whose weight was ten gold shekels” (Genesis 24:22).  “When the camels concluded drinking, [the man] took…” – Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Yosef: There was a precious stone in it that weighed half a shekel.  “And two bracelets to put on her hands” – corresponding to the two tablets [of the Ten Commandments]. “Whose weight was ten gold shekels” – corresponding to the Ten Commandments.  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night?” (Genesis 24:23).  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. [Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night [lalin]?]” – a stay for one night.  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka, whom she bore to Naḥor” (Genesis 24:24).  “She said to him: Both straw and feed is plentiful with us, as well as room for lodging” (Genesis 24:25).  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka…as well as room for lodging [lalun]” – to lodge for several nights. (Although he asked her about staying over for one night, she replied that he could stay for many nights.)  “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” (Genesis 24:26).   “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” – from here we learn that one should express thanks [to God] for good tidings.  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness and His truth from my master; I, the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master’s brethren” (Genesis 24:27).  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness…” – from the fact that the path was miraculously shortened, I knew that “the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master's brethren.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Let us examine a few more details of this story. Why did Eliezer have to describe his seniority in Abraham's household to the point where he said that his master had entrusted all his belonging to him? Why did the Torah keep repeating his status as עבד, &quot;slave?&quot; Why did the Torah later (24,21) describe Eliezer as האיש, an appellation hardly appropriate for an עבד? Still later, the Torah speaks of Laban running towards האיש; Rebeccah tells about what האיש has said to her. When Eliezer enters the house of Bethuel and Laban he is described as האיש, whereas as soon as he sits at the table he introduces himself as Abraham's slave, עבד. This, of course, is no problem seeing that Eliezer is Abraham's slave, and the Torah has repeatedly referred to him as such. The puzzling thing is that even after he handed out all the silver and golden trinkets, he is described as עבד; why would Laban ask Rebeccah if she wanted to go עם האיש הזה, thus elevating his status at the very moment when he harbored ill will against Eliezer? Immediately afterwards, when Rebeccah and Eliezer depart, Eliezer is again described as עבד, although Rebeccah and her handmaids are reported as following האיש. Once Isaac has been sighted Rebeccah is described as addressing the עבד. How could Laban address Eliezer with the words: בוא ברוך ה' &quot;Enter the one blesssed by the Lord,&quot; when we know that every עבד is cursed since the time Noach cursed Canaan? This was the reason why Abraham did not want Isaac to marry Eliezer's daughter. He did not want to become involved with a tribe that was accursedץ When we said earlier (page 142) that Laban's blessing had the power to eventually help Esau's descendants to switch from being cursed to becoming blessed, where did Laban get that power from? Another difficulty is the expression in 24,31 where Laban claims to have cleared the house, (of idols, according to Bereshit Rabbah 60). If that were indeed so, Laban displayed a spiritual level that is hard to credit. Whence did he attain that spiritual level? Why did Eliezer reverse the sequence of events when describing his placing the bracelets on Rebeccah before he knew who she was (compare 24,22 with 24,47)? The other problem we have to deal with is the statement in Chullin 95 we have quoted, classifying Eliezer's &quot;test&quot; of Rebeccah as the only such kind of test that is admissible for Jews. Tossaphot, Chullin 95 raise the question that according to a view expressed in Sanhedrin 56 it is not only Jews who are forbidden to practise ניחוש. The answer given is that Eliezer did not rely on ניחוש, and did not give the jewelry to Rebeccah until he had found out that she was from Abraham's family. According to this view we would have to disregard the Torah's first report of that event and accept the version Eliezer told in Bethuel's house. If that is so, why does the Torah seem to mislead us and create the impression that Eliezer relied exclusively on ניחוש? Besides, since Eliezer obviously accepted the word of a stranger, and presumably a minor at that, at face value, how can one claim that he did not rely primarily on ניחוש? Was there any proof that this girl would agree to marry a man she had never seen and who lived a long way from her home and family? Why then did Eliezer give Rebeccah the jewelry except that he believed in ניחוש?</p>

              <p>ויצא משה לקראת חתנו, Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, etc. Seeing that Yitro had pleaded that Moses welcome either his wife or his sons or both, the Torah is at pains to tell us that Moses considered Yitro as deserving to be welcomed by him in his own right, hence the emphasis on לקראת חתנו. Perhaps Moses even went so far as to demonstrate this point by going only to Yitro's tent at this point, ignoring his wife and children till somewhat later. Mechilta makes the additional point that seeing that Moses prostrated himself in front of Yitro this is proof that he went out in order to honour Yitro. Our sages say that Moses honoured Yitro greatly. If the Torah had not stressed that Moses went to meet his father-in-law, how would I have known that he did not go out in order to welcome his wife and sons specifically?</p>

              </summary>
              <p>וישתחו וישק לו, He prostrated himself and kissed him, etc. Our rabbis in the Mechilta say that it was not clear who prostrated himself before whom and who kissed whom. When the Torah wrote איש in &quot;they asked each other how they were,&quot; it became clear that Moses prostrated himself as he qualified for the description איש. The fact that the Torah does not mention that two people prostrated themselves makes it plain that only one of the two prostrated himself before the other. Should you argue that Yitro too has been referred to as איש in Exodus 2,21 where Moses is reported as agreeing to stay with Yitro, there is a subtle difference when Moses is called איש and when Yitro is called איש. Let me first explain the precise nature of the title איש, seeing that every male adult is called איש, if only to distinguish him from his female mate. We even find the term איש applied to animals such as in Genesis 7,2 where the Torah speaks of the pure animals which Noach is to take into the ark with him. The meaning of the word איש undergoes a change when it is used together with the name of the person concerned. In such instances it describes that person as someone of breeding and nobility. We find an example of the word איש or אנשים being used as a complimentary description in Numbers 13,3 where the people whom Moses had selected as spies were described as all being אנשים after we had already been told their names. On the other hand, when the word איש is used in lieu of a name it does not denote exceptional qualities such as Genesis 37,15 the man who found Joseph unable to locate his brothers in Shechem. The same applies in Genesis 24,21 where Eliezer is referred to as האיש. We are told in Bamidbar Rabbah 16, that the use of the word אנשים is complimentary only when the actual names of these people are recorded also. When G'd asked Bileam who the אנשים were who had come to him that night, (Numbers 22,9), clearly no compliment was intended. On the other hand, in Exodus 11,3, when Moses is described as האיש משה גדול מאד the word האיש is clearly highly complimentary. The same is true even of Exodus 32,23 when the mixed multitude refer to the fact that Moses had not returned from the Mountain. These people described Moses as the most perfect human being they had ever encountered. In the case of Yitro we do not find that the word איש is applied to him by the Torah in conjunction with his name, only in lieu of his name. When he is referred to in that context, the word האיש, (i.e. a pronoun) has neither a complimentary nor a derogatary meaning. The word is simply one used to describe a male. </p>

              <p>HALAKHAH: Rebbi Isaac said, the Torah uses any expression. And the man looked confidently at her (Gen. 24:21.) . “Any amphora which contains two seah. (Mishnah Terumot 10:8.) ” “If they are fearful. (Both Bible and Mishnah are finite texts and do exhaust the entire Hebrew vocabulary known at their times. Therefore it is not astonishing that occasionally one finds hapax legomena or at least uncommon expressions used in these texts. The use of שאה in the biblical text is hapax. In later texts, the root means “destruction”. The word usually is interpreted as a collateral form of שעה, but since the linguistic background of Genesis is the Accadic of the Patriarchs it may be Accadic šeū “to see” read as ש1א7א instead of ש4א7א, and therefore represents archaic Hebrew. A clay amphora as mentioned in Mishnah Terumot usually is חָבִית. The root of the uncommon word גָּרָב is the same as the biblical word (Lev. 21:20) “to be bone dry”, but the meaning is totally different. Similarly, in our Mishnah the expression צוֹדֶה does not mean “to hunt” but “to be afraid of an ambush”, comparable to Biblical צָדָה (Ex. 21:12, 1S 24:12) “to intend murder”, Arabic צדּי “to corrode (metal)”. Cf. Responsa Rashba, vol. 1, #523.) ”</p>

He then asked her about her family status, and when told that she was member of Avraham’s family he gave here the jewelry as a gift. The Torah abbreviated somewhat in its report of what happened, something that is not unusual. That this is so is clear from the sequence of events Eliezer described during the meal, when he filled in the words that have been omitted here. Even here, (contrary to the way some people interpret our verse) the Torah did not write that he gave her the jewelry before having established her family status.</p>

              <p>ויקח האיש נזם זהב בקע משקלו ושני צמידים, “the man took a golden nose-ring weighing a beka and two bracelets, etc.” Why did the Torah need to tell us the weight of these pieces of jewelry? We are dealing with an allusion to the fact that eventually Rivkah’s descendants, i.e. the generation who would contribute to the building of the Tabernacle in terms of shekalim. In Exodus 35,26 the Torah speaks of the weight of these shekalim also in terms of בקע לגולגולת, one “beka per person.” When the Jewish people received the two tablets with the Ten Commandments you will find that these comprised 172 words. This corresponds to the numerical value of the letters in the word בקע. This corresponds to what we read here ושני צמידים על ידיה עשרה זהב משקלם. The words עשרה זהב are an allusion to the Ten Commandments. We may also perceive the word שקל as an acronym describing אש קול, i.e. the ingredients most prominent during the revelation of G-d at Mount Sinai. We were told that on that occasion מן השמים השמיעך את קולו ליסרך ועל הארץ הראך את אשו הגדולה, “from the Heavens he let you hear His powerful voice, and on earth He showed you His great fire“ (Deut. 4,36). This also leads us to examine the amount of shekels offered by Haman in order to secure permission from King Achashverosh to do to the Jewish people as he saw fit. He offered 10,000 talents of silver, or 600,000 shekels. (compare Esther 3,9) It was his plan to neutralise the 600,000 shekels the Jews had contributed at the time for the sockets of the Holy Tabernacle and to deprive them of any merit they might have accumulated due to that donation. In short, Haman wanted to neutralise the accumulated merit of the people who had embraced the Torah at Mount Sinai. He wanted to annul what had been acquired with fire and sound. This is what has been hinted at here in Eliezer’s prayer (verse 27) when he said: 'אנכי בדרך נחני ה’, “I was on the way when G-d guided me, etc.” He meant that the merit of the “אנכי” which the Jewish people would accept in the future was active on his behalf at the time he stood by the well. All the details of what was happening with Rivkah at this time foreshadowed events of the future involving her offspring. Similarly, all that happened to the servant of Avraham on this mission foreshadowed events in Jewish history of the future when that people was in the desert.  Just as an angel had been at his side through the efficacy of Avraham’s prayer who had said that “G-d will send His angel ahead,” so it happened to Avraham’s descendants in the desert. Seeing that the angel in question was not a regular natural phenomenon but one of the disembodied spiritual creatures, so the angel who accompanied the Jewish people was such a disembodied spiritual force who had been emanated by the merit of Avraham. This was whom the Torah had in mind when it quoted G-d as telling Moses in Exodus 23,20 הנה אנכי שולח מלאך לפניך. “Here I am about to send an angel ahead of you.” Just as Avraham in our chapter referred to this divine force as מלאכו, “His angel,” so G-d referred to the same divine force as מלאכי, “My angel,” (not just any מלאך, angel, in Exodus 23,23). Just as the waters had risen towards Rivkah, so the waters rose towards her “children” in the desert as we explained. The servant also alluded to such future developments when presenting her with the jewelry mentioned in our chapter. This mission was carried out by a trusted servant, i.e. Eliezer. The Jewish people in the desert were led by G-d’s trusted servant Moses. When the Torah wrote in this chapter that Eliezer had been equipped with all the “good” of his master Avraham, the Torah, in a parallel reference, tells us that G-d equipped Moses for his task by equipping him with all ‘His goodness.” This is what is meant by Exodus 33,19 “אני אעביר כל טובי על פניך, “I will let all My goodness pass before you.” Just as Eliezer gave gifts to Rivkah not only at the well but also in her father’s house (verse 53), so the Jewish people who received the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai again received the gift of a covenant shortly before they entered the Holy Land (Deut. 28,69). At that time many commandments which were applicable in Eretz Yisrael were revealed for the first time in detail. This reflects the statement of our sages in Gittin 60 that “the Torah was given to the Jewish people in individual scrolls.” The sages meant that although Moses had received all 613 commandments while he was on Mount Sinai in the first year of their wanderings, he did not teach all of these commandments to the people at once. Just as the story of Rivkah and Eliezer at the well has been repeated in the Torah and the servant relates all that happened to him at the well, so Moses repeated many parts of the events the Jewish people experienced during their trek through the desert once more in the Book of Deuteronomy. Also, the Jewish people received both the first and the second set of Tablets.</p>

This verse omits the deed for it should have said: “And the man took a golden ring and put it upon her nose (So it says in Verse 47 here.)  and two bracelets upon her hands.” Therefore I say that the interpretation of the verse is as follows: And the man took a golden ring and two bracelets which would be upon her hands, and he said to her, Whose daughter art thou? (Verse 23 here.)  And after she had told him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, (Verse 24 here.)  he put the ring upon her nose and the bracelets upon her hands, as he told them. (In Verse 47 here. He first asked her who she was, and then he gave her the presents. This interpretation differs from Rashi (in Verse 23) who says that after he had given her the presents, he asked her whose daughter she was, for he was confident that, on account of Abraham’s merit, G-d would make his journey successful. Later, however, in Verse 47, when he recounted the story, he changed the sequence of the two events so that they should not sense the inconsistency and say, “How could you give her anything when you did not know who she was?”)  Here, however, Scripture omits the actual giving, and similarly in many places.</p>

              <p>ויקח. Es steht noch nicht, daß er es ihr gegeben. In seiner Erzählung, V. 47, sagt er auch, daß er ihr dies Geschmeide erst, nachdem sie ihn mit ihrer Familie bekannt gemacht, gegeben habe. Allein er hielt es doch jetzt bereits für gut, es hervorzunehmen und etwas von dem Reichtum blicken zu lassen, den er bei sich führte. Er wollte ja jetzt auch um Aufnahme in das Haus bitten. Elieser kannte die Welt, jedenfalls die aramäische Welt, sonst wäre ihm ja גמילות חסד nicht als etwas so Charakteristisches und Charakterisierendes erschienen. Um Aufnahme für zehn Kamele und die dazu gehörigen Leute zu finden, dazu gehört nicht bloß eine abrahamitische Tochter, dazu gehört ein ganzes abrahamitisches Haus. Das Mädchen war eine Perle an Menschenfreundlichkeit, allein wer weiß, ob nicht in unedler Fassung. Jedenfalls hielt Elieser vor der Frage nach ihrem Hause und der Möglichkeit, dort Aufnahme zu finden, es nicht für überflüssig, etwas Geld blicken zu lassen. Wer weiß auch, ob Rebekka als zartfühlende Tochter, die den Geist ihres das Hausregiment führenden Bruders sehr wohl kannte, der schwerlich für eine Anzahl bloßer Knechte mit Kamelen ein freundliches Willkommen gehabt hätte, ihren Namen gesagt haben würde, wenn sie in Eliesers Händen nicht etwas hätte blinken gesehen, was, freilich nicht für sie, doch für den Genius ihres Hauses eine größere Anziehungskraft als die Gelegenheit auszuübender Menschenfreundlichkeit gehabt! Daß er bei der Erzählung im Hause ihrer Eltern diesen Umstand umging und einfach die Geschenke nach ihrer Auskunft über ihre Familie erscheinen lässt, ist wieder eine Feinheit, die überhaupt Eliesers Benehmen und Reden charakterisiert.</p>

The servant initially removed the ornaments from his bag, then asked her for her identity, and only upon receiving a satisfactory answer did he give her the ring and bracelets.

              <p>“The man took a nose-ring weighing a half shekel, and two gold bands for her arms, ten shekels in weight” [24:22]. Eliezer took a gold nose-ring and two gold bands for her hands, ten shekels in weight. Hizkuni writes. It is written in the verse, “and he took” [24:22]. This means, Eliezer prepared himself and took all of this in his hand and wanted to give it to the maiden. That is why it is not written, and he gave to the maiden. He did not give it to the maiden, but asked her first, “whose daughter are you?” [24:23]. This means, whose daughter are you? He first wanted to know who she was. Another explanation is that Eliezer first gave the maiden, before he asked the maiden, whose are you, in the hope that he would acquire a reputation that he was rich. However, later Eliezer gave the news to Bethuel and Laban, Eliezer did not want to say that he first gave the jewelry to Rebecca before he asked. That is, he said: I asked about her father and mother and for the sake of their honor, I gave the jewelry to Rebecca. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:22.)  That is to say, he said: I asked about her father and mother, and for their honor I gave the jewelry to Rebecca. Rashi writes. He first gave her, since Eliezer relied on the merit of Abraham and that is why he gave her a gold nose-ring, weighing a half shekel. This was an allusion to Israel, each of whom would give a half shekel. The two bracelets allude to the two tablets that Israel would receive from the Holy One. Ten gulden in weight alludes to the Ten Commandments from God, that is to say, the Ten Statements. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:22–23.) </p>

            <summary>The commentary from Shulchan Shel Arba 1:39 discusses the significance of reciting 100 blessings each day, with each blessing being equivalent to ten pieces of gold, symbolizing the inclusion of the 10 sefirot in each blessing. The practice of reciting 100 blessings daily was instituted by King David to repair the loss of 100 lives, and is emphasized in the Torah and Psalms. On Shabbat, when the Amidah only contains seven blessings, extra blessings can be fulfilled through enjoying aromatic herbs and fruits. In contrast, Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 38:6 explains the legal implications of betrothal with conditions, such as retroactive effect if the conditions are fulfilled and the voiding of betrothal if conditions are not met within a specified time frame.</summary>

              <p>If he gave her a Prutah and said to her “Be betrothed to me with this on the condition that I will give you a maneh.” (Originally the shekel was a unit of weight for means of payment in gold and silver. In the third millenium BCE one finds this unit of weight in Babylonia. Sixty Babylonian shekels were a maneh. When this system of coinage was introduced into Israel the maneh generally consisted of only 50 shekels. The shekel as a unit of weight for gold is first mentioned in Jewish sources in Genesis 24:22 and Joshua 7:21. In Genesis 23:16 one finds mention of the shekel as a unit of weight for silver.)  When the condition is fulfilled the betrothal will take effect retroactively even if he did not say “from now.” For anyone who says al menath it is as if he had said “from now.” Yet if she accepts betrothal from another before the conditions are fulfilled and afterwards the conditions were fulfilled, the betrothal of the second man is void. But if he said to her “on the condition that I will give to you a maneh within 30 days,” if he gave it to her within the thirty days behold it is a betrothal retroactively; if he did not give it within thirty days she is not betrothed, and if she accepts betrothal from another man during the thirty days she is betrothed but she is not betrothed (i.e., this is a pending situation.)  until thirty days. When the thirty days are completed if the conditions of the first man are not fulfilled the betrothal of the first man is cancelled and the betrothal of the latter is complete and she does not require a bill of divorce from the former. If the former fulfills his condition she does not require a bill of divorce from the latter.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>And you need to know that because the sages z”l said, “a bat kol went out and said that a cup of blessing is equal to forty pieces of gold, it is clear from this that each blessing of the hundred blessing equals ten pieces of gold.” (B. Hullin 87a. Since there are four blessings in birkat ha-mazon said over the cup of blessing – you do the math. This is also an allusion to the tradition that one said say at least a hundred blessings per day.)  And there’s support for this in the verse: “one ladle (kaf) of ten [shekels] of gold filled with incense,” (Nu 7:14.)  that is to say, every “one from Ka”F, (Ka”F is numerically equivalent to 100.)  which are the one hundred blessings equal to “ten gold [pieces].” And you will also find in another place, “esreh zahav mishkalam” – “ten gold shekels in weight” (Gen 24:22, the value of the gold armbands Eliezer gave Rebekah as a present after she gave his camels water at the well.)  to which armbands Scripture follows with the phrase “Then I bowed low in homage to the Lord and blessed the Lord.” (Gen 24:48, immediately preceded in 24:27 with “And I put the ring on her nose, and the bands on her arms,” i.e., the ten shekel gold bands, which are equal to one blessing.)  The reason why every blessing is equal to ten shekels of gold is to hint that it is possible to include the 10 sefirot in each and every blessing. And the reason for 100 blessings every day is their correspondence to the 10 sefirot, ten blessings for each and every sefirah. And this what is written, “And now, O Israel, what (mah) does the Lord your God demand of you.” (Dt 10:12.)  And our sages z”l said, “Don’t read mah – “what,” but rather me’ah –“a hundred,” (B. Menahot 43b.)  that is to say, “A hundred the Lord your God demands of you.” And there are 99 letters in this verse; adding the letter aleph makes it 100. (That is, adding an aleph to the word mah, making it me’ah, give the verse 100 letters. In his commentary to the Torah R. Bahya brings this interpretation as the sod – “the mystical interpretation” of Dt. 10:12.)  And we found in King David (peace upon him), who said, “The utterance of the man set on high [‘al],” (2 Sam 23:1. The Hebrew word ‘al is numerically equivalent to 100.)  because one hundred men of Israel a day used to die in that generation, and deeply moved by this, David instituted [tiken]100 blessings. (Midrash Tanhuma Korah 12. Tiken – “instituted” of course also has the connotation of tikkun – “repair,” as in the sense of a cosmic repair through blessings of a world diminished by the loss of 100 lives.)  He didn’t institute them per se, but rather re-established them, since they had been forgotten, and David came along and re-established them. (Ibid. According to this midrash, Moses originally established the blessings, and afterwards, whne they had been forgotten, David came along and re-established them, and after David’s era they were forgotten again until the sages of the Talmud re-established them (Chavel).)  And thus is written, “So [ki khen] shall the man who fears the Lord be blessed [yivorakh].” (Ps 128:4.)  The word yivorakh – “shall be blessed” is spelled without a vav, which means that by the numerical equivalent of K”I Khe”N – 100 – will the person who fears the Lord both bless and be blessed. (Lacking the vav, the Hebrew word can be read either actively as yivarekh – “he will bless,” or passively as yivorakh – “he will be blessed.”)  Therefore a person needs to recite 100 blessings and fulfill them each day. And on Shabbat, when it is not possible because the Amidah for Shabbat contains only seven blessings, as it is written, “I praise You seven times on theday,” (Ps 119:164.)  the day which is well-known and special, namely, Shabbat, our sages z”l already said, “one completes them with aromatic herbs and fancy fruits.” (B. Menahot 43b, i.e., one enjoys lots of extra snacks and aromas that require blessings to make up for the shortage of blessings.)  </p>

              <p>“The people began to engage in harlotry with the daughters of Moav” – come and see what is written upon their exodus from Egypt: “Speak to the children of Israel, and they will return and encamp before Pi HaḤirot” (Exodus 14:2).What is Pi HaḤirot? It is a place designated for harlotry. Because they conducted themselves chastely, it was called Pi HaḤirot. (Harlotry is not mentioned explicitly, but rather ḥirot, an allusion to ḥerut, freedom.)  But these, who abandoned themselves to the men, (The Etz Yosef writes that this should read &quot;women&quot; instead of &quot;men.&quot;)  it is written “the people began to engage in harlotry [with the daughters of Moav].”  “The people began” – every place that it says “the people,” it is an expression of denigration, but everywhere that it says “Israel,” it is an expression of praise. “The people were as complainers” (Numbers 11:1); “the people spoke against God and against Moses” (Numbers 21:5); “the people wept that night” (Numbers 14:1); “until when will this people scorn Me?” (Numbers 14:11); “Moses saw the people, that it was exposed” (Exodus 32:25); “the people assembled around Aaron” (Exodus 32:1), and likewise, all of them.  “The people began to engage in harlotry” – cast a staff into the air, it falls on its place of origin. The one who began with harlotry initially, ultimately completed it. Their mothers began with lewdness. (Lot and his daughter were the ancestors of Moav (Genesis 19:30–37).)  “The elder said to the younger…let us give our father wine to drink, and we will lie…it was the next day and the elder said to the younger: Behold, I lay last night…” (Genesis 19:31–32, 34). Her sister taught her; that is why the verse spared the younger, and did not state what she had done explicitly, but rather, “she lay with him” (Genesis 19:35). But regarding the elder it is written: “She lay with her father.” She who began with harlotry initially, her daughters completed the task after her; “to engage in harlotry with the daughters of Moav.&quot;  “They invited the people to the offerings of their gods, and the people ate, and prostrated themselves to their gods” (Numbers 25:2).  “They invited the people to the offerings of their gods” – they went in accordance with his (Bilam’s.)  counsel, as it is stated: “Behold, they were for the children of Israel, by the word of Bilam, to commit trespass against the Lord” (Numbers 31:16). They crafted curtains for them and seated harlots in them and in their hands were all types of precious vessels. An elderly woman would sit outside and watch over the young woman, who was inside the shop. When an Israelite would pass to purchase an object in the  market, the elderly woman would say to him: 'Young man, do you not want linen garments from Beit She’an?' She would show him and say: 'Go inside and you will see fine objects.’ The elderly woman would say for more, (A more expensive price.)  and the young woman for less. From that point on, the young woman would say: 'You are like a member of the household, choose for yourself.' There was a bottle of wine with her, and the wine of gentiles had not yet been prohibited. A young woman would come out adorned and perfumed and seduce him. She would say to him: 'Why is it that we love you and you hate us? Take this vessel for yourself at no cost. Is it not that “we are all the children of one man” (Genesis 42:11), the sons of Teraḥ, father of Abraham? You do not wish to eat from our slaughter and from our cooking, we have calves and roosters; slaughter in accordance with your mitzva and eat.' Immediately, she would give him wine to drink and Satan was inflamed within him, and he strayed after her, as it is stated: “Harlotry, wine and new wine capture the heart” (Hosea 4:11).  Some say: Bilam commanded them not to give them to drink, so they would not be judges as those intoxicated with wine, but rather as intentional sinners. When he would proposition her, she would say to him: ‘I will not submit to you until you slaughter this to Peor, and prostrate yourself to it.’ He would say: ‘To idolatry I do not prostrate myself.’ She would say to him: ‘You are doing nothing more than exposing yourself.’ (Worship to Peor was undertaken by means of defecating before it.)  He strayed after her and did so. This is what the Sages said: One who defecates to Baal Peor, that is its worship, as it is stated: “They prostrated themselves to their gods.” (After having worshiped Peor by defacating, they then proceeded also to bow down to Peor.)  “Israel adhered to Baal Peor, and the wrath of the Lord was enflamed against Israel” (Numbers 25:3).  “Israel adhered [vayitzamed] to Baal Peor” – initially, they would enter discreetly, but ultimately, they would enter in pairs [tzemidim], as in a yoke [tzemed] of cattle. Alternatively, like a person who is constant [tzamid] in his labor. Vayitzamed – like “bracelets [tzmidim] on her hands” (Genesis 24:22). Rabbi Levi said: This is a harsher decree than the calf, as regarding the calf it is written: “Remove the gold rings” (Exodus 32:2), but here, vayitzamed, like bracelets. (There they donated earrings for idolatry, but here, bracelets, which are larger.)  At the calf, three thousand fell, but here, twenty-four thousand.  “The Lord said to Moses: Take all the leaders of the people, and hang them for the Lord opposite the sun, and the enflamed wrath of the Lord will be withdrawn from Israel” (Numbers 25:4).  “The Lord said to Moses: Take all the leaders of the people, and hang them” – Rabbi Yudan said they hanged the leaders of the people because they did not reprove the people. Rabbi Neḥemya said: He did not hang the leaders of the people, but rather, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: 'Empanel for them heads of the Sanhedrin, and they will judge all those who went to Peor.' (“Hang them” means: Have the leaders of the people hang the sinners.)  He said: 'Who will inform them?' He said to him: ‘I will publicize them. Anyone who erred, the cloud will move from above him and the sun will shine upon him in the midst of the congregation. Everyone will know who erred and will hang him.’ Know that it is so: “So Moses said to Israel's officials: Each of you slay those of his men [who attached themselves to Baal Peor]” (Numbers 25:5).</p>

Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night?” (Genesis 24:23).  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. [Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night [lalin]?]” – a stay for one night.  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka, whom she bore to Naḥor” (Genesis 24:24).  “She said to him: Both straw and feed is plentiful with us, as well as room for lodging” (Genesis 24:25).  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka…as well as room for lodging [lalun]” – to lodge for several nights. (Although he asked her about staying over for one night, she replied that he could stay for many nights.)  “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” (Genesis 24:26).   “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” – from here we learn that one should express thanks [to God] for good tidings.  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness and His truth from my master; I, the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master’s brethren” (Genesis 24:27).  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness…” – from the fact that the path was miraculously shortened, I knew that “the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master's brethren.”</p>

Did I not say to you that this one is close but far and that one is far but close?’ At that moment, Rabbi Yehoshua said: ‘Happy are you Israel that you are all wise, from your old to your young.’ (Rabbi Yehoshua admitted that he was bested by the man in the field and by the boy, and he praised the Jewish people for their great wisdom.)  He went on from there and found a certain child with a covered vessel in his hand. He said to him: ‘What do you have in your hand, covered within this vessel?’ He said: ‘Had my mother wanted you to know what I have with me, she would have not told me to cover it.’ He went on from there and found a certain child and said to him: ‘What is the quality of the water of this city?’ He said to him: ‘Why do you care? The garlic and the onions are plentiful.’ When he entered the city, he found a girl standing and filling [her pitcher] from the spring. He said to her: ‘Give me water to drink.’ She said to him: ‘To you and to your donkey.’ After he drank and turned to go, he said to her: ‘My daughter, you have acted like Rebecca.’ She said to him: ‘I have acted like Rebecca, but you have not acted like Eliezer.’ (After Rebecca drew water for the servant of Abraham (identified by the Sages as Eliezer), and for his camels, he gave her jewelry (Genesis 24:22).)  It is taught: One leaves a portion from food cooked in a pot, but one does not leave a portion from food cooked in a stew pot. (A similar statement in Eruvin 53 reads: “One does not leave a portion from the pot but one leaves a portion from the plate.” Rashi explains that the waiter was expected to serve all the food that was cooked, but participants at the meal were expected to leave over some of the food that was served. These leftovers would be eaten by the waiter.)  There was an incident where Rabbi Yehoshua was hosted by a widowed woman. The first day she brought him a cooked item and he ate it and did not leave a portion for her. The second day she brought him a cooked item and he ate it and did not leave a portion for her. On the third day, she oversalted a cooked dish of pounded grain. After Rabbi Yehoshua tasted it, he withdrew his hand from it. She said to him: ‘Rabbi, why did you withdraw your hand from this pounded grain?’ He said to her: ‘I already ate earlier in the day.’ She said to him: ‘If you ate earlier in the day, why did you not mimimize the bread, just as you minimized this pounded grain? Perhaps you left a portion. From the two cooked items that you ate, why did you not leave a portion like you did from this pounded grain?’ At that moment, Rabbi Yehoshua said: ‘In all my days, no person has ever gotten the best of me except for this widow, a young girl, and those children, to realize what is stated: “Great among the nations,” great in intellect.</p>

              <p>As far as the angel was concerned it was clear already at this point that the mission was successful, that Rebeccah was intended by Heaven to become the wife of Isaac, and that therefore she was entitled to receive the nose-ring, bracelets etc. This is why the Torah reports that &quot;he&quot; (האיש) &quot;took out&quot; these pieces of jewelry on her hands&quot; (24,22). The reason the Torah omits to mention &quot;he placed,&quot; is because from Mattatron's point of view, they were as if already on her hands, although in actual fact Eliezer here on earth is not mentioned as having placed them on her hands and on her nose until after he had ascertained who the girl was. This act is reported only in 24,47. </p>

            <summary>Ibn Ezra explains that certain Hebrew nouns only appear in plural or singular forms, such as &quot;virginity&quot; and &quot;children.&quot; Rabbeinu Bahya discusses how setting aside money for a sacrifice already sanctifies it, and describes various ornaments mentioned in the Bible. Rashi explains the term &quot;sufficiency&quot; and Ibn Ezra interprets a verse from Genesis as a pluperfect. Chizkuni analyzes the repetition of the word &quot;year&quot; in relation to Sarah's age and beauty, comparing it to the reporting of Yishmael's death.</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>
                <h4>Chizkuni, Genesis 23:1:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>מאה שנה, “one hundred years;” Rashi comments on the reason why the word: שנה, “year,” is repeated here three times, when the Torah could have simply written: מאה עשרים ושבע שנה, “one hundred and twenty seven years.” He suggests that the Torah wished us to know that Sarah was as free from sin at a hundred as she had been at twenty, and that she was as beautiful at twenty as she had been at seven. This, of course, raises the question why the Torah, in reporting the death of Yishmael at 137 years (Genesis, 25,32) used exactly the same formulation? We can answer this by pointing out that when reporting Sarah’s age, each group of years is reported separately, as an individual unit, whereas when reporting Yishmael’s age at death, the groups of years are introduced in the construct mode, i.e. מאת, not מאה, i.e. all the years had the same common factor. Not only that, but the Torah sums up her years once more with the words: שני חיי שרה, “the years of Sarah’s life,” i.e. all her years were earmarked by a common denominator. If, when Avraham’s death is reported our sages have seen fit to read something into the way his years are reported, although there too just as at the death of Yishmael we find the word מאת in the construct form, this can be accounted for by the word: ימי, “days of,” which are superfluous and therefore available for interpretation. (Genesis 25,7) Rashi also adds that Sarah was free from sin at twenty as if this was something exceptional; this sounds strange as at that time everyone was free from sin, i.e. not held accountable until the age of twenty? We must understand Rashi as if he had written: ”just as she was free from sin at 20, she remained free from sin until the end of her life. Accountability for sins at the age of 12 or 13 for females and males respectively, commenced only after the Torah had been given. [Our midrashim describe Yishmael as “innocent” when expelled by Sarah, as he was below 20 years of age. Ed.] Sarah had not required cosmetics at twenty anymore than she had required it at the age of seven. We know from Rivkah, who accepted jewelry at the age of three in order to enhance her appearance, that girls in those days felt the need to enhance their natural charms at an early age. (Compare Genesis 24,22) There is a Midrash in pessikta zutrata according to which the reference to her being one hundred as meaning that she was as beautiful at a hundred as she had been at twenty, whereas she was as free from sin at twenty as she had been at seven.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>[AND LAMECH SAID…] Note, this  (Verses 23 and 24. The reason is that I.E. understands verses 23 and 24 to be an attempt by Lamech to induce his wives to cohabit with him. However, verses 20 through 22 tell us that they in fact did so. Hence verses 23 and 24 must describe what happened before verses 20-22. Its meaning is that Lamech had already said to Adah and Zillah. Va-yomer is thus a pluperfect (Krinsky).)  should have appeared earlier. I have already noted two similar examples of this in my earlier comments. (See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 1:9.)  Three additional examples are: that the man took a golden ring (Gen. 24:22); (This is followed by: and said: Whose daughter art thou (Gen. 24:23). Now, would the servant give a golden ring to the girl before asking her who she was? Therefore Gen. 24:23 must be rendered: And he already said, Whose daughter art thou (Krinsky).)  And the Lord said unto Moses, say unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiff-necked people (Ex. 33:5); (This is preceded by: And when the people heard these evil tidings (v. 4). However, the evil tidings are reported in verse 5. Thus verse 5 should precede verse 4. Hence the meaning of And when the people heard (v. 4) is: and when the people had heard; i.e., when they heard the following, namely what is reported in the next verse (Meijler).)  and And I besought the Lord at that time (Deut. 3:23). (Cf. I.E.’s comment on Deut. 3:23. What is reported in this verse took place before Deut. 3:21, viz., And I commanded Joshua, etc. Moses besought God before he commanded Joshua not to fear the kings of Canaan. Hence Deut. 3:23 is to be rendered as And I had besought the Lord. Ibid. I. E.’s commentary.)  As to our verse, it is to be interpreted as our sages did. The rabbis tell us that Adah and Zillah were afraid to bear children because they feared that their offspring, who were the seventh generation from Cain, would die or be killed as punishment for Cain’s sin. Therefore Lamech said to them, “I am in truth the seventh generation (From Cain. However, in truth Lamech lied to them. He was the sixth and not the seventh generation from Cain (Filwarg).)  and if a man would wound me or a child bruise me, then I would kill them.” I have slain is used in place of I will slay. (Haragti is a perfect.)  Similar examples are: I will give (natati) (Literally, I gave.)  the price of the field (Gen. 23:13), and which I took out (According to I.E., I took (lakachti) means I will take.)  of the hand of the Amorite (Gen. 48:22). There are many similar instances. (The point is that the Bible occasionally uses a perfect in place of an imperfect.)  </p>

With this intention he went to the well, and desired the maidens to give him some water to drink: but while the others refused, on pretense that they wanted it all at home, and could spare none for him, one only of the company rebuked them for their peevish behavior towards the stranger; and said, What is there that you will ever communicate to anybody, who have not so much as given the man some water? She then offered him water in an obliging manner. And now he began to hope that his grand affair would succeed; but desiring still to know the truth, he commended her for her generosity and good nature, that she did not scruple to afford a sufficiency of water to those that wanted it, though it cost her some pains to draw it; and asked who were her parents, and wished them joy of such a daughter. &quot;And mayst thou be espoused,&quot; said he, &quot;to their satisfaction, into the family of an agreeable husband, and bring him legitimate children.&quot; Nor did she disdain to satisfy his inquiries, but told him her family. &quot;They,&quot; says she, &quot;call me Rebeka; my father was Bethuel, but he is dead; and Laban is my brother; and, together with my mother, takes care of all our family affairs, and is the guardian of my virginity.&quot; When the servant heard this, he was very glad at what had happened, and at what was told him, as perceiving that God had thus plainly directed his journey; and producing his bracelets, and some other ornaments which it was esteemed decent for virgins to wear, he gave them to the damsel, by way of acknowledgment, and as a reward for her kindness in giving him water to drink; saying, it was but just that she should have them, because she was so much more obliging than any of the rest. She desired also that he would come and lodge with them, since the approach of the night gave him not time to proceed farther. And producing his precious ornaments for women, he said he desired to trust them to none more safely than to such as she had shown herself to be; and that he believed he might guess at the humanity of her mother and brother, that they would not be displeased, from the virtue he found in her; for he would not be burdensome, but would pay the hire for his entertainment, and spend his own money. To which she replied, that he guessed right as to the humanity of her parents; but complained that he should think them so parsimonious as to take money, for that he should have all on free cost. But she said she would first inform her brother Laban, and, if he gave her leave, she would conduct him in.</p>

              <p>ויאמר, בת מי את, he said: “whose daughter are you?” He had asked this question before giving her anything, as is clear from when he repeats what took place before sharing any food with her family in verse 47 of this chapter. An alternate interpretation: the line: “the man took out a golden nose ring,” is to be understood literally; he did something completely appropriate as a reward for the girl’s having let him and his camels to drink, a task which had consumed time and effort. He also meant to show that he was a servant of a wealthy man. When telling her family at the dinner table what had transpired at the well, he added that he had first enquired from her about her family status; he did so in order to flatter the family, suggesting that he would not have given her such gifts before knowing that she was a member of Avraham’s family. נזם זהב, the translation of this word by the Targum here is different from the same word in Exodus 35,22. This word sometimes means a ring worn in the ear, other times a ring worn in the nose.</p>

              <p>ללין, this is a noun meaning: “a place that serves as shelter for the night.” He asked whether there was nearby an inn for travelers. (He did not ask for accommodation for his ten men and camels as a favour). The formulation ללין is parallel to the formulation לדין, and the noun ריב “quarrel,” from the root רוב, “to fight.” When used as a verb we find the formulation: וילן, “he stayed overnight.”</p>

              <p>בת מי את, הגידי, &quot;Whose daughter are you? Tell me, etc.&quot; The Torah lumps both these questions together to show that Eliezer did not entertain any doubts that the girl must belong to Abraham's family. Had he entertained such doubts he could not have enquired immediately about the chance of lodging in her parents' home until he had clarified who her parents were. He merely wanted to know her father's name. He added his enquiry about staying at her parents' overnight to emphasise that this had nothing to do with her father's name, that he was convinced G'd had guided him to the right family.</p>

              <p>ויאמר בת מי את, “he said: ’whose daughter are you?‘“ The true meaning of this verse is that the servant had asked this question already before he gave Rivkah the jewelry. It is quite inconceivable that Eliezer should have been handing out such expensive jewelry to a stranger he knew nothing about. This is not the only time that you find in this story that the Torah did not report it in the exact sequence in which the events occurred. You find proof that when Eliezer recounted in Bethuel’s house what had occurred, (24,47) he related that he gave her the jewelry after having ascertained who she was. In Leviticus 9,22 the Torah writes that Aaron raised his hands and they (Moses and Aaron) blessed the people, after which he (Aaron) descended from having performed the sin-offering.” The meaning there is clearly that Moses and Aaron blessed the people after Aaron had descended from the altar. Nonetheless, the Torah saw fit to describe this in a manner which could lead us to receive the wrong impression.</p>

              <p>ללין, ”for an overnight stay.” The word is a noun, as opposed to ללון which would be the verb from the same root. The meaning is that there is accommodation for a single night’s lodging. This is the way our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 60,6 interpret this word. Rivkah had changed the word and had said ללון, implying that Eliezer would be welcome for a more extended stay although he had inquired only if he could stay for a single night. She used the word in its infinitive which does not carry any connotation of a limited time.  The correct interpretation is that the word ללין is a transitive form of the verb, i.e. Eliezer asked whether lodging overnight could be provided in her father’s house. Whereas Eliezer had asked whether he and his entourage could be assigned a place in her father’s house to spend the night, Rivkah replied that he did not need to be assigned such a place but that he could choose where in her father’s house he wished to spend the night. By saying ללון, i.e. using the intransitive form of the word, Rivkah indicated that Eliezer would have the choice of a number of accommodations in her father’s house.</p>

              <p>?היש בית אביך מקום ללין, The meaning of the word ללין is a verbal mode meaning the same as להלין, “to provide lodging.” The letter י indicates the transitive conjugation hiphil. The word ללון by comparison which is in the simple conjugation (intransitive) kal, describes what the person enjoying the lodging does, i.e. spend the night. Both the enquiry and the response are the same, i.e. Rivkah answered the question asked, she did not answer obliquely, seeing that she used the verb “to lodge” in a different conjugation. After all, Eliezer had asked her both about lodging for the camels and lodging for himself and his men. It is possible to understand the exchange between Eliezer and Rivkah as meaning: “is there room in your father’s house to provide lodging,” a reference to the camels only, whereas Rivkah responds “not only is there room for the camels but there is also room for the men.” The author quotes Job 24,7 to show that the verb לון when used in the transitive mode ערום ילינו מבלי לבוש, “they will have to spend the night without clothing” also means the same as the intransitive conjugation ילונו.</p>

              <p>ללין, the word לין is a noun, just as the word ריב in Deuteronomy 25,1כי יהיה ריב בין אנשים , “when there is a quarrel between men, etc.” is a noun. It is a derivative of Genesis 31,36 וירב בלבן, he “(Yaakov) quarreled with Lavan.” The word דין is a similar noun derived  from דן אנכי in Genesis 15,14. לין is in a similar relationship to Genesis 32,14 וילן שם בלילה הוא, “he spent that night there.” (the night of the wrestling match with the angel on the far side of the river Yabbok) Rivkah’s answer גם מקום ללון  (as opposed to the word ללין in Eliezer’s enquiry) meant that there is room for you and your men’s bodies to spend the night with us. The formulation ללון is a verbal formulation just as in Genesis 31,35 לקום, where Rachel excuses herself for not rising in the presence of her father. It is also similar to the formulation (verbal infinitive) לשוב מצרימה “to return to Egypt” in Exodus 4,21. If Rivkah had said: גם מקום לכם, she would have had to continue with the word ללין instead of the word ללון. Whereas the word לנו used by Eliezer meant that he and his men would be prepared to spend the night where the camels spent it, the word ללון after the word עמנו, “with us,” which clearly refers to Rivkah and her family, i.e. accommodation designed for human beings. She therefore meant to say: “why would you need to spend the night at an inn? This is the correct meaning as understood by people who understand the nuances of the Holy Tongue, i.e. Hebrew as written in the Torah.

              <p>“Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night” [24:23]. Eliezer asked Rebecca: is there room in your father’s house to spend the night. That is why “to spend the night” is written with a yud. This means that Eliezer desired a place for one night. Rebecca responded with “a place to spend the night,” meaning to spend many nights. That is to say, for your sake you can stay for many nights. Therefore, to spend the night is written with a vav, that is to say, for many nights. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:23. The interpretation is based on Eliezer using the singular form of the term, while Rebecca uses the plural form)  Toldot Yizhak asks a question here. Eliezer asked for “a place to spend the night.” Is there a place in your house for us to spend the night? Rebecca responded: “there is also place to spend nights.” There is a house to spend the night and did not say, there is also a place for you to spend the night. This means, there is place to sleep for you for many nights. The explanation is that Rebecca thought to herself. How can I say that there will be place to sleep many nights? Perhaps my father will not want them to stay. This was a wise thing on her part. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:23.) </p>

              <p>[AND LAMECH SAID…] Note, this  (Verses 23 and 24. The reason is that I.E. understands verses 23 and 24 to be an attempt by Lamech to induce his wives to cohabit with him. However, verses 20 through 22 tell us that they in fact did so. Hence verses 23 and 24 must describe what happened before verses 20-22. Its meaning is that Lamech had already said to Adah and Zillah. Va-yomer is thus a pluperfect (Krinsky).)  should have appeared earlier. I have already noted two similar examples of this in my earlier comments. (See I.E.’s comment on Gen. 1:9.)  Three additional examples are: that the man took a golden ring (Gen. 24:22); (This is followed by: and said: Whose daughter art thou (Gen. 24:23). Now, would the servant give a golden ring to the girl before asking her who she was? Therefore Gen. 24:23 must be rendered: And he already said, Whose daughter art thou (Krinsky).)  And the Lord said unto Moses, say unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiff-necked people (Ex. 33:5); (This is preceded by: And when the people heard these evil tidings (v. 4). However, the evil tidings are reported in verse 5. Thus verse 5 should precede verse 4. Hence the meaning of And when the people heard (v. 4) is: and when the people had heard; i.e., when they heard the following, namely what is reported in the next verse (Meijler).)  and And I besought the Lord at that time (Deut. 3:23). (Cf. I.E.’s comment on Deut. 3:23. What is reported in this verse took place before Deut. 3:21, viz., And I commanded Joshua, etc. Moses besought God before he commanded Joshua not to fear the kings of Canaan. Hence Deut. 3:23 is to be rendered as And I had besought the Lord. Ibid. I. E.’s commentary.)  As to our verse, it is to be interpreted as our sages did. The rabbis tell us that Adah and Zillah were afraid to bear children because they feared that their offspring, who were the seventh generation from Cain, would die or be killed as punishment for Cain’s sin. Therefore Lamech said to them, “I am in truth the seventh generation (From Cain. However, in truth Lamech lied to them. He was the sixth and not the seventh generation from Cain (Filwarg).)  and if a man would wound me or a child bruise me, then I would kill them.” I have slain is used in place of I will slay. (Haragti is a perfect.)  Similar examples are: I will give (natati) (Literally, I gave.)  the price of the field (Gen. 23:13), and which I took out (According to I.E., I took (lakachti) means I will take.)  of the hand of the Amorite (Gen. 48:22). There are many similar instances. (The point is that the Bible occasionally uses a perfect in place of an imperfect.)  </p>

              <p>The point is linguistic, but the message is remarkable. In a few brief words, Rashi has summarised an existential truth about Jewish identity. To be a Jew is to travel. Judaism is a journey, not a destination. Even a place of rest, an encampment, is still called a journey. The patriarchs lived, not in houses but in tents. (Note that Lot, in Sodom, lived in a house (Gen. 19:2). So did Laban (Gen. 24:23).) </p>

It was the custom in those days to enumerate the father’s genealogy before that of the mother. When it came to other matters, girls tended to keep company and share intimacies with their mothers, as in verse 28 where Rivkah relates her encounter with Eliezer to her mother. [If she had not suddenly worn costly jewelry Lavan might not have become aware that something unusual had happened at the well. Ed.]

It had already been written, &quot;And Betu'el sired Rivkah&quot; (Gen. 22:23), and now she is described as &quot;of Paddan-aram, the sister to Laban the Arammian.&quot; This is to teach us that she was born among the misled, she did not follow their ways. Therefore it is written that she was the daughter of Betu'el, of Paddan-aram, and the sister of Laban, who were all wicked and evil doers; but she did good deeds and did not behave as they did.</p>

              <p>“The servant ran toward her, and he said: Please allow me to sip a little water from your jug” (Genesis 24:17).  “The servant ran toward her” – toward her good deeds. (Since he saw the water rise for her, he realized she must be exceptionally righteous.)   “Please allow me to sip a little water from your jug” – [just] one sip.  “She said: Drink, my lord, and she hastened to lower her pitcher into her hand, and she gave him to drink” (Genesis 24:18).   “When she had finished giving him to drink, she said: I will draw for your camels also, until they have finished drinking” (Genesis 24:19).  “She hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels” (Genesis 24:20).  “The man was astonished at her; he was silent, to know whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not” (Genesis 24:21).  “The man was astonished at her…” – Rabbi Yoḥanan of Tzippori said: He was squinting (To see her more clearly.)  and looking at her [to see] if “the Lord had made [his journey] successful.”  “When the camels concluded drinking, the man took a gold nose ring whose weight was one half shekel, and two bracelets to put on her hands, whose weight was ten gold shekels” (Genesis 24:22).  “When the camels concluded drinking, [the man] took…” – Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Yosef: There was a precious stone in it that weighed half a shekel.  “And two bracelets to put on her hands” – corresponding to the two tablets [of the Ten Commandments]. “Whose weight was ten gold shekels” – corresponding to the Ten Commandments.  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night?” (Genesis 24:23).  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. [Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night [lalin]?]” – a stay for one night.  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka, whom she bore to Naḥor” (Genesis 24:24).  “She said to him: Both straw and feed is plentiful with us, as well as room for lodging” (Genesis 24:25).  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka…as well as room for lodging [lalun]” – to lodge for several nights. (Although he asked her about staying over for one night, she replied that he could stay for many nights.)  “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” (Genesis 24:26).   “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” – from here we learn that one should express thanks [to God] for good tidings.  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness and His truth from my master; I, the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master’s brethren” (Genesis 24:27).  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness…” – from the fact that the path was miraculously shortened, I knew that “the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master's brethren.”</p>

The act of bowing involves touching one's face to the ground, while prostrating includes extending the hands and feet to fully touch the earth, symbolizing both spiritual and physical submission to God. The fulfillment of Eliezer's conditions for finding a wife for Isaac led him to bow and praise God for guiding him correctly.</summary>

According to our sages the former means touching one’s face to the ground, whereas the latter involves prostrating one’s body and stretching out with the arms and legs.

So begegnete das Volk der Aufforderung, die Bedeutung des Peßach seinen Kindern geistig zu vererben, durch קידה und השתחויה. (Schmot 12, 27) und stellte damit Geist und Leib dieser Erziehungsaufgabe zu Gebote. Ähnlich Mosche bei der ihm gewordenen höchsten Offenbarung des göttlichen Waltens (das. 34, 7). Auch hier beugt Elieser zuerst seinen Geist vor dem ihm hier so sichtbar hervorgetretenen geistigen Walten und Leiten göttlicher Vorsehung, und gab sich dann ganz derselben weiter hin. Er beugte seinen Geist vor dem allerhöchsten Geist, der in sein Herz geschaut und seinen Engel vor ihm hergesandt hatte.</p>

The former refers to a “definitive path, ‎way, one that was commonly known.” Surely no highway led ‎from Kiryat Arba to Aram Naharayim! We must assume therefore ‎that what Eliezer meant to convey by choosing this word ‎בדרך‎, is ‎not the route that led from Kiryat Arba to Aram Naharayim, but ‎the feeling that he progressed with unnatural speed to his goal, ‎or as the sages in Bereshit rabbah 60,6 say that Eliezer ‎covered a two week journey in a single day, so that he realized ‎that this miracle was proof that his mission would succeed. It was ‎clear to him therefore that the house that he was taken to must ‎be the house of Avraham’s family.‎</p>

We would then have to understand the word בדרך, as if he had said: “I was on this long and tedious journey, and here G-d brought me to this well in one fell swoop when I had only just set out.” This would also be the reason he emphasized his arrival היום in verse 42, as if to say: “I started out today and I arrived today.”</p>

              <p>חסד on the other hand, is the recognition that G’d has granted one loving kindness over and beyond what one could have expected based on one’s general conduct. In this instance G’d’s חסד was that not only did He make Eliezer meet a girl who was suitable for marriage to Yitzchok on the basis of her personal virtues, but beyond that she was also qualified through being a member of Avraham’s family. Eliezer attributed these favourable developments to the merits of his master, not to his own.</p>

This is why he used the plural formulation saying: achey adoni instead of the singular mode as he did when he recounted these events in verse 48 when he said bat achi adoni. Both formulations were accurate with a slight shift of emphasis. The author quotes Genesis 46,21 echi varosh (names of Binyamin’s sons) as a tool to help one remember these two constructions of the words achi and achey.

              <p>חסד ואמת. Was אהבה in der Gesinnung ist, das ist חסד in der Tat, אמת ist gewissermaßen ein beschränkender Beisatz. הסד ואמת ist eine solche Liebestat, in welcher doch der Wahrheit nicht zu nahe getreten wird. Des Menschen Liebe ist blind. Sie erfüllt des Geliebten Wünsche ohne Rücksicht auf den wahren Wert dieser Wünsche. Gottes Liebe ist הסד ואמת, sie erfüllt nur solche Wünsche, in denen das Wahre gewahrt ist, die wahrhaft zum Heile gereichen. So bei Jakob (Kap. 47, 29). Die Fürsorge für seine Bestattung ist das דoח, die Beachtung der Bedingung: aber nicht in Mizrajim, das אמת. So auch das von den Kundschaftern der Rahab zu Leistende (Jos. 2, 14) war ein חסד ואמת, eine bedingte Wohltat. אמת ist überall das Salz, die Klausel, daß in Erfüllung der Liebe das Wahre, die Hauptsache, nicht verloren gehe.</p>

              <p>So vielleicht auch hier. Die Verheiratung ihrer Kinder ist der höchste Wunsch der Eltern. Suchen sie die Erfüllung dieses Wunsches ohne Berücksichtigung des Wesentlichen — (ists nicht eine Tochter von abrahamitischer Gesinnung, so eine von ענר אשכל וממרא oder von ארם) — dann erstreben sie ein הסד ohne אמת. Abraham aber wünschte nur חסד mit אמת, und beides gewährte ihm Gott.</p>

              <p>אנכי בדרך וגו׳ Ohne so reinen, gewissenhaften, ganz in Abrahams Ab- und Ansichten eingehenden Sinn hatte Elieser eigentlich eine ganz leichte Aufgabe. Land und Familie Abrahams waren ja bekannt, und daß der Brautwerber für einen Sohn Abrahams, eines so berühmten reichen Mannes, irgendwo einen Korb bekommen sollte, war gar nicht zu denken. Allein Elieser war זקן ביתו ,עבד אברהם suchte ein Weib לעבד ד׳ ליצחק, da war um so größer die Gefahr, die Rechte nicht zu finden, je mehr er eines bereitwilligen Entgegenkommens wohl überall gewärtig sein konnte; daher glaubte er sich ganz der göttlichen Führung überlassen zu müssen. Und wie war die ihm geworden! Er war noch auf dem Wege — war noch gar nicht angekommen — und befand sich schon am Ziele! Darum gelobte er mit ברוך ד׳, auch weiter sich in dieser Angelegenheit nur ganz der Führung Gottes überlassen zu wollen.</p>

            <summary>Prayer is a process of elevating and sanctifying our inner thoughts and feelings, leading to a deeper connection with the Divine. Emeth, translated as truth, is associated with hesed, or lovingkindness, in the Bible, emphasizing that emeth is not an abstract concept but an ethical virtue to be practiced towards others.</summary>

                <h4>Man and God, Chapter 6 Emeth, the Concept of Truth 2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>That emeth means something quite different from the abstract and intellectual concept of truth becomes quite clear as one compares the numerous biblical passages in which emeth is associated with hesed, love (or lovingkindness). It is most unlikely that what Abraham’s servant said to Rebekah’s family about the God of his master was that He did not forsake “His mercy (hesed) and His truth (emeth) toward my master.” What indeed could that truth be and what bearing may it have on guiding the servant to the place for which he set out? Similarly, when the servant requested the decision of the family in his suit on behalf of his master’s son, he could not have said to them: “And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master.” (Gen. 24:27, 48.)  What on earth could dealing truly with someone mean? And especially, what could it mean in the situation in which the expression was used by Abraham’s servant? What the servant really said was: “And now if you are [willing] to do hesed and emeth with my master.” Had Jacob really prayed: “I am not worthy of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which Thou hast shown unto Thy servant,” we would not know what he could have meant. What was “all the truth” which God had shown to Jacob, of which Jacob was not worthy? What Jacob said was: “I am not worthy of all the hasadim [acts of love] and the emeth, which Thou hast done unto Thy servant.” (Ibid. 32:11.)  As in the previous example, emeth is here action, something that is done to someone just as hesed. As in its association with shalom, so in its connection with hesed, emeth is an ethical virtue that is to be practiced toward others. Hesed and emeth are also associated with each other as divine attributes. Of God it is said that he is long-suffering and abundant in hesed and emeth. (Exod. 34:6. For the talmudic interpretation see T. B., Rosh Hashanah, 17b.)  There is a rich biblical tradition for which the association between hesed (love, lovingkindness) and emeth is most natural. As the other examples which we have discussed earlier, this association leads us to the conclusion that the biblical concept of emeth is not to be found in the realm of abstract ideas of pure rationality, but in that of values of practical reason. The biblical emeth is not an epistemological idea, but an ideal of ethics.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Prayer is from below to above. How so? From that very spring in our hearts, filled with natural holiness, behold we draw - actualizing its delicate feelings, aligned to elevate and exalt them, to purify and sanctify them in the holiness of transcendent purity which includes all sanctities and purities, all wisdoms and ways of knowing, all understandings and thoughts. Behold we are rising, and as much as our intellect grows, as much as our traits are clarified, as much as the manner of Divine cleaving (Compare Shmonah Kvatzim 2:26 with section 4:13)  is made stronger in life, in idea and will, in makeup and nature, in outcome and in aspect - so shine the lights that are revealed in us through our prayerful expressions. The further we descend into the depths of this lofty and august (In the sense of awe-inspiring. See Tehillim 89:8)  matter, into the chasm of the innerness of our soul and all its greatness and power, we can gauge with more exacting measure our elevation through the process of prayer. And when we rise, all the roots of our existence rise with us, all the branches of our neshama, all the lines of life which pour out from our essence and all the sources of life which are poured out upon us, until they bring us to our particular essentiality. Everything is blessed (The fundamental meaning of the word bracha, blessing, is addition. In turning to the Holy One with the words ‘Blessed are You…’ it is a declaration that He is the source of all abundance, who allows creation to be something separate from Him with an independent, creative stance. The midrash tells the story that the letters presented themselves before the Creator, each asking that the world be created through it. The letter ‘bet’ was chosen because it begins the word bracha and therefore the Torah begins with the word bereshit- in the beginning. In truth these two words actually share two letters – ‘bet’ and ‘resh’ which together make the word bar, meaning ‘son’ or ‘outside.’ These words are a call to an independent existence, to be a son capable of shaping and creating, an offspring who experiences himself as other than Primary Existence. Among all the works of creation, only man has the power of choice and the therefore the ability to shape his own life. Only humanity develops ideas, invents and forges new paths which lead beyond the givens of nature. Adam is the creature who realizes the Divine intention in the most real way. In this light, all humanity can hear the command to Avram to ‘go’ as an encouragement to move, to be themselves, and thereby to drive creation forward. In the journey of the siddur to say the words ‘Blessed are You…’ to the Creator is to open a channel to the river of abundance which pours down upon us and says – grow! The experience of being blessed with life, the knowledge of the precious nature of my existence, does not contradict the experience of God’s good which is poured down upon me and continues to flow within me as an expression of His will that I develop my unique selfhood. R’ Daniel Kohn For definitions of the meaning of ‘beracha’ see Sefer HaChinuch Mitzva 430, Mishne Torah Laws of Berachot 1:3, Chizkuni on Bereshit 24:27, Rashba Responsa I 423 at the end, Nefesh HaChaim Gate 2 ch. 2) , everything rises, and everything is sanctified and uplifted, rejoicing the joy of the upright, exulting in holy elation. The nature of holiness itself rises up and is clarified, achieving a recognizable character, an active intellectual character which is no longer reactive - free and in command, ruling over all the expanses of life. This is the way (See Kohelet 8:5-6 for this usage of משפט)  of prayer In Torah we are occupied with the integration of life from above to below; from the lofty heights of the Divine intellect, from the source stone of which the Torah was cut, we take the portions of life and draw them down in their mighty greatness which fills all that is, which is greater than any end or limitation, and we root them in the depth of our naturalness, and our holy nature at the foundation of its strength overflows with the blessing of heaven through the outpouring of light which comes to us.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Chapter 18: Writings [1] A Psalm of David. The LORD says to my Lord: &quot;Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.&quot; (Psalm 110:1) This verse shows how the Holy One, blessed be He, loves and exalts Israel, as He has invested their forefathers with greatness, as it says, &quot;And his greatness shall be from him&quot; (Jeremiah 30:21). And there is no greatness other than the forefathers, as it is written, &quot;As for the saints in the land, they are the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight&quot; (Psalm 16:3). Therefore, &quot;And his greatness shall be from him&quot; - from the forefathers, and everything is from them until now. Regarding the forefathers, how do we know that even the Holy One, blessed be He, said of them, &quot;I am from you&quot;? As it says, &quot;And his ruler shall come from the midst of them&quot; (Jeremiah 30:21). This refers to the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written in Psalms, &quot;Bless God, O you his peoples; you are the sheep of his pasture&quot; (Psalm 100:3). &quot;And he shall come near to me&quot; (Jeremiah 30:21) - this refers to Abraham, as it says, &quot;Abraham came forward and said...&quot; (Genesis 18:23). &quot;For who among them has stood in the council of the LORD to see and to hear his word?&quot; (Jeremiah 23:18) - The word of the LORD to my Lord (Psalm 110:1) - this refers to Abraham, as it says, &quot;And he said, 'Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his mercy and his truth toward my master'&quot; (Genesis 24:27). The attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, are not like the attributes of flesh and blood. When a king enters, he sits on the throne at the right, and his Sanhedrin is on his left. But the Holy One, blessed be He, who rules from one end of the world to the other and everything is His, wrote that Abraham sat at His right, as it says, &quot;The LORD says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand.'&quot; Why does He seat him next to Him? To prove to Israel and to show Abraham their father all the good that He does with them, as it says, &quot;He did wonders in the sight of their fathers&quot; (Psalm 78:12). Therefore, He seats him next to Him. And similarly, Hannah says, &quot;He raises up the poor from the dust&quot; (1 Samuel 2:8). This refers to the one who made himself like dust and ashes, as it is written, &quot;I am but dust and ashes&quot; (Genesis 18:27). Even when the Holy One, blessed be He, raises up the poor from the dust, what does He do for him? He seats him on the throne of glory, as it says, &quot;And he shall inherit the throne of glory&quot; (1 Samuel 2:8).</p>

              <p>Chapter (55) 56: Prophets. [1] The vision of Obadiah (Obadiah 1). May the memory of the righteous be for a blessing. When Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said (Job 4:1), Rabbi Berachiah said, &quot;Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, exact punishment from Esau in a vision? Rather, it was to teach us how God repays both a hater and a lover according to their deeds. When Job was afflicted, Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau, was his friend, and Eliphaz was righteous and rebuked Job only in a vision. The verse says, &quot;Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 'If one ventures a word with you, will you be offended? But who can keep from speaking?'&quot; (Job 4:2). It is like a parable of a man who had two wives, one whose dowry was ten thousand and one whose dowry was four thousand. The one whose dowry was four thousand said to him, &quot;Why don't you treat me with the same respect as your other wife?&quot; He said to her, &quot;Your dowry is four thousand, and your friend's dowry is ten thousand.&quot; Similarly, Job said, &quot;Why don't you treat me with the same respect as Abraham?&quot; He said to him, &quot;Have you been tested like Abraham?&quot; He who is tested will be afflicted by what is said to him. And only Abraham was tested, as it says, &quot;God tested Abraham&quot; (Genesis 22:1). He said to them, &quot;But I did not bring in four wreaths.&quot; &quot;He was whole-hearted and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil&quot; (Job 1:1). They said to him, &quot;Abraham was tested with ten, and he had ten wreaths.&quot; He was called Ethan, as it says, &quot;A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite&quot; (Psalms 89:1), and similarly, &quot;The mighty men are foundations of the earth&quot; (Micah 6:2). And why was he called Ethan? Because he strengthened himself to do the will of his Creator. He who believed in God was called Heman, as it says, &quot;And he believed in the Lord&quot; (Genesis 15:6). And why is Eitan called Heman, who strengthened himself to do the will of his Creator, called Heman, because he believed in the Almighty, as it says &quot;And he believed in the Lord&quot; (Genesis 15:6). Abram was originally called Abram, and then the Lord added to his name, and he became Abraham. Why did the Lord add to his name? Because he fulfilled the five books of the Torah even before they were given, as it says &quot;Because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws&quot; (Genesis 26:5). Therefore, he is called Abraham. He is also called &quot;Ayit&quot; (Falcon), as it says &quot;One calls from the east a bird of prey&quot; (Isaiah 46:11), referring to the hen that protects her chicks from the wolves and the ravens. Similarly, Abraham risked his life by being thrown into the furnace for his beliefs. He is called &quot;Tzur&quot; (Rock), as it says &quot;Look to the rock from which you were hewn&quot; (Isaiah 51:1). Just as a rock has no [עיים ruins or eyes], so Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac when commanded to do so. He is called &quot;Nasi&quot; (Prince), as it says &quot;For thus says the High and Lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: 'I dwell in the high and holy place, with him who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones'&quot; (Isaiah 57:15). He is called &quot;Adon&quot; (Lord), as it says &quot;And he said, 'Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham'&quot; (Genesis 24:27). And if you ask why he was called Adon, was it not because he was his servant? Others also called him Adon, as it says &quot;And we said to my lord&quot; (Genesis 44:19), because he made the Almighty Lord over all of His creatures. He is called &quot;Elohim&quot; (God), as it says &quot;The prince of God&quot; (Genesis 23:6). This is because he made known the fear of the Almighty in his world, as it says &quot;You are God-fearing&quot; (Genesis 22:12). He is called &quot;Navi&quot; (Prophet), as he first revealed the power of the Holy Spirit, as it says &quot;And you return the wife of the man, for he is a prophet&quot; (Genesis 20:7). &quot;And he shall be called a God-fearing man, as it is said, 'Now I know that you are a God-fearing man' (Job 22:12), for he was in awe of the Lord and called a lover, as it is said, 'the seed of Abraham, my friend' (Isaiah 41:8). Behold, ten trials were given to correspond to the ten qualities. Eliphaz said to him, 'Do you possess these qualities? If so, then trouble will come upon you. Behold, you have comforted many' (Job 4:3-4). Those who suffer came to you, and you comforted them. The blind one came and said to you, 'God already knows what I am going to do, for He made me blind from my mother's womb.' And you said to him, 'Do not say that.' And you said to him, 'My son, if you built a house and did not want to make windows, who would have forced you?' You are a linchpin of the Almighty, and He did not do this out of hatred, but to praise you in the future, as it is said, 'Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened' (Isaiah 35:5). &quot;So shall Hashem of Hosts be a protecting wall to the remnant of Israel; to them shall they deliver from captivity and return. And the Passover [Haggadah] says, 'Do not say thus, &quot;If I were there, I would have built pillars for myself.&quot; Whoever says this, God praises him for the future, as it says, &quot;Then shall leap as a hart the lame&quot; (Zechariah 8:4). And also, the [Haggadah] says, 'The deaf-mute one says to him, &quot;If you were a skilled craftsman and did not want to make ears for your friend, who could compel you?&quot; Thus, God praises you for the World-to-Come, as it says, &quot;And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped&quot; (Isaiah 35:5). You comforted all who were afflicted, &quot;The tottering one will be restored by you&quot; (Job 4:4). And now, when afflictions have befallen you, you are confused, as it says, &quot;Now it shall come upon you and you will be broken&quot; (Job 4:5). &quot;Is not your fear of God your confidence?&quot; (Job 4:6) Because you said, &quot;I am pure and upright,&quot; if not for the fact that God acted towards you as one does towards a human being, and brought the Flood, your righteousness would have been before you. Remember now, who being innocent has ever perished?&quot; (Job 4:7). Eliphaz said to Job, &quot;Even if Abraham the righteous had been in your place, he would not have been spared,&quot; as it says, &quot;I am the Lord Who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans&quot; (Genesis 15:7). &quot;If you are righteous, He will have mercy upon you, for He does not destroy the righteous, as it is said, 'Remember now, who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?' (Job 4:7-8). When I saw those who plow iniquity (Job 4:8), I envied the wicked who were at ease, who sow mischief and reap calamity. But lo, the day comes, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble; the day that comes shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. (Malachi 3:19) He who roars like a lion and the voice of the fierce lion is heard no more (Isaiah 31:4), it was said to him, 'Israel will eventually sin before the Lord who is called a lion, as it is said, 'The lion has roared, who will not fear?' (Amos 3:8). He elevated them to Nebuchadnezzar who was called a lion, as it is said, 'The lion has come up from his thicket' (Jeremiah 4:7), and in the month of Tammuz, whose sign is the lion, he destroyed the Temple, which is called the lion, as it is said, 'Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt' (Isaiah 29:1), and he who rules over Judah is called a lion, as it is said, 'Judah is a lion's whelp' (Genesis 49:9). Here, he explains five names, all of them called a lion. The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the two young lions have been silenced. The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. (Job 4:10-11) Elihu said to him, 'It was not I who spoke, but the Spirit of God who dwells in me' (Job 32:8). And how were all of these proven in a vision? As it is said in the visions of the night (Job 4:13), the Lord said to him, 'You have proved My servant Job in a vision; even so I will send a prophet who will prove and punish the house of your father in a vision, as it is said, 'The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord God concerning Edom: We have heard tidings from the Lord, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: &quot;Rise up! Let us rise against her for battle!&quot; (Obadiah 1:1) Why should you serve us? Even I will unsheathe My sword and come down upon him, as it is said, 'For My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; behold, it descends for judgment upon Edom, upon the people I have doomed to destruction' (Isaiah 34:5).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Chapter (67) 68: Prophets [1] &quot;In the second year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai&quot; (Haggai 1:1). Like the scriptures say: &quot;A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level,the rugged places a plain. And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” (Isaiah 40:3-5) [also look: Eikhah Rabbah 1:23]. &quot;A voice calls out [in the wilderness]&quot; [edit: ] . Rabbi Levi said: &quot;Why is it called 'in the wilderness'? Rather, it is in accordance with the practice of the world. Just as someone who lost a valuable object does not search for it in the place where it was lost, but rather in a public place where many people pass through, so too the Holy One, blessed be He, caused Israel to be lost in the wilderness, as it is said, 'In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die' (Numbers 14:35), and there He goes and seeks them. A voice calls out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way.' What should we prepare? He said to them, 'Remove the obstacles from among you.' As Laban said to Eliezer, 'Do not be delayed by me, now that the Lord has granted success to your journey. Let me see you off and send you on your way to my master' (Genesis 24:56). Laban had already uprooted [Rebecca] from here [Haran] for Eliezer's sake, as it is said, 'And I have set my face towards the Lord' (Genesis 24:27). And what about the place for the camels? He said to him, 'Rebecca does not steal in this place. And I have set my face towards the Lord.' And who will steal [the idols]? Rachel, who is destined to stand up [to Laban], will steal them and put them among the camels, as it is said, 'And Rachel took the  teraphim * [*תְּרָפִים m.n. pl. a kind of  household idols. Of uncertain origin. According to Neubauer and others, related to רֽפָאִים ᴵ (=  shades, ghosts ).], and put them in the camel's saddle' (Genesis 31:34). Alternatively, 'And I have set my face towards the Lord' is a reference to the statue of Manasseh. And when was it [that it was hidden]? When Nebuchadnezzar went out to destroy it, as it is compared to a camel, as it is said, 'The burden upon beasts of burden' (Isaiah 21:7). The burden upon beasts of burden is the Messiah, and the burden upon a camel is Nebuchadnezzar. On the day that Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Temple, the Messiah was born, as it is said, 'And Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one' (Isaiah 10:34), and 'a shoot shall grow out of the stock of Jesse' (Isaiah 11:1). Therefore, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God' (Isaiah 40:3), straighten yourselves like those whom I straightened out in the wilderness who were crooked, 'and let every valley be exalted, and every mountain and hill be made low' (Isaiah 40:4), so that you will no longer be afraid of sin, as it is said, 'Look at your way in the valley' (Jeremiah 2:23).&quot; Alternative interpretation: &quot;All valleys will be exalted. I will carry Moshe, who was buried in a valley, as it is written 'And He buried him in the valley' (Deuteronomy 34:6). This can be compared to a wise man who entrusted his son to a scribe to learn Torah laws and teachings. When they came to appoint him as a wise man, he said, 'I swear that my son has not yet been appointed a wise man until his teacher comes and sanctifies him.' Similarly, Hashem entrusted Israel to Moshe and taught them everything, as it is written, 'See, I have taught you statutes and laws' (Deuteronomy 4:5). And the Messiah will come to redeem them, and Hashem says to him, 'I swear that my children will not be redeemed until Moshe Rabbeinu comes,' as it is written, 'I saw his beginning and ending' (Isaiah 41:4). Why do I carry him? 'Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill shall be made low' (Isaiah 40:4). These are the kingdoms, as it is written, 'And I looked up and saw four chariots coming out from between two mountains' (Zechariah 6:1). And 'The crooked shall be made straight and the rough places smooth' (Isaiah 40:4). This refers to the evil inclination, as it is written, 'The heart is deceitful above all things' (Jeremiah 17:9). And 'The riders shall come down to the plain' (Isaiah 40:4). These are wicked people, as David says, 'You will hide them in the shelter of Your presence from the intrigues of men' (Psalms 31:21). Afterwards, 'And the glory of Hashem shall be revealed' (Isaiah 40:5), because in this world the prophets prophesy indirectly, saying, 'I saw Hashem standing by the altar' (Amos 9:1). Ezekiel says, 'The word of Hashem came to me and I saw visions by the river Kevar' (Ezekiel 1:1). Amos says, 'Behold, Hashem stood upon a wall with a plumb line' (Amos 7:7). &quot;And the prophet Haggai prophesied about the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem&quot; (Ezra 5:1), but in the future, everyone will see it, as it is said, &quot;And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all flesh will see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken&quot; (Isaiah 40:5).</p>

              <p>“The servant ran toward her, and he said: Please allow me to sip a little water from your jug” (Genesis 24:17).  “The servant ran toward her” – toward her good deeds. (Since he saw the water rise for her, he realized she must be exceptionally righteous.)   “Please allow me to sip a little water from your jug” – [just] one sip.  “She said: Drink, my lord, and she hastened to lower her pitcher into her hand, and she gave him to drink” (Genesis 24:18).   “When she had finished giving him to drink, she said: I will draw for your camels also, until they have finished drinking” (Genesis 24:19).  “She hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels” (Genesis 24:20).  “The man was astonished at her; he was silent, to know whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not” (Genesis 24:21).  “The man was astonished at her…” – Rabbi Yoḥanan of Tzippori said: He was squinting (To see her more clearly.)  and looking at her [to see] if “the Lord had made [his journey] successful.”  “When the camels concluded drinking, the man took a gold nose ring whose weight was one half shekel, and two bracelets to put on her hands, whose weight was ten gold shekels” (Genesis 24:22).  “When the camels concluded drinking, [the man] took…” – Rav Huna in the name of Rabbi Yosef: There was a precious stone in it that weighed half a shekel.  “And two bracelets to put on her hands” – corresponding to the two tablets [of the Ten Commandments]. “Whose weight was ten gold shekels” – corresponding to the Ten Commandments.  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night?” (Genesis 24:23).  “He said: Whose daughter are you; please tell me. [Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay the night [lalin]?]” – a stay for one night.  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka, whom she bore to Naḥor” (Genesis 24:24).  “She said to him: Both straw and feed is plentiful with us, as well as room for lodging” (Genesis 24:25).  “She said to him: I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milka…as well as room for lodging [lalun]” – to lodge for several nights. (Although he asked her about staying over for one night, she replied that he could stay for many nights.)  “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” (Genesis 24:26).   “The man bowed and prostrated himself to the Lord” – from here we learn that one should express thanks [to God] for good tidings.  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness and His truth from my master; I, the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master’s brethren” (Genesis 24:27).  “He said: Blessed is the Lord, God of my master Abraham, who did not withhold His kindness…” – from the fact that the path was miraculously shortened, I knew that “the Lord guided me on the way to the house of my master's brethren.”</p>

              <p>“The girl ran and told her mother’s household all about these matters” (Genesis 24:28).  “The girl ran and told her mother’s household” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A woman frequents only her mother’s household. They raised an objection to him: “She [Rachel] told her father” (Genesis 29:12). He said to them: That was because her mother had died. To whom could she have told? Is it not to her father?  “Rebecca had a brother and his name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring” (Genesis 24:29).  “When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister, saying: So spoke the man to me, he came to the man and, behold, he was standing beside the camels at the spring” (Genesis 24:30).  “Rebecca had a brother and his name was Laban” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said a favorable interpretation – he was very fair in complexion. (Lavan (Laban) means white.)  Rabbi Berekkya said an unfavorable interpretation – he was white, [i.e. pure], in wickedness.  “Laban ran out to the man, to the spring [haayin]” – he was assessing [me’ayen] him. (He was looking over Eliezer, to see if he might get some money from him.)    “He was standing beside the camels at the spring [haayin]” – he [Laban] was assessing [me’ayen] himself. (Whether or not he would be able to deceive Eliezer to benefit himself.)  “He said: Come, blessed of the Lord; why are you standing outside, and I have cleared the house and place for the camels?” (Genesis 24:31).  “He said: Come, blessed of the Lord” – he thought that he was Abraham, as the contours of his face resembled him.  Rabbi Yosei ben Dosa said: Canaan (Canaan was cursed by Noah (Genesis 9:25).)  and Eliezer were one and the same, and because he faithfully served that righteous man [Abraham], he emerged from the ranks of the cursed and entered the ranks of the blessed.   “He said: Come, blessed of the Lord” – Rabbi Yaakov said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan of Beit Guvrin, who would use this as a parting statement: (When taking leave of his host.)  If Eliezer, by means of faithfully serving that righteous man, emerged from the ranks of the cursed and entered the ranks of the blessed, then the people of Israel, who perform acts of kindness for their greater and lesser members with their hands and their feet, all the more so.  “Why are you standing outside” – it is not in keeping with your esteem to remain outside.  “And I have cleared the house” – from the filth of idol worship.</p>

              <p>WHO WAS BORN TO BETHUEL THE SON OF MILCAH THE WIFE OF NAHOR, ABRAHAM’s BROTHER. Because Nahor also had children from his concubine Reumah, (Above, 22:24.)  they always described the lineage of Bethuel by saying that he was the son of Milcah who was the mistress of the household. And because the girl mentioned her father’s mother first, as it says, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah (Further, Verse 25.)  — for such was customary among the girls, analogous to the verse, And she told her mother’s house (Verse 28 here.)  — therefore Scripture mentions in the verse before us that he [Bethuel] was the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor. But the servant later said, And she said, The daughter of Bethuel Nahor’s son, (Verse 47 here.)  for he corrected the matter as is ethically proper. However, he did say, whom Milcah bore unto him, (Verse 47 here.)  in order to state that Bethuel was the son of the mistress and not the concubine.</p>

              <p>AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN THE MASTER HEARD. She told him about it at the time of conjugal intimacy. Matters such as these did your servant to me, i.e., matters of intimacy such as these. So says Rashi. So also did they say in Bereshith Rabbah: (87:10.)  “Rabbi Abahu said, ‘She said it to him at the time of conjugal relations.’” Now I wonder. Joseph’s master was a castrate, (Sotah 13b.)  who had married his wife during his youth, and the Rabbis expounded, “ ‘Sris’ (a captain of) Pharaoh (Above, 37:36.)  — this teaches us that he bought Joseph for carnal purposes only, but the Holy One, blessed be He, caused Joseph’s master to become castrated.” (The Hebrew word for castrate is saris, the same word mentioned in the verse above.)  Moreover, how would she dare discredit herself and become loathsome in the eyes of her husband by telling him that she had committed adultery, whether by force or with acquiescence, which would have merited mortal punishment, for why did she not cry out at the outset, so that he should run away, as she did at the end? Now to the men of her house she said, He came unto me to lie with me, (Verse 14 here.)  but not that he lay with her, only that he came to do so, but she cried out and he fled. And surely she would hide the matter from her husband. And should you say that she told him so in order that his anger be kindled against him and that he should kill him, [it would have been sufficient for this purpose that she say that he attempted to violate her, for] any servant that attempts to violate his master’s wife deserves the death penalty! It is possible that they intended to explain the expression, Matters such as these, as meaning matters of intimacy, meaning, exposing and caressing but not actual intimacy, as his master had become physically castrate, having been visited by a disease which resulted in a lack of desire for conjugal relations, as is the case with a shachuf. (One whose genitals are atrophied.)  In line with the literal interpretation of Scripture there is no need for all this, for the Hebrew letter kaph, in the word kadvarim, is not for the purpose of expressing comparison to other matters. Instead its meaning is “these things.” (I.e., only to indicate approximation, and here meaning: “matters as these, more or less.”)  A similar usage [of the letter kaph is found in these verses]: And she told her mother’s house ‘kadvarim ha’eileh’ (according to these words); (Above, 24:28. )  And when he had spoken unto me ‘kadvarim ha’eileh’ (according to these words) I set my face toward the ground. (Daniel 10:15. )  There are many similar verses. It may be that the verse is saying that when his master heard his wife’s words which she told him — “Your servant did unto me such matters as these which I had immediately related to the men of the house” — then his anger was kindled. It is possible that the kaph is here used for exaggeration, similar to its use in the verses: Why speaketh my lord ‘kadvarim ha’eileh’ (such words as these)? (Further 44:7.)  And there have befallen me such things as these (‘ka’eileh’)? (Leviticus 10:19.)  Now due to his master’s love for Joseph he did not kill him, or it was a miracle of G-d, or knowing Joseph’s righteousness, he doubted her words. Similarly the Rabbis said in Bereshith Rabbah: (Bereshith Rabbah 87:10.)  “The master said to Joseph, ‘I know this charge against you is false, but lest a stigma fall on my children, (Lest people say; “Just as she was free with you, so she was with others, and the children she had are not his.”)  [I will put you in prison].’”</p>

              <p>ולרבקה אח ושמו לבן, Rebeccah had a brother called Laban. Our sages observe that whenever the Bible mentions righteous people, their name precedes them, whereas the reverse is the case when the Bible mentions wicked people (Esther Rabbah 6,3). Examples are Ruth 2,1; 1,2. Samuel I 25,3. It is puzzling then that Laban is introduced here in the manner of the righteous. In order to understand this we must pay attention to the verse describing Laban as running. Our sages in Yalkut Shimoni 109 state that as soon as Laban saw the nose-ring on Rebeccah he became greedy for money. This does not throw any light on our problem. The Torah should have written: &quot;As soon as he saw the nose-ring, etc., Laban ran,&quot; instead of mentioning the fact that Laban saw the nose-ring after he had already commenced to run towards Eliezer. Besides, why did the Torah repeat the words: &quot;to the man outside at the well&quot; in verse 29 and then again in verse 30?</p>

              <p>The fact is that Laban was sincerely concerned about his sister's innocence, suspecting that the gifts to her of the jewelry by a total stranger could have been the beginning of an immoral relationship between them. The Torah here describes Laban as if he were a righteous person because it acknowledges his concern for his sister's chastity.</p>

              <p>When the Torah states: &quot;it was when he saw,&quot; this shows that Laban reacted first to what he saw and subsequently to what he heard. As long as he had not yet heard what transpired between the two he put an ugly intepretation on the manner in which he thought his sister had obtained the jewelry, suspecting Eliezer of seducing Rebeccah. Laban nevertheless continued on his way to meet Eliezer and to offer him hospitality.</p>

              <p>Why did he run and for what did he run? Rashi is not asking why Lavan ran, and answering, “He said, ‘This one is rich....’” Rather, Rashi is arranging the verses, as they are not written in chronological sequence. It should have said first, “When he had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and heard the words of his sister...” and then, “He ran.” That is the sequence: Lavan saw the ring, heard his sister’s words, and ran. Also, it is not feasible that [the sequence follows the order of the verses]: first he ran, then he saw the ring and heard his sister’s words, and then he went out to the man. An even greater [break in sequence is that] in the middle, it says Lavan saw the ring. [On the contrary,] “He ran” and “He came” should be next to one another, not interrupted by, “When he had seen...” All this brought Rashi to explain, “‘He ran.’ Why did he run...?” Rashi is saying that the verses are written in this order so they will [state that Lavan ran, and then] explain why he ran. Furthermore, there are two [possible] reasons why Lavan ran: seeing the ring, and hearing his sister’s words. When Rashi says, “And for what did he run?” he is asking: for which reason did he run? [Rashi answers:] “He saw” and “He ran” are written next to each other to show that he ran because, upon seeing the ring, he said: “He is rich.” It was not because he heard Rivkah’s words, [in which case we could] judge him favorably, that he ran to honor Eliezer or for some other reason, and not out of his lust for money. Whereas if “He saw” and “He heard” would have been written before “He ran,” [in chronological sequence,] we would not know what he ran for, or if it was for both reasons. This is why Rashi carefully quotes the wording of the verse: “Why ‘He ran’? ‘When he had seen the nose ring...’” From this we see that Rashi’s true intention is to arrange the verses so they will be orderly and connected. He does this by inserting a few [explanatory] words into the verses, which is his practice in most places, as known by those familiar with Rashi’s ways. Whereas if Rashi merely intended to ask and answer, as certain commentators explained, then he should [have paraphrased] and said: “Why did he run? He said, ‘This one is rich’....” [According to them,] that which Rashi quotes, “When he had seen the nose ring,” before explaining, “This one is rich....” is completely not understandable. (R. Meir Stern) </p>

After Rebecca ran to her home, her brother ran from the house to discover more about the mysterious man who had arrived from afar, given gifts to his sister, questioned her, and requested to lodge in their house.</p>

              <p>וירץ לבן, “Lavan ran;” some scholars ask what prompted Lavan to run to meet Eliezer even before he had seen the jewelry on the hands of his sister? They explain the sequence of what happened as follows: when Lavan realized that his sister took unusually long to return with her jug of water from the well, he ran to find out if anything had happened to her. He was afraid she might have been violated by some male. Instead of taking the normal route, he ran across orchards etc., in order to reach the well faster. When he did not find Rivkah at the well, seeing she was on the way home by her regular route, and had told her mother who had given her the jewelry, he returned home When Lavan on his return home not only heard the unlikely story of how Rivkah had come into possession of these trinkets, he turned back to confront the man she said had given her such precious gifts. There is no need for such a convoluted explanation. The words ויהי כראות את הנזם ואת הצמידים, “as soon as he saw the nose ring and the bracelets,” merely tell us the reason why וירץ לבן, “Lavan took off in a rush,” to meet this generous stranger.

                <h4>Bamidbar Rabbah 10:5</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>“Speak to the children of Israel” (Numbers 6:2), those who take the vow of the nazirite. “And say to them,” to caution the court regarding this, that they should not allow the nazirite to violate his naziriteship. If they see that he seeks to violate his naziriteship, they shall compel him to fulfill his statement. This is to teach you that the great are cautioned regarding the lesser, and they will be punished due to them if they do not rebuke them. Likewise it says: “They will stumble over one another” (Leviticus 26:37); one due to the iniquity of another. This is to teach you that the entire Jewish people are guarantors for one another.    “When a man or a woman will articulate [to take the vow of a nazirite]” – that is what is written: “There was [vayhi] a certain man from Tzora…” (Judges 13:2). (This is the beginning of the chapter dealing with the birth and naziriteship of Samson.)  Rabbi Levi said: Every place that vayhi is stated, it is nothing other than an expression of suffering: “Vayhi in the days of Aḥashverosh” (Esther 1:1) – there was Haman. “Vayhi in the days when the judges [judged]” (Ruth 1:1) – there was a famine. “Vayhi when man began [to increase]” (Genesis 6:1) – “the sons of the great [saw the daughters of man]” (Genesis 6:2). (This eventually led to the Flood. See Genesis 6:1–3.)  “Vayhi in the days of Amrafel” (Genesis 14:1) – “they waged a war” (Genesis 14:2). “Vayhi when Joshua was in Jericho…” (Joshua 5:13) – “[a man was standing before him] and his drawn sword was in his hand” (Joshua 5:13). (Joshua was confronted by the commander of the host of the Lord.)   “Vayhi the Lord was with Joshua” (Joshua 6:27) – “the children of Israel committed trespass regarding the proscribed thing” (Joshua 7:1). “Vayhi when Samuel aged” (I Samuel 8:1) – “his sons did not follow his path” (I Samuel 8:3). “Vayhi David was successful in all his endeavors” (I Samuel 18:14) – “Saul was hostile to David” (I Samuel 18:9). “Vayhi a certain man from Tzora…” (Judges 13:2) – “Manoaḥ said to his wife, we will die” (Judges 13:22).  Vayhi, Rabbi Yudan said: Every place that this expression is stated regarding the righteous, he is the equivalent of thirty-one righteous men, the numerical value of vayhi. (Vav – 6, yod – 10, heh – 5, yod – 10 = 31.)  “A certain [eḥad] man,” a great man. Wherever ehad is used it indicates greatness. With regards to the Holy One Blessed be He, one is said as it it written &quot;God is One&quot; (Deuteronomy 6:4); there is no one in the world who is His equal. Likewise, regarding Abraham: “Abraham was one [eḥad]” (Ezekiel 33:24); there was no one in those days who was his equal. Regarding Israel, it is written: “Who is like Your people, Israel, one [eḥad] nation on the earth” (I Chronicles 17:21); there is none among the nations that are its equal. Likewise, regarding Avimelekh it says: “One of [aḥad] the people almost lay with your wife” (Genesis 26:10); because he was king. Likewise regarding Elkana it says: “Eḥad” (I Samuel 1:1), as there was no one in his generation who was his equal.  “[There was a certain man] from Tzora [from the family of the Danite]” (Judges 13:2), anyone whose name and the name of his city are stated, it is known that he is from that city. His name, but not the name of his city, it is known that he is from Jerusalem. “From the family of the Danite,” because Tzora belonged to Judah, as it is written: “Eshtaol, Tzora, and Ashna” (Joshua 15:33), and Tzora belonged to Dan, “the border of their inheritance was Tzora, Eshtaol…” (Joshua 19:41), it was necessary to state that he was “from the family of the Danite.” It does not say “from the tribe,” but rather, “from the family of the Danite.” It teaches that his [Manoaḥ’s] father was from Dan and Manoaḥ’s mother was from Judah. In this regard, Jacob said: “Dan will judge his people, [as one of [ke’aḥad] the tribes of Israel]” (Genesis 49:16), like the most elite of the tribes; this is Judah. That is why Jacob juxtaposed him to Judah, as he was from the land of Judah and his mother was from Judah. Likewise Manoaḥ was from Dan and his wife was from Judah; consequently Samson emerged from the tribe of Dan and the tribe of Judah, as they said: The name of Samson’s mother was Hatzlelponi, and her lineage is ascribed to the tribe of Judah, as it is stated: “And the name of their sister was Hatzlelponi” (I Chronicles 4:3).  “And his name was Manoaḥ” (Judges 13:2). The wicked precede their name: “Naval was his name” (I Samuel 25:25); “Goliath was his name” (I Samuel 17:4); “Sheva ben Bikhri was his name” (II Samuel 20:21). But the righteous, their name precedes them: “And his name was Elkana” (I Samuel 1:1); “And his name was Yishai” (I Samuel 17:12); “And his name was Boaz” (Ruth 2:1); “And his name was Mordekhai” (Esther 2:5); “And his name was Manoaḥ.” They are similar to their Creator: “But My name, the Lord…” (Exodus 6:3). They raised an objection to it: But is it not written: “Rebecca had a brother and his name was Lavan”? (Genesis 24:29). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He was conspicuous. (Lavan was not his name, but rather, his whiteness was a conspicuous attribute of his.)  Rabbi Berekhya said:  He was obvious [meluban] in his wickedness. They raised an objection: “And his name was Mikhaihu” (Judges 17:1) – because he received guests, his name was written like the names of the righteous. They raised an objection from the [verse regarding the] sons of Samuel: “The name of his firstborn son was Joel and the name of his second was Aviya” (I Samuel 8:2). The Rabbis said: Just as this one was wicked, so, too, that one was wicked. Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Simon: Ultimately, they repented. That is why he [Samuel’s firstborn, Joel] is called: “Vashni” (I Chronicles 6:13), as they changed [shenishtanu] to good deeds. (The full verse reads: “The sons of Samuel: his first-born, Vashni, and Aviya.”)  That is why they merited the Divine Spirit. That is what is written: “The word of the Lord that was to Joel son of Petuel” (Joel 1:1). This is Samuel. Why is he called Petuel? It is because he enticed [pita] the Holy One blessed be He with his prayer. (See Psalms 99:6.)   Manoaḥ, why is he called Manoaḥ? It is because he was privileged to speak with an angel, and prophecy is called rest [menuḥa], as it is stated: “Seraya was the minister of Menuḥa” (Jeremiah 51:59). It teaches that Barukh ben Neriya (He was Seraya’s brother and a disciple of the prophet Jeremiah. According to another opinion, Seraya was another name of Barukh.)  merited the Divine Spirit, just as it says: “The spirit of the Lord will rest [venaḥa] upon him (Isaiah 11:2).  “His wife was barren, she had not given birth” (Judges 13:2). This teaches that there was a dispute between Manoaḥ and his wife. He said to her: ‘You are barren; that is why you have not given birth.’ She said to him: ‘You are sterile and that is why I have not given birth.’ Manoaḥ was not sterile.  “An angel of the Lord appeared to the woman” (Judges 13:3). From here you learn that Manoaḥ’s wife was a righteous woman who merited having an angel speak with her, to introduce harmony between her and her husband and to inform her that she was barren and it was she who was preventing the pregnancy, not her husband; that is why he spoke with her. Because she saw the angel, she is called Hatzlelponi, because she addressed [pona] the angel. Tzelal is nothing other than an angel, just as it says: “As it is for this that they entered beneath the shelter [betzel] of my roof” (Genesis 19:8). (Lot is referring to the angels who came to rescue him from the destruction of Sodom.)  There, because Lot was more righteous than his wife, the angels came to the shelter of his house and not the shelter of her house. However, here, where the angel came to her because she was righteous, that is why she is called Hatzlel. Why is it stated: Hatzlel, and it did not say Hatzel? It is because he appeared to the woman twice, once in the city and once in the field. “Behold now, you are barren and have not given birth” (Judges 13:3); he informed her that she was barren and that is why she had not given birth in order to introduce harmony between her and her husband, as she had been angry at her husband Manoaḥ because she was not giving birth. “But you will conceive, and you will bear a son,” (Judges 13:3), from here on you will conceive and you will bear a son.  “Now, please beware” (Judges 13:4); he cautioned her not to drink vinegar of wine and vinegar of intoxicating drink and the water in which grapes were soaked (See Numbers 6:3.) . These are nothing other than precautions for wine, so that the nazirite will not come to drink wine, that is why the verse prohibited them for him. “And do not drink wine or intoxicating drink&quot; (Judges 13:4), just as it says: “From wine and intoxicating drink he shall abstain” (Numbers 6:3), “…and do not eat any impurity” (Judges 13:4). Impure is nothing other than prohibited, as the Torah cautioned the nazirite not to eat anything “that may be derives from the grapevine,” (Numbers 6:4), just as it says: “…and grapes, fresh or dried, he shall not eat. [Throughout his days as a nazirite] he may not eat from anything that may be derived from the grapevine” (Numbers 6:3–4). “For behold, you will conceive and bear a son” (Judges 13:5). From here, the semen from the night was kept in her womb and she had not expelled it. When the angel said to her: “For behold, you will conceive and bear a son,” the womb absorbed that drop.  “A razor [umorah] shall not come upon his head” (Judges 13:5), just as it says: “A razor shall not pass on his head” (Numbers 6:5). Why is a razor called morah? It is because the hair fears [mityareh] nothing other than the razor as it shaves a shave of destruction, just as it says: “Do not destroy the corner of your beard” (Leviticus 19:27).  “For the lad will be a nazirite to God from the womb” (Judges 13:5). It was revealed before the Holy One blessed be He that Samson was one who would follow his eyes. That is why He cautioned him as a nazirite that he should not drink wine, because wine leads to licentiousness. If, when he was a nazirite, he followed his eyes, had he drunk wine there would have been no rehabilitation for him as he would have constantly been pursuing licentiousness. What is it that is said: “From the womb”? It is to realize what is stated: “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you” (Jeremiah 1:5). However, regarding the wicked what does it say? “The wicked are corrupt from the womb; liars go astray from birth” (Psalms 58:4). Likewise it says: “I was formed in iniquity; [in sin my mother conceived me]” (Psalms 51:7).  “He will begin to deliver Israel from the hand of the Philistines” (Judges 13:5). In him will be fulfilled the prophecy of Jacob , who said: “Dan will judge his people…Dan will be [a serpent]…[I await your deliverance, Lord]” (Genesis 49:16–18).  “The woman came and she told her husband, saying: A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very awesome…” (Judges 13:6). From here [we derive that] the Divine Presence would rest only upon those with a striking appearance. “He said to me: Behold, you will conceive [and give birth to a son]” (Judges 13:7), but what he said to her: “Behold now, you are barren” (Judges 13:3), she did not reveal to him, as she did not wish to reveal her inadequacy.  “As the lad will be a nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death” (Judges 13:7). She added [the phrase]: “Until the day of his death,” as she did not know what was in the future. But the angel, who knew that he was going to lose his naziriteship by means of Delilah, that was why he did not say: “Until the day of his death.”  “Manoaḥ entreated [vayetar] the Lord, and said: Please, my Lord, the man [of God whom You sent, let him come again to us]” (Judges 13:8). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Why is the prayer of the righteous analogized to a pitchfork [eter]? It is to say to you: Just as the pitchfork overturns the grain in the field from place to place, so the prayer of the righteous overturns the attribute of cruelty to the attribute of mercy.  “God heeded the voice of Manoaḥ, [and the angel of God came again to the woman]” (Judges 13:9). Why did the angel of God return to the woman and did not come to Manoaḥ? It was in order to avoid invalidating his initial statements that he said to the woman. Alternatively, it was to endear her in his eyes.  “The woman hurried, ran, [and told her husband]” (Judges 13:10). It teaches that all actions of the righteous are with alacrity. “[Behold, the man] who on that day [bayom] came to me, [appeared to me]” (Judges 13:10). It does not say “today [hayom],” but rather, bayom. It teaches that the angel did not appear to her until the following day, because Manoaḥ did not pray until the morning prayer of the following day, just as it says: “Lord, in the morning hear my voice…” (Psalms 5:4). It teaches that the righteous seek clarity regarding their actions. “[Are you the man who spoke to the woman?] He said: I am” (Judges 13:11); I am initially and I am ultimately, as I am not changing my words.  “Manoaḥ said: Now, let your words come” (Judges 13:12). Manoaḥ said to him: ‘Until now, I have heard from the woman, and women are not qualified to instruct, and one may not rely on their statements. But, “now, let your words come,” I would like to hear from your mouth, as I do not believe her statements; perhaps she made changes in her statement, or subtracted or added.’ “What will be the guidelines for the lad?” (Judges 13:12); what naziriteship must he observe after he is born? “…and his actions?” (Judges 13:12); what shall his mother do all the days that she is pregnant with him? “The angel of the Lord said to Manoaḥ: “From everything that I said to the woman [let her beware]” (Judges 13:13), in order to accord honor to the woman and endear her to him. “Let her beware” (Judges 13:13), he said to him regarding vinegar of wine, vinegar of intoxicating drink, and the water in which grapes were soaked: “She shall not partake of anything that may be derived from the grapevine and she shall not drink wine or intoxicating drink” (Judges 13:14), in its plain sense. “And she shall not eat any impurity” (Judges 13:14), just as it says: “And grapes, fresh or dried, he shall not eat” (Numbers 6:3). “Everything that I commanded her, she shall observe” (Judges 13:14); what he said to her: “A razor shall not come upon his head” (Judges 13:5).  “Manoaḥ said to the angel of the Lord: Please let us detain [naatzera] you” (Judges 13:15). Manoaḥ said to him: ‘We had been obstructed, just as it says: “For the Lord had obstructed all wombs of the house of Avimelekh” (Genesis 20:18), and you brought us tidings of relief. Let us make a festival with you, just as it says: “On the eighth day it shall be an assembly [atzeret] for you” (Numbers 29:35). “And we will prepare a young goat before you” (Judges 13:15); you caused us to rejoice and we will rejoice with you with a goat, as rejoicing is only with meat.’  “The angel of the Lord said to Manoaḥ: If you detain me, I will not eat of your food” (Judges 13:16). The angel said to him: ‘It is not the way of the prophets of the Lord to receive payment for their prophecy.’ Regarding false prophets, what does it say? “You profaned Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for crumbs of bread, to kill…” (Ezekiel 13:19). But regarding true prophets, what does it say? “He (Elisha.)  said: As the Lord before whom I have stood lives, I will not accept” (II Kings 5:16).  “If you would prepare a burnt offering, offer it up to the Lord” (Judges 13:16). The angel intimated to him that he needed to offer up a burnt offering to the Lord in response to the good tidings, just as Abraham did when the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “To your offspring, I will give this land” (Genesis 12:7). Immediately, Abraham built an altar in response to the good tidings, as it is written: “He built an altar to the Lord, who appeared to him” (Genesis 12:7), and an altar is for nothing other than an offering.   “For Manoaḥ did not know that he was an angel of the Lord” (Judges 13:16). Why is it stated? It is because his wife said to him: “His appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God, very awesome” (Judges 13:6); she was under the impression that Manoaḥ identified that he was an angel, but, nevertheless, he invited him to eat, as he was mistaken, believing that there is eating on High. That is why it is stated: “For Manoaḥ did not know that he was an angel of the Lord.” That is why he invited him to eat. But had he known that he was an angel, he would not have said to him to eat, as he was well-versed in the fact that there is no eating on High. Why did he not identify him? From here you learn that when prophets would go on a mission of the Holy One blessed be He, the Divine Spirit that would rest upon them would confer awesomeness upon them in the eyes of their beholders, as everyone feared them, as they resembled angels.  Why, then, did the angels who came to inform Sarah regarding pregnancy eat, but this one did not want to eat? It is because those angels, when they first appeared to Abraham, they appeared to him in the image of wayfarers, and he brought them into his house as he was accustomed to, and invited them to eat. They did not want to deprive him of the exercise of hospitality and they ate with him. After they ate, they stated their mission. It did not appear as though they received payment for their mission. But this angel, initially he stated his mission. Had he eaten with him, it would have appeared as though he received payment for his mission. That is why he refrained from eating.  “Mano’aḥ said to the angel of the Lord: What is your name?” (Judges 13:17). It is because he did not identify him as an angel, that is why he asked him regarding his name. “So that when your words come to pass we will honor you [vekhibadnukha]” (Judges 13:17); Manoaḥ said to him: ‘Tell me your name so that I will ask where I might find you when your prophecy comes to pass, and we will give you a gift.’ Vekhibadnukha is nothing other than a gift, just as it says: “For I will honor you [ki khabed akhabedkha]” (Numbers 22:17). (Balak sought to convince Bilam to curse Israel on his behalf, and said he would honor him, meaning he would shower him with gifts of silver and gold.)   “The angel of the Lord said to him: Why do you ask my name?” (Judges 13:18). The angel said to him: ‘You need not ask my name, as ultimately, you will never see me again.’ That is what is written: “It is inscrutable [vehu feli]” (Judges 13:18). Regarding himself, he said to him that he will be obscured from him, that he will never see him again, just as it says: “This knowledge is inscrutable to me. [It is sublime; I cannot reach it]” (Psalms 139:6). Alternatively, “It is inscrutable [vehu feli]” – the angel said to him: ‘I do not know to tell you my name as, in accordance with the mission upon which the Holy One blessed be He sends us, He calls us a name.’ That is: Vehu feli; in accordance with each and every wonder [pelia uflia] that He performs through us, He calls us a name. Alternatively, vehu feli, it is a name. The name of the angel is feli, based on his mission to render Samson a nazirite, just as it says: “For the lad will be a nazirite to God” (Judges 13:5). This is why He called him feli, like the matter that the verse said: “When a man or a woman will articulate [yafli] [to take the vow of a nazirite]…” (Numbers 6:2).</p>

They raised an objection to him: “She [Rachel] told her father” (Genesis 29:12). He said to them: That was because her mother had died. To whom could she have told? Is it not to her father?  “Rebecca had a brother and his name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring” (Genesis 24:29).  “When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister, saying: So spoke the man to me, he came to the man and, behold, he was standing beside the camels at the spring” (Genesis 24:30).  “Rebecca had a brother and his name was Laban” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said a favorable interpretation – he was very fair in complexion. (Lavan (Laban) means white.)  Rabbi Berekkya said an unfavorable interpretation – he was white, [i.e. pure], in wickedness.  “Laban ran out to the man, to the spring [haayin]” – he was assessing [me’ayen] him. (He was looking over Eliezer, to see if he might get some money from him.)    “He was standing beside the camels at the spring [haayin]” – he [Laban] was assessing [me’ayen] himself. (Whether or not he would be able to deceive Eliezer to benefit himself.)  “He said: Come, blessed of the Lord; why are you standing outside, and I have cleared the house and place for the camels?” (Genesis 24:31).  “He said: Come, blessed of the Lord” – he thought that he was Abraham, as the contours of his face resembled him.  Rabbi Yosei ben Dosa said: Canaan (Canaan was cursed by Noah (Genesis 9:25).)  and Eliezer were one and the same, and because he faithfully served that righteous man [Abraham], he emerged from the ranks of the cursed and entered the ranks of the blessed.   “He said: Come, blessed of the Lord” – Rabbi Yaakov said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan of Beit Guvrin, who would use this as a parting statement: (When taking leave of his host.)

              <p>“Naomi had an acquaintance of her husband’s, a mighty man of valor, from the family of Elimelekh, and his name was Boaz” (Ruth 2:1). “Naomi had an acquaintance [moda] of her husband’s, a mighty man of valor” – moda means relative. Rabbi Abbahu said: If a giant marries a giantess, what do they produce? Mighty men of valor. Boaz married Ruth; what did they produce? David, “who knows how to play, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, understanding in matters, a comely man, and the Lord is with him” (I Samuel 16:18). “Who knows how to play” – [refers to his expertise] in Bible; “a mighty man of valor” – in Mishna; “a man of war” – he knows to negotiate the battle of Torah; “understanding in matters” – in good deeds; “a comely man” – in Talmud. Alternatively: “Understanding in matters” – he infers one matter from another matter; “a comely man” – who displays understanding in halakha; “and the Lord is with him” – the halakha is in accordance with his opinion. “From the family of Elimelekh, and his name was Boaz” – the wicked precede their name: “Goliath was his name” (I Samuel 17:4); “Naval is his name” (I Samuel 25:25); “Sheva son of Bikhri was his name” (II Samuel 20:21). However, the righteous, their names precede them: “And his name was Kish” (I Samuel 9:1); “and his name was Saul” (I Samuel 9:2); “and his name was Yishai” (I Samuel 17:12); “and his name was Mordekhai” (Esther 2:5); “and his name was Elkana” (I Samuel 1:1). It is because they are similar to their Creator, as it is written: “But with My name, the Lord, I was not known to them” (Exodus 6:3). They objected to him: “And his name was Laban” (Genesis 24:29). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is an obvious characteristic. (He was extremely white [lavan] or was a senior judge who sought to clarify matters. Laban was not his real name.)  Rabbi Berekhya said: He was blatant [meluban] in his wickedness. But is it not written: The sons of Samuel, “the name of the firstborn was Yoel and the name of his second, Aviya” (I Samuel 8:2), [and] the Rabbis say: Just as this one was wicked, so too, that one was wicked? Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: Because they changed their actions and merited the Divine Spirit, as it is stated: “The word of the Lord that was to Joel [Yoel] son of Petuel” (Joel 1:1). (The midrash interprets Petuel as a reference to Samuel; see Bemidbar Rabba 10:5. ) </p>

According to Yalkut Shimoni 109, Eliezer interpreted Laban's running as an hostile act and he invoked the holy name of G'd as a result of which the camels stood over the well in the air. This is why the Torah describes the camels as &quot;הגמלים על העין.&quot; Eliezer himself stood on top of the camels. He called out to Laban from an elevated position whereupon Laban addressed him with the words: &quot;come in blessed one of the Lord!&quot; If nothing unusual had occurred Laban would have reversed the wording of his invitation saying: &quot;Why should you remain outside, come in blessed one of the Lord!&quot;</p>

Es ist bereits gesagt, daß er zu Elieser hinaus bis zur Quelle gelaufen sei und hier heißt es nun: da er den Nasenring usw. sah und die Worte etc. gehört hatte, ויבא, da kam er etc. Es scheint daher das Ganze eine fortlaufende Erzählung und dies: ויהי כראות וגו׳ bis zum folgenden Vers ein fortlaufender Vordersatz zu sein, zu welchem mit V. 31 der Nachsatz beginnt. Alle Hausleute hatten das Geschmeide gesehen, allein während diese mit dem Anschauen beschäftigt waren (es heißt nicht כראותו) hatte bei einem Laban der Anblick des Goldes sofort seinen Zauber geübt: &quot;Da ist mehr! bezahlt er schon so ein bischen Wasser, wie nun gar eine ganze Bewirtung!&quot; Der spekulative Bruder nimmt also die Schwester bei Seite und hört sie nochmals genau aus, und eilt dann hinaus, damit ihm ja kein anderer zuvorkomme, erwartet, ihn schon draußen auf der Straße zu finden, ist nicht wenig verwundert, bis zum Brunnen laufen zu müssen, wird aber vollends perplex, einen Mann, der nach allem, was er gesehen und gehört, doch ein mit Gold um sich werfender Kazin sein muss, noch bescheiden zuwartend bei seinen Kamelen am Brunnen zu finden! Darum verbeugt er sich auch nicht, spricht nicht höflich — wie etwa ein Abraham und Lot — er hat schon an Respekt vor ihm verloren, sondern sagt ziemlich brüsk: Komme doch herein, was genierst du dich, du bist doch ein ברוך ד׳, d. h. ein reicher, mit Schätzen gesegneter Mann!

              <p>Laban was possessed of עין רע, he was ill-willed, begrudging, he was haughty and greedy. His whole concern in approving the match was to secure personal gain. The Torah is careful to document how Laban was motivated by money when we are told: &quot;As soon as Laban saw the nosering and bracelets on the hands of his sister etc.,… he ran towards the man&quot; (24,30). Laban was a swindler to boot. Realising that Eliezer had come to propose a שידוך, a match, he whispered to Eliezer that in consideration of an appropriate amount of money he would side with him and approve the match. Should Eliezer refuse, he, Laban would oppose the match; he was the most influential member of the household. When the Torah reports that &quot;Laban had heard the words of Rebeccah his sister,&quot; this is our clue that he knew that a match was going to be discussed. Eliezer had no option but to promise Laban what he had asked. The reason the Torah does not report all this is because it simply never came to this. Eliezer did not keep his promise, as I shall explain. In his dealings with Laban Eliezer applied the principle of עם עקש תתפתל, &quot;with the perverse you have to be wily&quot; (Psalms 18,27). He did this by making a promise he would not keep. Laban was misled, for he believed that Eliezer would keep his part of the bargain.</p>

            <summary>Chizkuni explains that the word על can mean &quot;beside&quot; in various verses in the Bible, such as Genesis 14:6, Exodus 27:21, and Exodus 40:3, indicating proximity rather than physical placement above or on top of something. This interpretation is also seen in Leviticus 24:7 and Leviticus 25:31, emphasizing the idea of being next to or beside something rather than on top of it.</summary>

              <p>אשר על העדות, “which is over the Ark.” The word: על, here cannot be translated as “above, or on,” as we have been told that the candlestick stood on the same floor as the Ark, although it was divided from it by the dividing curtain. This is not the only time that the word על is used as meaning: “beside,” compare Leviticus 24,7, and Exodus 40,3, where there are two more such examples, as well as in Genesis 24,30.</p>

              <p>“The girl ran and told her mother’s household all about these matters” (Genesis 24:28).  “The girl ran and told her mother’s household” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A woman frequents only her mother’s household. They raised an objection to him: “She [Rachel] told her father” (Genesis 29:12). He said to them: That was because her mother had died. To whom could she have told? Is it not to her father?  “Rebecca had a brother and his name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man, to the spring” (Genesis 24:29).  “When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister, saying: So spoke the man to me, he came to the man and, behold, he was standing beside the camels at the spring” (Genesis 24:30).  “Rebecca had a brother and his name was Laban” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said a favorable interpretation – he was very fair in complexion. (Lavan (Laban) means white.)  Rabbi Berekkya said an unfavorable interpretation – he was white, [i.e. pure], in wickedness.  “Laban ran out to the man, to the spring [haayin]” – he was assessing [me’ayen] him. (He was looking over Eliezer, to see if he might get some money from him.)    “He was standing beside the camels at the spring [haayin]” – he [Laban] was assessing [me’ayen] himself. (Whether or not he would be able to deceive Eliezer to benefit himself.)  “He said: Come, blessed of the Lord; why are you standing outside, and I have cleared the house and place for the camels?” (Genesis 24:31).  “He said: Come, blessed of the Lord” – he thought that he was Abraham, as the contours of his face resembled him.  Rabbi Yosei ben Dosa said: Canaan (Canaan was cursed by Noah (Genesis 9:25).)  and Eliezer were one and the same, and because he faithfully served that righteous man [Abraham], he emerged from the ranks of the cursed and entered the ranks of the blessed.   “He said: Come, blessed of the Lord” – Rabbi Yaakov said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan of Beit Guvrin, who would use this as a parting statement: (When taking leave of his host.)  If Eliezer, by means of faithfully serving that righteous man, emerged from the ranks of the cursed and entered the ranks of the blessed, then the people of Israel, who perform acts of kindness for their greater and lesser members with their hands and their feet, all the more so.  “Why are you standing outside” – it is not in keeping with your esteem to remain outside.  “And I have cleared the house” – from the filth of idol worship.</p>

              <p>Another matter, “when you will come to the land of Canaan.” They are seven nations, and you say “the land of Canaan”? The Rabbis say: It alluded to the fact that just as Ḥam castrated him and Canaan was punished; here, too, Israel sins and the land is cursed. (The Sages understood Ḥam to have castrated his father Noah (see Sanhedrin 70a, based on Genesis 9:22–24). In response, Noah cursed Ḥam’s son, Canaan (Genesis 9:25). Similarly, the verse refers here to the Land of Canaan to indicate that when the land is struck, it is due to sin, in this case the sins of Israel.  )   Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov and the Rabbis, Rabbi Eliezer says: It is because Canaan was the progenitor of them all. (The other six nations that inhabited the land were descendants of Canaan, and therefore the land is called the Land of Canaan. )  That is what is written: “Canaan begot Sidon his firstborn, and Ḥet” (Genesis 10:15). (The subsequent verses (Genesis 10:16–18) list various other sons of Canaan, some of whom were the progenitors of the nations that inhabited the Land of Canaan. )  The Rabbis say: It is because they were all merchants, just as it says: “Whose merchants are princes; whose peddlers (The term for “its peddlers [kinaneha]” is grammatically related to the name Canaan. )  are the eminent of the land” (Isaiah 23:8).  Rabbi Yosei ben Dosa said: Eliezer is Canaan. (Eliezer, the servant of Abraham (see Genesis 15:2), was a Canaanite. )  But because he served that righteous one, he emerged from the category of cursed and came into the category of blessed. That is what is written: “He said: Cursed is Canaan” (Genesis 9:25), and it is written: “Come, blessed of the Lord” (Genesis 24:31). (This was stated by Lavan to the servant of Abraham, identified by the Sages as Eliezer. )  Rabbi Yaakov in the name of Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Rabbi Natan of Beit Guvrin employed this in requesting to take his leave. (When taking leave of his host or an important individual, he would mention this comment. )  If Eliezer emerged from the category of cursed and came into the category of blessed because he served that righteous one; our brethren, Israel, who honor their prominent leaders, all the more so. Therefore, Moses cautions Israel: “When you will come to the land of Canaan.”</p>

              <p>Three people in the Torah use this expression – and all of them are non-Jews, people outside the Abrahamic covenant. The first is Noah: “Praise be to the Lord, the God of Shem” (Gen. 9:26). The second is Abraham’s servant, presumed to be Eliezer, whom he sends to find a wife for Isaac: “Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned His kindness and faithfulness to my master” (Gen. 24:27). The third is Yitro in this parasha. (There are two other oblique examples. Laban calls Abraham’s servant, “You who are blessed by the Lord” (Gen. 24:31). Avimelekh king of Gerar says of Isaac, “You are blessed by the Lord” (Gen. 26:29). Again note that neither of the speakers is part of the covenant.) </p>

The imprisoned man's wife questioned his friend's inaction, leading to both men being released. The story highlights the righteousness of early pious individuals and their animals, such as Abraham's camels avoiding houses with idols and Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa's donkey miraculously returning home when stolen.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>There is another story of a young woman who was kidnapped, and two pious men went to pay her ransom. One of them was arrested and accused of robbery and sent to prison. Every day, his wife would bring him bread and water. One day, he said to her: Go to my friend [the other pious man] and tell him that I am being held in prison [(and accused of soliciting a prostitute), while he just sits in his house and does nothing to help the young woman. His wife replied: It’s bad enough that you are being held in prison, but now you also engage in this kind of foolishness?] He said to her: Please, just go and say this to him. So she went and related this to his friend. What did the friend do? He went and brought silver and gold, and other men with him, and got them both released. When the first man got out, he said: Let me sleep next to the young woman in bed, but with her clothes on. In the morning, he said to them: Now immerse me in water, and then immerse her in water. They did so. Then he said to them: What did you suspect during my immersion? They said to him: We said to ourselves, all that time that he was in prison, he was hungry and thirsty, and now he is out in the fresh air…so this all warmed up your flesh and you were overstimulated, so perhaps you had an ejaculation [and that is why you had to immerse]. He said: And what did you suspect during her immersion? They said to him: After all that time that she was among the idolaters, perhaps she ate and drank from their foods, and now you were telling us to immerse her so that she would be purified. He said to them: That is in fact just what happened, and you, who have judged me favorably, will be judged favorably by the Omnipresent God. Just as the early righteous people were pious, so too were their animals. They say that Abraham’s camels would not go into a house that had idols in it, as it says (Genesis 24:31), “I have cleared the house, and made space for the camels.” [“I have cleared the house” – of idols. But what do you learn from “and made space for the camels”?] That teaches us that they would not go into the house of Lavan the Aramean until all the idols were cleared out. There is a story that Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa’s donkey was stolen by robbers. They put it in the courtyard and placed straw, barley, and water in front it, but it would not eat or drink. They said: How can we leave it here? It will just die and rot in the courtyard. So they opened the door and put the animal outside, and it started walking and kept going until it reached [the home of] Rabbi Hanina ben Dosa. When it got there, his son heard it braying. He said: Father, isn’t this voice is like the voice of our animal? He said: Son, open the door for it, for it is clearly dying of hunger. He got up and opened the door, and put straw and barley and water in front of it, and it ate and drank. That is why they say: Just as the early righteous people were pious, so too were their animals.”</p>

        <summary>Laban showed hospitality to Eliezer and his camels by providing them with food and water, demonstrating respect for guests and symbolizing his eagerness to expedite the marriage of Rebecca to Isaac. The Midrash emphasizes the righteousness of Abraham's camels and the significance of small details in Jewish law, while the Musar commentary highlights Laban's motives for hastening the marriage and Eliezer's generosity towards Rebecca.

            <summary>Eliezer entered Laban's house and Laban took care of the camels, providing them with straw and feed. The expression &quot;he ungirded the camels&quot; refers to Laban removing the muzzles from the camels, as interpreted by Rashi and Bereshit Rabbah. The term &quot;provender&quot; is a general term for cattle feed, and Laban's actions towards Eliezer and the camels demonstrate his hospitality. Laban's reference to God's name and the washing of feet symbolize respect for guests. In a Midrash, it is suggested that Eliezer's camels were as pious as a donkey known for its piety. The story also involves a plot to poison Eliezer, but he is saved by reciting a blessing and the poison ultimately affects Bethuel. Isaac's suspicion of Eliezer's innocence leads to Eliezer being rewarded by being brought into the Garden of Eden alive.</summary>

              <p>ויפתח הגמלים, “he unmuzzled the camels.” Rashi comments that he unmuzzled the camels which he had muzzled before so that they would not graze in land owned by others. This is taken from Bereshit Rabbah 60,8. Rabbi Yirmiyah there asked whether the camels of Avraham were not as pious as the donkey of Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair who would not eat grass in another’s field even without being muzzled. [In fact these donkeys were reported once to have remained without fodder for three days due to their piety.] The matter is raised in the Midrash as it was difficult for people at that time to imagine that the piety in the house of Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair should have exceeded that in the household of Avraham. Keeping this in mind, Rabbi Yirmiyah interpreted the word ויפתח to mean that Eliezer loosened the yokes that these camels normally wore around their necks, and from which the bags they carried were suspended. A parallel of this expression is found in Isaiah 52,2 התפתחי מוסרי צוארך, “loosen the bonds from your necks!” The word ויפתח actually refers to Lavan who performed this task and provided the camels with straw to lie on, fodder to feed, and water to wash the feet of the men traveling with Eliezer.</p>

              <p>ויתן תבן ומספוא, Rabbi Acha concludes that mundane conversation of men such as Avraham’s servant Eliezer is esteemed more highly by G’d (the Torah) than the learned discussion of Torah by the children of the patriarchs; he derives this from the inordinate amount of detail provided by the Torah to the minutiae of the story of Eliezer at the well. On the other hand, basic legislation in the Torah concerning ritual impurity is often only hinted at by a letter here or an extra word elsewhere in the text. The same scholar continues: the washing of the feet of the servants of our patriarchs ranks as more worth reporting than details of the impurities of certain creepers and if the blood of such creepers confers ritual impurity similar to their bodies. This goes so far that the greatest scholars were not able to resolve their understanding of these rules by reference to what is actually written in the text of the Torah.

              </summary>
              <p>AND THE MAN CAME INTO THE HOUSE. Eliezer is the man who entered the house. And he ungirded the camels — this refers to Laban who acted ethically towards his guests, unharnessed their camels and gave them straw and fodder, and he also gave water to wash the feet of Eliezer and the feet of the men that were with him. It must refer to Laban for it would be unlikely that it was Eliezer who gave water to wash his own feet and those of his men. A similar case is the verse, And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit. (Further, 37:28.)  The words, and they drew, refer back to the brothers of Joseph mentioned in the preceding verse, and not to the Midianites. And so in the verse, Then said Ziba unto the king [David]: According to all that my lord the king commandeth his servant, so shall thy servant do; but Mephibosheth eateth at my table as one of the king’s sons. (II Samuel 9:11.)  [The concluding words, but Mephibosheth eateth], are the words of David and not Ziba. There are many such verses. Now the purport of the expression, and he ungirded the camels, is that he unloosened the bands on their necks, as it was customary to lead them knotted, or perhaps they travelled with saddles girded upon them, just as is expressed in the verses: Let not him that girdeth on his armor boast himself as he that putteth it off, (I Kings 20:11.)  Loose thyself from the band of thy neck. (Isaiah 52:2.)  Now Rashi wrote, “He removed their muzzles for he had closed their mouths so that they might not graze in other peoples’ fields.” And in the words of Bereshith Rabbah, (60:1.)  “He removed their muzzles. Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmiyah asked Rabbi Chiya the son of Rabbi Aba, ‘Were not the camels of our father Abraham like the ass of Rabbi Pinchas ben Ya’ir, (A Sage of the Tannaitic period. He was a son-in-law of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai. He was celebrated for his great piety; even his ass refused to eat untithed corn.)  etc.?’” This question is intended to contradict [the interpretation which maintains that the ungirding refers to] the removing of the muzzles for it is impossible that the piety in the house of Rabbi Pinchas been Ya’ir should have been greater than that in the house of our father Abraham, and just as the ass of Rabbi Pinchas ben Ya’ir did not have to be guarded against eating things which its master was forbidden to feet it, all the more so were the camels of our father Abraham. There was thus no need to muzzle them for no injustice befalleth the righteous. (Proverbs 12:21.) </p>

              <p>“Food was set before him” [24:32]. Food was placed before him. Eliezer said: I will not eat until I will speak. Bahya and the Baal ha-Turim write. They gave him poison in the bowl, expecting that Eliezer would eat and die. They wanted to inherit and they hurried him and said, eat soon. He responded: I am the servant of Abraham. I must first wash my hands and recite the blessing over the bread. He thought the Holy One would save him because of the blessings. An angel came and moved the poison before Bethuel. Bethuel ate the poison and he died immediately. That is why the verse says, “then he and the men who were with him ate and drank” [24:54]. Eliezer and his men ate and drank. However. It is not written that the household of Bethuel ate, since they had become bereaved, because Bethuel died at the table. (Bahya and Baal ha-Turim, Genesis, 24:33.)  The Yalkut writes. Why did Bethuel die so quickly? Bethuel was a king in Aram Naharaim and each virgin who would get married came before Bethuel and slept with him, and he would take her virginity. That is why his name was Bethuel because he took each maiden’s virginity [betulim]. On the night that his daughter Rebecca became a bride, all the evildoers gathered and said to Bethuel. If Bethuel would take Rebecca’s virginity, then it would be good. If not, they would kill both Bethuel and Rebecca. That is why the Holy One caused Bethuel to die the same night. Eliezer and Rebecca left Haran two hours after sunrise and the angel caused that they came to Hebron in one day. It was a seventeen-day journey from Hebron to Haran. This was like when he left Abraham’s house and wanted to go to Haran for Rebecca. He was also on the way for three hours, in a journey that normally took seventeen days, as the verse says, “I came today to the spring” [24:42]. That is, I left today, and today I came to the well. Eliezer woke up in the morning and he saw the angel standing. Eliezer said: do not delay me and let me go with Rebecca. Eliezer came with Rebecca and she saw Isaac in the forest. He was going out of the Garden of Eden. When Rebecca saw prophetically that the evil Esau would come from her, she fell off the camel and caused her virginity to disappear. The Holy One sent the angel Gabriel to protect her virginity in the field in the place where she fell, and that the blood should not stink and thereby be recognized. When Isaac slept with Rebecca and did not find her a virgin, he suspected that Eliezer had slept with her. Isaac asked: tell me the truth. Rebecca said: I fell off the camel and lost my virginity. He said to Rebecca: you are lying, but Eliezer slept with you. Rebecca swore that Eliezer did not touch her. Isaac went with Rebecca and found a tree root smeared with blood. Isaac immediately recognized that Rebecca had told the truth. The Holy One said: what good should we do for Eliezer, since he was suspected, but was innocent in the matter. The Holy One said to the angels that Eliezer should be brought into the Garden of Eden alive. Here we can see how great a sin it is when one suspects someone and he did not commit the transgression. God repaid him with a good reward. We find that Isaac was in the Garden of Eden alive and left. However, Eliezer came into the Garden of Eden alive and remained there in that state forever.

            <summary>Abraham's camels were so righteous that they did not need to be muzzled to prevent them from eating private vegetation, similar to the donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair. The donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair was so righteous that it refused to eat untithed food, unlike the people of later generations who did not tithe their food. The impurity of the blood of creeping animals is derived from extra letters in the Torah, showing the significance of even the smallest details in Jewish law. The act of washing the feet of the patriarch's servants is also emphasized as being significant in the Midrash.</summary>

              <p>“The man came to the house and unfastened the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him” (Genesis 24:33).  “The man came to the house [and unfastened the camels]…” – he untied their muzzles. Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rabba: Were the camels of Abraham our patriarch not like the donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair? (As the Midrash goes on to relate, Rabbi Pinḥas’ donkey would not touch forbidden food. Surely Abraham’s animals were no less righteous than those of Rabbi Pinḥas, therefore there was no need to muzzle them to prevent them from eating private vegetation, and the unfastening mentioned in the verse was referring to their saddles.)  Robbers once took the donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair. It spent three days with them and did not eat anything. They said: ‘In the end it will die, and stink up our cave for us. Let us return it to its owner.’ They sent it out and it came to its owner’s house. When it arrived it brayed, and he recognized its voice. He said: ‘Open the gate for that unfortunate one and give it to eat, as three days have passed during which it did not taste a thing.’ They gave it barley, but it would not taste it. They said to him: ‘We gave it barley but it would not taste it.’ He said to them: ‘Did you process it?’ (By removing the chaff and other refuse.)  They said to him: ‘Yes.’ [He asked:] ‘Did you separate the tithes of demai from it?’ (Demai is produce purchased from a person who is not trustworthy regarding the separation of tithes from his produce. One who buys such produce must separate the tithes himself, as a precaution.)  They said to him: ‘No. Did you not teach us, Rabbi: “One who purchases grain for an animal, or flour for hides, or oil for light, or oil to rub into leather is exempt from tithing demai?”’ (Demai 1:3.)  He said to them: ‘What can we do for it if it is stringent with itself?’ (The donkey was so righteous that it did not want to rely on the exemption from tithing animal feed. )   Rabbi Yirmeya once sent a basket of figs to Rabbi Ze’eira. Rabbi Yirmeya said: ‘Is it possible that Rabbi Ze’eira would eat them without tithing them?’ (He therefore did not tithe them himself before sending them.)  Rabbi Ze’eira said: ‘Is it possible that Rabbi Yirmeya would send them without tithing?’ Between the two of them, the figs were eaten in their untithed state. The next day, Rabbi Yirmeya met Rabbi Ze’eira. He [Rabbi Ze’eira] said to him: ‘Did you tithe those figs?’ He said to him: ‘No.’ Rabbi Abba bar Yemina said to Rabbi Ze’eira: ‘If the people of early generations were likened to angels, we are likened to human beings. If they were likened to people, we are likened to donkeys. And [if we are likened to donkeys] we are not likened to the donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair, [but to an ordinary donkey]. When the donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair was given untithed food it would not eat it, but we ate untithed figs.’   “He gave straw and feed for the camels” – the conversation of the servants of the patriarch’s household are more significant than the Torah laws of the descendants. The passage about Eliezer is two or three columns long, it states it and repeats it. The [law of impurity of] creeping animals is one of the fundamental laws of the Torah, but the fact that its blood imparts ritual impurity, like its flesh, (The flesh of a creeping animal imparts impurity (see Leviticus 11:29–38), but the Torah does not state explicitly that its blood imparts impurity.)  is learned only from a derivation based on an extra letter in a verse. [What is that derivation?] Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Tameh, hatameh (Leviticus 11:29). (The verse, when speaking of creeping animals, could have said: “And these are impure [tamei],” but instead it says “And these are the impure ones [hatamei].” It is from the additional letter heh that the impurity of its blood is derived.)  Rabbi Eliezer ben Yosei says: Zeh, vezeh (Leviticus 11:29). (The verse, when speaking of creeping animals, could have said: “These [zeh] are the impure ones,“ but instead it says “And these [vezeh] are the impure ones.” It is from the additional letter vav that the impurity of its blood is derived.)   “And water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him” – Rabbi Aḥa said: The washing of the feet of the servants of the patriarch’s household is more significant than the Torah laws of the descendants, for [the Torah] found it necessary to write even about the washing of his feet, The creeping animal is one of the fundamental laws of the Torah, but the fact that its blood imparts impurity like its flesh is learned only from a derivation based on an extra letter in a verse.

            <summary>Ibn Ezra explains that the word &quot;va-yusam&quot; is in the hofal form, similar to &quot;va-yushav&quot; in Exodus 10:8. Rashbam notes that Eliezer refrained from eating until he completed his mission after receiving divine approval. Radak points out a similar spelling anomaly in Genesis 50:26, and Rabbeinu Bahya suggests that Eliezer's food was poisoned but the angel intervened. Siftei Chakhamim discusses the different meanings of the word &quot;אם,&quot; while Rashi explains that it can mean both &quot;אשר&quot; and &quot;כי.&quot; Steinsaltz highlights Eliezer's decision not to eat until he explained his purpose, fearing a sense of obligation to his hosts. Chizkuni and Alshekh also comment on the spelling of the word &quot;ויישם.&quot;</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>ויושם לפניו לאכול, “food was placed before him.” There is a difference between the spelling and the reading of the word ויישם, which is read as if it had been spelled ויושם. According to ancient sources, including Yonathan ben Uziel, some poison had been placed in Eliezer’s food so that he would die and Bethuel and Lavan would appropriate to themselves all the riches he had brought with him. The attempt ended in failure, as a mistake was made and the plate with the poisoned food was placed in front of Bethuel. This is why the word was spelled with two letters י, the equivalent of the name of G-d. [When you combine the two letters י which are part of the written text, and you add the letter ו, which is read, you obtain the number 26, the same as the numerical value of the four-lettered ineffable name י-ה-ו-ה. Ed.] According to Psalms 124,2 [the psalmist reputedly had this incident in mind when he composed that hymn, Ed.] this was a hint that had it not been for the merit of Avraham Eliezer would have eaten the poisoned food. While he waited with eating until he had spelled out why he had come there, this afforded the angel the opportunity to switch plates. When the Torah says at the end of that paragraph ויאכלו וישתו הוא והאנשים אשר עמו, “they ate and they drank, he and the men who were with him,” this is to draw our attention to the fact that the members of Bethuel’s household did not eat as they were mourning the sudden death of Bethuel caused by his eating the poison he had prepared for Eliezer. This also accounts for the fact that in verse 55 only Rivkah’s brother and mother are mentioned as requesting a delay in her departure. Her father had died and thus could not offer an opinion.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Judaism posits yet another regulation regarding the welfare of animals which is regarded as biblical in nature even though the law is not reflected in a literal reading of Scripture. The biblical statement &quot;I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle, and thou shall eat and be satisfied&quot; (Deuteronomy 11:15) is understood in rabbinic exegesis as forbidding a person to partake of any food unless he has first fed his animals. (See Berakhot 41a and Gittin 62a. See also Rambam, Hilkhot Avadim 9:8; R. Meir Rothenberg, Teshuvot Maharam ben Barukh he-Ḥadashhot, no. 302; R. Jacob Reisher, Teshuvot Shevut Ya‘akov, II, no. 13; Magen Avraham, Oraḥ Ḥayyim 167:18 and 271:12; Ḥayyei Adam 45:1, and R. Joel Schwartz, Ve-Raḥamav al Kol Ma’asav, pp. 59-62. R. Jacob Emden, She’elat Ya‘ave&amp;x1E93;, 1, no. 17, rules that there is no absolute requirement to feed a dog or a cat before eating oneself since those animals sustain themselves on table scraps and forage for foods but that it is nevertheless proper to feed them first in order “to acquire the trait of compassion.” Magen Avraham, Oraḥ, Ḥayyim 324:7, declares that providing food for any animal, including animals belonging to other persons and ownerless animals, constitutes a miẓvah. See also R. Simeon ben Ẓemaḥ Duran, Teshuvot Tashbaẓ, III, no. 293; R. Jacob Ettlinger, Teshuvot Binyan Ẓion, no. 103; and R. Eliyahu Klatzkin, Teshuvot Imrei Shefer, no. 34, sec. 1. Cf. R. Moses Sofer, Teshuvot Ḥatam Sofer, Yoreh De‘ah, no. 314, s.v. ve-la’asot, and no. 318, s.v. ve-hinneh.)  This regulation is derived from the order in which the two clauses comprising the verse are recorded. The passage speaks first of providing for animals and only subsequently of satisfying human needs. (Similarly, Scripture records that Laban gave straw to the camels and only afterwards did he provide food for Abraham’s servant. See Genesis 24:32-33 and Sefer Ḥasidim (ed. Reuben Margulies), no. 531. Cf., R. Joel Schwartz, Ve-Raḥamav al Kol Ma’asav, p. 60, note 4.)  Amplifying this rule, the Palestinian Talmud, Yevamot 15:3 and Ketubot 4:8, declares that a person is forbidden to purchase an animal unless he can assure an adequate supply of food on its behalf. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>A person ought to be modest in his eating and drinking, not be short-tempered at the table, (Derekh Eretz Rabba 6.)  not eat or drink standing, nor eat before the fourth hour of the day. (Derekh Eretz Rabba 7, around 10:00 AM (van Loopik, 115).)  When two are eating, each one waits for the other to take from the plate, but with three, one does not wait. A person should not grab in his hand a serving larger in size than an egg, because that is being a glutton. (Derekh Eretz Rabba 6.)  One should not wipe the plate with his fingers, not eat from a head of garlic or onion but from its leaves. (Ibid.)  And one should not bite from a piece of food and then give it to his companion, because not all creatures feel the same way [about how hygienic this would be]. (Ibid., 9.)  One should not bite off piece of bread with one’s teeth and then return it to the table. Once it happened that there was someone who picked up a piece of bread and let it hang from his teeth. R. Akiba said to him, “Not so, my son. You might as well put your heel on it and rip it off.” (Ibid., 7.)  A person should not drink his cup in one gulp, and if he does so, he is a glutton. Two sips are polite; three sips, vulgar. (Ibid., 6.)  One should not drink from one’s cup and then give it to his companion because of the health risk. Once it happened to R. Akiba when he was a guest at someone’s house that his host gave him a cup from which he had sipped. R. Akiba said to him, “Drink it yourself.” Ben Azzai said to him (the host), “How long will you keep giving R. Akiba cups that have been sipped from!?” (Ibid., 9.)  A person should not put the plate on top of the bread. Once it happened to R. Akiba when he was a guest at someone’s house that his host took a piece of food and put the plate on it. R. Akiba grabbed it and ate it. He said to his host, “How could I imagine that you would be hurt by lukewarm water when you’re not even hurt by boiling water?” (Ibid. The story “proves” that it is wrong to cover food with the plate. Following Chavel’s explanation, I think Rabbi Akiba reproaches his host for ungraciously not offering him the piece of food and trying to hide it under the plate. R. Akiba explains his own bold gesture -grabbing the food and eating – euphemistically. In other words, with someone as rude as you who doesn’t know better than to put a plate on a piece of food, only something as rude as what I did (“boiling water”), not a gentle or subtle hint (“lukewarm water”), could get it across to you just how wrong and rude you were to put the plate on top of the food.) </p>

              <p>Five are the things they said about bread: (1) Don’t put raw meat on bread; (2) don’t put the cup on top of the bread; (3) don’t put the plate on top of the bread; (4) don’t throw the bread; and (5) don’t sit on the food – so it is taught in the laws of Derekh Eretz. (Ibid.) Rejoice over your table when the hungry come and enjoy from your table, for that will lengthen your days in this world and earn you life in the world to come. And so also from Derekh Eretz we learn: “Let no guest say, ‘Give me and I shall eat,’ until they speak to him, though it is not necessary to say explicitly that he should eat when on the table in front of him is whatever he needs and is able to eat. For thus it is written in the Torah: “But when food was set before him, he said, ‘I will not eat until I have said what I have to say.'” (Gen 24:33.)  Who said anything to Eliezer about eating that he should reply, “I will not eat,” unless he was responding to the fact that the food was prepared, set before him, and up to him to eat? There was no one putting himself between him and his food for him to say to him “I will” or “I will not eat.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>“The man came to the house and unfastened the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him” (Genesis 24:33).  “The man came to the house [and unfastened the camels]…” – he untied their muzzles. Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rabba: Were the camels of Abraham our patriarch not like the donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair? (As the Midrash goes on to relate, Rabbi Pinḥas’ donkey would not touch forbidden food. Surely Abraham’s animals were no less righteous than those of Rabbi Pinḥas, therefore there was no need to muzzle them to prevent them from eating private vegetation, and the unfastening mentioned in the verse was referring to their saddles.)  Robbers once took the donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair. It spent three days with them and did not eat anything. They said: ‘In the end it will die, and stink up our cave for us. Let us return it to its owner.’ They sent it out and it came to its owner’s house. When it arrived it brayed, and he recognized its voice. He said: ‘Open the gate for that unfortunate one and give it to eat, as three days have passed during which it did not taste a thing.’ They gave it barley, but it would not taste it. They said to him: ‘We gave it barley but it would not taste it.’ He said to them: ‘Did you process it?’ (By removing the chaff and other refuse.)  They said to him: ‘Yes.’ [He asked:] ‘Did you separate the tithes of demai from it?’ (Demai is produce purchased from a person who is not trustworthy regarding the separation of tithes from his produce. One who buys such produce must separate the tithes himself, as a precaution.)  They said to him: ‘No. Did you not teach us, Rabbi: “One who purchases grain for an animal, or flour for hides, or oil for light, or oil to rub into leather is exempt from tithing demai?”’ (Demai 1:3.)  He said to them: ‘What can we do for it if it is stringent with itself?’ (The donkey was so righteous that it did not want to rely on the exemption from tithing animal feed. )   Rabbi Yirmeya once sent a basket of figs to Rabbi Ze’eira. Rabbi Yirmeya said: ‘Is it possible that Rabbi Ze’eira would eat them without tithing them?’ (He therefore did not tithe them himself before sending them.)  Rabbi Ze’eira said: ‘Is it possible that Rabbi Yirmeya would send them without tithing?’ Between the two of them, the figs were eaten in their untithed state. The next day, Rabbi Yirmeya met Rabbi Ze’eira. He [Rabbi Ze’eira] said to him: ‘Did you tithe those figs?’ He said to him: ‘No.’ Rabbi Abba bar Yemina said to Rabbi Ze’eira: ‘If the people of early generations were likened to angels, we are likened to human beings. If they were likened to people, we are likened to donkeys. And [if we are likened to donkeys] we are not likened to the donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair, [but to an ordinary donkey]. When the donkey of Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair was given untithed food it would not eat it, but we ate untithed figs.’   “He gave straw and feed for the camels” – the conversation of the servants of the patriarch’s household are more significant than the Torah laws of the descendants. The passage about Eliezer is two or three columns long, it states it and repeats it. The [law of impurity of] creeping animals is one of the fundamental laws of the Torah, but the fact that its blood imparts ritual impurity, like its flesh, (The flesh of a creeping animal imparts impurity (see Leviticus 11:29–38), but the Torah does not state explicitly that its blood imparts impurity.)  is learned only from a derivation based on an extra letter in a verse. [What is that derivation?] Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Tameh, hatameh (Leviticus 11:29). (The verse, when speaking of creeping animals, could have said: “And these are impure [tamei],” but instead it says “And these are the impure ones [hatamei].” It is from the additional letter heh that the impurity of its blood is derived.)  Rabbi Eliezer ben Yosei says: Zeh, vezeh (Leviticus 11:29). (The verse, when speaking of creeping animals, could have said: “These [zeh] are the impure ones,“ but instead it says “And these [vezeh] are the impure ones.” It is from the additional letter vav that the impurity of its blood is derived.)   “And water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him” – Rabbi Aḥa said: The washing of the feet of the servants of the patriarch’s household is more significant than the Torah laws of the descendants, for [the Torah] found it necessary to write even about the washing of his feet, The creeping animal is one of the fundamental laws of the Torah, but the fact that its blood imparts impurity like its flesh is learned only from a derivation based on an extra letter in a verse. [What is that derivation?] Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Tameh, hatameh, Rabbi Eliezer ben Yosei says: Zeh, vezeh.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>For, in My fury, etc. Rashi explains: It is written, “The heavens are My throne, etc.” (Yeshayah 66:1) and so if He Himself sits in heaven, so how is it feasible that He raises His hand heavenward? Therefore Rashi explains that when it is written, “heavenward” it means “to Myself” i.e. towards Myself. When [Rashi] explains, “For in My fury, etc.” he means to say that it is not general practice to swear unless one makes a promise and then he swears to verify his word. If so, why does Hashem take an oath here? He did not make a promise! For this reason Rashi explains “for in My fury, etc.” i.e. nevertheless, due to His great anger against the enemy to wreak vengeance on him, and not to reconsider this, He took an oath that He will seek vengeance from the enemy. Re”m wrote: But I do not know the meaning of the word כי in the phrase “For (כי) I will raise My hand heavenward.” It does not fit with any of the four possible meanings of ki, which are: “if, perhaps, rather, [and] because. It seems that this is the explanation: Since it is not general practice to swear unless he makes a promise to give or to do something for him, as we find with Boaz who said “I swear as Hashem lives, lie down, etc.” (Rus 3:13), by this he swore to keep his word, and the promises which he had promised. Something which one says that he would do, can also have the same meaning, since it is the general practice to swear [to verify] what he wants to do, so too, I will swear on account of the fury, that it is My intention to rage against the nations. “I shall lift My hand to heaven” to swear that “If I whet My saber to a gleam, etc.” Then the meaning of כי here is “because” and means because “if I change.” This is similar to “Until I have spoken” (Bereishis 24:33) which is [a form of] “that.” The meaning of the verse here is as follows: Since it is general practice to take an oath on a promise that one makes to his friend, so too I will do, and I will raise My hand to Myself and say, “As I live” which is the oath. The meaning of, “heavenward” is to Himself, Who is called “Heaven’” which is His Throne.” [The verse] does not mean to say that Hashem grasped heaven in His hand and swore by holding an object [which is customary when making an oath], because the purpose in taking an object when swearing is only to add concentration and awe to the oath. This is something that does not pertain to Hashem. Do not challenge me that it says, “The hand is on Hashem’s Throne” (Shemos 17:16) where Rashi explains “the hand of Hashem is raised to swear by His throne,” because nothing is written there to imply an oath, as it does here.

              </summary>
              <p>(Genesis 24:34): It was learned — there were 13 that never tasted the taste of death. These were them: The milcham [phoenix] bird and its [species], Enoch the son of Yered, Serah the daughter of Asher, Batya the daughter of Pharaoh, Jabez, Hiram the king of Tyre, Elijah, Ebed-melech the Kushite, the Messiah, the cohort of Jonadab the son of Rechab, Rabbi Judah the Prince's grandson, Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Levi, and Eliezer the servant of Abraham. Why the milcham bird? Because when Eve ate from the tree, and afterward they both gave [from it] to all the creatures to taste, when they gave [it] to the milcham bird, it did not want to eat [it]. The Holy One, blessed be He, [then] said, &quot;I will make it stand forever as an example for all the generations. It and its species will testify about the merit of the Jewish people in the future.&quot; And it is still in that city that the angel of death built, and they are fruitful and multiply like the other creatures. But when they become a thousand years old, they become small like a chick and then grow to be like an eagle and never die. Why Enoch? Since everyone in his generation was completely wicked and he was completely righteous. Hence, he resembled the ministering angels. Serah the daughter of Asher, because she had always been righteous. And when the sons of Jacob went up from Egypt and found Joseph alive, the holy spirit disappeared from Jacob until the day he was told, Joseph is still alive (Genesis 45:26). At that time, he said to her, &quot;You should likewise live forever.&quot; And it clung to her since she had always been righteous. So she is still sheltered in the Garden of Eden. Batya the daughter of Pharaoh, because she raised Moses and saved him from death. Jabez, because everyone in his generation was righteous, but he was the greatest of them all. And he was Othniel the son of Kenaz. Hiram the king of Tyre went into the Garden of Eden but left. He entered because he toiled [in building] the Temple. Hence they placed him in the Garden of Eden for 400 years. In the end, he became haughty-hearted and said: I am a god; I sit enthroned like a god (Ezekiel 28:2) — hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Ezekiel: say to the prince of Tyre, &quot;Because you have been so haughty [... You have been] in Eden, the Garden of God, etc.&quot; (Ezekiel 28:2-13). So He therefore expelled him from the Garden of Eden and he is [now] in Geihinnom. And were it not that the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to punish Hiram, the Temple would still not be destroyed. As it were, the Temple would have been embarrassed to [take part in] hurting Hiram. Once the Temple was destroyed, He permitted the ministering angels to give him his full sentence for everything he said in front of the divine presence. Why Elijah? Because he was a righteous zealot, son of a zealot. Hence He gave him a covenant of peace to live forever. Ebed-melech the Kushite, because he had mercy upon the prophet Jeremiah, peace be upon him, and took him out from the pit. [So] Jeremiah prayed for him to the Holy One, blessed be He, and He gave Him eternal life. Why the Messiah? Because he was in a wicked generation and he saw his fathers, the kings of the House of David, worshipping idolatry; but he repudiated them and chose the Holy One, blessed be He, and sought mercy for the Jewish people, to fast and to pray for them, as it is stated: But he was wounded because of our sins, etc. and by his bruises we were healed (Isaiah 53:5). Hence he was hidden, so that he will redeem the Jewish people with the ingathering of the exiles and rejoice with them during the resurrection of the dead. Why Jonadab and his cohort? Because he was in a wicked generation, but when he heard the rebukes that Jeremiah was giving over to the Jewish people at the time of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah, that the Temple would be destroyed in the future and the Jewish people exiled, he stood and made his children and all of his cohort take an oath that they would not build houses, etc. so that you may live long (Jeremiah 35:7). Because of this, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: There shall [never] cease to be a man of the line of Jonadab, etc. (Jeremiah 35:19). And they are still in the land of Eden and they will live forever. Rabbi Judah the Prince's grandson, due to his great humility and righteousness, he was of a lowly spirit. He never lifted his eyes even towards his wife, all the more so towards the wife of his fellow. And due to his great modesty and fear [of God], he merited to enter the Garden of Eden while living. Why Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Levi? Since he never asked [to annul] his oath, and [due to] that which happened with the angel of death. Eliezer, because he said, &quot;I am a descendant of Cham who was cursed together with his descendants by Noah to be a servant to his brothers forever. It is better for me to serve a servant of God, may He be blessed, and not to serve a servant of idolatry.&quot; So he converted and stood with Abraham to learn humility, righteousness, and justice. Come and see his humility! For when they wanted to honor him greatly in Aram Neharaim, he belittled himself and said: I am the servant of Abraham (Genesis 24:34). And also [because] he was suspected of something that was not true about him. </p>

              <p>כל יוצא צבא בישראל, “every one who goes to join the army among the Israelites.” Rashi comments that we learn from this verse that no one under the age of twenty is to join the army, something that corresponds to what we learned in Avot, בן עשרים לרדוף, “at the age of twenty one has matured enough to give chase.” (Avot, 5,25) It is possible to interpret the words כל יוצא צבא, as referring to all the men old enough to participate in general assemblies of the people. We know that every such general assembly is described as צבא, as for instance in לצבא צבא לעבודה באהל מועד, “to take part in the assembly around the Tent of Meeting in order to perform service” (Numbers 4,23). Another example of such a meaning of the word צבא would be the well-known term צבא השמים, “heavenly assemblies.” (Deut 4,19 and 15 other examples throughout the Bible) This is the reason why men participating in wars are not just described as חיילים, or אנשים לבושים בדים, “soldiers, or men wearing uniforms, but as יוצאי צבא, similar to יוצאי שער עירו, (Genesis 24,34) “all those assembled in the public square of his town.”

              <p>(35-48) Interessant ist ein Vergleich der Erzählung im Munde Eliesers mit dem vorhergehenden Bericht des wirklichen Vorganges. Alle Abweichungen motivieren sich auf den ersten Blick entweder aus Höflichkeitsrücksichten, wie schon einiges bemerkt oder aus dem Bestreben, den Leuten, die Elieser wohl durchschaute, das Ganze mundgerecht zu machen. Das הקרה נא und alles, was Eliesers Sorge über das Gelingen in den Augen der Leute zu auffallend groß hätte erscheinen lassen und sie misstrauisch machen können, bleibt weg. Ebenso alle die zarten Nuancen, die der obige Bericht enthält. Bei einer gewissen Klasse Menschen ists durchaus gefährlich, gefühlvoll zu erscheinen, sie nennen das &quot;romantisch&quot;, &quot;überspannt&quot;, und fangen an, an der praktischen Solidität des Verhältnisses zu zweifeln, in welches sie eingehen sollen.

              <p>“In her old age” [24:36]. Eliezer said that Sarah, my master’s proper wife, gave birth in her old age and Abraham willed everything to him. Hizkuni writes that Eliezer said, she had given birth in her old age. That is, she would not have any other children. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:36.)  The son will inherit everything. He is very beloved, because he was born in their old age. Toldot Yizhak writes. Eliezer praised his master, Abraham, since the people thought, if Isaac is a fine young man and Abraham had his fortune, why did he have to send so far from his land to take a wife for his son? He could certainly have found a wife at home. The explanation is that this is why Eliezer had to speak so long. He said: my master Abraham is still very rich. Do not think that he has become impoverished. Isaac is a fine young man and not an evildoer or an idler. He was born through a miracle when Sarah was ninety years old. You can well understand that the Holy One will send a good son. Therefore, do not be afraid. Isaac is good and pious. That is why Eliezer said, “the Lord has greatly blessed my master” [24:35]. That is, do not think that the goods and camels that I am showing you belong to strangers. It is customary that often one takes money, silver and gold and displays it for the sake of a match. Therefore, he said: my master Abraham was blessed by God with this wealth and had no need to borrow. Rather, I have been sent to you because my master did not want to take a wife for his son from the daughters of the Canaanites. My master made me swear that I should not take a daughter of the Canaanites, but from his family. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:35–37.) </p>

            <summary>Avraham gave all his possessions to Yitzchok, despite the Talmud's denial of a father's right to transfer his estate from an unworthy son to a worthy one. The issue of disinheritance of Yishmael is resolved by the suggestion that both Avraham and Yishmael were converts, who do not legally inherit from each other. Additionally, Avraham may have given everything to Yitzchok before the sons of Keturah were born, as indicated in Genesis 24,36.</summary>

                <h4>Da'at Zekenim on Genesis 25:5:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>ויתן אברהם את כל אשר לו ליצחק, “Avraham gave all that was his to Yitzchok.” How could he have done so, seeing that the Talmud in tractate Baba batra folio 133 denies a father the right to transfer his estate even from a unworthy son to a worthy son, the reason being that the son from whom his potential inheritance is taken away may have a worthy son himself, whereas the son to whom it has been transferred may have an unworthy son. (Compare Talmud tractate Pessachim 49) We read in Job 27,17 concerning the definition of a righteous person that יכין וצדיק ילבש וכסף נקי יחלק, “the just will put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.” [The problem is how could Avraham disinherit his firstborn son Yishmael legally? Ed.] It is especially puzzling since according to the Talmud in tractate Yuma folio 28, credits him with even having observed Rabbinic ordinances, such as certain procedures for preparing food when a festival day is followed by the Sabbath when preparing food is forbidden. We have to conclude that both Avraham and Yishmael were actually converts, neither having been born as Jews. Converts do not legally inherit their fellow converts, neither by Biblical law nor by Rabbinic decree. (Talmud tractate Kidushin folio 17). Rabbeinu Chananel bar Sh’muel suggests that Avraham gave all he had to Yitzchok before the sons of Keturah had been born, This is indicated by this having been reported already in Genesis 24,36: where he is reported immediately after Sarah having given birth to him as receiving all of his father’s estate. [Seeing that Yishmael, as Hagar’s son was the son of a slave woman, he could not legally own anything that had been Avraham’s or Sarah’s as slaves do not own their master’s or their mistress’ property. So where was the problem? Ed.]</p>

              <p>And she will not be willing to follow you. [This comment] solves three problems. First, [in v. 38] it connects תלך to לא, as if it were written אם לא תלך אל בית אבי. [This solves the problem] that לא does not fit with [its following word] אל. Second, [Rashi’s addition of] “And she will not be willing to follow you” [solves the problem] that otherwise it would imply: as soon as you go to my father’s house you will be absolved of the oath not to take a wife from the Canaanites, whether or not she is willing to follow you. [Third, in the phrase, “Unless you first go...”] Rashi adds the word “first” [to solve the problem] that otherwise it would imply: if you take a wife from the Canaanites, and afterwards go [to my family,] and she is not willing to follow you, you still will be absolved of my oath. But this is not so, as Eliezer was not allowed [to take a Canaanite wife] unless he first went [to Avraham’s family] and she would not be willing to follow him. [Accordingly, the final phrase in v. 38,] “Take a wife for my son,” begins a new sentence. It is as if saying: “Rather, you should take a wife for my son from my family, as mentioned above.” </p>

            <summary>The text compares the generations of Isaac and Ishmael, emphasizing the righteousness of Isaac over Ishmael by using the analogy of a donkey's foal that temporarily gains a pleasant smell from rose oil but ultimately reverts to its original state. It highlights the difference in the wives chosen for Isaac and Ishmael, with Isaac's wife coming from Abraham's family while Ishmael's wife was an Egyptian handmaid, indicating a distinction in their lineage and righteousness.</summary>

              <p>[4] Another interpretation: These are the generations of Isaac. But haven't we already heard &quot;These are the generations of Ishmael&quot; (Genesis 25:12)? Here we have &quot;These are the generations of Isaac, son of Abraham&quot;. One might think that they are similar, God forbid, but &quot;the Lord knows the way of the righteous&quot; (Psalm 1:6). This can be compared to a donkey's foal that fell into a rose oil, and although its smell became pleasant from the rose oil, in the end it returns to its previous state. So too with the donkey's foal, which is the Egyptian handmaid, as it is written &quot;Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys&quot; (Ezekiel 23:20), she cleaved to Abraham and bore Ishmael, and it is written &quot;These are the generations of Ishmael, son of Abraham.&quot; But in the end, she returned to her previous state, as it is written &quot;And his mother took for him a wife from the land of Egypt&quot; (Genesis 21:21), who was the Egyptian handmaid. However, look at what Abraham commanded for him, that his servant Eliezer should not take a wife for him from the daughters of Canaan, but rather from Abraham's family (Genesis 24:38). Therefore, &quot;These are the generations of Isaac&quot; and so on, but &quot;Ishmael, these are the generations of Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maidservant, bore to Abraham&quot; (Genesis 25:12).</p>

              <p>עד בכור השפחה, according to Rashi, seeing that most commentators here understand the words בכור השפחה, to be identical to בכור השבי in 12,29, they use that term in their commentary on this verse. They assume that Rashi agreed seeing that nearly all prisoners of war become slaves. [According to my understanding of Rashi on 2,29, there are degrees in the hierarchy of slaves. The Torah uses both terms, as the slave who was a prisoner of war is considered as at the rockbottom of that hierarchy. Ed.] Another reason for the two terms being used by the Torah for servant women; when the firstborn sons of servant maids heard Moses use the term שפחה in our verse, they decided to become captives so as to escape the threat of being killed. Upon noticing this, G-d said: while it is true that I had only spoken about the firstborn of the servant maid being killed, now I must include also the firstborn of a woman prisoner. A different interpretation: the expression בכור השבי is subordinate to the general heading of בכור השפחה. The prophets in their way of expressing themselves (as opposed to the Torah itself) do not bother with stylistic effects but are concerned with the basics. Such nuances as השקני “let me drink,” as opposed to הגמאיני, “let me sip,” when Eliezer is quoted as speaking to Rivkah, (Genesis 24,38) or the two versions of the commandment to keep the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments no less, i.e. in Yitro it says: זכור for “remember,” whereas in the Book of Deuteronomy, the text of which is attributed to Moses, it says: שמור to express the same commandment, or minor differences such as swearing a false oath which in Yitro is described as לשוא, and in Leviticus 19,12, לשקר, or differences such as לא תחמוד, for “do not covet,” and לא תתאוה, in the version of the Ten Commandments in Deuteronomy 5,18, are to be viewed as if two sides of the same coin. [My words, Ed.] Both expressions convey the same basic thought. Still another explanation: when Moses said: ומת כל בכור, “and every firstborn will die,” the firstborn of the maidservants rejoiced noting that they are not considered in the eyes of the Jewish G-d from the firstborn of the nobility. When their masters noted their joy, they threw them in a dungeon to teach them a lesson and not to forget their place in the Egyptian hierarchy. As a result they died, while still in the dungeon. In effect what happened is simply that the first born who had been only slaves at the time the plague had been announced had become also prisoners by the time the plague became effective.</p>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Bereshit 12:1:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>King Solomon warns people in this verse to try and move within circles of scholars and at the same time to try and avoid keeping company with fools. The reason he uses the expression הולך, is that a person should always walk behind the scholars, become familiar with them, and consider himself as an adjunct to them. He should make of the scholars leaders for his “head.” Anyone who practices this virtue cannot fail to become wise himself.  On the other hand, anyone who habitually mingles with fools will wind up causing harm to his own head, i.e. he will become “broken.” Basically, this verse in Proverbs describes the damage which results from keeping company with fools and the advantage which accrues to a person from the company of scholars. It is a fact that while someone who mingles with the scholars will benefit by such an association, the scholar will not suffer by it at all. This is the reason the Torah has been compared by David to a light (candle), seeing that an unlimited number of people can get light from this candle without the light of the candle becoming dimmed. This is the meaning of Psalms 119, 108 נר לרגלי דברך, ואור לנתיבתי’ “Your word is a lamp at my feet, a light for my path.”  Our sages in Yalkut Shimoni (this book was not at the disposal of the author. Ed) comment on this verse in Proverbs that the matter may be compared to someone who enters a perfumery store. His clothing will absorb some of the fragrances in that store although he did not make a purchase of any of the products that are for sale there. In other words, the owner of that store provided a service for the browser without making a sale. Similarly, the mere fact that one is in the presence of scholars results in something rubbing off on those who make a point of being in such company. Solomon describes that the opposite is true when one frequents the haunts of fools. Not only is their presence not beneficial, but it is even harmful to those who are not of their ilk.  The expression כסילים which Solomon applies to these fools are people who deliberately choose negative virtues, indulge in physical pleasures as their main purpose in life and who at the same time despise and ridicule people concerned with moral/intellectual pursuits. Such people do not qualify for admonition as they belong to one of the three categories of people who are not to be admonished. They are 1) כסילים, fools, 2) לצים, scoffers, 3) רשעים, wicked people. Concerning category one Solomon said (Proverbs 23,9) “do not speak to a fool; he will disdain your sensible words.” Concerning the scoffer, Solomon said (Proverbs 9,8) “do not admonish the scoffer lest he hate you.” Concerning the wicked, Solomon said (Proverbs 9,7) “rebuking a wicked person one hurts oneself.” Just as the very company of scholars is like an open invitation to serve the Lord, so the company of the other types of people we mentioned is like an invitation to reject the service of the Lord. The Torah writes in Deut. 7,4 “for he will lead astray your son (grandson) from following Me. The Torah spoke about the results of intermarriage of a Jewish girl with a Gentile. Although, technically speaking, the children of such a union will be Jews, the influence of the Gentile father and his family will estrange them to Judasim.  For all the above considerations David commenced his Book of Psalms with praise for the people who resist keeping company with the habitual sinners, and who instead make the Torah of G-d the object of their ambition, preoccupying themselves with it both by day ad by night (Psalms 1,1-2).  Solomon followed in the footsteps of his father when he commenced the Book of Proverbs (1,8) with the words שמע בני מוסר אביך, “listen to the instruction of your father my son; etc.” He continued immediately by warning that we should not expose ourselves to the seductive words of the wicked (1,10).  Our patriarch Avraham made every effort to observe the eventual laws of the Torah and the sacrificial services; our sages illustrated this when they said (Yuma 28) that he even observed such rabbinic ordinances as עירוב תבשילים, ensuring that he had cooked and baked food in the house for the Sabbath which follows on the heels of a festival so that preparation of food on the festival itself would not be viewed as exploiting a day when work is forbidden to prepare for the Sabbath. Avraham faced the dilemma of keeping away from wicked people, people who were the cause of truly free choice of worship having become impossible. Once you have become a true heretic (compare Maimonides Hilchot Teshuvah) you are not given a chance to repent). This is why G-d told him to move away from such people so that he would not become infected by them. G-d sent him away from his land, his birthplace to a land which He was going to show him (once he had set out to leave his home).  According to Tanchuma 3 on Lech Lecha, Avraham was not aware of the stench caused by the people amongst whom he lived as his environment was similar to a graveyard which had been sprinkled with a bottle of spikenard oil which neutralized the stench which emanates from there. How did G-d deal with this problem? He took Avraham from place to place and acquainted him with the different smells of the universe. In this manner Avraham was able to appreciate what was wrong in the world, and he would be trained not to become overwhelmed by the stench caused by the lifestyles of his contemporaries. Then came the point when G-d said to Avraham: “remove yourself from them and do not become dirtied by them.” This is the meaning of the words לך לך, i.e. “it is time that you by yourself.” The repetition of the letters לך לך allude to the word לכלך, dirt. G-d did not want him to become dirtied by his surroundings.  This was the first of the ten trials Avraham had to undergo; he successfully coped with all of them. The final and greatest trial was when G-d told him to offer up his son Yitzchak on Mount Moriah. At that time G-d again introduced the trial with the words לך לך in order to compare his first trial to his last trial. The commandment of which the Torah speaks here at the beginning of chapter 12 was issued while Avraham was in Charan as this was his country and his birthplace. Concerning that place Avraham said later (23,2 when he instructed Eliezer to get a wife for Yitzchak): “but go only to my country and to my birthplace!” It was certainly a great trial for him to leave his country and the place he had been born and raised in, the place where he had dwelled with his whole family, and to go to an entirely unknown country.  Remember that prior to G-d’s communication to Avraham telling him to move away from home, it would have been appropriate for the Torah to tell us something about Avraham’s virtues, just as the Torah had done before it reported that G-d issued commands to Noach before him. We must assume that the reason the Torah did not do so was because it had already hinted previously that Avraham was a person of exceptional qualities when the Torah referred to אור כשדים, as we explained on 11,28.</p>

        <summary>Eliezer hinted at his desire for his daughter to marry Yitzchok by using the word &quot;perhaps&quot; without the letter ו, indicating his secret aspirations (Radak, Tur HaArokh, Siftei Chakhamim, Rashi). Eliezer's potential curse as a Canaanite slave made him more cursed than others, preventing him from uniting with a blessed individual like Yitzchok (Siftei Chakhamim). Eliezer's use of the word &quot;perhaps&quot; without the ו also indicated his flattery towards his hosts, suggesting that he could have prevented the union and offered his daughter as a bride (Chizkuni). Radak explains that the angel's response to Sarah's doubt about conceiving a child was a general statement about God's power, similar to Eliezer's mission explanation to Abraham. The angel did not address Sarah's mention of her husband's old age because her menopause was a greater impediment to conception. Rashi notes that Eliezer's use of &quot;perhaps&quot; without a vav indicated he wanted Isaac to marry his daughter, but Abraham rejected the idea due to Isaac's blessing and Eliezer's perceived curse. In Genesis 24:39, Onkelos translates Abraham's concern about finding a suitable wife for Isaac as questioning whether the woman will come back with him, while Targum Jonathan interprets it as questioning whether the woman will follow him to Canaan.</summary>

              <p>אלי לא תלך האשה אחרי, “perhaps the woman (that I chose) will not follow me. (to this land).” Rashi comments on this that it is remarkable that the word: ulay here is spelled without the letter ו after the first letter as we would have expected, and that this is a hint by Eliezer who had a daughter, that he secretly hoped that the refusal of a potential bride from Avraham’s family to move to the land of Canaan, might make his master Avraham willing to let her become Yitzchok’s wife. [Rashi bases himself on an interpretation by B’reshit Rabbah on why in the report of the conversation between Avraham and Eliezer on the same subject in 24,5 that letter ו is not missing. Ed.] It is difficult to understand why he did not write this comment already on verse eight in this chapter where Avraham had not excluded a marital union with the daughters of any of his three friends Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre, although they were Canaanites, and not slaves from Damascus, and Avraham had Eliezer released him from his oath in the event that a girl from Charan were to refuse to move to the land of Canaan. We must assume that Avraham had felt that the curse that rested on Canaan had already run its course, whereas the curse on Eliezer’s antecedents had not yet run its course, so that marriage into that family would be spiritually much more dangerous. B’reshit Rabbah 59,9, states specifically that Eliezer was a descendant of Cham, whose son Canaan Noach had cursed. In the book: Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer, chapter 15, Eliezer is identified with Og King of Bashan, whom the Israelites slew in a battle during their last year in the desert. [My edition of Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer does not have this, and my research of a lengthy article about Og by Dr Admiel Kosman of the Bar Ilan university, also does not bring any source for that statement. Ed.] According to our author, the following is the text in his edition of Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer. “Eliezer has been described as the most senior servant, and added that he was a servant for evermore. When he did Yitzchok a great favour by choosing a wonderful wife for him, Yitzchok freed him forever. G–d then rewarded Og by making him King of Bashan. If this is true, why did G–d order Moses to kill Og as a punishment for defending his country against invaders? According to Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer he was a perfectly righteous man! We also know from the Talmud, tractate Sofrim chapter 21, as well as from Derech Eretz zuttah, tractate Sotah, 1, that he was one of only nine people who immediately upon drawing their last breath had their souls transferred to the spiritual hereafter. This matter was discussed in connection with a tradition that when Yitzchok first joined Rivkah in the marital bed, and found that she was not a virgin, he suspected Eliezer as having been to blame for this. He said to him: “may you live as long and enter paradise as you are innocent of my accusation!” In light of all the above, we must assume that there had been two Kings called King of Bashan, one during Avraham’s lifetime and another during Moses’ lifetime. It was the former who was so righteous. Each one of these two persons, once crowned king, used the title King of Bashan, seeing that all of Bashan’s king were called Og, just as all of Egypt’s kings were called Pharaoh.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ואמר... אלי, the word veulai is spelled with the letter ו missing, something which gave rise to an interesting aggadic interpretation mentioned already by Rashi. Accordingly, Eliezer himself had hoped to have his daughter marry Yitzchok in the event that the woman he found in Aram Naharyim would be unwilling to relocate in the land of Canaan. This is why he had referred to this possibility with the words אלי, לא תלך האשה אחרי, “to me (if) the woman will not follow me (to the land of Canaan).” The truth is that Eliezer related all the events exactly as they had occurred. We are not able to provide conclusive reasons why the Torah sometimes chose to write certain words defectively, (with a letter missing) or by adding a letter which could have been omitted. There are too many such instances for us to find satisfactory explanations for all of them. Eliezer related the events that had occurred to him in his conversation with his master as well as how G’d had arranged things after he had set out on his mission. His sole purpose was to demonstrate from the course of events that G’d loved Avraham so much that He had made his mission so spectacularly successful up to this point. G’d had responded even to his own prayer in exactly the manner in which he had hoped he would. As a result, the very idea of denying his request would appear out of the question, seeing that it was so clear that the entire sequence of events must have been engineered by G’d, personally. If we find some different nuances here and there in the events as reported by the Torah and as related by Eliezer, this is meaningless, just as different nuances in the wording of the Ten Commandments in the Book of Exodus and the Book of Deuteronomy are not meant to raise concerns as to their authenticity of either version. Everything until the word ועתה in verse 49 is quite clear.

              <p>אלי לא תלך האשה PERADVENTURE THE WOMAN WILL NOT FOLLOW ME —The word אולי perhaps is written without ו so that it may be read אֵלַי unto me. Eliezer had a daughter and he was endeavouring to find some reason why Abraham should say that he must appeal to him (Eliezer) that he should give his daughter in marriage to Isaac. Abraham said to him, “My son is blessed and you are subject to a curse. One who is under a curse cannot unite with one who is blessed” (Genesis Rabbah 59:9).</p>

              <p>It is written אלי. Eliezer had a daughter... You might ask: Above (v. 5), when Eliezer first said to Avraham, “Perhaps (אולי) the woman will not be willing,” why was it not spelled אלי there, for this exposition? The answer is: There, it is followed by, “Shall I bring your son back to the land from where you came?” There, it does not imply that Eliezer was looking for an excuse. Rather, he was asking: if she will not come with me, should I bring Yitzchok to them? But here, since this is not written afterwards, it is for this exposition. (Mahara’i) Another answer: After Lavan said to Eliezer (v. 31), “Come, you who are blessed of Hashem,” Eliezer thought: “Now I am blessed! Perhaps Yitzchok will marry my daughter.” Thus here, it is spelled אלי, for this exposition. But above, Eliezer was not yet blessed. The Maharshal answers: Eliezer never thought he would become Avraham’s in-law, because Avraham was blessed but he was cursed. Rather, Eliezer feared that once he told them he was under oath to take a wife specifically from Avraham’s family, they would extort him for a great sum of money. Thus he told them אלי, to hint to them that he had a daughter. </p>

The answer is: The curse was actualized in Eliezer, as he was a slave. Thus, he was more cursed than they. This resolves the difficulty of Re’m on v. 8.</p>

              <p>אלי לא תלך, “maybe she is not willing to go, etc.” the word “perhaps,” אולי, is spelled here without the customary letter ו, which prompts Rashi to suggest that Eliezer had a daughter whom he would have liked to be married to Yitzchok.. Since he did not dare suggest this to Avraham, the first time the word אולי appears in this connection it is spelled in the ordinary manner; only now when Avraham was not present, and the whole matter was hanging in the balance, did the Torah hint to the reader about Eliezer’s secret aspirations.

              <p>“I said to my master, what if the woman does not want to follow me?” [24:39]. Eliezer said: I said to my master, perhaps the woman will not want to follow me. Abraham said: the Holy One will send his angel for this. (Bahya, Genesis, 24:15.)  Rashi writes. Why is perhaps written without a vav? This teaches us that Eliezer said to Abraham: give my daughter to your son Isaac. Abraham responded: my son Isaac was blessed by God and you and your daughter are cursed. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:39.)  That is why perhaps is written without a vav. That is to say, Eliezer said: your son Isaac should come along. Hizkuni writes. The Torah showed here that Eliezer desired that Isaac should take his daughter and did not show this above in the Torah portion, when Abraham said to Eliezer, take a wife for my son from my family. The explanation is that Eliezer was like a matchmaker and praised Isaac before Rebecca’s father and mother. He said: I would have gladly given my own daughter to Isaac, but Abraham did not want it. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:39.) </p>

            <summary>Radak explains that the angel's response to Sarah's doubt about conceiving a child was a general statement about God's power, similar to Eliezer's mission explanation to Abraham. The angel did not address Sarah's mention of her husband's old age because her menopause was a greater impediment to conception. Rashi notes that Eliezer's use of &quot;perhaps&quot; without a vav indicated he wanted Isaac to marry his daughter, but Abraham rejected the idea due to Isaac's blessing and Eliezer's perceived curse.</summary>

              <p>?האף אמנם אלד, will such a miracle indeed occur on my behalf even though I am that old? Even though the angel did not answer her point by point, he did answer her with an overall statement that there simply is nothing which is beyond G’d’s power to accomplish if he so desires. Our author uses a similar approach when examining the words Eliezer used in explaining his mission in Genesis 24,39. There too, the fact that he conveyed the content of what he had asked Avraham before undertaking his mission was important, the exact wording was not the issue. The angel did not even bother to reply to Sarah’s statement that her husband too was too old to impregnate her with semen. The reason he did not do so was that Sarah having had her menopause was the far greater natural impediment to her becoming pregnant. It is not altogether unknown for old men to father children even in their advanced old age.</p>

Ed.] He did not refer to the angel described in Exodus 33,2 ושלחתי לפניך מלאך, “I will send an angel ahead of you.” [In that instance G’d’s benevolent providence had been reduced to a more indirect level, as evidenced by the absence of the suffix ו, “His” at the end of the word מלאך. Here the word מלאכו appears twice, indicating that there were two angels active to ensure the success of Eliezer’s mission. (compare 24,7) The first angel’s mission was to keep harm from befalling Eliezer and his men; the second angel was to ensure the arrival of the right girl at the right place at the right time.

            <summary>The Talmud Sotah 2 explains that marriage partners are determined based on a person's deeds and moral accomplishments, which can augment or neutralize their predetermined mazzal. This is exemplified by Abraham and Sarah overcoming sterility through merit, resulting in Isaac being born with excellent mazzal. Choosing a suitable life partner is crucial for achieving one's maximum potential, with the original &quot;woman&quot; (genetic and environmental equipment) meant to aid in spiritual pursuits, while the wife is meant to help navigate the challenges of the world. This highlights the importance of selecting a partner who can support one's growth and spiritual journey.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>The Talmud Sotah 2 also says that marriage partners are provided for man only in accordance with his deeds, his moral accomplishments. This statement does not contradict the statement about the angel predetermining who should marry whom. The idea portrayed is that the partner that comes with a person at birth is the genetic and environmental equipment which we commonly term mazzal. When man chooses a wife, however, he does so on the basis of the merit he has acquired since his birth. The original mazzal can be augmented or neutralized in one of two ways. 1) Man remains free to overcome natural handicaps by willpower, determination, perseverance etc. 2) G-d extends active help, hashgachah peratit, based on that individual's merit. It is customary for mazzal and merit to complement each other. This was so in the case of Abraham who was born with many positive endowments, i.e. mazzal tov. By meriting G-d’s help, he was able to neutralize the one area in which he had been disadvantaged at birth, his sterility. This accomplishment on the part of Abraham and Sarah resulted in their son Isaac being born with excellent environmental and hereditary factors, mazzal tov. By the time Jacob was born, the mazzal had improved even further due to environmental and hereditary input of two generations. Life in an environment of an Abraham and an Isaac does create certain tendencies which then become part of one's mazzal. In this connection we observe Abraham telling his servant Eliezer, who was concerned about his chances of finding the right wife for Isaac, that the G-d who had seen fit to promise the land of Canaan to his descendants and who had protected them thus far, would intervene to facilitate the finding of the proper wife for Isaac (Genesis 24,40). All this underscores the importance of choosing a suitable life partner, one that can help one achieve one's maximum potential. The original &quot;woman,&quot; i.e. the equipment man receives at birth, is meant to help man work towards his olam haba, eternity, by employing his intellect etc. The second &quot;woman,&quot; his wife, is meant to smooth his path in this world, help him cope with the problems of a mundane existence, and in that process to free him for pursuits of a spiritual nature. It is for this reason that throughout the Bible both “man” and &quot;woman&quot; appear side by side. &quot;Male and female He created them-- the side He had taken from man into a woman&quot; (Genesis 2). </p>

Noach was afraid to mix with the corrupt society he lived in and isolated himself with only G–d as his companion because he was afraid of the possible influence on him of contemporary society. Abraham was not only confident that he would not succumb to the corrupt society around him, but he tried to lead his fellow-men back to the path of monotheism and a life of good deeds.

He sent him on a mission to warn his contemporaries to repent of their wicked ways. The Torah however, records only מקצת שבחו בפניו, וכלו שלא בפניו. The usual meaning of this concept is that one does not reveal all of a person's merits while he is alive, whereas when eulogizing such a person one must reveal all his merits. In this instance the meaning of שלא בפינו is that Noach did not initiate his role as the conscience of mankind, but he was prompted to do so by G–d.</p>

            <summary>Radak explains that serving the Lord involves both thoughts and deeds, as exemplified by King Chiskiyah. God commanded Avram to perform circumcision as a unique mark for his descendants, specifically for Yitzchok's special seed. Rashi contrasts Noah, who needed God's support for righteousness, with Abraham, who drew moral strength from himself. Ramban clarifies that Abraham wanted a wife for Isaac from his family, not from his country, which he interprets as Haran where his ancestors came from. Abraham stayed in Canaan longer than Haran, so Haran is called his country only because he lived there for a time.</summary>

                <h4>Radak on Genesis 17:1:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>התהלך לפני, as rendered by Onkelos, &quot;serve Me&quot; by carrying out what I command you ( in order to become perfect). This is also that meaning of the word התהלך in Genesis 24,40 as well as in Genesis 48,15. It is a reference to serving the lord in thought and deed. All service of the Lord is rooted in man's heart. This is why King Chiskiyah in Kings II 20,3 in his prayer says: אני ה' דבר נא את אשר התהלכתי לפניך באמת ובלבב שלם, &quot;please o Lord remember how I have served you in truth and with a pure heart, etc.&quot; Chiskiyah first refers to his serving G'd with his heart, before mentioning that he had performed deeds which constituted service of the Lord also, when he said והטוב בעיניך עשיתי, &quot;and I have done what is pleasing in Your eyes.&quot; At this juncture G'd commands Avram that He will require additional service from him, service to be performed on his own body. He had already proven that his heart was pure. He had also already perfected his personality traits to the extent that his mind and intelligence had suggested such improvements. This form of service to be performed on his body was something that his mind and reason would reject as illogical. G'd demanded this only in order for the people whom Avraham would produce would be recognizable by the circumcision of their body as unique, as wearing the mark of G'd. Even though many of the gentiles do circumcise themselves also, they do not do so in response to a command by G'd. Only the special seed of Avram, i.e. Yitzchok was included in this command. Also Yitzchok's special seed was included in that command, [i.e. according to our author Ishmael's children and Esau's children as well as the sons Avraham had by Keturah would not have been included in this commandment. Because of these considerations G'd commanded the circumcision before Yitzchok would be born or even conceived. Any convert, not alive at that time but joining the Jewish people and its faith are therefore described as being בני אברהם &quot;descendants, sons of Avraham,&quot; [This is an additional meaning of the name change from Avram to Avraham, foretelling him that he would become the spiritual father of all future converts. Ed.]</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 24:7:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>FROM MY FATHER’s HOUSE, ‘UMEI’ERETZ MOLAD’TI’ (AND FROM THE LAND OF MY NATIVITY). Rashi comments: “From my father’s house — from Haran. And from the land of my nativity — from Ur of the Chaldees.” If this is so, the expression, Unto my country and to ‘molad’ti’ thou shalt go, (Verse 4 here.)  must also refer to Ur of the Chaldees. But Heaven forbid that the sacred seed should mix with the sons of Ham, (The Chaldees and the entire land of Shinar belonged to the sons of Ham. See Ramban, above, 11:28.)  the sinful one! (Above, 9:22-24.)  Even if one would say that Abraham had some family there from the seed of Shem, the fact is however that the servant went to Haran as his master said! Now perhaps the Rabbi [Rashi] thinks that eretz molad’to (Verse 4 here.) (the land of his birth) was Ur of the Chaldees, but molad’ti (Verse 4 here.)  means “my family,” and my country (Verse 4 here.)  means the land wherein he lived. But all these are futile words since here, in the verse before us, he said, And thou shalt take a wife for my son from there, [and according to Rashi, who explained ume’eretz molad’ti, mentioned in this verse, as meaning Ur of the Chaldees, it would follow that Abraham commanded Eliezer to go there to get a wife from the children of Ham]! Moreover, Abraham stayed in the land of Canaan for a longer period than he did in Haran, and so why should Haran be called his country simply because he lived there for some time? Instead, the meaning of the expression, unto my country and to ‘molad’ti’, (Verse 4 here.)  is “unto my country in which I was born,” [namely, Haran in Mesopotamia], for there he stayed and from there his ancestors came, as was already explained. (See Ramban above, 11:28 and 12:1.)  In Bereshith Rabbah we find: (59:13.)  “From my father’s house — this is the house of his father. And from the land of my birth — this is the environs [of his father’s house].” It is possible that unto my country and unto ‘molad’ti’ means “Unto my country and unto my family,” for he did not want a wife to be taken for Isaac even from the people of his country but only from his family. Similarly in the verse, And thou shalt take a wife for my son from there, [the word misham (from there)] alludes to the expression, from my father’s house, mentioned at the beginning of the verse. And so did the servant say when quoting Abraham, And thou shalt take a wife for my son of my family, and of my father’s house, (Further, Verse 40.)  and again he said, quoting his master. Then shalt thou be clear from my oath when thou comest to my family. (Ibid., Verse 41.)  These words were said by the servant to honor them so that they would listen to him.</p>

It is the Torah’s compliment for Eliezer by G-d Himself. According to the plain meaning the reason for the repetition is that the Torah wished to describe Eliezer’s oath to Avraham as one part of the story and his prayer to G-d to help him find a girl such as Rivkah as his own initiative, for how else would he meet a blood relation of his master as the very first girl that came out to draw water. His hosts were suitably impressed, so that they agreed that this match must reflect the will of G-d. (verse 50)</p>

(So that they should not eat vegetation belonging to a private individual.)   “And all his master’s goods in his hand” – Rabbi Ḥelbo said: This refers to his will. (In it, he bequeathed all his belongings to Isaac.)   “He arose and went to Aram Naharayim” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: [He arrived] on that same day. This is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak [elsewhere]: “I came today to the spring” (Genesis 24:42) – today I departed and today I arrived.   “You made the land quake; You shattered it. Heal its shards, for it has toppled” (The Midrash interprets all these descriptions as references to incidents in which someone was able to reach long distances in a short amount of time, as if the ground itself contracted for him.)  (Psalms 60:4). “You made the land quake” – in the days of Abraham; (See Genesis Rabba 43:3.)  “you shattered it” – in the days of Eliezer; “heal its shards” – in the days of Jacob; (See Genesis Rabba 68:8.)  “for it has toppled” – in the days of Yishbi Benov. That is what is written: “Yishbi Benov, who was of the offspring of the giant” (II Samuel 21:16). He wielded his shield, and David leapt backwards eighteen cubits. (From the force of the shield.)  This one feared that one, and that one feared this one. This one [Yishbi Benov] feared [David], saying: ‘If this is how he leaps backwards, what can he do going forward?’ And that one [David] feared this one [Yishbi Benov], saying: ‘If he can wield his shield like this, how can I stand against him?’ David said: ‘If only I had one of my sister’s sons to come and aid me.’ Immediately, “Avishai son of Tzeruya came to his aid” (II Samuel 21:17). Was he standing behind the door [that he arrived so quickly]? That is a rhetorical question. The Rabbis say: Even if he was at the other end of the world, the Holy One blessed be He flew him and brought him in the blink of an eye, so that that righteous one [David] should not have to stand there in distress. That is what is written: “Avishai son of Tzeruya came to his aid and smote the Philistine and put him to death. Then David’s men took an oath [to him, saying]: You will not go out with us to battle [any longer], so that you not extinguish the lamp of Israel” (II Samuel 21:17).  “He made his camels crouch outside the city by a well of water at the time of evening, at the time that the women go out to draw water” (Genesis 24:11).  “He made his camels crouch outside the city” – he had them go on their knees.</p>

                <h4>Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Vayetzei 8:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 28:10): BUT JACOB SET OUT. This is one of four children of Adam for whom the land (i.e., spatial distance) was contracted. They are the following: Abraham, Eleazer, Jacob, and Abishai. (Cf. Sanh. 95 (bar.), which omits Abraham from the list.)  In the case of Abraham, where is it shown? &lt; It was &gt; when he went forth to pursue the kings &lt; that &gt; the land contracted before him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 14:15): AND THE NIGHT WAS DIVIDED AGAINST THEM. (I.e., Abraham only needed to pursue the kings until midnight because God had shortened the pursuit. So Gen. R. 43:3; Exod. R. 18:1; cf. Gen. R. 43:3.)  And in the case of Eleazer, where is it shown? &lt; It was &gt; when he went to bring a wife for Isaac &lt; that &gt; the land contracted before him. (Sanh. 95a; PRE 16.)  What is written about him (in Gen. 24:42)? AND I CAME TODAY (i.e., in one day) TO THE SPRING. The day he set out was the very day on which he arrived. And in the case of Abishai, where is it shown? When he fought with Ishbi-benob the brother of Goliath. (See also Gen. R. 59:11.)  What did he do? He went after David with his shield at the ready. In that hour the Holy One put the fear of David upon him, since he said: How swift this man is! Where are David and his mighty men? And where is it shown? Where it is so written (in II Sam. 21:15): AND DAVID WAS WEARY. At that time David had said: Oh, that someone would put one of my sister's sons here for me. Now Joab and Abishai were far away from him where they were fighting with the children of Ammon and with Aram (cf. I Chron. 19:10f.) However, when David prayed, the Holy One contracted the land before Abishai, as stated (in II Sam. 21:17): BUT ABISHAI BEN ZERUIAH CAME TO HIS AID. And our father Jacob was also one before whom the Holy One caused the land to contract. (Sanh. 95b; Gen. R. 68:8.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 28:10; 29:1): AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA AND WENT TO HARAN…. [THEN JACOB CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY (literally: RAISED HIS FEET)]. Our masters have said: In the case of all the children of Adam, their feet carry them; but in Jacob's case, he keeps his feet up. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 29:1): THEN JACOB RAISED HIS FEET.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>And he went toward Haran. This is one of the four occasions on which the earth contracted itself. The first occasion was at the time of Abraham: He divided himself against them at night (Gen. 14:15). It occurred again for Eliezer, as it is said: And I came this day unto the fountain (ibid. 24:42). And once again in the days of Jacob, (Reading Jacob instead of David.)  as it is said, When he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah (Ps. 60:2). And this is what is meant by: And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba (Gen. 28:10). Similarly, it occurred at the time about which David said: Thou hast made the land to shake, Thou hast cleft it; heal the branches thereof; for it tottereth (Ps. 60:4). This verse teaches us that the Holy One, blessed be He, also contracted the earth for Joab, Abishai, and the army (when they pursued Abner). (He had led the revolt against David.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>There are several difficulties in 18,2: &quot;He raised his eyes and saw three men standing by him; he saw and ran to meet them from the entrance of the tent. He bowed down to the ground.&quot; Why does the Torah repeat that Abraham &quot;saw?&quot; If the men stood beside him, why did he have to run towards them? We are familiar with what the Talmud says and Rashi quoting it, but we will ignore that for the moment. According to our approach, the repetition of the word &quot;he saw,&quot; is justified; Abraham's intellectual vision told him that these men were angels, whereas his physical vision led him to believe that they were human beings. Abraham's doubts were reinforced by the fact that he had seen angels frequently, but they had not appeared to him in the guise of human beings. The words &quot;he raised his eyes&quot; (heavenwards) indicate that he wondered if they were angels. The words נצבים עליו, are appropriate when one speaks of angels as we know from Daniel 7,16: &quot;I approached one of the standing ones and asked him, etc.&quot; We also know from Zachariah 3,7 that human beings are described as מהלכים, progressing, whereas angels are described there as בין העומדים האלה, &quot;between these stationary ones.&quot; According to Yerushalmi Berachot 1,1 המלאכים אין להם קפיצה, angels do not experience miraculous transposition from one area to another [as happened to Eliezer on his journey to Aram Naharayim for instance in Genesis 24,42, see Rashi Ed.]. Abraham afterwards saw that the appearance of these men was that of human beings. He thought that they might be Arabs, and since humans walk, move, even if they might stand still briefly, he ran towards them. When he came close to them everything that he said to them could be interpreted as appropriate both to angels and to humans. If they were angels, they would interpret what he said to them in a certain manner, whereas if they were men, they would also interpret his words as appropriate. </p>

                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 28:17:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>THIS IS NONE OTHER THAN THE HOUSE OF G-D, AND THIS IS THE GATE OF HEAVEN. This refers to the Sanctuary which is the gate through which the prayers and sacrifices ascend to heaven. Rashi comments, Rabbi Elazar the son of Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra said, ‘This ladder stood in Beer-sheba and its slope (“Its slope.” In our text of Rashi: “the middle of its slope.” Ramban will explain later that the reference is to “the end” of the slope, which is the head of the ladder.)  reached unto the Sanctuary in Jerusalem. Beer-sheba is situated in the southern part of Judah, and Jerusalem is to its north on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin, and Beth-el was in the northern portion of Benjamin’s territory, on the boundary between Benjamin’s territory and that of the children of Joseph. It follows, therefore, that a ladder whose base is in Beer-sheba and whose top is in Beth-el has its slope (“Its slope.” In our text of Rashi: “the middle of its slope.” Ramban will explain later that the reference is to “the end” of the slope, which is the head of the ladder.)  reaching opposite Jerusalem. Now regarding the statement of our Rabbis that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘This righteous man has come to the place where I dwell, [namely, the Sanctuary in Jerusalem, and shall he depart without spending the night?’], (Chullin 91b.)  and with regard to what they also said, ‘Jacob gave the name Beth-el to Jerusalem’ (Pesachim 88b.)  this place which he called Beth-el was Luz and not Jerusalem! And whence did they learn to say so, [implying that Luz is identical with Jerusalem]? I therefore say that Mount Moriah [the Temple site in Jerusalem] was forcibly removed from its place and came here to Luz, and this movement of the Temple site is ‘the springing of the earth’ which is mentioned in Tractate Shechitath Chullin. (“The slaughtering of unconsecrated beasts.” This tractate is now generally called Chullin (Unconsecrated Beasts). 91b.)  It means that the site on which the Sanctuary was later to stand came towards Jacob to Beth-el. And this too is what is meant by vayiphga bamakom (and he met the place): (Verse 11 here.)  [as two people meet, who are moving towards each other]. If you should ask, ‘When our father Jacob passed the site of the Sanctuary [on his way from Beer-sheba to Haran] why did He not detain him there?’ The answer is: If it never entered his mind to pray at the place where his fathers had prayed, should Heaven make him stop there? He had journeyed as far as Haran, as we say in the chapter of Gid Hanasheh, (“The sinew of the hip.” It is the seventh chapter of Tractate Chullin (see Note 18) 91b.)  and Scripture itself helps us clarify this point by saying, And he went to Haran. (Verse 10 here.)  When he arrived at Haran he said, ‘Is it possible that I have passed the place where my fathers prayed without praying there myself?’ He decided to return and had returned as far as Beth-el, whereupon the ground of the Temple site sprang for him until Beth-el.” All these are the words of the Rabbi. (Rashi. See also Note 139, Seder Bereshith.)  But I do not agree with them at all for ‘the springing of the earth’ which the Rabbis mention in connection with Jacob is like that which they have said happened to Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, namely, that he reached Haran in one day. As they have said in Tractate Sanhedrin, (95a.)  “The earth sprang for three persons: Eliezer, the servant of Abraham, our father Jacob, and Abishai the son of Zeruiah.” (II Samuel 21:17. In coming to the rescue of David, a miracle occurred, and he reached him at once though he was far away from him.)  And the Rabbis explained: “Eliezer, the servant of Abraham — for it is written, And I came this day unto the fountain, (Above, 24:42.)  which teaches that on that very day he embarked on his journey. Jacob — for it is written, And he met the place. (Verse 11 here.)  When he arrived at Haran he said, ‘Is it possible that I have passed the place where my fathers prayed without praying there myself?’ As soon as the thought of returning occurred to him, the earth sprang for him, and immediately he met the place.” Thus the Rabbis explicitly say that as soon as the thought to return occurred to him in Haran, the earth sprang for him and he met the place where his fathers prayed, but not that he returned to Beth-el, nor that Mount Moriah sprang and came there to Beth-el. In Bereshith Rabbah (59:15.)  the Rabbis further equated them both [Eliezer and Jacob] with respect to “the springing of the earth.” Thus they said: “And he arose, and went to Aram-naharaim (Above, 24:10.)  — on the very same day. And I came this day unto the fountain (Above, 24:42.)  — this day I embarked on the journey, and this day I arrived.” With respect to Jacob the Rabbis interpreted in a similar vein: “And he went to Haran (Verse 10 here.)  — the Rabbis say on the very same day.” And furthermore, what reason is there for Mount Moriah to “spring” and come to Beth-el, as Rashi claims, after Jacob had troubled himself to return from Haran to Beth-el, a journey of many days? (If such a miracle was to be performed, why did not Mount Moriah spring all the way to Haran?)  Moreover, Beth-el does not lie on the border of the Land of Israel which faces towards Haran for Haran is a land which lies to the east [of the Land of Israel while Beth-el lies in its western part]. (Above, 12:8.)  Additionally, the middle part of a ladder is not referred to as its “slope.” (Thus Rabbi Elazar who said that “its slope” reached to the Sanctuary did not refer to its middle, as Rashi has it.)  And, finally, what reason is there for the middle of the ladder to be opposite Beth-el, [where, according to Rashi, the side of the Sanctuary had been transported], when the middle part of an object does not possess significance beyond that of its whole? There is, however, another intent to these Midrashim. The Rabbis have said in Bereshith Rabbah, (68:6.)  “Rabbi Hoshayah said, ‘It has already been stated, And Jacob hearkened to his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram. (Above, 28:7.)  What then does Scripture teach by repeating, And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba? (Verse 10 here.)  Rather, the redundancy teaches us that Jacob said, “When my father desired to leave the Land of Israel, at what location did he seek permission for it? Was it not in Beer-sheba? I, too, shall go to Beer-sheba to seek this permission. If He grants me permission, I shall leave, and if not, I shall not go.” Therefore Scripture found it necessary to state, And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba.’” (Verse 10 here.)  The intent of this Midrash is that the Rabbis were of the opinion that Jacob was blessed by his father in Hebron, the land of his father’s sojournings, and it was to Hebron that he came when he returned to his father from Paddan-aram, as it is said, And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba — the same is Hebron — where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. (Further, 35:27.)  Now if so, the verse stating, And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba (Verse 10 here.)  teaches that when his father commanded him to go to Laban (Above, 28:5.)  he went to Beer-sheba to receive Divine permission, and that is the place wherein he spent the night and saw visions of G-d, and it was there that He gave him permission to exit from the Land of Israel, even as He said, And I will keep thee wherever thou goest and will bring thee back unto this land. (Verse 15 here.)  And the ladder which he saw, in the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra, he saw with its feet in Beer-sheba, in the very place where he lay, and with the end of its slope which is the top of the ladder reaching to a point opposite the Sanctuary. It was supported by heaven at the gate through which the angels enter and exit. The revered G-d stood over him, and therefore he knew that Beer-sheba was the gate of heaven, suitable for prayer, and the Sanctuary was the house of G-d. And in the morning Jacob continued his journey from Beer-sheba and arrived at Haran on the same day, and this was “the springing of the earth” mentioned with respect to Jacob. This is the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra who said in Bereshith Rabbah, (69:5.)  “This ladder stood in Beer-sheba and its slope reached to the Sanctuary, as it is said, And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba; (Verse 11 here.)  And he was afraid and said, How fearful is this place.” (Verse 17 here.)  And the stone which he erected as a pillar (Verse 18 here.)  he did not erect in the place where he slept, for Beer-sheba is not Beth-el and it was in Beth-el that he erected it, and there he went upon his return from Paddan-aram, as it is said, Arise, go up to Beth-el … and make there an altar unto G-d who appeared unto thee, etc. (Further, 35:1.)  But he erected it [after carrying the stone from Beth-el to Jerusalem] (Thus comments Rabbi David Luria (R’dal) in explanation of Ramban’s words. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 160.)  opposite the slope, at the place where the head of the ladder stood, which he had called the house of G-d, and this is the city which had previously been called Luz. (Verse 19 here.)  Thus in the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra, Luz was Jerusalem which Jacob called Beth-el. (Verse 19 here.)  Possibly this may be so, according to the verses in the book of Joshua. (The source intended is not clear to me. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 160, for further discussion of this matter.)  It is certainly true that it is not the Beth-el near Ai (Above, 12:8. Whereas the Beth-el referred to here had previously been called Luz.)  for that Beth-el was originally so named in the days of Abraham (Above, 12:8. Whereas the Beth-el referred to here had previously been called Luz.)  and prior to that. But Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Shimon differs there (Bereshith Rabbah 69:8.)  with Rabbi Yosei the son of Zimra, and he says: “This ladder stood upon the Sanctuary site and its slope reached to Beth-el. What is his reason? And he was afraid, and said, (Verse 17 here.)  etc. And he called the name of that place Beth-el.” (Verse 19 here.)  Thus in the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Shimon the verse stating, And he lighted upon the place, (Verse 11 here.)  means Mount Moriah. And he tarried there all night, because the sun was set for him not at its proper time [so that he should spend the night there], for as our Rabbis have stated: (Chullin 91b.)  “[The Holy One, blessed be He, said], ‘This righteous man has come to the place where I dwell. Shall he then depart without staying there over night?’” And so Jacob saw the ladder with its feet standing in that place, and its slope, which is its top, reached to a point which was opposite that particular Beth-el [which was mentioned in connection with Ai during Abraham’s era], (Above, 12:8. Whereas the Beth-el referred to here had previously been called Luz.)  and that was the city of Luz. And Jacob said that the very place where he spent the night was the house of G-d, and the slope of the ladder was the gate of heaven, thus Mount Moriah is excellent for prayer, and Beth-el also is a suitable place for the worship of G-d. And he erected the pillar in Beth-el, for in the opinion of all Rabbis he erected it opposite the slope of the ladder. The opinion of Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Shimon, [i.e., that Jacob slept on Mount Moriah, and he erected the pillar in Beth-el], is in agreement with the Midrash in the Gemara of the chapter concerning Gid Hanasheh, (“The sinew of the hip.” It is the seventh chapter of Tractate Chullin (see Note 18) 91b.)  and that of Chapter Cheleck, (“Portion,” i.e., in the World to Come. This is the tenth chapter of Tractate Sanhedrin, 95b.)  which states that Jacob left Beer-sheba and came to Haran, and when he reconsidered and decided to return and pray at Mount Moriah, the place where his fathers had prayed, then the earth “sprang” for him and he lighted immediately upon Mount Moriah. Perhaps it is the Rabbis’ opinion that the earth “sprang” for him both when going from Haran to Mount Moriah and when returning from Mount Moriah to Haran. This would be in agreement with the opinion of the Rabbi who says: (Bereshith Rabbah 68:9.)  “And he went to Haran (Verse 10 here.)  — on the same day. And he lighted upon the place (Verse 11 here.)  — at once, very suddenly.” I found it more explicitly in Pirkei Rabbi Eliezer Hagadol: (Chapter 35.)  “Jacob was seventy-seven years of age when he left his father’s house, (He was sixty-three when he was blessed by his father (Megillah 16 a), and for the following fourteen years he was secluded in the house of Shem and Eber for the purpose of studying Torah. This makes Jacob seventy-seven years old when he left Haran. The Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer refers to it as “when he left his father’s house,” but the intent is as explained. (Rabbi David Luria.))  and he followed the well that travelled before him from Beer-sheba to Mount Moriah, a two-day journey, and he arrived there at midday, etc. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘Jacob, you have bread in your travelling-bag, the well is before you, enabling you to eat and drink and lie down in this place.’ Jacob replied, ‘Master of all worlds, the sun has yet to descend fifty stages, and shall I lie down to sleep in this place?’ Prematurely, the sun then set in the west. Jacob looked and saw that the sun had set in the west, so he tarried there all night, because the sun was set. (Verse 11 here.)  Jacob took twelve stones from the stones of the altar upon which his father Isaac had lain bound as a sacrifice (Above, 22:9.)  and put them under his head. By the fact that his resting-place contained twelve stones, G-d informed him that twelve tribes were destined to be established from him. But then all twelve stones were transformed into one stone to inform him that all twelve tribes were destined to become one nation in the earth, as it is said, And who is like Thy people, like Israel, a nation one in the earth? (II Samuel 7:23.)  In the morning Jacob awoke with great fright, and said, ‘The house of the Holy One, blessed be He, is in this place,’ as it is said, And he was afraid, and said: How fearful is this place! (Verse 17 here.)  From here you learn that whosoever prays in Jerusalem is considered as if he prayed before the Throne of Glory, for the gate of heaven is open there to receive the prayer of Israel, as it is said, And this is the gate of heaven. (Verse 17 here.)  Jacob then wanted to collect the stones [which he had used as a resting-place for his head in order to build an altar], but he found them all to be one stone, and so he set it up as a pillar in that place. Thereupon oil flowed down for him from heaven, and he poured it on top of the stone, as it is said, And he poured oil upon the top of it. (Verse 18 here.)  What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? With His right foot He sank the anointed stone unto the depths of the abyss to serve as the key-stone of the earth, just as one inserts a key-stone in an arch. It is for this reason that it is called Even Hashethiyah (The Foundation Stone), (On this stone, the Ark of G-d, which contained the two Tablets of the Law, rested in the Holy of Holies in the Sanctuary in Jerusalem. (Yoma 53b.))  for there is the center of the earth, and from there the earth unfolded, and upon it stands the Temple of G-d, as it is said, And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be G-d’s house. (Verse 22 here. The use of the present tense in the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer — “and upon it stands the Temple of G-d” — may either be a reference to the remains of the ancient Sanctuary and its environs, which were still visible in the days when the Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer was composed, or it may preferably indicate that although the Temple is now in ruins the place thereof is still deemed sacred as in the days when the House of G-d was firmly established on the sacred mountain.)  From there he [Jacob] went on his journey, and in the twinkling of an eye he arrived in Haran.” Thus far [extends the quotation from the Pirkei Rabbi Eliezer Hagadol]. Thus, all Midrashim — despite some minor differences among them — acknowledge that “the springing of the earth” occurred to Jacob through which he travelled a journey of many days in the twinkling of an eye. It is possible that all Midrashim concede to one another, and that on all these journeys of his — when going from Beer-sheba to Haran, when he desired to return to Mount Moriah, and when he left there to go to Haran — the earth “sprang” for him. But there is not one of all these Midrashim which says, as Rashi said, [that Mount Moriah was forcibly removed from its location and was transported to meet him in Beth-el].</p>

        <summary>Eliezer was surprised that the people in Aram Naharayim understood Hebrew, not just Aramaic. Rabbi 'Aḳiba believes seeing maidens before entering a city signifies prosperity. Eliezer's use of עלמה instead of נערה is linked to the Torah's spelling of נער as masculine. Rabbeinu Bahya emphasizes the Jewish people's strength in prayer, contrasting them with the Gentiles. The Torah mentions death by sword as the highest level of impurity, with metal objects causing impurity equal to a corpse. Eliezer's prayer in Genesis 24 is seen as a petition for kindness to Abraham. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the scene at the well in Genesis 24:43.</summary>

            <summary>Rabbeinu Bahya explains that the Jewish people's strength lies in prayer, which has helped their forefathers in times of distress, as seen with Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov. The Gentiles are compared to cedars, while Israel's victories are attributed to prayer and Torah. In another commentary, the Torah mentions death by sword to illustrate the highest level of ritual impurity, with metal objects causing impurity equal to a corpse. The concept of impurity levels is discussed, with the highest level being beyond possible contamination, symbolized by pure waters and tears. The Torah mentions water seven times on the second and third days of creation, representing seven different liquids with varying abilities to contract impurity. Eliezer's prayer in Genesis 24 is interpreted as a petition to find the woman appointed for Isaac, symbolizing kindness to Abraham.</summary>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Bamidbar 19:16:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>בחלל חרב או במת, “someone slain by the sword or one that died naturally;” if the Torah had wanted to equate the two examples of corpses it should have used the expression: בחלל או במת, “someone slain or dead of natural causes.” Why did the Torah mention חרב, “sword?” The Torah chose an example of most victims who die a violent death. Although the Torah chose the example of the “sword” as the cause of death, the same contamination occurs when the victim was killed by a stone or a wooden arrow, for instance (Maimonides Hilchot Tumat Met 1,2).  Our sages in Shabbat 101 point out, however, that the example חרב, i.e. a metal tool, means that the metal weapon contracts the same degree of impurity אבי אבות הטומאה, the absolute primary cause of ritual contamination, as does the corpse itself. The reason is that the sword, by definition, is a means for causing death, is designed to cause death and therefore ritual impurity. The sword, while halachically contracting a degree of impurity equaling that of its victim, the corpse, in that the impurity it confers upon those touching it lasts for seven days, and requires the same purification rites as does the one who became defiled through contact with the corpse itself, does not confer such impurity by the person being merely in the same airspace with it. We derive this from the words אדם כי ימות באהל, “i.e. when a human being dies inside a tent, etc.” the corpse can confer ritual impurity upon such a person, the sword by which he was killed, however, cannot confer that particular type of impurity. The truth of this statement is guaranteed, as if such a sword could confer impurity by a survivor being in the same tent with it, all the priests would be forbidden to enter their own houses seeing each of them contains a sword or metal tool such as a nail which by its very presence would confer impurity on the priest concerned.  This concept has been illustrated by Rabbi Chayim from Germany who sent the following inquiry to Rabbeinu Tam (grandson of Rashi): Seeing that every house at one time or another contains a corpse, and it also has metal nails which are an integral part of its construction, what house can one build in order to avoid ritual contamination by these factors? (The Rabbi quoted Isaiah 66,1 “which is the kind of house that you (man) can build for Me (G’d)” as the gist of his question.) Clearly, Rabbi Chayim understood the reference to חרב in our verse as including all kinds of objects made of iron, otherwise his question does not make sense. [this is in contrast to some authorities who understand the word חרב as applying only to the murder weapon or other weapons made of the same material]. The question therefore presupposes that Rabbi Chayim applied the term חרב to mean that any metal object would confer the status of absolute prime cause of ritual contamination on anyone in the same airspace as it. This understanding of the halachah is based on a statement in Shabbat 101 where Samuel said that a ship (and contents) which lay at anchor and was connected to the harbor by means of iron chains will incur ritual impurity of primary severity (אב הטומאה) if the chain touched such a source of ritual impurity on the quay. Samuel’s statement was meant to apply to degrees of ritual impurity which are of Biblical force, as opposed to ritual impurity due to Rabbinic decree. At any rate it is clear from what he said that he did not distinguish between a sword and some other tool made of metal.  In Pesachim 14, where mixing oil of the Menorah which has been disqualified by differing degrees ritual impurity is discussed, the Talmud states that the words בחלל חרב in our verse mean that a metal lampstand which has become contaminated by a primary cause of impurity has the same degree of impurity as the corpse which made it impure in the first place. This is beyond dispute where the lampstand was in direct contact with the corpse (after death) as opposed to it having been the cause of death of the person who contaminated it.  We have learned in Keylim 1,1: “primary causes of ritual impurity are: 1) a dead unclean reptile; 2) semen which is still virile; 3) a person who became ritually unclean through a corpse. Seeing the person who was in some kind of contact with a corpse becomes a primary source of ritual impurity, it is clear that the source of that impurity, i.e. the corpse itself must be of a higher degree of impurity, i.e. the one known as אבי אבות הטומאה, “the root cause of impurity.” It is well known that derivatives of such a root cause of impurity have the ability to confer descending degrees of impurity to a sixth level (generation) not further. [In other words, anyone more than six persons or objects removed from the root cause cannot be negatively affected by such a root cause. Ed.] The six levels of ritual impurity are known in descending order of severity as: 1) אבי אבות הטומאה, 2) אב הטומאה, 3) ראשון לטומאה, 4) שני לטומאה, 5) שלישי לטומאה, (applicable only to תרומה, produce imbued with a low level of holiness. 6) רביעי לטומאה, (applicable only to matters imbued with high levels of sanctity such as sacrificial meat). We do not encounter a further 7th level of impurity as permanent purity is attached to anything that far removed from a primary cause of impurity. These waters are known as מים טהורים, “pure waters,” as we know from Ezekiel 36,25: “I will sprinkle upon you (the people of Israel) pure waters.” During periods of exile, these waters are known as שערי דמעה, “the gates of tears,” seeing that tears are a derivative of the power reposing in water. Our sages in Baba Metzia 59 are on record that even when all other “gates” (such as the gate of prayer) are locked, the gates of tears always remain open, i.e. our prayers when accompanied by tears always can reach heaven. This seventh level of purity [i.e. a level beyond possible contamination, Ed.] is known as the מים העליונים, the waters of the upper regions (Chagigah 15). This is another name for the attribute (emanation) of חסד which is the seventh emanation counting from the lowest one, מלכות. In the Torah these waters are described as מים חיים, “waters which retain the quality of life.” They are the waters which the prophet Zecharyah refers to as emanating from Jerusalem on the day heralding the redemption (compare Zecharyah 14,8). When the prophet describes these waters as coming forth from Jerusalem, he refers to celestial Jerusalem. When you peruse the Torah’s report of the creation you will find the word מים mentioned 5 times in connection with the second day of creation and 2 more times in connection with the third day of creation. These seven occasions when מים is mentioned on those two days allude to the fact that the work of the second day was not really complete until the third day. [This is also why the words: “G’d saw that it was good,” are absent in the Torah’s report of what was created on the second day. Ed.].  Our sages in Tractate Machshirim 6,4 speak of the existence of seven different kinds of liquids and the potential ability or otherwise of these liquids to contract and confer ritual impurity. The liquids in question are 1) dew; 2) water; 3) wine; 4) oil; 5) blood; 6) milk; 7) bees’ honey. The first time the word מים appears in the Torah in the report of G’d’s creative activity on the second day corresponds to the basic concept of water, a regular liquid. The other six times when the Torah refers to מים in its report of G’d’s activity on the second and third day what are meant are the derivatives of the basic element water, i.e. the six additional liquids (something fit to drink) mentioned in Machshirim. All the six other liquids listed in the Mishnah in Machshirim appear in the Bible as “drinks” employing either the term שתיה or השקאה. In Exodus 17,6 the Torah writes: “some water emerged (from the rock) and the people drank.” In Genesis 24,43 Eliezer asks Rivkah to let him drink some water. In Leviticus 10,9 the Torah forbids the priests to drink wine or liquor on certain occasions. In Jeremiah 35,2 G’d told the prophet to go to the house of the Rechabites and to give them wine to drink. The term used there is והשקית. Oil is used as a liquid used for drinking in Isaiah 25,6: “the Lord will make on this mount for all the peoples a banquet, משתה, containing rich oils.” Blood is mentioned in the Torah as a drink in Numbers 23,24: “Israel will drink the blood of the slain” (Balak’s prophecy/blessing). Another verse mentioning blood as a drink is found in Ezekiel 39,17 where G’d tells the prophet to address the birds promising them: “assemble and gather from all around for the sacrificial feast I am preparing for you;..... eat flesh and drink blood.” Dew is referred to as water, מים, in Judges 6,38 where Gideon is described as “squeezing the dew from the fleece, a bowlful of water.” Bees’ honey is mentioned as a drink in Deut. 32,13: “He made him suck honey from a rock.” Finally, milk is described as a drink in Judges 4,19: “she (Yael) opened a skin-bottle of milk and gave him some to drink.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>וישאו בני ישראל את עיניהם...ויצעקו בני ישראל אל ה', “the Children of Israel raised their eyes....and they cried out to Hashem.” The Torah tells us that they fell back on a tried remedy, i.e. prayer, which had helped their forefathers in times of distress. We know that Avraham prayed from Genesis 19,27 where the Torah describes him as rising early in the morning “to the place, etc.” The words “to the place” are a euphemism for someone directing his prayer to G’d. We find similarly that Yitzchak was praying in Genesis 24,43 where the Torah describes him as coming from a שיחה, i.e. a prayer-session. We find that the Torah describes Yaakov as having prayed at the place where he had the dream of the ladder (Genesis 8,11). The reason the Jewish people have been compared to a worm (Isaiah 41,14 “do not fear worm Yaakov, etc.”) is that just as a worm has no strength of its own other than that of its mouth with which it is able to defeat the mighty cedars, so the strength of the Jewish people is their mouth, i.e. the power of their prayers. Prayer is something soft which has the power to break something hard. The Gentiles have been compared to cedars as we know from Ezekiel 31,3: “here Assyria used to be a cedar in Lebanon,” etc., etc. In verse 12 the prophet describes how this magnificent tree was cut down.” Psalms 29,8 also describes the forests being stripped bare (by the worms). Israel’s victories are due to prayer and Torah. We base this on Deut. 4,29: “when you will seek out the Lord your G’d from there (your state of distress) you will find Him.” We have a similar message in Psalms 20,8: “they (call) on chariots, they (call) on horses, but we call on the name of the Lord our G’d.”</p>

              <p>HER THOU HAST APPOINTED FOR THY SERVANT, EVEN FOR ISAAC. Rashi comments: “She is fit for him since she is charitable and worthy of admission into the house of Abraham. And thereby shall I know — this is a petition: ‘Let me know through her that Thou hast shown kindness unto my master.” If so, Eliezer is saying, “I know for certain that You have appointed her for Your servant Isaac.” But in that case [his petition, which still indicates a doubt as to whether she was the appointed one,] does not connect well. Its interpretation however is as follows: “Make it happen to me this day that the girl to whom I will speak be the one that You have appointed for Your servant Isaac, and with this, show kindness to my master Abraham for with this I will know that You have shown kindness to him if she be of his family and of good mind and of beautiful appearance.” And so he said [when recounting the events of the day]: And let it come to pass, that the maiden, etc., let the same be the woman whom the Eternal hath appointed.

              <p>When the voice from the celestial regions announces who will be married to whom in the future, the reference is to the basic compatibility of man and woman based on the endowments they have come been born with. It does not refer to accomplishments of either party since they have been born, prior to their being married. The latter is called &quot;the second mating.&quot; Since matching two people on the basis of their respective accomplishments is a monumental task requiring supernatural insights, and there is also the difficulty of ensuring that they meet, it is described as not unlike the miracle of splitting the sea. Were this not so, one would have to assume that all man's endeavors are in vain, his prayers totally ineffective etc., everything in life preordained. The experiences of our ancestors are very illuminating in this context. Our Parshah reflects both kinds of &quot;shiduchim,&quot; matches. More about all this in chapter 22. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>את כל ונוכחת, “he prepared all this when he purchased for her a wardrobe, in order to demonstrate to everyone that he felt the need to mollify Sarah.” The word נוכחת means preparing something, inviting someone, and appears in this context in Genesis 24,44 אשר הוכיח ה' לבן אדוני, “the one whom the Lord has prepared for the son of my master (as a wife)”.     Ibn Ezra explains the words הנה הוא לך כסות עינים as Avimelch saying to Sarah: “concerning Avraham whom you had told me that he was your brother, it fulfils the function of an “eye-cover” (veil) for you to ensure no one will dare raise his eyes to you”. At the same time his stature also protects all your maids against anyone daring to take advantage of them. They will all enjoy the protection of the status of being wives of his servants.     Yet another explanation of the words הנה הוא לך כסות עינים understands it as a reference to Sarah having described Avraham as her brother as a defensive stratagem, to protect his life, and the fact that all the entourage of Avraham and Sarah conspired together in this deception so as not to endanger their master’s life. At any, rate, Avimelech added, now that everything has been cleared up, ונוכת, you will be safe and do not need to misrepresent yourself. </p>

Eliezer clarified that he had not finished speaking or praying before Rebekah appeared, to prevent any confusion about her actions being prompted by overhearing him. Eliezer had heard Rebekah's name while in her family's house or she had told him her name at the well. Rashi explains that the use of the past tense in the text indicates contemporaneous action. Rebekah came out with her pitcher as Eliezer was still speaking, and he asked her for a drink.</summary>

              <p>טרם אכלה means I WAS NOT YET FINISHING. Similarly in the case of every word that expresses an action contemporaneous with another Scripture sometimes uses the past tense — so that it might have written here טרם כִּלִיתִי — and sometimes it uses the future tense. Examples are: (Job I. 5) “For Job was saying (אמר)” — here it is past tense and (ib.) “Thus was Job doing (יעשה)” — here it is future tense. But the meaning of both of them is contemporaneous action: “for Job was saying (whilst he sacrificed) “Perhaps my sons have sinned etc.&quot; “and he was doing this&quot; (whenever his sons feasted).</p>

            <summary>The text discusses the twofold cognitive powers of man, perception by intellect divided into &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;calculating,&quot; and perception by senses. Speculative reason is constant and concerns abstract or immutable phenomena, while practical reason is transient and concerns transient phenomena. Prophets have different soul faculties, and man was created in the image of God in his ideal state. The Jewish people are called children to show they possess more of the traits of their Creator. Moses' prophetic powers are superior to other prophets, and Ezekiel's visions describe his own image of God's throne. Rabbi Akiva believes man has the potential to emulate Divine powers, with the Jewish nation having an easier path to achieve this goal.</summary>

              <summary>
                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 76:1:5</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>As discussed in chapter ten, man's cognitive powers are twofold. Perception is possible by means of one's intellect, or by means of one's senses. Perception by intellect is divided into two categories. A) Things or beings that cannot be other than they are. B) Things or beings which are subject to change. We will call the perception of the first type the ability to &quot;know,&quot; whereas we will call the perception of the second type, the ability to &quot;calculate.&quot; There is a constant relationship between him who endeavours to know, and between the object that is being defined. If the object of one's perception undergoes a fundamental change, the faculty enabling us to perceive such object also undergoes some transformation. We observe a parallel phenomenon concerning perception with our senses. The sense of sight, vision, is affected by the object being perceived. Yet that same sense of sight remains completely unaffected by objects that are perceived merely by the sense of touch, for instance. Should an object that had been perceived as incapable of undergoing change be found to have changed nonetheless, the powers of perception applied to it will no longer be speculative reason, but practical reason. To determine the common denominator between man and bird for instance, we employ &quot;wit,&quot; speculative reason. It tells us that both species are living entities, react to stimuli, breathe and move. To determine the difference between man and bird, we employ &quot;sagacity,&quot; practical reason. The latter tells us of the ability of the birds to fly, their having wings etc. On the other hand, it tells us that man has the power of speech, the ability to express thoughts coherently etc. At any rate, we employ two branches of what may also be described as &quot;soul power,&quot; when we engage in these perceptions. The reason &quot;sagacity&quot; is also known as &quot;practical reason&quot; is, that without it, almost no voluntary activity is possible. Being able to understand and analyse phenomena does not by itself lead to action. Therefore, the practical “reason” is an essential part of the cognitive process. Since speculative reason concerns itself with phenomena that are abstract, or at any rate immutable, everlasting, it too is constant. Practical reason, since it concerns itself with transient phenomena, is itself transient in nature. When departing this life and becoming a purely spiritual being, we will no longer possess this practical reason, since in the world of abstract beings there is nothing it could be applied to. This is in line with the statement in the Talmud that &quot;the departed is aware of his own pain, but not of the pain of others.&quot; (Rosh Hashanah 18) Since all bodies die, he is aware of his own demise, since apart from this fact, each person's fate varies, he is unaware of other facts which would require practical reason in order to be appreciated. The term &quot;life&quot; is a constant, even though each individual living creature is bound to die at some point or other. Since the prophet perceives beings that cannot be perceived by other human beings with his soul, it follows that his soul's faculties are somewhat different from other people's faculties in this respect. According to Aristotele, the relationship between pure speculative reason and pure practical reason is similar to the relationship between Divine intellect and human intellect respectively. When G'd, at the time of creation, said that man was to be made in His image, He meant man in his ideal state. Picture for yourself the spiritual state of the people of Israel at the time they received the ten commandments at Mount Sinai. Our opening Midrash discusses a similar state of affairs. Since all the forces active in the universe are represented in man in some form, and he is therefore sometimes referred to as a microcosm, he had dominion over all the other creatures on earth, just as G'd had dominion over all things and spirits in the entire universe. Therefore, prophets, on occasion use the term &quot;Adam&quot; when referring to G'd, to describe Him in His capacity as the Omnipotent. See Daniel, 8,16, &quot;I heard the voice of &quot;Adam,&quot; or Ezekiel 1,2, &quot;and on the likeness of the throne, a likeness such as &quot;Adam &quot; above.&quot; These terms are used only in order to facilitate understanding by human ears of all the anthropomorphical terms used for that purpose. Since it is permissible to employ the term &quot;Adam&quot; in this fashion, it is not surprising to find references to &quot;perfect man&quot; as &quot;Adam&quot; also. Chochmat adam ta-ir panav, &quot;the wisdom of perfect man lights up his face.&quot; (Kohelet 8,1) It is this that is meant by Rabbi Yudan, when he stated that the descriptive powers of the prophets are very great indeed, since they can employ the form to describe its original Creator. When one considers that Moses gave of his spirit to the newly appointed elders, then one can understand the relationship between them and Moses as parallel to the relationship between G'd and His most superior creatures, i.e. the angels. According to Rabbi Akiva in Avot 3, 14, man is beloved since he was created in The image. The meaning is that since this image had been bestowed on him at the very beginning of the creative process, i.e. nivra, he has the potential to emulate Divine powers. However, not one in ten million reaches this lofty goal. Rabbi Akiva continues to single out the Jewish nation, which due to the gift of Torah, can hope to achieve the human ideal more easily than any other nation. The Jewish people are called banim, children, to show that they possess more of the traits of the &quot;father,&quot; i.e. their Creator. Maimonides in the first section of his &quot;Moreh,&quot; chapter 45, is at pains to explain that Ezekiel's visions describe his own image of G'ds throne, which image, though Divinely inspired, is not to be confused with the objectively true state of affairs. The greatness of Ezekiel lies in his describing the function of this image as being equivalent to the function of G'd Himself. Moses, being extremely humble, had his stature attested to by G'd Himself, who explains to Aaron and Miriam that his status is incomparably higher than theirs. When our sages say of Moses, that his face was like the sun, they mean that though the sun is only one of the planets, its stature is such that it is always mentioned separately, never lumped together with the other planets. Similarly, the prophetic powers of Moses cannot be lumped together with that of other prophets, as it is far too superior. </p>

              <p>“And said in his heart, ‘shall a child be born to him that is a hundred years old, and shall Sarah …’” (17. V. 17.)  As for these words, I have already explained the phrase “in his heart” in connection with “and it grieved Him at His heart” (18. Gen. 6:6.)  and “And the Lord said in His heart,” (19. Gen. 8:21.)  in Maṣref La-Kesef. (20. In Maṣref La-Kesef (MK II 34) Kaspi invokes the principle that “the Torah speaks in the language of men” in regard to these verses. On this principle, see above Chapter 2.)  Here the implication is that Abraham did not want the Lord or anyone else to hear him, teaching us that it is not correct to doubt the king’s words at all. The writer of the Torah recorded this for us so that we should understand | what I have explained here. The masses should certainly not feel that Abraham was in doubt. (Instead they should feel that “in his heart”) has the same meaning as when it is used with Eliezer (21. Gen. 24:45, “… and before I had done speaking to my heart …”)  and Esau. (22. Gen. 27:41, “… and Esau said in his heart: ‘Let the days of mourning for my father be at hand …’” In this and the previous note, the phrase means, “he thought to himself.”)  The reason for his speaking “in his heart” was that it was not right that his contemporaries should think that Abraham was in doubt or uncertain of the promise of the Lord, or uncertain of his ability to understand God’s word in spite of his being so great a prophet.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Abraham the author declares: It is the style of those who speak Hebrew to express their thoughts very clearly at times. However, at other times it is their style to say what they must in as few words as is necessary for a person to understand their meaning. Note that words are like bodies and their meanings are like souls. The body is, as it were, a vessel for the soul. Hence all the wise men of all nations (Literally, tongues. In other words, all wise men who speak a different language.)  are in the habit of preserving the ideas conveyed by a word (I.E. literally reads: The wise men…preserve meanings.)  and are not concerned with changes in wording when the meaning remains one and the same. I will now offer you a number of examples. (Of instances in Scripture where the same idea is conveyed in different words.)  God told Cain: And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from the ground… When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth (Gen. 4:11,12). Cain replied: Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the land (Gen. 4:14). Now who is so simple as to think (Vat. Ebr. 38 reads: Now he who is simple thinks.)  that the latter verse does not convey what the former verse does because of the change in words. Look, Eliezer said, Give me to drink (hagmi’ini), I pray thee (Gen. 24:17). However, he quoted himself as saying, Let me drink (hashkini), I pray thee (Gen. 24:45). Moses said, the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon (Ex. 12:29). However, it is earlier written, the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill (Ex. 11:5). In Deuteronomy, Moses quoted the prayer which he offered on behalf of Israel because of the golden calf (Deut. 9:26-29). Now to the unintelligent, this prayer appears totally different from the one recorded in the Torah portion Ki Tissa (Ex. 32:11-14). The general rule is, one will find the same meaning in different words whenever anything is repeated in Scripture, such as the dreams of Pharaoh (See Gen. 41:1-7; 17-24.)  and Nebuchadnezzar, (See Dan. 4.)  and many other things. Now Scripture, as I noted, sometimes abridges and other times elaborates. It does the same with prefixes. (Literally, servile letters.)  At times it adds them. At other times it leaves them out. However, the meaning remains the same. Thus God said, and blue, (Hebrew, u-tekhelet.)  and purple (Ex. 25:4). However, Moses said, blue, (Hebrew, tekhelet.)  and purple (Ex. 28:6). God said, onyx stones (Hebrew, avne shoham.)  (Ex. 25:7). However, Moses said, and onyx stones (Hebrew, ve-avne shoham.)  (Ex. 35:9). There are many such instances. Either way is correct, as the verse which leaves out the vav is employing a concise style. There is no harm in it. (For it does not change the basic meaning of the verse.)  Similarly, the verse which has a vav in it does no harm because it adds clarity. Now one does not search for a reason that a vav, which is enunciated by the mouth, (Such as the vav of ve-avne, or u-tekhelet.)  is sometimes left out, sometimes written, and sometimes added. (That is, it is a superfluous vav. See Vol. 1, Introduction, p. XVII.)  For any of the aforementioned (Ways of writing.)  is correct. We do not look for the reason why an enunciated vav was written. (Or was left out.)  This being the case, why should we look for reasons regarding (The omission or non-omission of.)  the silent vav which is not enunciated? For example, we should not ask why the word le-olam (forever) (Olam can be spelled with or without a vav.)  is written with or without a vav. (The vav in olam is silent.)  Now people want reasons for full and also for deficient spellings. I would have kept silent if they wanted reasons for each one of them, (For every full or deficient spelling (Weiser).)  or if there was only one way to spell these words. (And they found it spelled otherwise.)  I will give you an example. Suppose someone tells me, “Write the following to my friend: I so and so love you forever;” and I spelled ploni (so and so) without a vav, and also ohevekha (I love you) without a vav and le-olam (forever) deficiently. (That is, without a vav.)  Then Reuben came to me and asked me why I wrote deficiently. Now my concern is to write what I was told to write. I am not concerned with full or deficient spellings. (A person uses the spellings that come to mind. There is no hint of anything special or any allusion in the type of spelling that one chooses to employ.)  Perhaps Levi will come along and teach me how to write. (That is, when to use full or deficient spellings. Levi obviously cannot, for there are no rules regarding the use of full or deficient spellings.)  I do not want to dwell on this. However, the intelligent will understand what I mean. (I.E. apparently believed that Moses had some discretion in choosing the spelling to be employed in writing the Torah.)  I will now explain the above-noted difficulties. (The questions raised by I.E. at the beginning of his comments on this verse.)  </p>

              <p>AND THE SERVANT RAN TO MEET HER. Rashi comments: “Because he saw that the waters rose in the well when she approached it.” In Bereshith Rabbah the Rabbis said, (60:6.)  “And she filled her pitcher, and came up. (Verse 16 here.)  All the women went down and filled their pitchers from the well. But this one, as the waters saw her they immediately rose. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to her, ‘You are a sign of blessing to your children.’” (When Israel wandered in the desert, the waters in the well would rise as soon as they approached it. See Numbers 21:17 and Midrash Rabbah, ibid.)  It would appear that the Rabbis derived this interpretation upon observing the language, And she filled her pitcher, and came up, (Verse 16 here.)  for it does not say, “and she drew water and filled [the pitcher].” Now this miracle happened to her only the first time for afterwards it is written, and she drew. (Verse 20 here.)  The servant, when recounting the day’s events to them, said: And she went down unto the well, and drew water. (Verse 45 here.)

              <p>AND ESAU SAID IN HIS HEART. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said, “It is possible that he revealed his secret to one of his friends.” (If not, how did Rebekah become aware of the fact that Esau was planning to kill Jacob? (Verse 42 here).)  But this is not necessarily so for any decision which a person reaches after deliberation is referred to in Hebrew as “speaking with the heart,” even when it also includes speech with the lips. A similar case is found in the verse, And with a double heart do they speak, (Psalms 12:3.)  for the will is synonymous with the heart. And all Israel were of one heart to make David king, (I Chronicles 12:39.)  meaning that they had all arrived at the same decision and were talking of it. Similarly, And Jeroboam said in his heart. (I Kings 12:26. Further on it says, And the king took counsel, (Verse 28). Here also there was speech which Scripture had referred to as being said in his heart.)  Similarly did Eliezer say, And before I had finished speaking in my heart, (Above, 24:25.)  whereas the prayer there was with his lips, as Scripture states, And he said, O Eternal G-d of my lord Abraham. (Ibid., Verse 12.)  However it is possible that the expression, before I had finished speaking in my heart, means “before I had concluded the thought in my mind.” Now here the verse states that when the great hatred of Jacob permeated Esau’s soul because of the blessing, he conceived the idea of murdering his brother, and with this he comforted himself from his depressed state. This explains the verse, And the words of Esau were told to Rebekah. (Verse 42 here. As Ramban explained, a decision in one’s heart, even though coupled with speech, is still referred to in Hebrew as “the speech of heart.” Therefore, the verse means that Esau decided upon a course of action, and he himself informed his mother of his decision.)  This is why she said to Jacob, Thy brother Esau comforts himself to slay thee. (Verse 42 here.)  Now Rashi comments, “She was told, through Ruach Hakodesh, (See above, Note 90.)  what Esau was thinking in his heart.” And so it is found in Bereshith Rabbah. (Bereshith Rabbah 67:9.)  If so, Esau’s words and thoughts were only in his heart, just as in the verse, I spoke with my own heart. (Ecclesiastes 1:16.)  The reason that Esau said, Let the days of mourning for my father be at hand then will I slay my brother is because he would not bring grief to his father during his lifetime. Perhaps it was due to his fear lest his father curse him, and his blessing would then turn into a curse. Rebekah, [who nevertheless advised Jacob to flee], feared that perhaps the elderly one would die suddenly, and Esau would then kill Jacob, or perhaps he might find occasion to kill him even during Isaac’s lifetime.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND THE ETERNAL REPENTED… AND IT GRIEVED HIM AT HIS HEART. The Torah speaks in the language of men. The purport is that they rebelled, and grieved His holy spirit (Isaiah 63:10.)  with their sins. The sense of the expression at His heart is that He did not tell this to a prophet, a messenger of G-d. This expression is also found with respect to thinking, just as: to speak to my heart, (Genesis 24:45.)  and other similar expressions. In Bereshith Rabbah (27:6.)  there is a significant matter concerning this, expressed by a parable which the Rabbis bring of an agent and an architect. (Rabbi Berachyah said: “It is like a king who had a palace built by an architect, and when he saw it, it displeased him. Against whom is he to complain? Surely against the architect.” Rabbi Assi said: “It is like one who traded through an agent and suffered a loss. Whom does he blame? The agent. Here too It grieved Him at His heart.”)  This constitutes a great secret which is not permitted to be written down. The one who knows it will understand why here the Tetragrammaton is written while in the whole of the rest of the chapter and the account of the flood, the name Elokim is used.</p>

The concept of &quot;yuldah&quot; in reference to Rivkah's birth suggests an immaculate conception, symbolizing the impact of Avraham's good deeds on others. Eliezer's retelling of events at the well during a meal with Betuel indicates a rewriting of history to avoid implying Betuel's connection to Avraham's soul, despite Betuel acknowledging the match as heaven-sent. This illustrates the far-reaching influence of righteous individuals like Avraham.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>Genesis ‎24,14. “and through her I shall know that You have done a ‎kindness with my master.” These words of Eliezer have been ‎explained in the Zohar where the author states that in the ‎time of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai even small children possessed ‎some special wisdom that enabled them to know what other ‎adults do not know. [The children being innocent. Ed.] They were ‎endowed with this superior wisdom as part of the spiritual rays ‎radiating from the saintly personality of Rabbi Shimon bar ‎Yochai. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is quoted as an example of the ‎influence exerted on his environment by every righteous person, ‎each one in varying degrees according to his spiritual stature. ‎They are to be perceived as a microcosm of Hashem, Who as ‎the macrocosm, disseminates spiritual influence throughout His ‎universe through His very existence. There is no question but ‎that Avraham’s major attribute was ‎חסד‎ and that he had a ‎profound influence on his immediate environment, not only ‎recognized but paid tribute to, by the people of Kiryat Arba, ‎when they described him as a “prince of G’d” in their midst. ‎‎(Genesis 23,6) Avraham personified on earth, what the Creator ‎personifies in the entire universe, i.e. the dispensing of ‎largesse. The expression ‎ילדה‎ is not appropriate for males, as ‎they only ‎הוליד‎, beget, plant seed, but do not bring it to gestation. ‎The proper meaning of the word “yuldah” as it appears ‎here suggests an immaculate birth, a birth that had not been ‎preceded by insemination. Seeing that this is a difficult process ‎for us to grasp, the idea that Avraham’s good deeds “spilled over” ‎even to people such as Betuel, is meant to set our mind at ‎rest over the fact that Rivkah, with a father such as Betuel, and a ‎brother such as Lavan, could have been such a righteous ‎matriarch as she clearly was. During the meal, Eliezer recounts ‎what had occurred at the well, and anyone who has read the ‎Torah’s report of what transpired is aware that Eliezer rewrote ‎some of this “history,” i.e. the sequence of events. Rashi ‎points this out (in his commentary on Genesis 24,47) implying ‎that during the meal, in the presence of Betuel, Eliezer could not ‎bring himself to imply that this man had been endowed with part ‎of Avraham’s soul. [Perhaps the fact that if even a Betuel could ‎exclaim that this match had been made in heaven (Genesis 24,50) ‎is the best support for our author’s theory that some of ‎Avraham’s spirit had spilled over even into the soul of a Betuel. ‎Ed.]‎</p>

(Rashi, Genesis, 24:42.)  I asked Rebecca, whose daughter are you? Later, I gave her the presents. Rashi asks here. Why did Eliezer say something different before her father and mother from what he did? He first gave the presents to Rebecca first and then asked Rebecca, whose daughter are you? Eliezer did this so that they should not ask him, what kind of fool are you, to give such precious presents to a maiden that you do not know. Therefore, Eliezer said to her father and mother, I asked her, whose daughter are you? (Rashi, Genesis, 24:47.) </p>

              <p>The difference between one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow [hamuddar hana’a meḥaveiro] and one for whom benefit from his food is forbidden by vow concerns only setting foot on the other person’s property and borrowing from that person utensils that one does not use in preparation of food but for other purposes. Those two benefits are forbidden to the former but permitted to the latter. Therefore, with regard to one for whom benefit from another’s food is forbidden by vow, that person may not lend him utensils used in the preparation of food, e.g., a sieve, or a strainer, or a millstone, or an oven. However, he may lend him a garment, or a finger ring, or a cloak, or nose rings, as these are not used in the preparation of food. However, he may not lend them to one for whom benefit from him is forbidden by vow. And with regard to any item that one does not use in the preparation of food, in a place where one rents items of that kind, that item is forbidden. Meaning, one for whom benefit from another is forbidden by vow is prohibited from borrowing this type of item from the one who vowed and imposed the prohibition. This is because one can use the money saved by borrowing the item rather than renting it to purchase food.</p>

                <h4>Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Chayei Sara, Torah Ohr 45</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Let us examine a few more details of this story. Why did Eliezer have to describe his seniority in Abraham's household to the point where he said that his master had entrusted all his belonging to him? Why did the Torah keep repeating his status as עבד, &quot;slave?&quot; Why did the Torah later (24,21) describe Eliezer as האיש, an appellation hardly appropriate for an עבד? Still later, the Torah speaks of Laban running towards האיש; Rebeccah tells about what האיש has said to her. When Eliezer enters the house of Bethuel and Laban he is described as האיש, whereas as soon as he sits at the table he introduces himself as Abraham's slave, עבד. This, of course, is no problem seeing that Eliezer is Abraham's slave, and the Torah has repeatedly referred to him as such. The puzzling thing is that even after he handed out all the silver and golden trinkets, he is described as עבד; why would Laban ask Rebeccah if she wanted to go עם האיש הזה, thus elevating his status at the very moment when he harbored ill will against Eliezer? Immediately afterwards, when Rebeccah and Eliezer depart, Eliezer is again described as עבד, although Rebeccah and her handmaids are reported as following האיש. Once Isaac has been sighted Rebeccah is described as addressing the עבד. How could Laban address Eliezer with the words: בוא ברוך ה' &quot;Enter the one blesssed by the Lord,&quot; when we know that every עבד is cursed since the time Noach cursed Canaan? This was the reason why Abraham did not want Isaac to marry Eliezer's daughter. He did not want to become involved with a tribe that was accursedץ When we said earlier (page 142) that Laban's blessing had the power to eventually help Esau's descendants to switch from being cursed to becoming blessed, where did Laban get that power from? Another difficulty is the expression in 24,31 where Laban claims to have cleared the house, (of idols, according to Bereshit Rabbah 60). If that were indeed so, Laban displayed a spiritual level that is hard to credit. Whence did he attain that spiritual level? Why did Eliezer reverse the sequence of events when describing his placing the bracelets on Rebeccah before he knew who she was (compare 24,22 with 24,47)? The other problem we have to deal with is the statement in Chullin 95 we have quoted, classifying Eliezer's &quot;test&quot; of Rebeccah as the only such kind of test that is admissible for Jews. Tossaphot, Chullin 95 raise the question that according to a view expressed in Sanhedrin 56 it is not only Jews who are forbidden to practise ניחוש. The answer given is that Eliezer did not rely on ניחוש, and did not give the jewelry to Rebeccah until he had found out that she was from Abraham's family. According to this view we would have to disregard the Torah's first report of that event and accept the version Eliezer told in Bethuel's house. If that is so, why does the Torah seem to mislead us and create the impression that Eliezer relied exclusively on ניחוש? Besides, since Eliezer obviously accepted the word of a stranger, and presumably a minor at that, at face value, how can one claim that he did not rely primarily on ניחוש? Was there any proof that this girl would agree to marry a man she had never seen and who lived a long way from her home and family? Why then did Eliezer give Rebeccah the jewelry except that he believed in ניחוש?</p>

              <p>[6. AND MOSES SAID.] Va-yomer mosheh (and Moses said) is to be understood in a manner similar to that of va-eshal otah (and I asked her) (Gen. 24:47). I have pointed out to you how the latter is to be interpreted. (According to I.E. the meaning of va-eshal otah (and I asked her) is, I had already asked. See I.E. on Gen. 24:14 (Vol. 1, p. 236).)  The meaning of our clause is that Moses had already said to them, This is the thing which the Lord commanded that ye should do, namely, that you offer a he-goat (v. 3), a calf (v. 3), a lamb (v. 3), and an ox and a ram (v. 4); (What is recorded in verse 6 occurred before that which is recorded in verse 5. In other words, Moses told the Israelites, This is the thing that the Lord commanded… before Israel brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting.)  then the glory of God will then appear to them. The latter refers to the fire that came forth from the Lord. (See verses 23 and 24.) </p>

Each blessing in the hundred blessings equals ten pieces of gold, hinting at the 10 sefirot. One must bow in specific blessings of the Amidah, with Rabbi Tanḥum stating one must bow until all vertebrae protrude, and Ulla saying one must be able to see a small coin on the ground opposite the heart.

                <h4>Abudarham, Weekday Prayers, Amidah 18</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>We read in Berachot, chapter Ain Omdin (Ch. 5): “The Sages taught: These are the blessings in the Amidah prayer in which a person bows: at the beginning and end of the forefather’s blessing (Avot) – and at the beginning and end of the thanksgiving blessing (Hoda’ah)”  (BT Berachot 34a)  The Talmud Yerushalmi explains the reason (we bow) in the Avot blessing (is based on the verse): “Then I bowed low in homage to Adonai and blessed Adonai, God of my master Abraham” (Gen. 24:48) and the Hodaah blessing (is based on the same verse), “I bow to the King,” which is translated (in Aramaic) “I gave thanks to the King.”  (I was unable to find a verse ואשתחוה למלך or the Aramaic translation that follows it. See Psalms 138:2 which seems to suggest the connection between bowing and thanksgiving; Also, Tosefta Kifshuta 2:17:2)  If someone bows at the end and beginning of each blessing (of the Amidah) one should teach him not to do so. “Rabbi Tanḥum said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: (In those blessings where one is required to bow,) one who prays must bow until all the vertebrae in the spine protrude (yitpakaku).”  (See BT Berachot 28b See Rashi, Baba Batra 80b, “In the case of reeds or of vines, he may cut only from the knot (pakak) and above,” Jastrow explains this word, “the place where a shoot is joined to the trunk or to a branch of the grape vine, knot.”)  This expression is taken from the expression, pakak hagefen, which is the knot in the branch which protrudes from the wood. “Ulla said: Until he can see a small coin [issar], on the ground before him opposite his heart.”  (Berachot Ibid.)  Rabbeinu Hai Gaon explains that he lowers his head like a bull rush until he can see a coin on the ground that is opposite his heart. He should not bow his body or head lower. Rashi explains that when one bows two folds of flesh are formed opposite the heart: one above and one below. One must stoop so far so that the flesh in between is the size of an issar coin.  (As explained Rashi on Berachot 28b – See Shottenstein Berachot Note 37 on Page 28b.)  “Rabbi Ḥanina said: Once he moves his head forward, he need not bow any further. Rava said: But that applies only if he is exerting himself and he appears like one who is bowing.”  (BT Berachot, Ibid.)  But one who is not healthy does not need to be in this fashion. These prostrations are meant to remind a person, before whom he is standing and that in the end he will return to the dust.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Birkat ha-mazon is recited with at least three adults, as it is said, “Exalt the Lord with me. (Ps 34:4: Gadlu la-Shem iti. Gadlu is a plural imperative, so it includes at least two; iti – “with me” adds one more, making it at least three.)  With three, one says in the zimmun “nivarekh she-akhalnu mishelo” – “Let us bless Him from whose food we have eaten” without mentioning God’s name. And with ten one does mention God’s name: nivarekh eloheynu– “Let us bless our God.” (B. Berakhot 49b, and so the Tur and Orah Hayim 192.)  And one does not say “Barekhu eloheynu” – “Bless our God,” in other words, one should not exclude himself from the group. Thus I conclude that “nivarekh” is preferable, but if someone has said “barekhu,” one doesn’t hold it against him. (B. Berakhot 50a. In other words, it is acceptable to say “barekhu.”)  Regardless if the number of diners is eleven or 110,000, one says, “nivarekh  eloheynu she-akhalnu mishelo,” because ten is the number that includes everything and there is nothing after it, unless it is doubled [?]. If one leading a zimmun of three says, “nivarekh she-akhalnu mishelo” – “Let us bless Him from whose food we have eaten,” the other two reply as if he were beginning with “Barukh she-akhalnu mishelo uv-tuvo hayinu” –“Blessed be the One from whose food we ate and by whose goodness we live.” If one leading a zimmun of ten says, “nivarekh eloheynu she-akhalnu mishelo” – “Let us bless our God from whose food we have eaten,” the rest reply with “Barukh eloheynu she-akhalnu mishelo uv-tuvo hayinu” –“Blessed be our God from whose food we ate and by whose goodness we live.” Those outside of the table answer “Amen,” which is like the matter discussed in tractate Yoma: (B. Yoma 37a.)  “For the name of the Lord I proclaim; Give glory to our God!” (Dt 32:3.)  When “I proclaim the name ‘Lord,’ You give glory to ‘Eloheynu,’ namely, you should answer “Amen.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>And you need to know that because the sages z”l said, “a bat kol went out and said that a cup of blessing is equal to forty pieces of gold, it is clear from this that each blessing of the hundred blessing equals ten pieces of gold.” (B. Hullin 87a. Since there are four blessings in birkat ha-mazon said over the cup of blessing – you do the math. This is also an allusion to the tradition that one said say at least a hundred blessings per day.)  And there’s support for this in the verse: “one ladle (kaf) of ten [shekels] of gold filled with incense,” (Nu 7:14.)  that is to say, every “one from Ka”F, (Ka”F is numerically equivalent to 100.)  which are the one hundred blessings equal to “ten gold [pieces].” And you will also find in another place, “esreh zahav mishkalam” – “ten gold shekels in weight” (Gen 24:22, the value of the gold armbands Eliezer gave Rebekah as a present after she gave his camels water at the well.)  to which armbands Scripture follows with the phrase “Then I bowed low in homage to the Lord and blessed the Lord.” (Gen 24:48, immediately preceded in 24:27 with “And I put the ring on her nose, and the bands on her arms,” i.e., the ten shekel gold bands, which are equal to one blessing.)  The reason why every blessing is equal to ten shekels of gold is to hint that it is possible to include the 10 sefirot in each and every blessing. And the reason for 100 blessings every day is their correspondence to the 10 sefirot, ten blessings for each and every sefirah. And this what is written, “And now, O Israel, what (mah) does the Lord your God demand of you.” (Dt 10:12.)  And our sages z”l said, “Don’t read mah – “what,” but rather me’ah –“a hundred,” (B. Menahot 43b.)  that is to say, “A hundred the Lord your God demands of you.” And there are 99 letters in this verse; adding the letter aleph makes it 100. (That is, adding an aleph to the word mah, making it me’ah, give the verse 100 letters. In his commentary to the Torah R. Bahya brings this interpretation as the sod – “the mystical interpretation” of Dt. 10:12.)  And we found in King David (peace upon him), who said, “The utterance of the man set on high [‘al],” (2 Sam 23:1. The Hebrew word ‘al is numerically equivalent to 100.)  because one hundred men of Israel a day used to die in that generation, and deeply moved by this, David instituted [tiken]100 blessings. (Midrash Tanhuma Korah 12. Tiken – “instituted” of course also has the connotation of tikkun – “repair,” as in the sense of a cosmic repair through blessings of a world diminished by the loss of 100 lives.)  He didn’t institute them per se, but rather re-established them, since they had been forgotten, and David came along and re-established them. (Ibid. According to this midrash, Moses originally established the blessings, and afterwards, whne they had been forgotten, David came along and re-established them, and after David’s era they were forgotten again until the sages of the Talmud re-established them (Chavel).)  And thus is written, “So [ki khen] shall the man who fears the Lord be blessed [yivorakh].” (Ps 128:4.)  The word yivorakh – “shall be blessed” is spelled without a vav, which means that by the numerical equivalent of K”I Khe”N – 100 – will the person who fears the Lord both bless and be blessed. (Lacking the vav, the Hebrew word can be read either actively as yivarekh – “he will bless,” or passively as yivorakh – “he will be blessed.”)  Therefore a person needs to recite 100 blessings and fulfill them each day. And on Shabbat, when it is not possible because the Amidah for Shabbat contains only seven blessings, as it is written, “I praise You seven times on theday,” (Ps 119:164.)  the day which is well-known and special, namely, Shabbat, our sages z”l already said, “one completes them with aromatic herbs and fancy fruits.” (B. Menahot 43b, i.e., one enjoys lots of extra snacks and aromas that require blessings to make up for the shortage of blessings.)  </p>

              </summary>
              <p>We are now in a better position to interpret the passage in Genesis which caused us some difficulty in the opening section of this chapter in our discussion. Speaking to the family of Rebekah, Abraham’s servant describes the way, along which God has led him, as a way of emeth. (Gen. 24:48; cf. also ibid. 27.)  To render it as, a true way, would be rather empty; the translation, a right way, is an attempt to hide a difficulty of exegesis by a plausible version. We, however, recall that of the same way the servant said earlier: “Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken His hesed [love] and his emeth toward my master; I am on the way the Lord hath led me to the house of my master’s brethren.” God has shown His love and His faithfulness toward Abraham by leading the servant along the way whither his master wanted him to go. This same way, which testifies to God’s love and faithfulness, is then called by the servant the way of emeth, along which God led him. This is not just the right way, in the sense of leading to the intended goal. It is the way of faithfulness; a way along which God, keeping faith with Abraham, led his servant.</p>

Why did he have to ask so much for kindness and truth? Did they not want to give Rebecca to a rich house? The explanation is that they heard that the children of Abraham would be in the Egyptian exile. Therefore, they did not want to give Rebecca to Isaac. That is why Eliezer had to ask, do kindness with my master. (Imre Noam, Genesis, 24:49.)  Rabbi Isserlein asks. What is the meaning of kindness and truth [hesed veemet]? One only speaks of truth when one does something for a deceased person, since he does not desire to be repaid. The explanation is that Eliezer was clever and said: I ask you, do kindness and truth. That is to say, do not desire that I should repay the kindness that you are doing. You should not desire money for this kindness, but do me a kindness without payment, not for the sake of a reward.

The Rabbis in Bereshith Rabbah warn against daughters of Canaan, Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre, as Abraham wanted Isaac to marry someone from his family. The phrase &quot;Then thou shalt be clear from this my oath&quot; means the servant would be free from the oath if Isaac chose to marry a Canaanite, as Abraham trusted Isaac to make the right choice.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>THEN THOU SHALT BE CLEAR FROM THIS MY OATH. Abraham did not permit him to take a wife for Isaac from the daughters of Canaan, but he would be free [from the oath if Isaac were to do it on his own] and the Eternal do that which is good in His sight. (II Samuel 10:12.)  But Rashi wrote, “And take a wife for him from the daughters of Aner, Eshkol or Mamre.” Now if they were Canaanites, far be it from him! And in truth they were of the seed of Canaan for Scripture says, Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshkol, and brother of Aner. (Above, 14:13.)  And in Bereshith Rabbah, the Rabbis have said: (59:11.)  “That thou shalt not take a wife, etc. (Verse 3 here.)  He warned him against the daughters of Canaan, Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre.” For it was with reference to Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre that Abraham said, Among whom I dwell, (Verse 3 here.)  since he did not dwell among all the Canaanites as they were many nations. But he warned him against these his confederates, and all the more against the others. But the verse, Then thou shalt be clear from this my oath, means that the servant would be free from the oath if Isaac would want to do it on his own, and Abraham relied on his knowledge that his righteous son Isaac would listen to his father and that he would beware of them and go instead to Ishmael or to Lot and the other nations. It is possible that from this my oath is a hint to that which he said, And thou shalt take a wife unto my son from there, (Verse 7 here.)  since perhaps the oath was for everything, [meaning that the oath covered two points: a) that he should not take for him a wife from the daughters of Canaan, and b) that he should go to his family. In case they refused, he would be free from the second oath, while the first oath would always remain in effect]. Accordingly, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath does not allude to that which Abraham told him, Thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, (Verse 3 here.)  [since he never freed him from this oath]. This explains the word zoth (this) — [thou shalt be clear from ‘this’ my oath — implying there was another oath from which he was not freed]. Therefore, the servant said, That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left, (Further, Verse 49.)  and he did not say, “I would return [to the land of Canaan,” since he was not freed from the oath not to take a wife from the daughters of Canaan].</p>

              <p>Genesis ‎24,14. “and through her I shall know that You have done a ‎kindness with my master.” These words of Eliezer have been ‎explained in the Zohar where the author states that in the ‎time of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai even small children possessed ‎some special wisdom that enabled them to know what other ‎adults do not know. [The children being innocent. Ed.] They were ‎endowed with this superior wisdom as part of the spiritual rays ‎radiating from the saintly personality of Rabbi Shimon bar ‎Yochai. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is quoted as an example of the ‎influence exerted on his environment by every righteous person, ‎each one in varying degrees according to his spiritual stature. ‎They are to be perceived as a microcosm of Hashem, Who as ‎the macrocosm, disseminates spiritual influence throughout His ‎universe through His very existence. There is no question but ‎that Avraham’s major attribute was ‎חסד‎ and that he had a ‎profound influence on his immediate environment, not only ‎recognized but paid tribute to, by the people of Kiryat Arba, ‎when they described him as a “prince of G’d” in their midst. ‎‎(Genesis 23,6) Avraham personified on earth, what the Creator ‎personifies in the entire universe, i.e. the dispensing of ‎largesse. The expression ‎ילדה‎ is not appropriate for males, as ‎they only ‎הוליד‎, beget, plant seed, but do not bring it to gestation. ‎The proper meaning of the word “yuldah” as it appears ‎here suggests an immaculate birth, a birth that had not been ‎preceded by insemination. Seeing that this is a difficult process ‎for us to grasp, the idea that Avraham’s good deeds “spilled over” ‎even to people such as Betuel, is meant to set our mind at ‎rest over the fact that Rivkah, with a father such as Betuel, and a ‎brother such as Lavan, could have been such a righteous ‎matriarch as she clearly was. During the meal, Eliezer recounts ‎what had occurred at the well, and anyone who has read the ‎Torah’s report of what transpired is aware that Eliezer rewrote ‎some of this “history,” i.e. the sequence of events. Rashi ‎points this out (in his commentary on Genesis 24,47) implying ‎that during the meal, in the presence of Betuel, Eliezer could not ‎bring himself to imply that this man had been endowed with part ‎of Avraham’s soul. [Perhaps the fact that if even a Betuel could ‎exclaim that this match had been made in heaven (Genesis 24,50) ‎is the best support for our author’s theory that some of ‎Avraham’s spirit had spilled over even into the soul of a Betuel. ‎Ed.]‎</p>

              <p>YHVH corresponds to matchmaking, as in “From YHVH this thing has come” (Genesis 24:50), and “an intelligent woman comes from YHVH” (Proverbs 19:14). It also corresponds to truth, as in “Who guided me on a true path” (Genesis 24:48). Through this [truth] speech is perfected. This is because: Ten measures of speech descended to the world. Women took nine portions and the entire world took one (as our Sages, of blessed memory, taught; Kiddushin 49b). As long as there are no marriage bonds, speech lacks perfection. But when marriage bonds are made, the categories of speech are combined and completed.</p>

            <summary>Laban and Bethuel acknowledge that the matter of Rebecca marrying Isaac was decreed by God, as Laban spoke before his father Betuel, indicating his wickedness. They cannot speak positively or negatively as matchmaking is determined by celestial forces, with a heavenly voice proclaiming matches forty days before birth. This reflects the belief that finding a spouse is a gift from God, as parents can only provide material wealth while God arranges proper marriages, a sentiment echoed in various biblical verses and Talmudic teachings.</summary>

              <p>מה’ יצא הדבר, “the matter originated with G-d.” Lavan meant that it was evident from the order in which matters had occurred that a higher power was involved here. They acknowledged that matchmaking was a preserve of celestial forces. Sotah 2. states that forty days prior to the development of the fetus a heavenly voice proclaims that the “daughter of X will be married to Y, even if the two people involved live on opposite sides of the ocean.” Solomon referred to this in Proverbs 19,14 בית והון נחלת אבות, ומה’ אשה משכלת, “whereas wealth may be determined by what one inherits from one’s father, an intelligent woman is a gift from heaven.” Clearly, parents are only able to bequeath you material riches whereas only G-d can provide you with the soul-mate you crave. Parents are unable to bequeath you the proper wife.  In a manner of speaking, such sentiments are also reflected in Solomon’s famous poem about the woman of valour (second half of Proverbs chapter 31). In Midrash Tehillim the author writes: “come and note how difficult it is to match the proper people to each other in marriage, seeing G-d refers to this problem both in the Torah, the Books of the Prophets, and the Hagiographa. In the Torah we have our reference here when even a pagan such as Lavan acknowledged that bringing about optimal marriages was a task only G-d knows how to solve. In the Books of the Prophets, concerning the unfortunate choice of wives or female companions made by Samson, we read in Judges 14,4 ואביו ואמו לא ידעו כי מה’ היא, “and neither his father nor his mother were aware that this matter originated with a plan by G-d. We have just quoted the verse in Proverbs 19,14 to show that also in the Hagiographa the problem is referred to. We have another verse concerning this problem in Proverbs 18,22, where Solomon writes: מצא אשה מצא טוב ויפק רצון מה’, “he who found a wife has found a good thing; he will obtain favour from the Lord.” Some scholars interpret Isaiah 46,3 העמוסים מני בטן הנשואים מני רחם, to mean that even if the respective partners grow up on opposite sides of the universe, G-d arranges for them to meet in order that they can get married. [The verse refers to the passive role man plays in the matter of זווג, matchmaking, though he may fancy himself as totally active and the result as due to is own initiative. Ed.] This is what the Talmud meant when saying that long before the birth of an individual plans had been made in heaven who would become her partner in marriage. A kabbalistic approach to the statement בת פלוני לפלוני, “the daughter of X will be married to Y.” The word בת in the statement בת פלוני לפלוני, is an allusion to the י (the tenth emanation), whereas the male, i.e. פלוני is a reference] to the ו, and the word לפלוני is an allusion to the א, (G-d) who is beyond the ocean of the emanation חכמה, wisdom. The reason the Talmud did not phrase this statement simply as פלוני ישא את פלונית, “X will marry Y,” was to show us hat the statement is not to be taken literally but that it applies to the relationships between different spiritual concepts. Such concepts too have to exist in a form of “marriage” to one another. This is also why the sages in the Talmud mentioned the female before the male in that statement [The “tenth”, i.e “lowest” emanation, is “lower,” hence female, when compared to the fifth emanation represented by the word פלוני.

We are not allowed to speak good or evil. The verse says that Laban answered before his father, since he was an evildoer to speak before his father. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:50.)  He was very smart in speaking, and therefore they let him speak. This shows that he was an evildoer. He said: we cannot say good or evil. He had an evil mouth. First he spoke about doing evil and then he spoke of doing good; his intention was to do more evil than good. (Bahya, Genesis, 24:50.)  Bahya writes. From here we learn that each match comes from God, as the sages also said. Forty days before the person is born, a shout goes out in heaven that a person should take this person’s daughter to wife.

Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak: It came forth from Mount Moriah. (It was immediately after Abraham’s binding of Isaac on Mount Moriah that Abraham was informed about Rebecca’s birth (Genesis 22:20–23). Her marriage to Isaac was foreordained from that point.)  The Rabbis say: From where did it come forth? “She will be a wife for your master’s son, as the Lord has spoken.” (The marriage of Isaac and Rebecca was not foreordained upon her birth.

              <p>Another thing that is said in Proverbs 18:22 is &quot;He who finds a wife finds a good thing.&quot; And here you say in Ecclesiastes 7:26, &quot;And I find more bitter than death the woman.&quot; But if she is a wicked woman, there is no end to her evil. And if she is a good woman, there is no end to her goodness. Therefore, find a wife and find a good thing. Even before the creation of woman, what is written in Genesis 2:18, &quot;It is not good for man to be alone.&quot; After she was created, what is written in Genesis 1:31, &quot;And God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good.&quot; Therefore, find the good. Our sages said that anyone who does not have a wife is lacking five things. Lacking blessing, as it is said in Genesis 1:28, &quot;And God blessed them.&quot; It says them, not him. Lacking life, as it is said in Ecclesiastes 9:9, &quot;Live joyfully with the wife whom you love.&quot; Lacking joy, as it is said in Proverbs 5:18, &quot;Rejoice with the wife of your youth.&quot; Lacking assistance, as it is said in Genesis 2:18, &quot;I will make a helpmate for him.&quot; Lacking goodness, as it is said in Proverbs 18:22, &quot;He who finds a wife finds a good thing.&quot; And when she is wicked, it is good to find that she brings all goodness out of her husband's home and makes him poor. But if she is a good woman, what is written about her in Proverbs 31:10, &quot;A capable wife, who can find? Her value is far beyond pearls.&quot; And it is written in Proverbs 12:4, &quot;A capable wife is a crown for her husband.&quot; And regarding this, it is said in Proverbs 19:14, &quot;And he obtains favor from God.&quot; And also, it says in Proverbs 31:10, &quot;An understanding wife is from God.&quot; Come and see how difficult the power of marriage is. In the Torah, in the Prophets, and in the Writings, God's name is mentioned in connection with marriage. In the Torah, as it is said in Genesis 24:50, &quot;The matter emanates from God.&quot; In the Prophets, as it is said in Judges 14:4, &quot;But his father and mother did not know that it was of the Lord.&quot; In the Writings, as it is said in Proverbs 18:22, &quot;And he obtains favor from God.&quot; Therefore, His name is connected with marriage.</p>

Laban eventually conceded the validity of these blessings.

              </summary>
              <p>BLESSED ‘MIBANIM’ BE ASHER. If the letter mem [in the word mibanim] serves to signify greater status [meaning that Asher is singled out from among the tribes for greater blessing] as indicated by the mem in these expressions: blessed ‘minashim’ (from among all other women) shall Jael be; (Judges 5:24. In other words, Jael shall be more blessed than other women.)  they [the ordinances of the Eternal] are to be desired ‘mizahav’ (more than gold), yea ‘umipaz rav’ (even more than much fine gold), (Psalms 19:11.)  and other similar expressions — then one may wonder: how could Moses diminish the rest of the tribes by saying that Asher be blessed more than all the sons of Jacob? Moreover [if such was his intent], his blessing was not fulfilled, for it did not come to pass. And Rashi wrote: “I have seen in the Sifre: (Sifre, Brachah 355.)  ‘You will find none of the tribes as blessed with children (“Of children.” In our text of Rashi: “with children.”)  as Asher.’ But I know not how this was so.” Now, our Rabbis meant to explain blessed ‘mibanim’ that Asher be blessed with the many children that he will beget, similar to the usage of the letter mem in the expression Blessed of the Eternal be his land, ‘mimeged’ (of the precious things) of heaven, ‘mital’ (of the dew). (Verse 13.)  Therefore, the Rabbis said that Moses blessed all the rest of the tribes with strength or with their inheritance, and Asher alone was blessed with children. And our textual version of the Sifre (Sifre, Brachah 355.)  reads: “You will find no one who was as blessed with children as Asher.” But how this blessing was fulfilled has not been explained. Perhaps it relates to what is written in [the Book of] Chronicles, All these were the children of Asher, heads of the fathers’ houses, choice and mighty men of valor, chief of the princes. And the number of them reckoned by genealogy for service in war was twenty and six thousand men. (I Chronicles 7:40.)  Such praise is not mentioned there about the rest of the tribes. In line with the simple meaning of Scripture, Blessed ‘mibanim’ be Asher is similar to the blessing let him be the favored of his brethren, (In Verse 24 before us.)  the verse stating that Asher be blessed by all the sons of Jacob their father and be favored by all his brothers. The reason is that his land is rich and from there will come all royal dainties (Genesis 49:20.)  for all the tribes, and they will all constantly say, “May G-d bless this land which brings forth such fruits.” The letter mem in the word mibanim will be like the mem in: ‘mei’Hashem’ (‘from’ the Eternal) proceedeth the thing; (Ibid., 24:50.)  ‘mei’E-il’ (‘from’ the G-d of) thy father (Ibid., 49:25.)  [so that our verse means: “Blessed will be Asher ‘from’ the sons” of Jacob]. And Onkelos translated: “The blessing of Asher will be from the blessings of the sons” [of Jacob]. It appears that Onkelos meant to say that all of the tribes will come to Asher to buy oil, and Judah, and the Land of Israel, will be his merchants for wheat of Minnith, and balsam, and honey, and oil (Ezekiel 27:17.)  and all choice fruits of the land (Genesis 43:11.)  all of which they will bring to sell him, and they will buy oil. Thus Asher will be blessed with all the delicacies available to all the tribes, this being the sense of the expression favored of his brethren, (In Verse 24 before us.)  for they will sell to him and buy from him what they desire. Then I found in Bereshith Rabbah: (Bereshith Rabbah 71:13.)  “And Leah said: ‘For my happiness! for daughters will call me happy,’ [and she called his name Asher]. (Genesis 30:13.)  Rabbi Levi said: In all his days Asher never lodged in an inn. (Rabbi Levi is thus interpreting the word b’oshri as meaning “in my resting place,” i.e., in my home, from the Aramaic root sharah, meaning “resting.”)  Asher inherited palaces on the heights, [heights great in area] more than the land inherited by Judah. The sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah and Beriah, and Serah their sister. [And the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel,] who was the father of Birzaith. (I Chronicles 7:30-31.)  Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Simon said [with reference to the name Birzaith which contains the word zayith — olive] that the daughters of Asher were beautiful, and they were married to priests (In our version of Bereshith Rabbah Rabbi Levi says that they were married to priests; and Rabbi Simon says that they were married to kings, because the name Malchiel contains the word melech — king. Rashi here quotes both: “his daughters were married to High Priests and kings who were anointed with olive oil.” See Exodus 30:33 (Vol. II, pp. 531-533).)  who were anointed with olive oil etc.”</p>

(Further, 31:53.)  [Thus, Laban being the son of Bethuel, (Above, 28:5.)  was nevertheless known by his father’s father’s name, Nahor.] (Ibid., 22:22.)  It is possible that Bethuel was a dishonorable person, and Laban wanted people to ascribe his lineage only to his father’s father, for so we find, And Laban and Bethuel answered. (Above, 24:50.)  [Laban is thus mentioned before his father, which indicates that Bethuel was not regarded as the head of the family.] Perhaps all this is in honor of Abraham for [by virtue of Laban’s being known by Nahor’s name], the whole family traced its lineage to Nahor the brother of Abraham, (Ibid., 22:23.)

He is his legitimate son, and is brought up as his only heir. He could indeed have had the most happy of all the women in that country for him, but he would not have his son marry any of them; but, out of regard to his own relations, he desired him to match here, whose affection and inclination I would not have you despise; for it was by the good pleasure of God that other accidents fell out in my journey, and that thereby I lighted upon your daughter and your house; for when I was near to the city, I saw a great many maidens coming to a well, and I prayed that I might meet with this damsel, which has come to pass accordingly. Do you therefore confirm that marriage, whose espousals have been already made by a Divine appearance; and show the respect you have for Abraham, who hath sent me with so much solicitude, in giving your consent to the marriage of this damsel.&quot; Upon this they understood it to be the will of God, and greatly approved of the offer, and sent their daughter, as was desired.

As noted later, they spoke Aramaic.) ,” if you say because of “beginning” only, is there not written “and said (That verse contains both roots, ענה and אמר, even if they are separated by the names of the speakers. Therefore, the argument of R. Jehudah is invalid.) ”? If you want to say, by “saying” only, is there not written “from the Eternal came the word” (This is a counter-argument. Since Laban and Bethuel admitted that the betrothal of Rebecca was a word of the Eternal, did they not speak Hebrew at that moment?) ? If you want to say, in the holy language, is there not written “the stone heap of testimony (Gen. 31:47. Since Laban had to translate Jacob’s גַלְעֵד into Aramaic, it follows that he did not speak Hebrew.) ”? If you want to say, before the Torah was given, is there not the text of the declaration of tithes (Deut. 26:16. However, there only the root אמר is used.)  which may be recited in any language (Cf. Mishnah 1.) ?</p>

              <p>“Here is Rebecca before you; take her” [24:51]. They said: Rebecca is before you. Take her and go with her to your master, as God had said. When Eliezer heard these words, he bowed down and praised God. He took out gold and silver jewelry and betrothed her with the silver and gold and also gave silken garments to Rebecca. He gave good fruits to her brother and sister. They ate and drank and went to sleep. The next morning they woke up and the angel came to Eliezer and wanted to accompany him to his home. Eliezer said to the household: send me home. The brother and mother responded, but Bethuel had eaten the poison. That is why her brother and mother had to answer. They said: let the maiden stay with us for a year or ten months and afterwards she will go. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:53–55.)  Hizkuni asks a question here. Did they not say at first, “here is Rebecca before you; take her and go” [24:51]. This means, take Rebecca and go. Now they were saying, the maiden wants to sit for several months with us. The explanation is: Laban and his mother did not know that Eliezer was a messenger to betroth Rebecca. Therefore they said: take Rebecca and go, expecting that Isaac would betroth her and it is not proper to delay. However, afterwards they saw that Eliezer was a messenger to betroth her and that Eliezer betrothed her himself, on behalf of Isaac. They said: as long as she is already betrothed, let her sit a while with us to make her clothes and adornments. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 24:55.)  Toldot Yizhak writes. Laban was very devious. Therefore, he did not say at first, let the maiden stay with us. He was afraid that Eliezer would agree that she should remain, but she should be given to him at a later time. Laban said at first, “the matter is from God, take her and go” [25:50 –51]. That is to say, take her there, since it was concluded this way from God, in the hope that Eliezer would respond, it is good. I will take her. He was very happy that he wanted to take her and he did not ask for a dowry. When Laban heard that Eliezer had praised God that the match had gone through, he got up before Eliezer and said. Let the maiden stay with us. We will buy her clothes and give her a dowry. Eliezer was not ashamed to say that he did not want any dowry. He said: because it happened through God and you promised me that I could take her. Let me go. Laban knew well that Eliezer would not leave the maiden because of the dowry, for even one day. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:55.) </p>

            <summary>The text from the Guide for the Perplexed emphasizes the importance of understanding the language used in biblical texts to interpret events as ascribed to God, highlighting the significance of context in removing difficulties and revealing truth. In Akeidat Yitzchak, the actions of the sons of Aaron are analyzed to show that their faults made their eventual sin possible, with deficiencies in intellectual, emotional, and moral aspects contributing to their unfit nature, as well as their arrogance and lack of acquired character traits essential for their priestly duties.</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>
                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 59:1:10</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>The four statements are therefore not to be understood as &quot;sins,&quot; but rather as faults which made their sin possible. Outstanding individuals such as these two sons of Aaron, could not fall prey to a cardinal sin such as bringing &quot;strange fire&quot; into the sanctuary, unless there had previously been something wrong in their attitudes. Drunkenness disturbs the mind. Only when in a confused state of mind, could they have committed such a serious error. Not having washed their hands and feet is symbolic of not preparing one's body to perform a sacred task. Garments, especially outer garments, are meant as a shield against the temptation of the yetzer hara. Failing to wear such garments shows that one at least underestimates the power of temptation, while at the same time overestimating one's own character strength The purpose of all Torah study is execution of its teachings. Another way of expressing this, is &quot;the producing of fruit.&quot; Having children is bearing fruit. Being able to bear fruit is a privilege. He who has something worthwhile to bequeath to posterity, leaves children behind who, perpetuate their parents, contribute to civilisation. He who studies Torah for ulterior motives, such as to achieve honour, a title etc has nothing to bequeath. These two sons of Aaron not having children, is not to be conceived as a cause for their being unfit. Rather, it is the result of their having been unfit. To sum up, one could accuse these two sons of three deficiencies. (1) intellectual; (2) emotional; (3) moral. It is also possible to view the fact that these sons did not marry as proof of a certain amount of arrogance. They did not marry because they did not consider anyone as good enough to become their respective wives. Again, the wearing of garments can be understood as representing acquired character traits. Not wearing outer garments would mean that they lacked certain character traits which are essential in a priest, without which he is not fit to represent the people before G'd. </p>

              <p>Events evidently due to chance are ascribed to God: e.g., in reference to Rebecca, “Let her be a wife to the son of thy master, as the Lord spake” (Gen. 24:51); in reference to David and Jonathan, “Go, for the Lord has sent thee.” (1 Sam. 20:22); in reference to Joseph, “God sent me before you” (Gen. 45:7). You see clearly that the providing of a cause, in whatever manner this may take place, by substance, accident, freewill, or win, is always expressed by one of the five terms, commanding, saying, speaking, sending, or calling. Note this, and apply it everywhere according to the context. Many difficulties will thereby be removed, and passages apparently containing things far from truth will prove to be true.</p>

Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Yitzḥak: It came forth from Mount Moriah. (It was immediately after Abraham’s binding of Isaac on Mount Moriah that Abraham was informed about Rebecca’s birth (Genesis 22:20–23). Her marriage to Isaac was foreordained from that point.)  The Rabbis say: From where did it come forth? “She will be a wife for your master’s son, as the Lord has spoken.” (The marriage of Isaac and Rebecca was not foreordained upon her birth.

            <summary>Ramban explains that the word &quot;saying&quot; in Genesis 1:3:1 indicates Will or thought, not mere creation by Will alone, and that the light created was of a special substance. Tur HaArokh discusses G-d's decree in Leviticus 10:3:1, with Rashi interpreting it differently than Nachmanides, who believes G-d can issue decrees at any time. In Ramban's commentary on Leviticus 10:3:1, he discusses the sanctification of the Sanctuary through those close to G-d, interpreting the word &quot;speaking&quot; as referring to decrees, thoughts, and ways, rather than literal speech.</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>
                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 1:3:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>AND G-D SAID, ‘LET THERE BE LIGHT.’ The word “saying” here indicates Will, as in the verse, What dost thy soul say, that I should do it for thee? (I Samuel 20:4.)  which means, “What do you want and desire?” Similarly, And let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the Eternal hath spoken (Genesis 24:51.)  means, “…as He hath willed, for such is the Will before Him.” Or, it may be [that the word “saying” here means] “thinking,” as in the verses, Thou sayest in thy heart; (Isaiah 47:8.)  And the chiefs of Judah shall say in their heart. (Zechariah 12:5.)  The purport is to state that the creation was not done with toil. Our Rabbis have also called this “thought.” Thus they have said: (Bereshith Rabbah 12:14.)  “The thought [concerning what was to be created on a particular day] was during the day; the deed itself was at sunset.” This teaches that creation was thought out, that there is a reason for everything created, that creation was not a simple manifestation of mere Will alone. The word “being” [Let there ‘be’] indicates a deed for the present time, (Thus unlike Rashi and R’dak (Rabbi David Kimchi), who hold that the reference here is to the creation of the luminaries, such as the sun, moon, etc., which were not suspended in the firmament until the fourth day (see Rashi, Verse 14), Ramban explains that the light of the first day was of a special substance; hence Scripture does not say, And it was so, since that light did not remain forever in its original state.)  just as: And thou wouldst be their king (Nehemiah 6:6.)  [meaning: their king from this moment on]. Therefore Scripture says that when He created the substance of the heavens, He said that from that substance there should come forth a shining matter called “light.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>THIS IS THAT THE ETERNAL SPOKE, SAYING: ‘THROUGH THEM THAT ARE NIGH UNTO ME I WILL BE SANCTIFIED.’ “Where had He spoken this? In the verse, and [the Tent] shall be sanctified ‘bichvodi’ (by My Glory). (Exodus 29:43.)  Do not read the word as bichvodi (by My Glory) but bimechubodai (through My honored ones). Moses said to Aaron: ‘My brother Aaron, I knew that this Sanctuary was to be hallowed by those who are beloved of the Holy One, blessed be He, and I thought that it would be either through me or through you. Now I see that your sons were holier (In Rashi: “greater.”)  than I and you.’” Thus the language of Rashi, based on the interpretation of our Rabbis. But if so, the verse, and [the Tent] shall be sanctified ‘bichvodi’ (Exodus 29:43.)  means “that it will become holy in the eyes of all the people through my honored ones, and they will know that I dwell therein.” Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra also wrote: “This is that the Eternal spoke, saying, means: G-d had already told me that He would show His sanctity through those that were near to Him. This is similar in meaning to the verse, You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities. (Amos 3:2.)  And when I will show them this holiness of Mine, then I will become glorified before all the people and they will fear Me.” But if this is so, then this is a statement not written [in the text], that G-d informed Moses of His ways and that such is the nature of His attribute! In my opinion there is no need for all this. For by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the expression “G-d spoke” refers to His decrees, His thought, and the manner of His ways, and the term “speaking” is used with reference to all these [in humans]. Thus: I spoke with my own heart, (Ecclesiastes 1:16.)  means “I reflected on this thought.” And this is ‘hadavar’ that Joshua did circumcise, (Joshua 5:4.)  means “this is ‘the cause’ why Joshua did so.” ‘Al d’var’ (because of) the money. (Genesis 43:18.)  Similarly, And let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the Eternal hath spoken, (Ibid., 24:51.)  means “as He hath decreed.” Likewise: In his days did Hiel the Beth-elite built Jericho; with his firstborn he laid the foundation thereof, and with his youngest son Segub he set up the gates thereof; according to the word of the Eternal, which He spoke by the hand of Joshua the son of Nun. (I Kings 16:34. Here too, it does not mean “which G-d spoke,” since we nowhere find that He did say so, but “which He decreed.” Cf. the words of Joshua (Joshua 6:26).)  Thus Moses said here: “This incident is that which G-d decreed, ‘saying to His heart': Through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified so that they should not break forth into My sanctity; and before all the people I will be glorified, so that they treat My dwelling-place with respect.”</p>

              <p>הוא אשר דבר ה' לאמור, “of this did G’d speak, saying:” Rashi claims that G’d referred to Exodus 29,43 ונועדתי שמה לבני ישראל ונקדש בכבודי, “I shall set My meeting there with the Children of Israel, and I will be sanctified with My glory.”     Some commentators hold that G’d referred to Exodus 19,22 וגם הכהנים הנגשים אל ה' יתקדשו, “even the priests who approach Hashem shall sanctify themselves lest He burst forth against them.”     Nachmanides writes there is no need to search for relevant verses, for G’d can issue decrees at any time in any place, such as when the angel speaking through the mouth of Bethuel announced (Genesis 24,51) “let her become the wife of your master’s son.” [This is strange as Nachmanides does not offer this comment in his commentary on that verse. Presumably, the fact that a man such as Bethuel quoted G’d as having said this, showed that he was being manipulated by G’d. Ed,. The expression כאשר דבר ה' in the mouth of Bethuel means “as G’d has decreed.” Here too Moses means to tell Aaron that what happened was nothing else but a decree of Hashem. He softens the blow by saying that G’d, by killing the sons of Aaron at this stage, had tried to prevent them who are so near to Him by dint of being priests, i.e. בקרןבי, from becoming guilty of an unforgivable trespass, i.e. their ruining His sanctity. </p>

              <p>From here [we learn] that thanks should be given for good tidings. You might ask: Why did Rashi not make this comment above, on: “The man bowed his head and prostrated himself” (v. 26)? An answer is: Above, it is followed by: “He said, ‘Blessed is Hashem, God of my master, Avraham.’” Perhaps there, he prostrated himself because he mentioned Hashem’s Name in a brocho, as “blessed” means a brocho. But here, no brocho follows. The Kitzur Mizrachi answers: The Bereishis Rabbah (60:7) made this comment on, “The man bowed his head and prostrated himself” (v. 26). But Rashi makes it here, because Eliezer could not have given thanks until after they said (v. 51), “Take her and go.” But, when he first spoke to Rivkah, he did not yet know if she would agree to go with him!</p>

              <p>ויוצא העבד כלי כסף, “the servant brought out silver trinkets, etc.” The trinkets mentioned here were intended as gifts accompanying the betrothal, whereas the ones mentioned earlier were gifts for his hosts. Betrothal is viewed as the first step of the wedding. (Kidushin 50) According to the plain meaning of the verse, Eliezer gave the valuable gifts to Rivkah, seeing that he was certain she would take them with her to her new home, whereas he gave relatively inexpensive gifts to various members of her family. Rivkah’s father, Betuel, did not require to be “bribed” by gifts; he was happy that his daughter had been chosen to become the wife of Yitzchok, his cousin. This is reflected in the text when the Torah wrote: “ ויאמר אחיה ואמה וגו', “her brother and her mother said, etc.; (used delaying tactics) Betuel was not in favour of any delay, as he was overjoyed that she married within the family. According to the plain meaning of the text, he allowed his son and wife to speak first, seeing that they had been the recipients of gifts, or because in that household it was Lavan who was the “senior” voice seeing that he was very astute. We have read in an aggadic text that Betuel tried to poison Eliezer’s food in order to prevent the marriage and that due to an angel’s switching plates he ate the poisoned food himself and died. This is supposedly why his name no longer appears in the rest of the story. A third version. The reason that Betuel, בתואל, was known by that name was that seeing that he was the nominal chief in Aram, he had reserved the right for himself to sleep with every virgin before she became married. His peers therefore demanded that he also sleep with Rivkah before she became married, otherwise they threatened to kill him. He agreed, and that it why the angel Gavriel killed him before he could carry out his intention.</p>

Man ist durch nichts berechtigt, hier an etwas anderes, als an köstliche Früchte und nicht an wertvolle Kostbarkeiten zu denken. מגד, wovon offenbar das Wort gebildet ist, kommt nur in diesem Sinne vor, und מגדנות steht, wo es mit noch anderen Dingen, wie Esra 1, 6 und Chron. II. 21, 3 vorkommt, immer zuletzt, war somit wohl nicht das Wertvollste. Geschenke von Wert gab er der jungen Braut. Confitüres, Artigkeiten, der Mutter und dem Bruder; dem Vater — gar nichts! Es ist dies wohl zu beachten. Was hat man nicht alles in unsere jüdische Vergangenheit hinein und zurück datiert! Erzählungen und Märchen von Reisenden über die jetzigen Gewohnheiten von Orientalen mussten — nach dem Axiom: &quot;Alles ist im Orient stabil und homogen&quot; — die Schablone abgeben, nach welcher man sich das jüdische Altertum zurecht legte.

              <p>“The servant took out vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and garments, and he gave them to Rebecca, and he gave her brother and her mother precious objects” (Genesis 24:53).  “The servant took out vessels of silver […and precious objects]” – Rabbi Huna said: Fruit delicacies. The Rabbis said: Toasted grain and nuts. Is toasted grain then the most beloved of all these things? (Since it is listed last, after gold and silver vessels, the implication is that it is the most precious of all the items on the list.)  The explanation is that it comes to teach you that if a person sets out on a trip without provisions with him, he will suffer. (On the road, precious objects are no substitute for food.)  Similarly, “Each woman will borrow [silver vessels and gold vessels and] garments from her neighbor” (Exodus 3:22) – are garments most beloved of all these things? The explanation is that it comes to teach you that if a person sets out on a trip without taking his garments with him, he will suffer. Similarly: “All those surrounding them supported them [with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with livestock, and with precious objects]” (Ezra 1:6).</p>

            <summary>Rashbam explains that the use of the distant past tense in Genesis 20:16 signifies a common sequence of events in biblical stories, citing examples from Genesis 12, 34, and 24. Chizkuni interprets the phrase &quot;אל יותר&quot; in Exodus 16 as a transitive form, similar to the use of the root יצא in other biblical passages like Genesis 24:53 and Psalms 105:43 and 135:7.</summary>

              <p>אל יותר, “do not leave any over!” The word יותר is word is to be understood as if it had been spelled in the transitive mode אל יותיר. We have other examples of such a formulation, as in Genesis 24,53, where Avraham’s servant Eliezer is described as taking jewelry out of his pocket or luggage, to give to Rivkah, and instead of the Torah writing: ויוציא העבד, it wrote: ויוצא העבד, “which literally translated would mean ”he went out,“ instead of “he took out.” These formulations of the root יצא also occur in the opposite direction as in Psalms 105,43: “He led His people out in gladness, “מוצא רוח מאוצרותיו ויוציא עמו בששון,“ or in Psalms 135 7: מוצא רוח מאורותיו, “He releases the wind from His vaults.”</p>

The word ימים as meaning a year has already occurred in Genesis 24,54 ימים או עשור, “a year or at least 10 months.” Also in Exodus 13,10 we find the expressionמימים ימימה, which  means: “from year to year, annually.” When the words מקץ שנתים occur without the addition of the word ימים, they mean “one year.” When an animal did not yet reach the first anniversary of its birth it is called as being בן שנתו, “an up to one year old.” (compare Leviticus 12,6)</p>

Sforno suggests giving Rivkah time to adjust to moving to another country. Radak explains that the Torah attributes events primarily to major characters, and that the word &quot;days&quot; in Hebrew can refer to a year or at least ten months. Tur HaArokh clarifies that Laban and Rivkah's mother requested that Rivkah stay for a year or at least ten months before leaving. Da'at Zekenim suggests that Betuel's silence may have been due to a plan to poison Eliezer to prevent the marriage. Chizkuni explains that the delay request was made after realizing that Eliezer had already performed the rites of betrothal through the gifts.

They had even said: “take Rivkah and be on your way!” (verse 51) At the beginning they had thought that Eliezer had been authorized only to arrange for the betrothal which would take place in Yitzchok’s hometown. The matter therefore had appeared as very urgent. Now that they saw that Eliezer had already performed (through the gifts) the rites of betrothal, they no longer saw any reason for the hurry. They therefore asked that an engaged girl be given the customary 12 months to prepare herself for her nuptials. (Compare Talmud, Ketuvot 57)י</p>

He says so although the Torah had quoted both Lavan and Betuel as agreeing to the match being made in heaven in verses 50-51. An alternate interpretation explaining Betuel’s “silence.” He had meant to poison Eliezer so as to prevent the marriage. An angel switched plates while Eliezer was speaking and when Betuel started eating he died from his own poison.</p>

              <p>ויאמר אחיה ואמה , when there are both major and minor characters in a story, the Torah attributes what is happening primarily to the major character. Although Rivkah’s mother was senior to Lavan, he, in his capacity as the manager of this household was mentioned first. We find something similar in Numbers 12,1 where Miriam, who was junior to Aaron is mentioned first since she did the talking and Aaron only listened. This is also why Esther is mentioned first in Esther 9,29, although the position as prime minister occupied by Mordechai was senior to that of the queen. The initiative of what is reported in the verse was Esther’s, hence her name is mentioned first. </p>

    Ibn Ezra claims that the ones who spoke were the ones who had received the gifts from Eliezer, whereas the father kept silent on the subject. It is possible that Lavan was a more prominent and distinguished person than his father, and this accounts for his speaking up first. This would be supported by the Torah writing ויען לבן ובתואל, instead of ויען בתואל ולבן.

He wanted to impede [the betrothal of Rebecca] and was stricken down overnight. That is what is written: “The righteousness of the honest will straighten his way” (Proverbs 11:5). “The righteousness of the honest” – this is Isaac; “will straighten his way” – the way of Eliezer. “In his evil, the wicked one is rejected” (Proverbs 11:5) – this is Betuel, who was stricken down overnight.  “Let the girl remain with us some days” – this refers to the seven days of mourning for him [Betuel]. “Or ten months [asor]” – this refers to the twelve months that a virgin is given to secure her needs for herself. (After betrothal, a fiancée is entitled to take twelve months before the wedding to prepare herself (Mishna Ketubot 5:2). Laban and his mother were willing to speed up the process, so they requested only ten months.)  “They said: We will call the girl, and ask her response” (Genesis 24:57).   “They said: We will call the girl [and ask her response]” – from here we learn that one may marry off an orphan girl only with her consent.  “They called Rebecca and said to her: Will you go with this man? She said: I will go” (Genesis 24:58).  “They called Rebecca and said to her: [Will you go with this man?]” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: They were hinting to her: ‘Will you [really] go? Will you [really] go?’ (They did not want her to go. It was as though they were asking: Are you even considering going with him?)  “She said: I will go” – I am going against your will, even if you disapprove.</p>

              <p>One gives a virgin twelve months from the time the husband asked to marry her after having betrothed her, in order to prepare herself with clothes and jewelry for the marriage. And just as one gives a woman this amount of time, so too does one give a man an equivalent period of time to prepare himself, as he too needs time to prepare for the marriage. However, in the case of a widow, who already has items available from her previous marriage, she is given only thirty days to prepare. If the appointed time for the wedding arrived and they did not get married due to some delay on the part of the husband, then the woman may partake of his food. And if her husband is a priest, she may partake of teruma, even if she is an Israelite woman. The tanna’im disagree about the permission granted to a priest to sustain his betrothed with teruma before she is married to him. Rabbi Tarfon says: He may give her all of her required sustenance from teruma. During her periods of impurity, e.g., menstruation, when she cannot partake of teruma, she may sell the teruma to a priest and use the proceeds to buy non-sacred food. Rabbi Akiva says: He must give her half of her needs from non-sacred food and half may be from teruma, so that she can eat from the non-sacred food when she is ritually impure.</p>

            <summary>Rashi explains that &quot;days&quot; in Leviticus 25:29 refers to a full year. The Kli Yakar compares the Giving of the Torah to a marriage, with the Torah scholar needing to be knowledgeable in the twenty-four books. Rashbam also notes that &quot;days&quot; can mean a year, as seen in Genesis 24:55. Or HaChaim interprets the concept of the Jewish people as a bride, with the birth of a male child symbolizing the nation's highest spiritual level. Rashbam further explains that &quot;days&quot; in Genesis 41:1 refers to two whole years. The German Commentary on Mishnah Ketubot 5:2:3 and Bartenura on Mishnah Ketubot 5:2:2 also point out that &quot;days&quot; can signify a year, based on various biblical references.</summary>

              <p>On the first of the second month. The Sages compared the Jewish people’s connection to Hashem to the marriage of a bride and groom in regard to two events: The first one is the Giving of the Torah, based on the verse (Shemos 31:18): “And He gave to Moshe when He finished (ככלתו).” The word ככלתו is written without the vav suggesting that just as the Torah was given to him as a bride (כלה), who is adorned with twenty-four adornments, so, too, a Torah scholar must be knowledgeable in the twenty-four books. The second event was the inauguration of the Mishkon, as it says (7:1): “It came to pass, on the day Moshe finished erecting the Mishkon.” Rashi explains that on the day the Mishkon was erected, the Israelites were like a bride entering the wedding canopy. This teaches us that the Giving of the Torah was like betrothal (erusin), and the day the Mishkon was erected was like marriage (nisuin). In between there was about ten months, which is comparable to the ten months given to a bride from the time of betrothal to marriage to be adorned in the twenty-four types of adornments mentioned in Yeshayahu (3:18-22).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>The verse also contains an allusion to the כנסת ישראל, the Jewish people as a conceptual entity. We find that this term is applied to women in such verses as Isaiah 54,5: כי בעליך עושיך, &quot;for He who has made you will espouse you;&quot; the prophet also continues: ואשת נעורים, &quot;and the wife of your youth;&quot; the prophet Hoseah describes the relationship of G'd and כנסת ישראל in Hoseah 2,21: וארשתיך לי לעולם, (G'd speaking to His bride) &quot;I will betroth Myself to you forever, etc.&quot; Isaiah 50,1: &quot;where is the bill of divorce I have given you?&quot; There are more such verses to be found scattered throughout the Books of the Prophets. וילדה זכר, &quot;and she gives birth to a male child, etc.&quot; when viewed from a moral-ethical vantage-point, the Torah reveals that when the מזריע the initiative for the husband-wife relationship with G'd originates with the Jewish people, the כנסת ישראל, then the product of such an initiative will be a male child, זכר, the entire nation will attain the highest spiritual level. The word זכר, male, is hyperbole for the highest moral-ethical achievenment. In Sanhedrin 98 and Shemot Rabbah 15 the superiority of the ultimate redemption to the redemption at the time of the Exodus from Egypt is described. The ultimate redemption is perceived there as the corollary of Israel distinguishing itself by the performance of good deeds, etc. The prophet described the Exodus in terms of Israel being &quot;naked and nude&quot; (Ezekiel 16,7). Clothing is perceived as a layer of מצות and good deeds covering our bodies. The inadequacy of the Jewish people at the time of the Exodus is underlined in Deut. 4,34 where G'd describes the Exodus as wrenching one people from the midst of the same people, something that made it legally difficult for G'd to justify taking the Israelites out of Egypt when He did. That redemption has been described only in female terms and that is why it did not endure in the end and the Temple was destroyed. Not so the redemption of the future which will occur as a direct result of Israel's merits. First and foremost among those merits is Israel's preoccupation with Torah as described in Deut. 31,21 something that will never be forgotten even during a protracted period of exile. The Torah continues: וטמאה, the mother contracts ritual impurity as a result of giving birth. Here the Torah alludes to the way G'd initiates a process which culminates in the rehabilitation of Israel so that it will attain a spiritual level that qualifies for the description זכר. The &quot;days&quot; mentioned here are to be understood as seven years similar to Genesis 24,55 where Laban and his mother wanted Rebeccah to delay her departure by ימים, i.e. a year. The years which are viewed as the חבלי משיח, the birth-pangs of the Messiah, last for seven years during which Israel will be refined spiritually in preparation of his arrival. He will make his appearance during the eighth year. On the eighth day, at the beginning of the eighth day (year), the baby is to have its foreskin removed, i.e. the concept of a foreskin which acts as a barrier between man and G'd will be removed from the universe. We read in Zachariah 13,2 that G'd will destroy the spirit of impurity from the earth. This will occur during the eighth year. It is well known that conceptually the foreskin is identical with the forces of the קליפה, the spiritually negative emanations. When the Torah wrote the word וטמאה, describing the state of the mother, this is a simile for the afflictions experienced during the birth-pangs of the Messiah.</p>

The word ימים as meaning a year has already occurred in Genesis 24,54 ימים או עשור, “a year or at least 10 months.” Also in Exodus 13,10 we find the expressionמימים ימימה, which  means: “from year to year, annually.” When the words מקץ שנתים occur without the addition of the word ימים, they mean “one year.” When an animal did not yet reach the first anniversary of its birth it is called as being בן שנתו, “an up to one year old.” (compare Leviticus 12,6)</p>

            <summary>A virgin is given twelve months to prepare for her wedding, based on the example of Rebecca staying with her family for &quot;days, or ten&quot; which is interpreted as a year and ten months.

              </summary>
              <p>GEMARA: The Gemara asks: From where are these matters derived, that a virgin is given twelve months to prepare for her wedding? Rav Ḥisda said it is based on the fact that the verse states with regard to Rebecca: “And her brother and mother said: Let the damsel abide with us for days, or ten” (Genesis 24:55).</p>

                <h4>Ketubot 57b:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>The Gemara first analyzes the language of the verse: What is the meaning of “days”? If we say two days, the minimum number justifying the use of the plural, does a person really speak like this? Rebecca’s relatives said to Abraham’s servant that they wanted her to stay for two days, after which he said to them no, as he did not want to wait even that long. If so, is it possible that after that they said to him that they wanted her to stay for ten days? Consequently, it is impossible to explain the word “days” as two days and “ten” as ten days. Rather, what is the meaning of “days”? It means: A year, as it is written: “For days he shall have redemption” (Leviticus 25:29), and there it is explained that “days” is referring to a year. Consequently, in the verse “And her brother and mother said: Let the damsel abide with us for days, or ten” (Genesis 24:55), “days” refers to a year, and “ten” refers to a shorter period of similar magnitude, i.e. ten months, in order to prepare for her wedding.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Chapter (67) 68: Prophets [1] &quot;In the second year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai&quot; (Haggai 1:1). Like the scriptures say: &quot;A voice of one calling: “In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God. Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level,the rugged places a plain. And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.” (Isaiah 40:3-5) [also look: Eikhah Rabbah 1:23]. &quot;A voice calls out [in the wilderness]&quot; [edit: ] . Rabbi Levi said: &quot;Why is it called 'in the wilderness'? Rather, it is in accordance with the practice of the world. Just as someone who lost a valuable object does not search for it in the place where it was lost, but rather in a public place where many people pass through, so too the Holy One, blessed be He, caused Israel to be lost in the wilderness, as it is said, 'In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die' (Numbers 14:35), and there He goes and seeks them. A voice calls out in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way.' What should we prepare? He said to them, 'Remove the obstacles from among you.' As Laban said to Eliezer, 'Do not be delayed by me, now that the Lord has granted success to your journey. Let me see you off and send you on your way to my master' (Genesis 24:56). Laban had already uprooted [Rebecca] from here [Haran] for Eliezer's sake, as it is said, 'And I have set my face towards the Lord' (Genesis 24:27). And what about the place for the camels? He said to him, 'Rebecca does not steal in this place. And I have set my face towards the Lord.' And who will steal [the idols]? Rachel, who is destined to stand up [to Laban], will steal them and put them among the camels, as it is said, 'And Rachel took the  teraphim * [*תְּרָפִים m.n. pl. a kind of  household idols. Of uncertain origin. According to Neubauer and others, related to רֽפָאִים ᴵ (=  shades, ghosts ).], and put them in the camel's saddle' (Genesis 31:34). Alternatively, 'And I have set my face towards the Lord' is a reference to the statue of Manasseh. And when was it [that it was hidden]? When Nebuchadnezzar went out to destroy it, as it is compared to a camel, as it is said, 'The burden upon beasts of burden' (Isaiah 21:7). The burden upon beasts of burden is the Messiah, and the burden upon a camel is Nebuchadnezzar. On the day that Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Temple, the Messiah was born, as it is said, 'And Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one' (Isaiah 10:34), and 'a shoot shall grow out of the stock of Jesse' (Isaiah 11:1). Therefore, 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God' (Isaiah 40:3), straighten yourselves like those whom I straightened out in the wilderness who were crooked, 'and let every valley be exalted, and every mountain and hill be made low' (Isaiah 40:4), so that you will no longer be afraid of sin, as it is said, 'Look at your way in the valley' (Jeremiah 2:23).&quot; Alternative interpretation: &quot;All valleys will be exalted. I will carry Moshe, who was buried in a valley, as it is written 'And He buried him in the valley' (Deuteronomy 34:6). This can be compared to a wise man who entrusted his son to a scribe to learn Torah laws and teachings. When they came to appoint him as a wise man, he said, 'I swear that my son has not yet been appointed a wise man until his teacher comes and sanctifies him.' Similarly, Hashem entrusted Israel to Moshe and taught them everything, as it is written, 'See, I have taught you statutes and laws' (Deuteronomy 4:5). And the Messiah will come to redeem them, and Hashem says to him, 'I swear that my children will not be redeemed until Moshe Rabbeinu comes,' as it is written, 'I saw his beginning and ending' (Isaiah 41:4). Why do I carry him? 'Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill shall be made low' (Isaiah 40:4). These are the kingdoms, as it is written, 'And I looked up and saw four chariots coming out from between two mountains' (Zechariah 6:1). And 'The crooked shall be made straight and the rough places smooth' (Isaiah 40:4). This refers to the evil inclination, as it is written, 'The heart is deceitful above all things' (Jeremiah 17:9).

Afterwards, 'And the glory of Hashem shall be revealed' (Isaiah 40:5), because in this world the prophets prophesy indirectly, saying, 'I saw Hashem standing by the altar' (Amos 9:1). Ezekiel says, 'The word of Hashem came to me and I saw visions by the river Kevar' (Ezekiel 1:1). Amos says, 'Behold, Hashem stood upon a wall with a plumb line' (Amos 7:7). &quot;And the prophet Haggai prophesied about the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem&quot; (Ezra 5:1), but in the future, everyone will see it, as it is said, &quot;And the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all flesh will see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken&quot; (Isaiah 40:5).</p>

Like a precentor, who is standing and blessing the bride in her bridal canopy, so they stood and blessed Rebecca their sister (wedded) to Isaac, as it is said, &quot;And they blessed Rebecca, and said unto her, Our sister…&quot; (Gen. 24:60).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>We know already from Genesis 18,16 where Avraham escorted the angels who had visited him, that he was in the habit of escorting his guests. This last stage in fulfilling the commandment of being hospitable is in fact the part for which the host receives his true reward. We find, for instance, that immediately after Avraham had escorted the angels away from his house, G’d rewarded him by revealing to him the impending fate of Sodom and giving him a chance to plead for their lives. We find something similar in Psalms 135,4 where the psalmist wrote כי יעקב בחר לו י-ה, and the reading of the last two words is one word, i.e. לויה, suggesting that the reason G’d chose Yaakov as His people was because they practice the virtue of escorting their guests. We find that the Torah also provides a hint of this when relating the journey of Eliezer to get a bride for Yitzchak. In Genesis 24,56 Eliezer is quoted as saying to his hosts: אל תאחרו אותי וה' הצליח דרכי, “do not delay me seeing that G’d has made my mission successful.” (The respective last letters in the words spell אל תאחרו אותי וה-י-ה-ו-ה spell the word לויה, “escort.)”</p>

It is forbidden to force marriage on anyone. According to Kidushin 41, a father may not make use of the right to marry off his daughter, the minor, unless she is old enough to understand the implication of giving her own consent, by saying: “I want to marry so and so.”</p>

    Alternately, the question posed to Rivkah meant: “do you prefer to travel with this man, or would you prefer that one of us comes with you to the land of Canaan?” Her answer when she said; “I will go,” meant that she considered the man as trustworthy and that it would be unfair to delay him on account of the expensive jewelry she had already accepted from him.”

              <p>“She said, I will go” [24:57]. Rebecca said: I will go, even if you tell me not to go, I will go by myself. Bahya asks a question. In the Torah portion, Eliezer is sometimes called a servant and sometimes he is called a man. That is to say, important. The explanation is that at first, before he came to the well and had not yet seen the angel, he is called a servant. However, when Eliezer came to the well and saw that the angel was with him, Scripture called him a man. That is, he is important because the angel appeared to him. The angel is also called a man. Eliezer also received honor because of the angel. Therefore, as soon as Rebecca was given into the hands of Eliezer, the mission of the angel ended and Scripture again calls him servant, as the verse says, “the servant brought out objects of silver and gold” [24:53]; “the servant took Rebecca” [24:61].

He wanted to impede [the betrothal of Rebecca] and was stricken down overnight. That is what is written: “The righteousness of the honest will straighten his way” (Proverbs 11:5). “The righteousness of the honest” – this is Isaac; “will straighten his way” – the way of Eliezer. “In his evil, the wicked one is rejected” (Proverbs 11:5) – this is Betuel, who was stricken down overnight.  “Let the girl remain with us some days” – this refers to the seven days of mourning for him [Betuel]. “Or ten months [asor]” – this refers to the twelve months that a virgin is given to secure her needs for herself. (After betrothal, a fiancée is entitled to take twelve months before the wedding to prepare herself (Mishna Ketubot 5:2). Laban and his mother were willing to speed up the process, so they requested only ten months.)  “They said: We will call the girl, and ask her response” (Genesis 24:57).   “They said: We will call the girl [and ask her response]” – from here we learn that one may marry off an orphan girl only with her consent.  “They called Rebecca and said to her: Will you go with this man? She said: I will go” (Genesis 24:58).  “They called Rebecca and said to her: [Will you go with this man?]” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: They were hinting to her: ‘Will you [really] go? Will you [really] go?’ (They did not want her to go. It was as though they were asking: Are you even considering going with him?)  “She said: I will go” – I am going against your will, even if you disapprove.</p>

              <p>“Her brother and her mother said: Let the girl remain with us for some days, or ten months; afterward she shall go” (Genesis 24:55).  “Her brother and her mother said: Let the girl remain with us” – where was [her father] Betuel? He wanted to impede [the betrothal of Rebecca] and was stricken down overnight. That is what is written: “The righteousness of the honest will straighten his way” (Proverbs 11:5). “The righteousness of the honest” – this is Isaac; “will straighten his way” – the way of Eliezer. “In his evil, the wicked one is rejected” (Proverbs 11:5) – this is Betuel, who was stricken down overnight.  “Let the girl remain with us some days” – this refers to the seven days of mourning for him [Betuel]. “Or ten months [asor]” – this refers to the twelve months that a virgin is given to secure her needs for herself. (After betrothal, a fiancée is entitled to take twelve months before the wedding to prepare herself (Mishna Ketubot 5:2). Laban and his mother were willing to speed up the process, so they requested only ten months.)  “They said: We will call the girl, and ask her response” (Genesis 24:57).   “They said: We will call the girl [and ask her response]” – from here we learn that one may marry off an orphan girl only with her consent.  “They called Rebecca and said to her: Will you go with this man? She said: I will go” (Genesis 24:58).  “They called Rebecca and said to her: [Will you go with this man?]” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: They were hinting to her: ‘Will you [really] go? Will you [really] go?’ (They did not want her to go. It was as though they were asking: Are you even considering going with him?)  “She said: I will go” – I am going against your will, even if you disapprove.</p>

Chizkuni adds that Deborah was sent by Rebekah to inform Jacob it was safe to return, remained with him in Padan Arom, and died on the journey back to Canaan, clarifying her role in Jacob's entourage.

              <p>“They sent Rebecca their sister, and her nursemaid, and Abraham’s servant, and his men” (Genesis 24:59).  “They blessed Rebecca, and said to her: Our sister, may you become thousands and myriads, and let your descendants inherit the gate of their enemies” (Genesis 24:60).  “They sent Rebecca…they blessed Rebecca” – they were downcast and despondent [that she was going], and they blessing her only with their mouths. (Not with their hearts.)   “Our sister, may you become thousands and myriads” – Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: Why was Rebecca granted [conception] only after Isaac prayed for her? (See Genesis 25:21.)  It was so that the idolaters [Laban and his mother] should not say: ‘Our prayer bore fruit.’ Instead, “Isaac entreated the Lord on behalf of his wife” (Genesis 25:21).  Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: “The blessing of the lost would come to me” (Job 29:13). “The blessing of the lost [oved]” – this refers to Laban the Aramean, as it is stated: “An Aramaean sought to destroy [oved] my father” (Deuteronomy 26:5). “Would come upon me” – this refers to Rebecca.  “Our sister, may you become thousands [alfei] and myriads [revava]” – chieftains [alufim] emerged from her through Esau, and myriads through Jacob. Chieftains from Esau – “the chieftain of Teiman, the chieftain of Kenaz” (Genesis 36:15); myriads [revava] from Jacob, as it is written: “I rendered you numerous [revava] like the plants of the field” (Ezekiel 16:7). Some say that both of these emerged through Israel, as it is written: “When it rested, he said: Repose Lord, among the myriad [rivevot] thousands of [alfei] Israel” (Numbers 10:36).</p>

              <p>ותמת דבורה, “Deborah died;” Rashi explains why the Torah suddenly inserts this statement and how it is relevant. We never knew that she was part of Yaakov’s entourage. After all, Yaakov himself had said that when he crossed the river Jordan the first time he had been accompanied only by his walking stick (Compare Genesis 32,11) Rivkah had told Yaakov (Genesis 27,4445) that she would let him know when it was safe to return, when Esau’s wrath had cooled off. She had dispatched Deborah to Padan Arom to inform Yaakov of this. Yaakov had not been willing to return already. Deborah remained with him in the house of Lavan and passed away on the journey on the way back to the land of Canaan. When she had been mentioned the first time (Genesis 24,59) she had only been described as Rivkah’s nursemaid; now the Torah supplied her name.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND DEBORAH REBEKAH’s NURSE DIED. I do not know why this verse has been placed between the verse, And he called the place El-beth-el (Verse 7 here.)  and the following verse, And G-d appeared to Jacob again. (Verse 9 here.)  Scripture thus interrupts one subject which occurred at one time and in one place for when Jacob came to Luz, that is Beth-el, (Verse 6 here.)  he built an altar there and he called the place El-beth-el, (Verse 7 here.)  and G-d appeared to him there and He blessed him. (Verse 9 here.)  Why then was this verse concerning Deborah’s death placed in the midst of one subject? A feasible answer is that which our Rabbis have said, (Bereshith Rabbah 81:8.)  namely that the verse alludes to the death of Rebekah, and therefore Jacob called the name of that place, Alon-bachut (the oak of weeping), for the weeping and anguish could not have been such for the passing of the old nurse that the place would have been named on account of it. Instead, Jacob wept and mourned for his righteous mother who had loved him and sent him to Paddan-aram and who was not privileged to see him when he returned. Therefore G-d appeared to him and blessed him, in order to comfort him, just as He had done to his father Isaac following the death of Abraham. (Above, 25:11.)  With reference to both of them the Sages have said (Sotah 14 a; Bereshith Rabbah 82:4.)  that He gave them the blessing of consolation addressed to mourners. Proof for this is that which is said below, And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, (Verse 27 here.)  for had Rebekah been there, Scripture would have mentioned “unto his father and unto his mother” for it was she who sent him. to Paddan-aram and caused him all the good, for Isaac commanded him to go there at her advice. Now Rashi commented: “Because the time of her death was kept secret in order that people might not curse her — the mother who gave birth to Esau — Scripture also does not make mention of her death.” This is a Midrash of the Sages. (Tanchuma Ki Theitzei 4.)  But neither does Scripture mention the death of Leah! Instead, we must say that the intent of the Sages was to explain why Scripture mentions Rebekah’s death by allusion, connecting the matter with her nurse. Since Scripture did refer to it, they wondered why the matter was hidden and not revealed. And the justification for the curse stated by Rashi is not clear since Scripture mentioned Esau at the death of Isaac, And Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. (Verse 29 here.)  It is, however, possible to say that Rebekah’s death lacked honor, for Jacob was not there, and Esau hated her and would not attend; Isaac’s eyes were too dim to see, (Above, 27:1.)  and he did not leave his house. Therefore, Scripture did not want to mention that she was buried by the Hittites. I found a similar explanation in Eileh Hadvarim Rabbah, (I found this not in Midrash Rabbah but in Tanchuma Ki Theitzei, 4.)  in the section of Ki Theitzei Lamilchamah, (Deuteronomy 21:10.)  where the Sages say: “You find that when Rebekah died, people said, ‘Who shall go before her? Abraham is dead. Isaac is confined to the house and his eyes are dim. Jacob is gone to Paddan-aram. If wicked Esau shall go before her, people will say, “Cursed be the breast that gave suck to this one.’” What did they do? They took out her bier at night. Rabbi Yosei bar Chaninah said, ‘Due to the fact that they took out her bier at night the Scriptures mentioned her death only indirectly. It is this which Scripture says, And he called its name Alon-bachut, two weepings, [one for Deborah and one for Rebekah]. Thus Scripture says, And G-d appeared unto Jacob… and blessed him. (Verse 9 here.)  What blessing did He give him? He gave him the blessing of consolation addressed to mourners.’” Thus far the Midrash. Now because Esau was the only one present at her burial, they feared the curse, and they did not view the burial as an honor to her, this being the significance of the Scriptural hint. Deborah was in Jacob’s company because after accompanying Rebekah to the land of Canaan, she had returned to her country, and now she was coming with Jacob in order to see her mistress. It may be that she was engaged in raising Jacob’s children out of respect for Rebekah and due to her love for her, and thus she resided with him. Now it is possible that she is not “the nurse” of whom it is said, And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, (Above 24: 59.)  but that she was another nurse who remained in the house of Laban and Bethuel, and now Jacob brought her with him to support her in her old age out of respect to his mother, for it was the custom among the notables to have many nurses. It is improbable that the old woman would be the messenger whom his mother had dispatched to Jacob [to have him return to the Land of Israel], as Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan would have it. (Mentioned by Rashi in this verse. A preacher in the city of Narbonne, Provence, France, who lived in the second half of the eleventh century, Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan, compiled a collection of Agadic material on the book of Genesis. The book itself, which had a great influence upon Rashi and other writers, has been lost except for the quotations made by other scholars.) </p>

In that case, the Holy One Blessed Be He who knows the thoughts [of the &quot;enemies&quot;] described them with the root Aleph-Vav-Yud-Bet [rather than Sin-Nun-Aleph] which describes a feeling in their hearts. But a hater enemy [Sin-Nun-Aleph] implies action as well, as in Devarim 30:7 &quot;upon your enemies [root Sin-Nun-Aleph] who chase after you.&quot; And people do not appreciate the wonder this is that even those who actively hate us will need the wisdom of Israel.</p>

              <p>“They sent Rebecca their sister, and her nursemaid, and Abraham’s servant, and his men” (Genesis 24:59).  “They blessed Rebecca, and said to her: Our sister, may you become thousands and myriads, and let your descendants inherit the gate of their enemies” (Genesis 24:60).  “They sent Rebecca…they blessed Rebecca” – they were downcast and despondent [that she was going], and they blessing her only with their mouths. (Not with their hearts.)   “Our sister, may you become thousands and myriads” – Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: Why was Rebecca granted [conception] only after Isaac prayed for her? (See Genesis 25:21.)  It was so that the idolaters [Laban and his mother] should not say: ‘Our prayer bore fruit.’ Instead, “Isaac entreated the Lord on behalf of his wife” (Genesis 25:21).  Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: “The blessing of the lost would come to me” (Job 29:13). “The blessing of the lost [oved]” – this refers to Laban the Aramean, as it is stated: “An Aramaean sought to destroy [oved] my father” (Deuteronomy 26:5). “Would come upon me” – this refers to Rebecca.  “Our sister, may you become thousands [alfei] and myriads [revava]” – chieftains [alufim] emerged from her through Esau, and myriads through Jacob. Chieftains from Esau – “the chieftain of Teiman, the chieftain of Kenaz” (Genesis 36:15); myriads [revava] from Jacob, as it is written: “I rendered you numerous [revava] like the plants of the field” (Ezekiel 16:7). Some say that both of these emerged through Israel, as it is written: “When it rested, he said: Repose Lord, among the myriad [rivevot] thousands of [alfei] Israel” (Numbers 10:36).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: Why did Rebecca become barren? It was so the nations of the world would not say: ‘Our prayer produced results,’ as they said to her: “Our sister, may you become thousands and myriads” (Genesis 24:60). This was until Isaac prayed on her behalf, and she was remembered. That is what is written: “Isaac entreated the Lord on behalf of his wife” (Genesis 25:21). Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa: Why did the matriarchs become barren? It was so they would not rely on their husbands due to their beauty. (They would not be fully confident in their relationship with their husbands, despite their great beauty, because their husbands would be frustrated by their barrenness. Therefore, they would place their trust in God (Etz Yosef).)  Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Why did the matriarchs become barren? It was so most of the years would elapse without enslavement. (In the covenant of the pieces Abraham was told that the four hundred years, beginning with Isaac’s birth, would contain elements of being strangers, enslavement, and oppression (Genesis 15:13). The fact that the matriarchs were barren, together with the fact that the enslavement in Egypt did not begin until after Joseph and his brothers died, ensured that the majority of the four hundred years elapsed without slavery (Etz Yosef).)  Rabbi Ḥoni [said] in the name of Rabbi Meir: Why did the matriarchs become barren? It was so their husbands would enjoy their beauty, for when a woman becomes pregnant, she becomes ugly and revolting. Know that it is so, as all the years that Sarah our matriarch was barren she would sit in her house like a bride under her wedding canopy. When she became pregnant, her luster was altered, just as it says: “With pain you shall bear children” (Genesis 3:16). Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shila of the village of Ḥamarta, and Rabbi Ḥelbo in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Why did the matriarchs become barren? It is because the Holy One blessed be He desired to hear their speech. He said to them: ‘My dove, I will tell you why I rendered you barren; it is because I desired to hear your speech.’ That is what is written: “For your voice is pleasant, and your appearance is lovely.”</p>

Our תוספות reconciles this with another source which derives this rule from elsewhere. ---------------------------–  תוספות anticipates a difficulty: ובמסכת כלה ( In the very beginning of מסכת כלה (which can be [usually] found in the back of מס׳ ע״ז) it states [כלה בלא ברכה אסורה לבעלה כנדה] ומניין לברכת חתנים מה״ת שנאמר ויברכו את רבקה ומנין שאפילו אלמנה וכו׳ שנאמר ויקח בועז עשרה אנשים וכו׳. It would seem that תוספות question is why the מסכת כלה cites the פסוק of רבקה, since it can all be derived from בועז (and he cites that פסוק anyway). See סוכ״ד אות עד for an alternate explanation. )  דמייתי קרא דויברכו את רבקה (בראשית כד ( פסוק ס׳. ) ) – And in מסכת כלה where he cites the פסוק; ‘and they blessed רבקה’, as a source for ברכת חתנים בעשרה (and does not derive it from ויקח בועז [alone]) –  תוספות replies: איכא למימר דהתם ברכת אירוסין ( The ברכה of וצונו על העריות וכו׳. See ‘Thinking it over’# 1. )  והכא ברכת נישואין ( The (six) ברכות beginning with שהכל ברא לכבודו. )  – One can say; that there (in מסכת כלה by רבקה) it was regarding the blessing of the betrothal, and here (by בועז) it is regarding the blessing of the marriage.  תוספות continues with a tangential issue: ויש ללמוד משם שיש לברך ברכת אירוסין לאשה המתקדשת על ידי שליח ( This expression seemingly indicates a case where the woman is not present and she is becoming מקודשת through a שליח. It is not clear why תוס׳ did not say this in a case where האיש מקדש ע״י שליח, since this is the case by רבקה. )  – And we can seemingly derive from there (by רבקה), that one can recite the ברכת אירוסין to a woman is being betrothed through an agent –  שהרי אליעזר שליח היה – For אליעזר was a שליח to be מקדש רבקה for יצחק, and they made ברכת אירוסין.  תוספות rejects the previous conclusion: ונראה דאסמכתא ( An אסמכתא refers to a derivation from a פסוק, which is not really the source of the ruling. The source is from elsewhere (or even מדרבנן); however we cite the פסוק as a support for the ruling. )   בעלמא היא דעשרה לא מישתמע מהתם ( However by בועז it states clearly that there were עשרה אנשים. See ‘Thinking it over’ # 2. )  – And it is the view of תוספות that the derivation from רבקה that ברכת אירוסין is required, this derivation is merely a support to the practice but not a source,  ( This answers תוספות initial question as well, since we really do not derive ברכת חתנים from רבקה; they merely cite it to have an אסמכתא מן התורה (and not only to derive it from כתובים). )  for it is not understood from there that ten people are required –  ולא איירי פשטיה דקרא בברכת ( However by בועז it does indicate ברכת חתנים as the גמרא states later, if it was merely for the דרשה, we do not require ten people, so it must be for ברכת חתנים. )  אירוסין: And the simple interpretation of the verse does not indicate that it is discussing ברכת אירוסין, which is וצונו על העריות, but rather merely a blessing from her family that she should be successful, etc.  SUMMARY We can perhaps say that the ברכה by רבקה is ברכת אירוסין (and by בועז it is ברכת נישואין), and derive that one makes ברכת אירוסין even if the שליח is מקדש, or probably assume that the פסוק of רבקה was merely an אסמכתא (and we do not derive anything from it).  THINKING IT OVER 1. תוספות (initially) states that the ברכה by רבקה refers to ברכת אירוסין. ( See footnote # 5. )  Seemingly this is difficult, for מס׳ כלה begins כלה בלא ברכה אסורה לבעלה וכו׳; indicating that with a ברכה she is permitted. However if we assume that the ברכה of רבקה was ברכת אירוסין, then she is still forbidden until the נישואין! ( See כסא שלמה. )  2. תוספות writes that the לימוד from רבקה is merely an אסמכתא, since we cannot derive from it the requirement of עשרה אנשים. ( See footnote # 9. )  However in מסכת כלה it merely states that we derive the ברכה from רבקה it does not claim that we derive the requirement for עשרה from רבקה! ( See כסא שלמה. ) </p>

It is good and proper to celebrate a Bat Mitzvah in the same way as a Bar Mitzvah, with the Bat Mitzvah girl reciting the Shehechiyanu blessing, words relating to the day, and reading specific passages.

              <p>It is good and proper to have a celebration for a Bat Mitzvah in the same way that is done for a Bar Mitzvah - to invite family, friends and acquaintances and have them participate in the celebration. At this occasion, the Bat Mitzvah girl should recite the Shehechiyanu blessing over a new garment and - if she is learned - she should say words relating to the day, read the Song of Devorah and the first two verses of Channah's prayer. (See Ben Ish Chai, Year 1, Parashat Reeh 17; Shut Yaskil Avdi vol. 8, Orach Chaim 17; Netivei Am 225 at the end; Shut Iggerot Moshe, vol. 1, Orach Chaim 104; Shut Yabeah Omer vol. 6, Orach Chaim 29:4. The Song of Devorah is Judges 5, [the mentioned verses of] Channah's prayer are I Samuel 2:1-2.)  And the father of the girl should recite the blessing of exemption from the punishment of this one (exempting a parent from responsibility when their child becomes an adult). (See Rama, Orach Chaim 225:72; Kaf HaChaim, Orach Chaim 225:15-16.)  And they should bless her and say to her, &quot;Our sister, may you become thousands of myriads.&quot; (Genesis 24:60.)  And she should, of course, go beforehand to the synagogue to pray, but not to go up to the Torah.</p>

              <p>Moreover, the inference from Rambam is that women may recite all seven marriage blessings and not just asher bara. His statement in Hilchot Berachot 2:9, &quot;This blessing is recited neither by slaves nor by children&quot; which does not exclude women, applies as well to the sheva berachot mentioned immediately afterwards in 2:10, since Rambam made no other statement as to who may or may not recite them. [For the same reason, &quot;on condition that ten [men] are present&quot; in 2:10 also refers to 2:9].  A hint from Scripture that women and men alike can recite birkat chatanim can be brought from Bereishit 24:6, where Rivkah's mother and brother both blessed her after she agreed to marry Yitzchak. Masechet Kalah explained, &quot;Where [is there a source] in the Torah for birkat chatanim? As it is said, 'They blessed Rivkah.' &quot; This even clearer in Pirkei d'R. Eliezer, chapter 16, &quot;they stood and blessed Rivkah as a chazan stands and blesses the bride in her chupah&quot; and see Tosafot in Ketuvot 7b and at length in Shitah Mekubetzet. Although Masechet Kalah concludes that this is only a Scriptural peg and not an actual derivation, it certainly suggests that women have a role in blessing the marriage couple.</p>

            <summary>A bride is forbidden to her husband without the marriage benediction, similar to a niddah who has not immersed in the ritual bath. The benediction of bridegrooms is derived from the Torah, as seen in the blessing of Rebekah, and even a widow is forbidden without it, as shown in the case of Ruth.</summary>

                <h4>Tractate Kallah 1:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>A bride (Here used in the sense of a betrothed girl. In the Talmudic period betrothal (’erusin) and marriage (ḳiddushin) denoted two stages different from what they are now. ’Erusin took place in the bride’s home and ḳiddushin subsequently in the bridegroom’s home. It is important to note that the ceremony of ’erusin was binding upon the bridal couple and could not be dissolved without a bill of divorce. Later the current custom prevailed whereby the two ceremonies were combined and performed at the same time (cf. P.B., pp. 298f., the benediction on the first of the pages being of ’erusin).)  is forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction (This consisted of seven benedictions. For the wording cf. K.R. I, 1, below p. 415f.; Keth. 7b-8a (Sonc. ed., pp. 31ff.); P.B., p. 299.)  in the same manner as a niddah. (In Biblical law the period of menstrual impurity lasted seven days (Lev. 15, 19ff.) but was extended by the Rabbis to eleven days. At the end of the period immersion in a ritual bath was necessary.)  Just as a niddah (Whose period of purification has ended.)  who has not immersed [in the ritual bath] is forbidden to her husband, so likewise is a bride forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction. Whence is the benediction of bridegrooms derived from the Torah? As it is stated, And they blessed Rebekah. (Gen. 24, 60.)  And whence do we derive that even a widow is so forbidden? (On remarriage without the benediction, cf. Keth. 7a (Sonc. ed., p. 26).)  As it is stated, And he took ten men of the elders of the city … And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders said, We are witnesses. The Lord make the woman … and let thy house be like the house of Perez. (Ruth 4, 2, 11f.) </p>

The journey was expedited, emphasizing Rebekah's noble status and Eliezer's role as a servant. Isaac prayed in the field upon seeing them, likened to a poor man pouring out his heart to the Lord. The presence of the heavenly messenger Mattatron is indicated by Eliezer's descriptions in Genesis 24:61, with the mission considered concluded upon his return. The Gemara discusses women riding camels, concluding it is not immodest, while Rav Ashi criticizes Manoah for not knowing the story of Rebecca riding on camels.

            <summary>Rebekah, her nurse, and the servant Eliezer set out on camels to meet Isaac, with Eliezer personally overseeing Rebekah's well-being along the way, as he walked beside her to ensure her safety and comfort. Eliezer's zealousness in guarding Rebekah against mishaps during the journey is highlighted, with the departure of Rebekah and the servant taking place after an emotional farewell with her family and friends, leading to Eliezer taking matters into his own hands to expedite the journey. Rebekah's noble status is emphasized by her being accompanied by her nursemaid and maids, while Eliezer's role as a servant is subtly acknowledged through the use of the term &quot;man&quot; to refer to him.</summary>

              <p>AND WENT HIS WAY. Va-yelakh (and went his way) is vocalized with a pattach rather than a kamatz even though it closes a verse, (A pattach usually changes to a kamatz at the end of a verse. We would thus expect va-yelakh to be vocalized with a kamatz.)  the reason for this being that this word is normally vocalized with a segol, and a vowel cannot go up two steps. (And he went is usually written with a segol (ya-yelekh). However, since here it closes a verse, the segol changes to a pattach. It cannot change to a kamatz because it would then be going up two steps, that is, from a segol to a kamatz, skipping the step of pattach. The normal sequence of the vowels followed by I.E. is segol pattach, kamatz.)  The same principle applies to the word va-yomar (and he said). (Va-yomer (and he said) is vocalized va-yomar with a pattach and not a kamatz, at the close of a verse.)  </p>

              <p>ויקח העבד את רבקה וילך, “The servant took Rivkah and he went.” The Torah here describes the servant’s desire to quickly complete his mission, after all the women had first accompanied Rivkah to the outskirts of the town, now Eliezer personally took over the task of watching over her to protect her against any possible mishap.
    Alternatively, seeing that the entire entourage of Rivkah and her family and friends had delayed the orderly departure as they had difficulty in parting from her, Eliezer now told the locals to turn back and let him get on with his task; i.e. ויקח, he now took matters in hand, etc.
    Ibn Ezra opines that the meaning of the apparently repeated mention of Eliezer taking Rivkah is that he personally walked along side her until they eventually met Yitzchok, and that he did not mind the inconvenience of walking (instead of riding on a camel).

He showed them the way. One asks a question. What is the meaning of “the servant took Rebecca”? Why does he have to say that he took Rebecca when she was coming along? The explanation is that the women went behind Rebecca to see her off. When they came into the fields, Eliezer took Rebecca by the hand. He wanted to protect her very well and walked near her.

The servant took Rebecca and went” (Genesis 24:61).  “Rebecca and her maids rose, [and rode upon the camels]…” [Why did they ride on camels?] (Camels are difficult to ride.)  Rabbi Levi said: It is the nature of camels that they grow in the East. (So Rebecca and her maids were used to riding them.)  The Rabbis say: [Camels were used for a symbolic reason.] Just as a camel has one sign of purity (It chews its cud.)  and one sign of impurity, (It does not have split hooves.)  so Rebecca produced one righteous person and one wicked person.  “And followed the man” – as it is unbefitting for a man to walk behind a woman.  “Isaac came from going to Be’er Laḥai Ro’i and he was living in the land of the south” (Genesis 24:62).  “Isaac came from going [ba mibo]” – he was coming [ba] back from bringing something. (Mibo is interpreted to mean: From bringing.)  And where had he gone? To Be’er Laḥai Ro’i. He had gone to bring Hagar back [to Abraham], she being the one who had sat by the well [be’er], and who had said to the One who lives [laḥai] forever: ‘See [re’eh] my misery.’ (See Genesis 21:14–21:19.)  “Isaac went out to have some words in the field toward evening, and he lifted his eyes, and behold, he saw camels coming” (Genesis 24:63).  “Isaac went out to have some words [lasuaḥ] in the field toward evening” – siḥa is nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “The prayer of a poor man, when he feels overwhelmed and pours out his prayer [siḥo] before the Lord” (Psalms 102:1).

              <p>In 24,61 we read about Rebeccah and her maidservants: ותרכבנה על הגמלים ותלכנה אחרי האיש, ויקח העבד את רבקה וילך . &quot;They rode on the camels and followed the man; the servant took Rebeccah and went (on his way). Clearly, the reason that we find two descriptions of Eliezer in one verse is that Mattaron the heavenly messenger was present until the mission had been concluded. The mission was not concluded until Eliezer was out of Charan on his way back. This process is indicated by the words in 24,61 ותקם רבקה ונערותיה ותלכנה אחרי האיש. Immediately after that, when Mattatron returned to Heaven, the Torah reverts to describing the man leading Rebeccah as עבד. It is possible that the word וילך, he went on his way, refers to Mattaron who returned to the Celestial Regions he had come from.</p>

Since a camel’s back is high off the ground, a woman cannot sit on it sidesaddle; consequently, she may ride on it without being considered immodest. The Gemara cites another relevant verse.

        <summary>Isaac visited the well Lahai-roi, a place of prayer where prayers were answered, possibly coming from Beer-lahai-roi or the Garden of Eden for healing. He settled near the well, re-digging old wells for living water. Isaac and Moses met their mates at wells, following patriarchal examples. Moses prayed based on the faith of the patriarchs to defeat Amalek, with Yitzchak living near Be'er Lahai Roi after Abraham's death. Be'er Laḥai Ro'i is where Hagar encountered an angel and received a promise from God, symbolizing a connection between Yitzhak and Hagar's experience.</summary>

            <summary>Isaac had just returned from a visit to the well Lahai-roi, which was a place of prayer for him due to a previous angelic revelation. He was on his way back to his permanent residence in the south country. Some commentators suggest that Isaac was coming from inside the town of Beer-lahai-roi, where he had business affairs, and that he was not establishing a new residence there. Others explain that Isaac was returning from a visit to the well Lahai-roi, a place where prayers were answered. It is also suggested that Isaac had been in the Garden of Eden for three years for healing purposes.</summary>

The formulation in our verse is similar to Kings I 8,65: מלבא חמת, or from Genesis 25,18: בואכה אשורה, “all the way to Ashur.” It is as if the Torah had written: מן בא. The word בא is used here in the same sense as in Judges 1,24: הראנו נא את מבא כניסת העיר, “please show us the way to the entrance of the city.” The letter מ in the word: מבא is to be understood like the letter מ in Psalms 38,5: מתום which means תום, from תמים, pure, unadulterated, (in the spiritual sense.

              <p>AND ISAAC CAME FROM THE WAY OF BEER-LAHAI-ROI. Beer-lahai-roi has two names. (Bo and Beer-lahai-roi. The Hebrew reads, ba mi-bo be’er-la-chai ro’i. If the Bible meant Isaac came from Beer-lahai-roi it should have read, ba mi-be’er-la-chai-ro’i. The word mi-bo thus presents a problem. This interpretation suggests that the verse be translated: Isaac came from Bo-beer-lahai-roi, the latter being a combination of both names (Cherez).)  Others say that ba mi-bo (came from the way) means came from the inside of. (I.e., mi-bo means from inside. They explain our verse to mean that Isaac came from inside (mi-bo) of Beer-lahai roi. The latter was a town in which the well by that name was located. The town took the name of the well. Isaac had some business in this town and was leaving it when he met Rebekah (Weiser).)  They similarly explain the word mi-bo in Every house is shut up, that none may come in (mi-bo) (Is. 24:10). However, I believe that mi-bo is an infinitive (That is, it consists of the infinitive bo (come) plus the prepositional mem. Thus mi-bo means from the way.)  and ba mi-bo be’er-la-chai-ro’i means came from the way leading to Beer-lahai-roi. (That is, Isaac was returning from a visit to Be’er-lahai-roi.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויצחק בא מבוא, “and Yitzchak was in the process of coming from Be-er lachay Ro-i.” The plain meaning of the text is precisely what the sages wrote in Bereshit Rabbah 60,14 in answer to the rhetorical question where Yitzchak was coming from, that he came to bring Hagar who dwelled near the well mentioned in order for her to become the wife of his father. Hagar had named this well to acknowledge that G’d had seen her disgrace and had helped her regain her dignity. This verse and the words בא מבוא may be a reference to the spiritual equivalent of the Jewish people, i.e Mount Moriah. Yitzchak had only now returned from a three-year stay at that holy site. He had been shown by G’d that this was the spiritual well of the Jewish people, the source from which they receive the water (i.e. Torah) which keeps them alive. During all this time when Yitzchak had lived in solitude his whole thinking had concentrated on the concept and eventual realisation of what the Jewish people are supposed to stand for in G’d’s scheme of things. We may view the words עם באר לחי רואי as support for our interpretation as otherwise the Torah should have written ב-באר לחי רואי, “at the well of Lachay Ro-i.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND ISAAC ‘BA MIBO’ (HAD JUST COME) FROM THE WELL LAHAI-ROI. Scripture states that Isaac had just now come from the well Lahai-roi, having returned from the well of Lahai-roi to which he had previously come. Had the verse stated, “Ba (he came) from the well of Lahai,” it would have appeared as if he lived there. Therefore, it was necessary to explain ba mibo as meaning that he returned to his city from the temporary visit that he had made to the well of Lahai-roi, for he abode in the south country and he was returning to his city. It is possible that since the word mibo is an infinitive, it indicates that Isaac constantly went to that place since it was a place of prayer for him because of the revelation of the angel there, (See above, 16:14.)  and he abode in the south country near there. And so did Onkelos translate it, “He came from his coming,” [thus indicating that he was in the habit of so doing]. In Onkelos’ opinion this was Beer-sheba for he translated both between Kadesh and Shur (Above, 20:1.)  and between Kadesh and Bered (Ibid., 16:14.)  as “Rekem and Chagra.” (Thus it is obvious that Shur and Bered are synonymous. Now Shur is in Gerar (above, 20:1), and Beer-sheba is in the land of the Philistines near Gerar (see Ramban, above, 21:32). The well of Lahai-roi, which is between Kadesh and Bered (above, 16:14), is thus near Beer-sheba.)  If so, that place — the place of the tamarisk-tree of Abraham (Above, 21:33.)  — was suitable for prayer. Now Isaac came from that well while he was on his way to another city which was on the same road as his city, and he went out towards eventide to converse in the field with his companions and friends who were there. He met the servant and Rebekah, whereupon they all walked together to the city, and Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent. (Verse 67 here.) </p>

              <p>בא מבא kommt in ganz תנ&quot;ך nicht wieder vor, &quot;kommt vom Kommen!&quot; בא heißt eigentlich: Hinkommen, dahin, wo man hingehört, wo man sich heimisch und hingezogen fühlt. Er muss also irgendwo hingegangen gewesen sein, wo er sich heimisch, wohin er sich gezogen fühlte: מבא; und nun muss er wieder anderwärts hingegangen sein, wohin er nunmehr sich gezogen, wo er nunmehr sich heimisch fühlte. Und wohin war er gegangen? Nach באר לחי ראי! Wir kennen ja den Brunnen, den eine Standesgenossin Eliesers, durch Freiheitsdrang aus Abrahams Haus getrieben, also genannt, und dort erkannt hatte, daß auch dann und da, wann und wo alles auf Erden für uns erstorben ist, &quot;ein Lebendiger uns schaut&quot;! Und über dem älteren Bruder Jizchaks war da einer Dienerin des Hauses Abrahams Gottes Vorsehung und Waltung sichtbar geworden. Liegt es nicht unendlich nahe, uns zu sagen: während so Elieser, der Diener aus dem Hause Abrahams, ausgezogen war, um in Hoffnung auf Gottes wachende und waltende und fügende Vorsehung einen Schritt einzuleiten, der, wie kein anderer, für die ganze Zukunft Isaaks verhängnisvoll entscheidend sein sollte, also — wenngleich in freudiger Weise, doch in ganz paralleler Lage mit Hagar und Ismael — hatte derjenige, den alles dies am nächsten anging, hatte Isaak sich zu der Stätte hingezogen gefühlt, die ihn in der Zuversicht stärken sollte, daß Gott also für ihn, in seinem sich gestaltenden Geschicke, Elieser sichtbar nahe sein werde, wie er für den älteren Bruder Hagar sichtbar nahe gewesen. Darauf aber sehnte er sich wieder zurück nach derjenigen Stätte, wo ihm das Familienleben erblühen sollte. Der Brunnen lag ja am Rande der Wüste. והוא יושב בארץ הנגב. Es scheint, daß Jizchak bereits selbständig gewohnt und zwar בארץ הנגב. Während Abraham bereits seit mehreren Jahren mitten unter den anderen Völkern lebte, hatte er es für gut gehalten, Jizchak, der jetzt wieder am Anfange stand, in der Stille, wie zuerst er selbst, isoliert wohnen zu lassen.

    Nachmanides explains that Yitzchok only now returned from the place known as באר לחי רואי. If the Torah had not added the word מבוא but had written בא מבאר לחי רואי, we would have thought that this was where Yitzchok resided permanently. By adding the word מבוא it becomes clear that Yitzchok at this point was on the way home to the city where he resided permanently. His stay at באר לחי רואי had been strictly temporary.
    It is possible that he would go there for the purpose of offering up prayers seeing that it had been at that location that he had seen the angel (when he lay bound) but that he had a permanent residence far more to the south of Moriah He had reached another town situated on the route to his home town, and there he went out towards evening to have a chat with a friend who lived there. While on route, he encountered Eliezer and Rivkah. And they walked all together to his home town.

The servant took Rebecca and went” (Genesis 24:61).  “Rebecca and her maids rose, [and rode upon the camels]…” [Why did they ride on camels?] (Camels are difficult to ride.)  Rabbi Levi said: It is the nature of camels that they grow in the East. (So Rebecca and her maids were used to riding them.)  The Rabbis say: [Camels were used for a symbolic reason.] Just as a camel has one sign of purity (It chews its cud.)  and one sign of impurity, (It does not have split hooves.)  so Rebecca produced one righteous person and one wicked person.  “And followed the man” – as it is unbefitting for a man to walk behind a woman.  “Isaac came from going to Be’er Laḥai Ro’i and he was living in the land of the south” (Genesis 24:62).  “Isaac came from going [ba mibo]” – he was coming [ba] back from bringing something. (Mibo is interpreted to mean: From bringing.)  And where had he gone? To Be’er Laḥai Ro’i. He had gone to bring Hagar back [to Abraham], she being the one who had sat by the well [be’er], and who had said to the One who lives [laḥai] forever: ‘See [re’eh] my misery.’ (See Genesis 21:14–21:19.)  “Isaac went out to have some words in the field toward evening, and he lifted his eyes, and behold, he saw camels coming” (Genesis 24:63).  “Isaac went out to have some words [lasuaḥ] in the field toward evening” – siḥa is nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “The prayer of a poor man, when he feels overwhelmed and pours out his prayer [siḥo] before the Lord” (Psalms 102:1). Likewise it says: “Evening and morning and noon, I pray [asiḥa]…” (Psalms 55:18).</p>

              <p>What is written before this passage (Gen. 25:1)? (Gen. 24:62:) NOW ISAAC HAD COME BY WAY OF BEER-LAHAI-ROI. (See Tanh., Gen. 5:8; cf. Gen. R. 60:14; 61:4.)  And afterwards &lt; it is written &gt; (in Gen. 25:1): THEN ABRAHAM TOOK A WIFE AGAIN. (This translation of the verse, which is somewhat more literal than the usual English renderings, suggests how Rabbi could interpret it to mean that Abraham had remarried Hagar.)  It is simply that when Isaac took Rebekah, Isaac said: Let us go and bring a wife to my father. Hagar and Keturah are the same person &lt; according to &gt; the words of Rabbi, but our masters say he took another wife. What is the logic of Rabbi? Hagar and Keturah are the same person because it is written (in Gen. 24:62): NOW ISAAC HAD COME BY WAY OF BEER-LAHAI-ROI. &lt; Here is a reference to &gt; the same woman about whom it is written (in Gen. 16:14): THEREFORE THE WELL WAS CALLED BEER-LAHAI-ROI. (The context suggests that Beer-lahai-roi might have been where Hagar had settled.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>“He settled in the land of Midyan, and sat alongside the well.” He learned the way of the patriarchs. Three were paired with their mates at the well; Isaac, Jacob, and Moses. Regarding Isaac, it is written: “Isaac came from going to Be’er [laḥai ro’i]” (Genesis 24:62). (This is the well where God had once appeared to Hagar. This is the context in which Isaac met Rebecca, who was returning with Abraham’s servant, identified by the midrash as Eliezer. Isaac then married her; see Genesis 24:63-67. )  Moreover, Rebecca met Eliezer near the spring. Jacob, “he saw, and behold, there was a well in the field” (Genesis 29:2);  (It was there that Jacob first met Rachel; see Genesis 29:10-11. )  Moses, “and he sat alongside the well.”  “The priest of Midian had seven daughters; they came and they drew water and filled the troughs to give their father’s flock to drink” (Exodus 2:16).  “The priest of Midian had seven daughters.” But doesn’t the Holy One blessed be He hate idol worship, and yet He provided Moses haven with an idol worshipper? Rather, our Rabbis said: Yitro was a priest for idol worship and he saw that it lacked substance, and he scorned it, and he thought about repenting before Moses arrived. He called the residents of his city and said: ‘Until now, I have served you. Now I am old; choose another priest.’ He arose and removed the service vessels of idol worship and gave them all to them. They arose and ostracized him so that no one should have ties with him, no one should perform labor for him, and no one should herd his flocks. He asked the shepherds to herd his flocks for him, but they did not agree; therefore, he sent his daughters out.  “They came and they drew.” It teaches that they would arrive early due to fear of the shepherds.  “The shepherds came and drove them away; Moses rose and rescued them and gave their flocks to drink” (Genesis 2:17).  “The shepherds came and drove them away.” Is it possible that he was the priest of Midyan and the shepherds were driving away his daughters? Rather, it teaches you that they ostracized him and drove away his daughters like a divorced woman, like you say: “He drove out the man” (Genesis 3:24). (In this verse, God permanently banished man from the Garden of Eden. So too, the shepherds sought to permanently banish Yitro’s daughters. )   “Moses rose and rescued them.” This teaches that he sat in judgment regarding them. (This is derived from the fact that the verse says that he rose, indicating that beforehand he was sitting.)  He said: Typically, men draw the water and women give the flocks to drink, while here, women draw and men give the flocks to drink. It does not say “he saved them [vayatzilan],” but rather, “he rescued them [vayoshian].” Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: They came to engage with them in a matter of forbidden sexual relations; here it is stated: “Moses rose and rescued them ,” and there it is stated: “The betrothed young woman screamed, and there was no one to rescue her” (Deuteronomy 22:27). Just as there, it is referring to forbidden sexual relations, here too it is referring to forbidden sexual relations.  The Rabbis say: This teaches that they cast them into the water and Moses saved them. Vayoshian is nothing other than an expression of saving from water, as it is stated: “Rescue me God, as the water has reached my soul” (Psalms 69:2). “And gave their flocks to drink.” This teaches that Moses drew water for them and gave their flocks to drink, just as Jacob did for Rachel.  “They came to their father Reuel. He said: Why were you quick to come today?” (Exodus 2:18).  “They came to their father Reuel.” This is Yitro. Why is he named Reuel? It is because he became a companion to God. “He said: Why were you quick to come today?” From here you learn that on all days they would come last.  “They said: An Egyptian man saved us from the shepherds and also drew water for us and gave the flock to drink” (Exodus 2:19).  “They said: An Egyptian man saved us from the shepherds.” Was Moses an Egyptian? Rather, his garb was Egyptian, but he was a Hebrew. Alternatively, “an Egyptian man,” this is analogous to one who was bitten by a deadly snake and was running to put his legs in water. He placed them in the river and saw a certain child sinking in the water, and he extended his hand and saved him. The child said to him: ‘Were it not for you, I would have died.’ He said to him: ‘It is not I who saved you, but rather, the deadly snake that bit me and I fled from it; it saved you.’ Similarly, Yitro’s daughters said to Moses: ‘Well done that you saved us from the shepherds.’ Moses said to them: ‘That Egyptian whom I killed, he saved you.’ That is why they said to their father, “an Egyptian man saved us,” in other words: Who caused this one to come to us? It is the Egyptian man whom he killed.  “Drew water [dalo dala],” he drew one drawing of water and gave water to all the flocks to drink, and the water was blessed for his sake. That is what is written: “and gave the flock to drink.” Our flock is not written, but rather “the flock,” as he gave even the flocks of the shepherds to drink. What then is “for us”? It means that he drew us out, too, as the shepherds cast us into the water and he took us out.  “He said to his daughters: Where is he? Why did you leave the man? Call him so that he will eat bread” (Exodus 2:20).  “He said to his daughters: Where is he?” He said to them: ‘The fact that you say that he drew water and gave water to all the flocks is an indicator that he is one of the descendants of Jacob who stood at the well and the water was blessed for his sake.’  “Why did you leave the man? [Call him so that he will eat bread],” – perhaps he will marry one of you. The eating of bread mentioned here refers to nothing other than a wife, similar to: “Except for the bread that he eats” (Genesis 39:6). (Joseph stated this in reference to Potifar’s wife.)  Immediately, Tzipora ran after him like a bird [tzipor] and brought him. Why was she named Tzipora? It is because she purified the house like a bird. (The bird plays a central role in the purification process of a leprous house; see Leviticus 14:48-53 ) </p>

            <summary>Moses prayed based on the faith of the patriarchs, including Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov, to defeat Amalek. Yitzchak lived near Be'er Lahai Roi after Abraham's death, showing respect for Hagar. Isaac's presence was absent in key moments, suggesting a symbolic death. Moses' hands became heavy during battle, supported by Aaron and Chur, to ensure the people were not demoralized. The word &quot;אמונה&quot; describes something that remains steadfast, like a peg in a firm place, as seen in Isaiah 22:23. Moses called on the merits of the forefathers to strengthen his prayer against Amalek.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>וידי משה כבדים “and Moses’ hands became heavy;” it was tiresome for Moses to have to stand all day long, as we know from verse 9 where he announced that on the following day he would take up a position on the top of the hill, and it would be difficult for him to keep his hands lifted upwards all day long. Aaron and Chur provided a stone for Moses to sit on; and they supported his arms from either side so that he could keep holding his staff aloft. All of this was necessary in order that the people would not become demoralised. The expression: אמונה, describes anything that does not weaken or decrease in size when remaining in the same position for a long time, such as from morning to evening. An example of the meaning of אמונה what we described are found in Isaiah 22,23: ותקעתיו יתד במקום נאמן, “I will fix him as a peg in a firm place.” There are numerous other examples of this kind. Moses’ doing this enabled Joshua to weaken the Amalekites and their troops. Once the Torah writes of ידו, “his hand”, singular mode, and another time it writes ידיו, “his hands,” plural mode. At the beginning of the battle Moses raised only one of his hands, while lowering his second hand; eventually both of his hands had become too heavy for him to keep aloft without someone supporting them. In the Midrash quoted in Torah shleymah item 94, in the name of several well known commentators, none of whom have revealed the name of that Midrash, we find the following interpretation of the words in this paragraph: the word אמונה, is a reminder of Avraham who had been complimented by G-d on his emunah, “faith,” already in Genesis chapter 15. When Moses’ prayer on behalf of his people embattled against Amalek had not elicited a response from Hashem, he appealed to the forefather Avraham to join his plea. The words: עד בא, are a hint that he similarly turned to the Jewish people’s forefather Yitzchok, of whom we read that he had returned from prayer at the well where Hagar’s prayer had been answered. (Genesis 24,62). The words: עד בוא השמש, are a reminder of our forefather Yaakov who had prematurely spent a night at Luz where he had his first prophetic revelation in the dream with the ladder. (Genesis 28,11 כי בא השמש). Moses called on the combined merits of all three forefathers to reinforce his prayer. Our author quotes from Genesis 49,22 and Samuel I4,15, as well as from Joshua 20,9, that the word אמונה applied here to both of Moses’ hands, is a legitimate mode of the feminine mode corresponding to the masculine plural mode of the word אמונים.</p>

              <p>The text itself is significant: “Isaac had come from Be’er Lahai Roi.” What was this place? We have encountered it only once before. It is where the angel appeared to Hagar when, pregnant, she fled from Sarah who was treating her harshly (Gen. 16:14). An ingenious midrash says that when Isaac heard that Abraham had sent his servant to find a wife for him, he said to himself, “Can I live with a wife while my father lives alone? I will go and return Hagar to him.” (Midrash HaGadol to Gen. 24:62.)  A later text tells us that “after Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi” (Gen. 25:11). On this, the Midrash says that even after his father’s death, Isaac lived near Hagar and treated her with respect. (Midrash Aggada and Bereshit Rabbati ad loc.)  What does all this mean? We can only speculate. But if the silences mean something, they suggest that even an arrested sacrifice still has a victim. Isaac may not have died physically, but the text seems to make him disappear, literarily, through three scenes in which his presence was central. He should have been there to greet and be greeted by the two servants on his safe return from Mount Moriah. He should have been there to mourn his departed mother Sarah. He should have been there to at least discuss, with his father and his father’s servant, his future wife. Isaac did not die on the mountain, but it seems as if something in him did die, only to be revived when he married. The text tells us that Rebecca “became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>A Midrashic approach on the words ויהי ידיו אמונה: Moses based his prayer on the faith the patriarchs had always displayed in their relationship with G’d, a faith which G’d had acknowledged. He had lauded Avraham for his faith in Genesis 15,6). He had lauded Yitzchak for his faith in Genesis 24,62 (based on the words עד בא, because the Torah writes: ויצחק בא מבוא, whereas He had lauded Yaakov’s אמונה based on the word השמש, in Genesis 32,32 ויזרח לו השמש,”the sun shone for him.” Thus far the Midrash. I believe that the meaning of all this is that Amalek had relied on Esau his patriarch who had received his blessing from the spiritual power of Yitzchak his father. This power was the attribute גבורה, an attribute identical with the attribute of Justice. Amalek (his spiritual representative) hoped to be able to exploit this attribute to overcome Israel. This is why Moses had to outmaneuver the celestial representative of Amalek in order for the Israelites on earth to prevail in this armed conflict. He therefore mentioned all three patriarchs in his prayer. He was “the son” of Yaakov, representing the principle that החוט המשולש לא במהרה ינתק, “that a three-plied cord will not easily come apart.” Amalek, i.e. Esau did not have such a three-plied cord to call on.   Our sages (Mechilta Amalek section 1) also commented that the words עד בא השמש, “until sunset,” allude to a peculiarity in that battle. Normally, other kingdoms engage in battle only until midday. This evil Kingdom of Amalek engaged in fighting both in the early morning and in the evening. Tanchuma Beshalach 28 adds that on that day the sun stood still for the sake of Moses. This is why the Torah added the words: “until the sun set.” The Amalekites were able to calculate what hour of day it was by means of astronomical calculations. What did Moses do in order to confuse them? He arrested the orbits of both sun and moon and thereby interfered with their calculations. The Midrash bases itself on the words: והיה כאשר ירים משה ידו; we also have a verse in Chabakuk 3,10, רום ידיהו נשא, followed by the words שמש ירח עמד זבולה. In other words: the prophet mentions the raising of the hands with the arrest of the sun’s and the moon’s orbit. Thus far Tanchuma.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND ABRAHAM CAME. Rashi comments: “From Beer-sheba.” Now this does not mean to imply that Abraham remained in Beer-sheba — as is indicated in the verse, And Abraham abode at Beer-sheba, (Above, 22:19.)  for how then would Sarah have been in Hebron? Rather, the intent is to state that Abraham had gone to Beer-sheba for the day for some purpose, and while there he heard of the death of Sarah and came from there to Hebron to mourn and weep for her. However, the expression of our Rabbis is, (Bereshith Rabbah 58:5.)  “And Abraham came — from Mount Moriah.” This is in accord with the Midrash which the Rabbi [Rashi] previously cited (In his commentary to Verse 2.)  which states that hearing of the Binding [in which her son had been made ready for sacrifice and had indeed almost been sacrificed] her soul flew from her and she died. It would appear that the Divine command concerning the Binding was delivered to Abraham in Beer-sheba for there he dwelt and he returned thereto after the Binding, for so it is written at the outset: And Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba and called there on the name of the Eternal, the Everlasting G-d. (Above, 21:33.)  It further states, And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days. (Ibid., Verse 34.)  This refers to his dwelling in Beer-sheba, which is in the land of the Philistines, and it is there that he was commanded concerning the Binding. It is for this reason that he expended three days on the journey to Mount Moriah, (Ibid., 22:4.)  for the land of the Philistines is distant from Jerusalem. On the other hand, Hebron is in the mountains of Judah, as Scripture testifies, (Joshua 20:7; 21:11.)  and is therefore near to Jerusalem. Thus, when coming from the Binding, he returned to Beer-sheba, as it is said, So Abraham returned to his lads and they rose and went together to Beer-sheba. (Above, 22:19.)  This teaches us that he tarried there and dwelled in Beer-sheba for a period of years. Now if this was the case, Sarah did not die during that period immediately following the Binding for it would not be that Abraham lived in Beer-sheba while Sarah dwelt in Hebron. And so it also appears since Isaac was born in Beer-sheba for it is previously written, And Abraham journeyed from there towards the land of the south and abode between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar, (Ibid., 20:1.)  and Abimelech said to him, Behold, my land is before thee; abide where it is good in thine eyes. (Ibid., Verse 15.)  There in that land Abraham settled in the city of Beer-sheba, for so it is written, And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke unto Abraham, saying. (Ibid., 21:22.)  Though it is not written there that they came to him from Gerar, [as it is written in the case of Isaac], (Further, 26:26.)  from which you might infer that Abraham lived in Gerar, this is not the case. Scripture clearly states that it was in Beer-sheba that they made the covenant. (Above, 21:32.)  Similarly, you will see that when Hagar was sent away from the house of Abraham on the day that Isaac was weaned, (Ibid., Verse 8.)  she walked in the desert of Beer-sheba, (Ibid., Verse 14.)  for it was there that they lived. However, after many days, he [Abraham] journeyed from the land of the Philistines and came to Hebron, and there the righteous woman Sarah passed away. However, according to the Midrash [which states that Sarah died at the time of the Binding], we must say that Abraham and Sarah lived in Hebron at the time of the Binding, and there Abraham was commanded concerning it. The verse which states that On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, (Ibid., 22:4.)  poses this difficulty: Since Hebron is near Mount Moriah, which is in Jerusalem, why did he not arrive at the mountain until the third day? The answer is as follows: The mountain which G-d had desired for His abode (Psalms 68:17. A reference to the fact that in the future the Temple of Jerusalem was to be built on that mountain. See Ramban, above, 22:2.)  was not revealed to him until the third day. Thus for two days he wandered in the environs of Jerusalem, and it was not yet the Divine Will to indicate the mountain to him. After the Binding, Abraham did not return to his place in Hebron. Rather, he went first to Beer-sheba, the place of his tamarisk-tree, to give thanks for the miracle that befell him. It was there that he heard of the death of Sarah, and he came to Hebron. The two apparently divergent opinions — namely, that Abraham came from Mount Moriah and that he came from Beer-sheba — are thus one [since, as explained, on his way from Mount Moriah he went to the tamarisk-tree which was in Beer-sheba, there to give thanks for the miracle]. Accordingly, the verse which states, And Abraham abode at Beer-sheba, (Above, 22:19.)  is intended to indicate that upon his return from the Binding he went to Beer-sheba, and from there he went to bury Sarah. After the internment he immediately returned to Beer-sheba and settled there for years. Scripture, however, concludes the subject of Beer-sheba all at once, and following that it tells of the burial, [which explains the lack of chronology in the verse, And Abraham dwelt in Beer-sheba]. It was there in Beer-sheba that Isaac married Rebekah, as it says, For he dwelt in the land of the South, (Further, 24:62.)  the locus of Beer-sheba. It is thus the opinion of all the commentators that Abraham was in another place, and it was from there that he came to the burial. In my opinion, Sarah had a tent for herself and her attendants. And so it is written elsewhere into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid servants. (Ibid., 31:33.)  Sarah thus died in her tent, and Abraham came into her tent with a group of his friends to bewail her. [This is a simple explanation of the expression, and Abraham came.] It may be that the word vayavo (and he came) indicates that Abraham was bestirred to make this eulogy, and he began to make it, for all who bestir themselves to begin doing a certain task are spoken of in Hebrew as “coming to it.” This usage is quite common in the language of Sages, as we learn in Tractate Tamid: (Tamid, IV, 3.)  “He came to the neck and left with it two ribs on either side…. He came to the left flank…. He came to the rump.” And also (you have) their expression, (Bechoroth 20a.)  “I have not come to this principle.” In Scripture, likewise, you find, he came for his hire, (Exodus 22:14.)  meaning that he came for the purpose of this work and did it for his hire. However, it does not appear to me feasible that Abraham came from another city to Hebron. If that were the case, Scripture would have mentioned that place and would have expressly written: “and Abraham heard, and he came from such and such a place.”</p>

        <summary>Isaac found joy and intimacy with God while walking in the field, leading to answered prayers and the arrival of his soulmate. Praying at the Kotel and in open spaces enhances connection to God, as seen in the patriarchs' examples. The three daily prayers were established by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, each serving a specific purpose in connecting with God. Isaac's prayer in the field symbolizes the importance of prayer in seeking divine intervention, and his strength lies in his ability to be alone with God. The Temple Mount is a designated area for prayer, contrasting distractions in fields, and prayer is linked to sustenance and divine intervention, reflecting the power and importance of prayer.</summary>

              <p>‎Genesis 24,63. “Yitzchok took a walk to meditate in the open ‎field;” It is a rule that people who practice submissiveness, (in ‎the sense of humility) are liable to become depressed, due to the ‎constant awareness that they cannot act freely in accordance ‎with their desires, as they constantly defer to the wishes of ‎others. When a person reserves his submissiveness vis a vis ‎his Creator, by serving Him exclusively, he thereby attaches ‎himself to the source of Joy. It follows that instead of becoming ‎morose and depressed, he will walk through life in a spirit of ‎happiness and joy. Our verse alludes to this psychological ‎phenomenon, the word ‎לשוח‎, being an alternate for ‎שמחה‎, joy. ‎Yitzchok’s taking a stroll was intended to fill his heart with joy. In ‎the field he would be able to communicate with his Creator, i.e. ‎with Holiness. Becoming associated with Holiness would engender ‎feelings of joy within him.‎</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Another aspect of why the Torah tells us that Yitzchok chose ‎to stroll in the field, is provided by the additional detail of the ‎time of day when this occurred, i.e. shortly before sunset, i.e. ‎לפנות ערב‎. Our sages (Pessachim 119) give some examples of how ‎G’d’s viewing matters differs from the way His creatures, human ‎beings, view the same matters. Example: When one of G’d’s ‎creatures suffers a defeat, he reacts by being saddened and ‎becoming depressed. G’d, on the other hand, is overjoyed when ‎one of His creatures prevails in a discussion with Him. When G’d ‎had originally suggested that Moses become a substitute for the ‎Jewish people whom He intended to destroy after the episode ‎with the golden calf, and Moses pointed out to him that this ‎would not be a good idea, as the chances of a new Jewish people ‎with only one founding father, himself, being better than the ‎previous Jewish people who had three founding fathers were very ‎slim, G’d was overjoyed to accept Moses’ argument as superior to ‎His own. (Compare psalms 4,1 where David alludes to this) The ‎Midrash (Tanchuma Ki Tavo 1) takes this thought even further by ‎generalizing that ”G’d issues decrees and the righteous on earth ‎cancel these decrees.”‎ When G’d was guiding His universe before having created ‎man, He did so all by Himself. He did not need to take into ‎consideration how His creatures would view His actions, i.e. His ‎will reigned supreme. Once He had created free willed human ‎beings, He had to seriously consider how the righteous among ‎them would view His actions. Our sages allude to this when they ‎said: (Bereshit Rabbah 19,7 ‎עקר שכינה בתחתונים‎, (loosely translated) ‎‎“G’d’s presence is occupied primarily with His creatures in the ‎‎‘lower’ part of the universe,” [i.e. He has to justify Himself to the ‎righteous people on earth. Ed.] This principle of G’d’s involvement in man’s pursuits not ‎merely being restricted to viewing it from the celestial regions, is ‎documented in Exodus 19,20 ‎וירד ה' על הר סיני‎, “Hashem ‎descended on Mount Sinai., etc.” What was the reason that G’d ‎saw fit to leave the lofty spheres of heaven? He prepared to act in ‎accordance with what the ‎צדיקים‎, the righteous expected from ‎Him. Being able to set the minds of His righteous at rest is the ‎greatest satisfaction that G’d, their Creator, can experience. In our portion, this is alluded to when the Torah describes ‎Yitzchok as meditating in “the field,” or, [in the words of our ‎sages ] “Avraham viewed G’d as ‘a mountain;’ Yitzchok viewed ‎Him as a ‘field,’ whereas Yaakov viewed Him as a ‘house;’ this is ‎why he promised to build a “house for Him.” The tzaddikim ‎learned to become progressively more familiar with G’d. [The ‎anecdotes about our author that are appended to his ‎commentary on the Torah, reflect the fact that the author was no ‎exception to this rule. Ed.] Being able to feel close to G’d, i.e. on ‎the field, enabled Yitzchok, whose very name symbolized joy, ‎laughter, to become more intimate with his Creator. The word ‎שדה‎ is also known as ‎חקל‎, “(as in ‎חקלאות‎ the pursuit of ‎agriculture.) [The author describes the righteous as being ‎described as ‎שדה חקל‎, but I have not been able to find the source ‎for this. ‎‎‎</p>

              </summary>
              <p>[There follows a paragraph that I have not been able to follow ‎completely, so that I am not able to translate into English ‎without possibly misrepresenting the author’s meaning. ‎Ed.] An alternate approach to the verse: “Yitzchok went for ‎a stroll in the field close to evening, when he raised his eyes ‎and beheld camels approaching” The Talmud (B’rachot ‎‎26), when commenting on this line says that Avraham, (compare ‎Genesis 19,26) composed the daily morning prayer, the word ‎ויעמוד‎ “he stood,” meaning that he stood engaged in prayer, ‎whereas Yitzchok composed the daily afternoon prayer, ‎מנחה‎. ‎According to the Talmud, the word ‎שיחה‎ when used in the Torah ‎always refers to prayer, ‎תפלה‎. [It does not occur again in the ‎Torah, although it does occur in psalms 102,1.Ed.] Yaakov, the ‎third of the patriarchs, introduced the evening prayer, ‎מעריב‎. ‎This is based on Genesis 28,11 ‎ויפגע במקום וילן שם כי בא השמש‎, “he ‎met G’d there as the sun was about to set and spent the night ‎there.” [The word ‎המקום‎, meaning G’d, is not unusual. Ed.] We ‎need to examine why a prayer is called ‎מנחה‎, “gift.” The morning ‎prayer being called ‎שחרית‎, is easy to understand as the word ‎שחר‎ ‎means morning, when the sun begins to shine. Calling the ‎evening prayer ‎מעריב‎ is also easy to understand as it is offered in ‎the evening, ‎ערב‎. But naming the afternoon prayer ‎מנחה‎ appears ‎somewhat difficult. Tossaphot Yom Tov, already recognized ‎this anomaly and answers it by referring to the period when it is ‎recited as ‎מנוחת השמש‎, “when the sun rests.” I propose a different explanation. I believe the root of the ‎word ‎מנחה‎ is simply “gift,” not “rest.” This prayer is presented at ‎a time, when man does not think that he has to either thank the ‎Lord for having awoken well from his sleep, or after having ‎completed the day’s chores without problems and entrusting our ‎soul to G’d once more when we lie down, confident that He will ‎restore it to us in the morning. Neither of these considerations ‎motivates us to devote time to prayer in the middle of our daily ‎activities. If we take time out to pray during the day nonetheless, ‎G’d may consider this as a gift from us to Him.‎</p>

              </summary>
              <p>An alternate approach to the paragraph commencing with: ‎וירא והנה באר בשדה‎, “he looked, and here there was a well ‎in the field, etc.;” The Talmud Pessachim 88 draws ‎attention to Avraham, Yitzchok, and Yaakov each using a ‎different simile when trying to condense their concept of G’d. ‎Avraham saw G’d in terms of a ‎הר‎, “mountain,” i.e. something far ‎above our level towering above man. Yitzchok perceived him as ‎שדה‎, a field, covering huge expanses of earth, but sharing earth ‎with man. Yaakov perceived Him as ‎בית‎, i.e. an intimate term, ‎viewing G’d as if He were at home with human beings. A major ‎difference between Yaakov’s concept of G’d and that of his ‎forefathers, is that the former did not view G’d as being “at ‎home” permanently on earth, whereas Yaakov did perceive Him ‎as constantly accompanying man, much as a house is the symbol ‎of a permanent presence. [The scriptural verses this is based on ‎are: Genesis 22,14 ‎בהר ה' יראה‎, “on the Mountain of Hashem, ‎He may be seen.” Genesis 24,63 ‎ויצא יצחק לשוח בשדה‎, “Yitzchok ‎went out into the field to meditate.” In Genesis 28,19 the Torah ‎quotes Yaakov as naming the site ‎ביתאל‎, “house of the Lord”. ‎Yaakov felt that the time had come when G’d could have a ‎permanent home on earth. However, this had been a vision ‎brought about by his dream/prophetic insight. After awakening ‎he realized that down on earth, where greed, envy and jealousy ‎were still prevalent, to wit the huge rock making the water of the ‎well inaccessible accept when all the interested parties were ‎assembled simultaneously, that the time was not yet ripe for G’d ‎to feel at home in such an environment. By removing the rock, ‎Yaakov wanted to demonstrate to the shepherds that a better ‎future could be in store for mankind. I have reworded the ‎thought expressed by the author somewhat, and have omitted ‎the comparison to the portion of ‎קן צפור‎ in Deut. 22,6. ‎Ed.]‎</p>

And concerning this, since Avraham Avinu understood that the soul of Yitzchak had a great desire to serve God with active performance, he sent his servant to find him his soulmate. And here truly, “this has come from God” (Tehilim, 118:23), for the time had come for Yitzchak to marry a wife. Furthermore, Yitzchak’s heart woke to the understanding of (Yeshaya, 45:18), “God did not create a desolation for his creations,” yet since he feared the actual performance of something in this direction, he went out to meditate, to pour out his heart in the field and ask God to help him and to prepare his zivug (mate). “For some, their zivug comes to them,” (Moed Katan, 18b), and his prayer was answered immediately, “and he raised his eyes, and saw the camels coming,” for “before you cry out, I will answer you” (Yesahya, 65:24).</p>

              <p>לשוח בשדה, “to meditate in the field.” According to both Ibn Ezra and David Kimchi these words mean: “to stroll amongst the shrubs.” Yitzchak had gone for a stroll to enjoy nature. A Midrashic interpretation based on Bereshit Rabbah 60,14. The word לשוח means “to pray,” as it does in all instances where it occurs. Well known examples are Psalms 102,1 תפלה לעני כי-יעטוף ולפני ה’ ישפוך שיחו, “A prayer of the lowly man when he is faint and pours forth his plea before the Lord.” Our sages in Berachot 26 have derived their view that Yitzchak inaugurated the daily Minchah prayer from this verse. A kabbalistic approach: The words לשוח בשדהteach that when someone prays to the One and only G’d he employs a כנוי, “a pronoun” of G’d’s name. In other words, one is not to enunciate the four-lettered name of G’d י-ה-ו-ה. Having used a substitute name for G’d (out of reverence for the “real” name), one will “find” G’d. This is the mystical dimension of the words לשוח בשדה. We find something similar with Yaakov in Genesis 28,11 where the Torah describes such a prayer as occurring in the evening, ויפגע במקום, the word במקום being the substitution for the real name of G’d. We employ this substitute in the Haggadah of Pesach when we recite ברוך המקום, meaning “blessed be the Lord.” Whenever the verb פגע appears it occurs with the preposition ב such as in Jeremiah 7,16 ואל תפגע בי, or in Job 21,15 ומה נועיל כי נפגע בו. All the activities of G’d are ascribed to such substitute names, כנויים, when they are still in the theoretical stage, whereas they are ascribed to the “real” name of G’d when they have reached the operative stage. We find confirmation of this in Jeremiah 8,14 כי ה’ אלוקינו הדמנו וישקנו מי ראש כי חטאנו לה', “for the Lord our G’d has doomed us, He has made us drink a bitter draft, for we have sinned against G’d.” Significantly, the verse does not end with “for we have sinned against Him,” as we would have expected but the prophet says “against G’d.” This means that up until the moment G’d actually executed His judgment on us, a “substitute” attribute rather than His Essence was involved. It is worth reflecting on this.</p>

              <p>והנה גמלים באים, when he had gone out to pray, the camels were already headed in his direction. This is what Rivkah referred to when she asked about the man walking “toward us?” (verse 65) This is because when Yitzchok returned from Beer lachay Ro-i to his house he was walking from the north to the south. People coming from Charan (Aram Naharaym) headed for Avraham’s house would be traveling from the east to the west. This is why after having deviated from his route which would have taken him from north to south, and walking in an easterly direction instead, Yitzchok would be walking in the direction from which the camels were approaching, from the land known also as ארץ בני קדם the land belonging to the people of the East. He had reason to believe that Rivkah would come from that direction.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>A term for prayer, as in, “He pours out his prayer.” Question: For the verse ישפוך שיחו (Tehillim 102:1), the Gemara in Avodah Zarah 7b uses the verse over here לשוח בשדה as a source that שיח means prayer [as if our verse was the source]?! Tosafos answer (in Berachos 26b) that this is the way of the Gemara. For we see that the Gemara (Megillah 13a) proves Esther was righteous because it is written about her (Esther 2:7), “He brought up Hadassah,” and it is written (Zechariah 1:7), “And he was standing among the hadassim.” Just as in Zechariah 1:7 it refers to the righteous, so too in Esther 2:7. Yet, in Sanhedrin (93a) the Gemara brings the proof the other way around. But this does not seem right to me. Rather, the answer is: Both verses are needed [to prove that שיח means prayer.] With ישפוך שיחו alone, we would think that שיח means speech, not prayer, since that same verse already said תפלה לעני. But לשוח בשדה [must mean prayer, for] with whom was Yitzchok speaking? Perforce, he established [the afternoon] prayer. And with לשוח בשדה alone, we would think that לשוח means as it does in Demai 1:1: “בנות שוח (white figs).” I.e., Yitzchok went for a walk among the trees in the field. This is why Rashi brings a proof from ישפוך שיחו. (Maharshal)</p>

Ed.] 
    Alternately, what the sages disapproved of was prayer in the בקעה an open area frequented by travelers who would be a distraction to the person concentrating on his prayer. A שדה, an open field not frequented by people would not be a source of distraction, and offering one’s prayers there would be approved by the sages.

She thought that he must be important. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:63.)  Rabbi Isserl writes. Rebecca saw Isaac walking from a distance and Isaac appeared to be shy and fearful before the bride. He had seen Eliezer going with the bride. He was walking back and forth, and Rebecca remarked that one should be bashful before the bride. The custom is that the people run to the bride to see her. Therefore, Rebecca thought that this must be the groom and that is why she was bashful. (Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 24:64.) </p>

Avraham established the morning prayer, Yitzchak the afternoon prayer, and Yaakov the nighttime prayer, aligning with the benefits that prayer brings to serving God. Morning prayer is for rooting holy concepts in the heart, evening prayer is for elevating the soul to God with pure love and awe, and nighttime prayer facilitates sacred visions and intellectual fruits beyond the physical senses. Prayer is essential for connecting with God and preparing for prophetic visions, as seen in the examples of the patriarchs.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>“A tanna teaches like R. Yosi bar R. Chanina – Avraham established the morning prayer, as it says ‘Avraham rose early in the morning to the place where he had stood before G–d…’ (Bereshit 19:27) and there is no standing (amidah) other than prayer, as it says ‘ Pinchas stood up and prayed.’ (Tehillim 106:30) Yitzchak established the afternoon prayer, as it says ‘Yitzchak went out to converse (lasuach) in the field at evening time…’ (Bereshit 24:63) and there is no conversation (siach) other than prayer, as it says ‘A prayer of the afflicted, when he faints and pours out his complaint (sicho) before G–d.’ (Tehillim 102:1) Yaakov established the nighttime prayer, as it says ‘He encountered (va’yifgah) the place, and stayed the night there…’ (Bereshit 28:11) and there is no encounter other than prayer, as it says ‘Therefore pray you not for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, nor make intercession (tifgah) to me…’ (Yermiyahu 7:16)” [Berachot 26b] These three expressions – standing, conversing and encounter, are aligned with three principle benefits that prayer brings to the service of G–d. The first act of prayer is to root firmly in the heart all the holy concepts and lofty images, the foundations of awe and morality which one has acquired in their soul, so that they will not falter under the storm winds which devastate morality and Divine service through desires of the heart and the passions of the time. The primary time for this rooting is the morning. That before one turn to the business of life and the inevitable feelings of bodily desire, they prepare a strong and well-founded moral posture for themselves which will standup under the oppositional trials of the waves of the times; therefore, the prayer which is oriented toward this activity is known as amidah, standing. To this end our father Avraham, first of the faithful, who withstood ten wondrous trials, and against all the multitude that opposed the path which rises in the light of G–d, who stormed in order to scatter and push him aside, was most fit; he fought to find a well-founded and enduring place to stand. Prayer is called sichah (See gemara Avodah Zarah 7b where siach is the language associated with personal prayer)  (conversation), sharing a name with the plants and trees which are called sichim (See Bereshit 2:5 which in this light could be read as “before there was any conversation.” This fits the nature of the second story of creation, which in its opening verse (Bereshit 2:4) uses the form of the word creation הבראם (in their being created) in contrast to the form ברא (created) in the first verse of the Torah. In general one can explore these two story as the first representing a subject/object relationship between G–d and creation and the second a subject/subject relationship. Hence the appearance of conversation at the outset of the second story. See footnote 2.) , due to the blossoming of the soul with new powers, which branch out naturally through the excitation of the soul in the service of the heart. This is most fit to the time of the evening offering, (see Tehillim 141:2) when one is close to casting off their troubles. Then their soul can elevate her nature, and the natural holy emotions stored up in her, to join to the living G–d and overflow with His pure love and awe, increasing fertile fruit and sending out shoots and branches, taking the likeness of a mighty tree (It is this aspect of prayer which ties the disparate pieces of creation together into a whole, a conversation. Note that the in the first story of creation there are individual plants (see Bereshit 1:11-12) but there is no field. It will take the type of prayer conversation which emerges in the second story, the siach hasadeh (see Rashi on Bereshit 2:5), to bind the blades of grass, the pieces of creation, into a whole that could be named a field. See Orach Chaim 61:3 and the Rama’s statement about how the gematria of two names of G–d, that which represents essence and that which represents expression, combine to equal 91, which is also the gematria of ilan, tree. The Maharal Be’er HaGolah, be’er chamishi says – know, that this world is similar to a single tree (ilan) which stretches from the root to the end of the tree, and it has many branches, drawn one after the other. So too it is with the world which is drawn from the First Cause that is the root, which is what we mean when we call heresy ‘to deny the root principle.’Its parts descend one after another until the final descent of the pieces of existence.)  - one of the sichim. (One of the pieces of creation, or ‘in the conversation.’)  This natural blossoming from within the rightness of the soul is the root of the judgment which is passed upon the one who turns aside from the straight path of life. The attribute of judgment, in so far that it has a natural law, is exacting with one who changes its ways and strays from its path; and this is the attribute of Yitzchak, as it is written “Were it not that the G–d of my father, the G–d of Avraham and the Fear of Yitzchak, had been with me…” (Bereshit 31:42), as our Sages taught with thorough explanation. However, there is another great advantage to prayer, that she find her essential purpose in those of the highest level and value, the highest holy ones who draw near to G–d, who rise up in prayer and lift themselves to the level of prophecy, or near to it, as is written in Tur/Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 98; they encounter states well beyond the ways of nature, because they are lifted up far beyond the natural condition and cleave to the living G–d in purity of heart and soul. And the night is best suited for this, in its respite and solitude, as the chasid explained in The Duties of the Heart (R Bachya ibn Pakudah wrote Duties of the Heart in Arabic in 1040 under the title &quot;Al Hidayah ila Faraid al-Ḳulub&quot; (Guide to the Duties of the Heart), it was translated into Hebrew by Judah ibn Tibbon under the title &quot;Ḥobot ha-Lebabot. R’ Bachya was a court judge and philosopher in Saragossa Spain. This work is the first systematic presentation of Jewish ethics and drew heavily from contemporary Arab thinkers. It presents ethics and philosophical understandings as the duties of ‘the heart’ in opposition to those of ‘the limbs’ which are the outward observance of the Law)  (Gate of Love of G–d, ch. 6) on the advantage of nighttime prayer, which also facilitates visitation of sacred lofty visions and awesome intellectual fruits, that cannot be apprehended in the company of the physical senses. Things grasped from beyond the conceptual processes embedded in nature come not according to the natural gradual order of simple to profound, or through individual analytic pathways gathered together into a framework. Rather the great light of the sweetness of G–d is revealed suddenly, happy is the one who merits to it! Prayer is called encounter (pgiya), as when one happens upon something, as a result not only of the nature of the path which the traveler takes but also of the immanent nearness of the one encountered. And so it was for our father Yaakov, peace be upon him, for it is a certainty that his prayer prepared him for the lofty prophetic vision of the ladder and all its particulars (see Bereshit 28:10-17) , and that is why the name encounter is associated with his prayer, “and he encountered the place.” This is befitting the nighttime prayer.</p>

              <p>To return to our subject, to explain the two flowers on the right and left branches: The flower on the right branch is parallel to belief in Prayer, that one should pray to G-d and not employ any intermediary. This belief is clarified in the book of Bereishit [which is the right branch, as the first chumash]. We find that the patriarchs all prayed to G-d without any intermediary at all. The Sages already said (Berachot 26b), “The prayers were established by the patriarchs”, and we have found that Avraham prayed in the event with Sodom, and Yitzchak prayed for his wife Rivkah, and Yaakov prayed as they taught regarding Bereishit 28:11, “And he was pogeia in the place.” Note: According to the Talmud, Yitzchak’s prayer took place in the field before Rivkah arrived, in Bereishit 24:63. Rabbi Isserles seems to refer to Bereishit 25:21.]  This what Yaakov actually meant when he  said (Bereishit 30:1-2), “Am I in the place of G-d, who has withheld, etc.” He meant that one should not place any intermediary between himself and G-d.  Therefore Yaakov was angry at Rachel, for she wished to place him between her and G-d, when she said, “Grant me children.” He knew that Rachel was not irrational, thinking that Yaakov could grant children; rather, she meant that he should be an intermediary, and this was what enraged him. All of this is clear.</p>

Alternatively, &quot;from the house of bondage&quot; refers to Isaac, whom God saved from the sword of his father, as it is written: &quot;And he said, 'Do not stretch out your hand against the lad'&quot; (Genesis 22:12). Isaac went out into the world and grew up, as it is written: &quot;And Isaac went out to meditate&quot; (Genesis 24:63). Additionally, regarding &quot;from the house of the prisoners,&quot; this refers to Jacob, who left his father's house when he fled from Esau, as it says &quot;And Jacob went out&quot; (Genesis 28:10). And what is written about him? &quot;And the man broke out exceedingly&quot; (Genesis 30:43). However, even in his kingship he was born poor (Ecclesiastes 4:14), as when Esau came and took his goats and more (Genesis 32:15). Alternatively: &quot;Regarding Joseph, who came from the house of prisoners and became king, as it is said 'The king sent and released him, even the ruler of peoples, and set him free.' (Psalms 105:20). However, even in his kingship, he was born poor, as it says 'A poor man who became king.' (Ecclesiastes 4:14). He did not elevate himself to become king, but just as his heart was when he was imprisoned, as it says 'And Joseph was the ruler...and he was the provider' (Genesis 42:6). And do not think that I only know him as the ruler and provider, but rather to teach you that he was both in his youth and as a king. As Solomon says: &quot;If the spirit [of judgment] of the Ruler arises against you...&quot;(Ecclesiastes 10:4).&quot;</p>

There is nothing more beloved than the Mincha (afternoon) prayer, as we see with Daniel who prayed for twenty-one days and was not answered until his Mincha prayer, as he says, &quot;And while I was speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God; yea, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening offering&quot; (Daniel 9:20-21). Isaac also prayed only the Mincha prayer, as it says, &quot;And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide&quot; (Genesis 24:63). David also requested this, as it says, &quot;Let my prayer be set forth before You as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice&quot; (Psalm 141:2). Therefore, when Elijah saw that the Mincha prayer was so beloved, he prayed only this prayer, as it says, &quot;And it came to pass at the time of the evening offering&quot; (1 Kings 18:36).</p>

              <p>“Isaac said to his son: How is it that you were so quick to find it, my son? And he said: Because the Lord your God coordinated it before me” (Genesis 27:20).  “Isaac said to Jacob: Please approach, that I may feel you, my son, are you my son Esau or not?” (Genesis 27:21).  “Isaac said to his son: How is it that you were so quick to find it, my son?” – you were so quick to find the blessing, my son? Your father was blessed at seventy five years old, (God blessed Isaac after Abraham’s death. Abraham died at age one hundred and seventy-five. Isaac was born when Abraham was one hundred years old.)  and you are sixty-three years old. (See Bereshit Rabba 62:5.)   “And he said: Because the Lord your God coordinated it before me” – Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, one of them said: If for your offering, the Holy One blessed be He provided for you, as it is stated: “Abraham lifted his eyes and saw that behold, there was a ram” (Genesis 22:13); for your food, all the more so. The other said: If for your mate He provided for you, as it is stated: “Please arrange it for me today” (Genesis 24:12), and it is written: “Behold, he saw camels coming” (Genesis 24:63); for your food, all the more so.  “And he said: Because the Lord your God coordinated it before me” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is analogous to a raven that brought fire to its nest. When he said: “Because the Lord your God coordinated it before me,” Isaac said: ‘I know that Esau would not mention the name of the Holy One blessed be He; this one mentions. This is not Esau, but Jacob.’ When Isaac said to Jacob: “Please approach, that I may feel you, my son,” water spilled on his [Jacob's] thighs, (He urinated in fear.)  and his heart was as soft as wax. The Holy One blessed be He appointed two angels for him, one to his right and one to his left, and they were holding his elbow so he would not fall. That is what is written: “Do not waver [tishta], as I am your God” (Isaiah 41:10) – do not become wax [tishva].</p>

              <p>Rabbi Abbahu began: “House and wealth are the inheritance of fathers, but a capable wife is from the Lord” (Proverbs 19:14) – Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Abbahu: We find in the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings that a person’s match is only from the Holy One blessed be He. In the Torah, from where is it derived? “Laban and Betuel answered and said: The matter comes from the Lord” (Genesis 24:50). In the Prophets: “His father and his mother did not know that it was from the Lord” (Judges 14:4). In the Writings, that is what is written: “But a capable wife is from the Lord.” There are instances where one goes to his match and there are instances where one’s match comes to him.

              <p>Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon began: “God settles the individuals in a home” (Psalms 68:7) – a noblewoman asked Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta, she said to him: ‘In how many days did the Holy One blessed be He create His world?’' He said to her: ‘In six days, as it is written: “For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth”’ (Exodus 20:11). She said to him: ‘From that time until now, what has He been doing?’ He said to her: ‘He is sitting and matchmaking; the daughter of so-and-so to so-and-so, the wife (Referring to someone who has been widowed or divorced.)  of so-and-so to so-and-so, the property of so-and-so to so-and-so.' She said to him: ‘That is his vocation. I, too, can do so. I have several slaves and I have several maidservants and I can make matches between them in a single moment.’ He said to her: ‘If it appears simple in your eyes, before the Holy One blessed be He, it is as difficult as the parting of the Red Sea.’ Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta went on his way. What did she do? She took one thousand slaves and one thousand maidservants and stood them in several lines. She said: ‘So-and so-man shall marry so-and-so woman, and so-and-so woman shall marry so-and-so man.’ She made matches between them in one night. The next day, they came to her. This one, his head was wounded, this one, his eye was gouged, this one, his leg was broken. She asked them ‘What do you want?’ This one said: ‘I do not want that one.’ That one said: ‘I do not want this one.’ Immediately, she sent and brought Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta. She said to him: ‘There is no God like your God. Your Torah is True, [it is] fine and praiseworthy, You spoke well.’ He said to her: ‘Is that not what I said to you? If it appears simple in your eyes, before the Holy One blessed be He it is as difficult as the parting of the Red Sea.’ What does the Holy One blessed be He do for them? He matches them against their will, not to their liking, (They marry appropriate spouses even though they are not aware of that at the time of the wedding.)  as it is stated: “God settles the individuals in a home; He liberates prisoners in chains [bakosharot]” (Psalms 68:7). What is “bakosharot”? It is with weeping [bekhi] and with song [veshirot]. One who is willing, with song, and one who is unwilling, weeps.  Rabbi Berekhya said: In this language, Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta answered her: ‘The Holy One blessed be He sits and crafts ladders, and humbles this one and raise that one, lowers this one and elevates that one.’ As it says: “But it is God who is the Judge; He humbles this one and raises that one” (Psalms 75:8). There are instances where one goes to his match and there are instances where one’s match comes to him. Isaac, his match came to him, as it is stated: “Isaac went out walking in the field…[Behold, he saw camels coming]” (Genesis 24:63). Jacob went to his match, as it is written: “Jacob departed from Beersheba.”</p>

              <p>“He encountered the place and spent the night there because the sun had set; he took from the stones of the place, which he placed beneath his head, and lay down in that place” (Genesis 28:11).  “He encountered [vayifga] the place” – Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Ami: Why do they change the name of the Holy One blessed be He and call Him the Omnipresent [hamakom]? It is because He is the place [mekomo] of the world, and His world is not His place. From what is written: “Behold, there is a place [makom] with Me” (Exodus 33:21) – the Holy One blessed be He is the place of the world, and His world is not His place. (God is not contained in the world, he does not &quot;live&quot; there. He is the &quot;place&quot; of the world. The world exists because of Him.)   Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It is written: “An abode of the God of eternity” (Deuteronomy 33:27). We do not know whether the Holy One blessed be He is the abode of the world, or whether the world is His abode. From what is written: “You are an abode for us” (Psalms 90:1) – that is, the Holy One blessed be He is the abode of the world, but His world is not His abode.  Rabbi Abba bar Yudan said: This is analogous to a warrior who was riding on a horse, and his garments were flowing to both sides. The horse is secondary to the rider, but the rider is not secondary to the horse, as it is stated: “You will ride on Your horses” (Habakkuk 3:8).  Another matter, what is vayifga? He prayed. “In the place” – he prayed in the Temple. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: The early patriarchs instituted three prayers: Abraham instituted the morning prayer, as it is stated: “Abraham arose early in the morning to go to the place where he stood…” (Genesis 19:27), and standing is nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “Pinḥas stood and prayed” (Psalms 106:30). Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is stated: “Isaac went out walking [lasuaḥ] in the field” (Genesis 24:63), and siḥa is nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “I will pour out [eshpoḥ] my woe before Him” (Psalms 142:3). Jacob instituted the evening prayer, as it is stated: “He encountered [vayifga] the place,” and pegia is nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “You, do not raise a cry [or a prayer] on their behalf, and do not plead with [tifga] Me” (Jeremiah 7:16). Likewise it says: “If they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, please, let them plead [yifge’u] with the Lord of hosts” (Jeremiah 27:18). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: It is corresponding to the three times that the day changes. In the evening, a person must say: ‘May it be Your will, Lord my God, to take me out from darkness to light.’ In the morning, he must say: ‘I give thanks before You, Lord my God, that You have taken me from darkness to light.’ In the afternoon, a person must say: ‘May it be Your will, Lord my God, that just as you accorded me the privilege of seeing the sun in its rising, so You will accord me the privilege to see it in its setting.’  Another matter, “he encountered the place” – the Rabbis say: It is corresponding to the daily offerings. (The midrash is giving an alternative source for the three daily prayers.)  The morning prayer, corresponding to the daily morning offering; the afternoon prayer, corresponding to the daily afternoon offering; the evening prayer is not obligatory. Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Even the evening prayer is obligatory – corresponding to the limbs and fats that were consumed in the fire on the altar. (The limbs and fats were also consumed in the fire at night.) </p>

              <p>(Fol. 26b) We are taught (in a Memera)' that R. Jose the son of R. Chanina said: &quot;The daily services were ordained by the Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac and Jacob).&quot; R. Joshua b. Levi said: &quot;The daily services were ordained to correspond with the [two] perpetual-daily-offerings.&quot; We have a Baraitha coinciding with the opinion of R. Jose, the son of R. Chanina, and we have also a Baraitha coinciding with the opinion of R. Joshua b. Levi. As to the support of R. Jose we are taught, &quot;Abraham ordained the morning service, as it is said (Gen. 19, 27.) And Abraham rose up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord. Omad (stood) refers to nothing else but prayer; for it is said (Ps. 106, 30.) Then stood up (Vaya'amod) Phinehas and offered a prayer. Isaac ordained the afternoon service (Mincha), for it is said (Gen. 24, 63.) And Isaac went out 'Lasuach' in the field towards evening. By the word Lasuach is meant prayer, for it is said (Ps. 102, 1.) A prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed and poureth out before the Lord his complaint (Sicho). Jacob ordained the evening service (Ma'arib), for it is said (Gen. 28, 11.) Vayifg'a upon a certain place, and tarried there all night; by the word Vayifg'a, prayer is meant, for it is said (Jer. 7, 16.) But thou — pray not thou in behalf of this people, nor lift up entreaty or prayer in their behalf, nor make intercession to me (Tifga).&quot; We are taught, coinciding with the opinion of R. Joshua b. Levi: &quot;Why did [the Rabbis] say that the time for the morning service is until noon? Because the perpetual-daily-morning-offering had also its time limited to noon. R. Juda says: Until the fourth hour of the day.&quot; </p>

Let our master instruct us: How many Tefillot (The Tefillah, also called the Eighteen Benedictions or the ‘Amidah, forms the central intercession of the Jewish liturgy.)  is one obligated to pray in a day? (Tanh., Gen. 10:9.)  Thus have our masters taught: One does not pray more than the three Tefillot which the ancestors of the world instituted. (Ber. 26b (bar.); yBer. 4:1 (7a); cf. Ber. 4:1;)  Abraham instituted the morning Tefillah, as stated (in Gen. 19:27): NOW ABRAHAM WENT EARLY IN THE MORNING UNTO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD STOOD ('MD) BEFORE THE LORD. Isaac instituted the Tefillah of the minhah (the Tefillah in the afternoon), as stated (in Gen. 24:63): NOW ISAAC WENT OUT TO BOW DOWN (rt.: SWH) IN THE FIELD TOWARD EVENING. Jacob instituted the evening Tefillah, as stated (in Gen. 28:11): WHEN HE CAME (rt.: PG') (The parallel text in the traditional Tanhuma (Gen. 10:9) explains that ‘MD, SWH, and PG‘ all denote prayer and finds the evidence in Ps. 106:30, Ps. 102:1, and Jer. 7:16 respectively.)  TO A CERTAIN PLACE. (See Acts 10:9.)  Now it is also written about Daniel (in Dan. 6:11): AND THREE TIMES A DAY [HE KNELT ON HIS KNEES]. But &lt; the text &gt; did not explain at what hour. David came and explained (in Ps. 55:18 [17]): EVENING, MORNING, AND NOON &lt; I COMPLAIN AND MOAN; AND HE HEARS MY VOICE &gt;. Therefore, one is not authorized to pray more than three Tefillot in a day. (TBer. 3:8; Ber. 31a; see yBer. 4:1 (7a).)  But R. Johanan said: And would that one might go on praying all day long! (Cf. Deut. R. 2:1 and M. Sam. 2, which argue against reciting the three services at one time.)  Antoninus asked Our Holy Rabbi: Is it permitted to pray at every hour? He said to him: It is forbidden. He said to him: Why? He said to him: Lest you treat the Most High with frivolity. He did not accept &lt; this answer &gt; from him. What did he do? He went to him early in the morning. He said to him: Greetings, Lord. (Gk.: Kyrie chaire.)  An hour later he came in to him. He said to him: {'MNH RTWQ} [Imperator]! (The Latin word originally designated a general, but in imperial times imperator became the title of Roman emperors. Buber has taken this reading from the traditional Tanhuma because he can make no sense of his manuscript, which reads: ’MNH RTWQ.)  An hour later he &lt; again &gt; said to him: Shalom to you, O King. He said to him: Why are you being disrespectful to the monarchy? He said to him: Let your ears hear what you are putting forth from your mouth. If you, who are flesh and blood, say this in the case of someone who asks after you every hour, how much the more so in the case of one who is disrespectful to the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One. Thus one should not bother him all the time.</p>

R. Joshua the son of Levi stated: Abraham established the morning prayer, as it is said: And Abraham arose early in the morning (Gen. 22:3); Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is said: And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide (ibid. 24:63); and Jacob introduced the evening prayer, as it is said: And he lighted upon the place and tarried there all night because the sun was setting (ibid. 28:1).</p>

              <p>And God Almighty give you mercy before the man (Gen. 43:14). May it please our master to teach us the number of times a man must pray each day. Thus did our masters teach us: A man must not pray more than three times each day, as instituted by the patriarchs of the world. Abraham established the morning prayer, as it is said: And Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord (Gen. 19:27). The word stood refers only to prayer, as is said: Then stood up Phinehas, and prayed (Ps. 106:30). Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is said: And Isaac went out to meditate in the field (Gen. 24:63). The word meditation is used with reference to prayer, as it is said: A prayer of the afflicted when he fainteth, and poureth out his meditation for the Lord (Ps. 102:1). Jacob introduced the evening prayer, as it is said: And he lighted upon the place (Gen. 28:11). The word vayifgah (“lighted upon”) alludes to prayer, as is said: Therefore, pray not thou … neither make intercession (tifga) (Jer. 7:16). And it is written concerning Daniel: And he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed (Dan. 6:11). However, in this verse, the time of prayer is not specified. It was David who came and set the time for prayer, by saying; Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain and moan, and He hath heard my voice (Ps. 55:18). Therefore a man may not pray more than three times a day.</p>

Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to totter (Ps. 69:24). You find that the righteous are exalted through their eyes, as it is said: And Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place (Gen. 22:4); Abraham lifted his eyes and he saw, and behold, it was a ram (ibid., v. 13): and also: Abraham lifted his eyes, and looked, and lo, three men stood over against him (ibid. 18:2); Isaac lifted up his eyes, as is said: And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide; and he lifted up his eyes (ibid. 24:63); and with regard to Jacob it likewise says: Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau came (ibid. 33:1). Wicked men, however, are degraded through their eyes, as it is said: And Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of the Jordan (ibid. 13:10). This refers to Sodom, which had been previously selected by Abraham, but to which Lot went, and where he behaved as they did. That is why his name was Lot. For Lot means accursed (lut), and that is what happened to him. And Balak the son of Zippor saw (Num. 22:2), and he was also degraded through his eyes.

Why did Rabbi Yudan say in the name of Rabbi Levi, 'Because there is no square cubit in the universe without a destructive spirit, and each and every one is given a permission slip to operate?' Just as these donkeys of the millers have shields to protect them, why should they not harm people?&quot; And at the time when a person's hour arrives, the angel of death appears over the face of the one causing harm, and he looks at the person and his harm. Therefore, it is announced to the person that he should not harm him. Say, &quot;Deliver my soul in peace, draw me close to you, and let the harmful ones not approach me. Say this because many were with me.&quot; These are the kings who were under his control, as it is said, &quot;A thousand may fall at your side.&quot; Another explanation: What is &quot;draw me close to you&quot;? David said, &quot;I see Daniel standing among the lions' dens, and they do not harm him.&quot; He began to say, &quot;Deliver my soul in peace, so that the lions do not come near him.&quot; And who caused him to be saved? Because many were with him. Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah also prayed on their behalf, and therefore God heard them. Another explanation: This verse is said about Rachel, &quot;Draw me close to you.&quot; This is so that Esau's advice concerning Rachel should not come close to her. Why? Because that was the condition under which Jacob took Leah and Esau took Rachel. And who caused Jacob (meaning Rachel) to be saved from his hand? Because many were with him. Therefore, say, &quot;Deliver my soul in peace, for many were with me.&quot; These were the Sanhedrin who were with him....</p>

For about [the latter] - when a person transgresses, his guilt grows as with weighty sins, like the matter that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Yerushalmi Chagigah 1:7), &quot;The Holy One, blessed be He, forwent about [prohibited] sexual relations, but did not forego about the nullification of Torah (wasting time that should be spent in Torah study). Especially since these people's main thoughts and actions are matters of their body and the vanities of their time, they have done much evil. But to the secret of fear, their souls should not come; and their glory should not be associated with the study of their consciences in the images of their hearts and chambers, and their images for fixed times within which they do not give a portion to Torah [study] among their occupations. And the calculation of their souls has been lost from within their hearts, for they are a nation that loses its counsel. And how much are they on the lowest level! And our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Avot 5:21), &quot;At sixty, old age; at seventy, fullness of years; at eighty, the age of strength; at ninety, a bent body; at one hundred, as good as dead and gone completely out of the world.&quot; And their intention, may their memory be blessed, with these words was to warn about repentance - that when a man reaches the days of old age, he should think about his end, if he did not merit to do so in the days of his youth. And since his time is close to coming, he should leave the matters of his body and his desires and rectify his soul. And when he reaches the days of fullness of years, he should add to the removal of [involvement with] the world from his heart. And according to the reduction of years [left], he should reduce his occupation in the world. And he should constantly seclude himself to meditate about fear of God, to think about his soul, to refine his traits and to seek Torah and [its] commandments. And that which they said, &quot;at ninety, a bent (lasuach) body&quot; is from the [same usage as in] (Psalms 102:1), &quot;spill his prayer (sicho)&quot; [and] (Genesis 24:63), &quot;to pray (lasuach) in the field&quot; - as our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Berakhot 26b), &quot;Isaac established the afternoon prayers, as it is stated, &quot;to pray (lasuach) in the field.&quot; For after one reaches ninety years, it is fitting for him that all of his occupation should be with prayer and praises of God, and to speak about His wonders. And King Solomon, peace be upon him, spoke about the matter of the days of old age - that a person should not then be lazy about service to God, may He be blessed. And he said (Ecclesiastes 11:6), &quot;Sow your seed in the morning, and don’t hold back your hand in the evening, since you don’t know which is going to succeed, the one or the other, or if both are equally good.&quot; He compared the days of childhood and youth to the morning and the days of old age to evening. And seed is metaphoric for children and for students, as our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Yevamot 62b), &quot;If he married a woman in his youth, he should marry [another] one in his old age; if he established students in his youth, he should establish [other] students in his old age.&quot; For perhaps the children of old age will be more successful in Torah and in the commandments than the children of youth. And likewise the students that he establishes in his old age may be more successful than the first ones. Or they could both be equally good. Afterwards, he stated (Ecclesiastes 11:7), &quot;How sweet is the light, what a delight for the eyes to behold the sun!&quot; Its explanation is that he went back to speaking about the days of old age which he compared to the evening. And since an old man will not taste that which he eats and that which he drinks - like the words of Barzilai the Gileadite - he stated that the old man should enjoy the light of the sun and not be disgusted by it. As disgust  obstructs a person from his service to the Heavens. So he should enjoy the light, when he compares it to the days of darkness that are coming - as it mentions in the verse below this (Ecclesiastes 11:8), &quot;Even if a man lives many years, let him enjoy himself in all of them, remembering how many the days of darkness are going to be; the only future is nothingness!&quot; The explanation is that even if a person get very old, let him not be a burden to himself. Rather he should rejoice in all of his years, so that he not lose one of his years and not rest from the service of the Creator. And he should remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. And then he will not be  able to perform the service, like the matter that is stated (Psalms 6:6), &quot;in the pit, who can acclaim You?&quot; And the righteous ones overcome their old age, gird their power and renew their strength for the service of God. It is as our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 152), As Torah scholars grow older, wisdom is increased in them.&quot; And it is stated (Psalms 92:15), &quot;In old age they still produce fruit; they are full of sap and freshness.&quot; And he mentioned above (Psalms 92:13-14), &quot;The righteous bloom like a date-palm, etc. Planted in the house of the Lord, etc.&quot; For the righteous are planted in the house of the Lord from their youth, and grow in the house of study from their young adulthood - like a date-palm that blossoms and like a cedar that grows in the Lebanon. And as our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, likewise said, (Midrash Tehillim 92:14), &quot;'The righteous bloom like a date-palm' - these are the infants, in the way that it was stated (Psalms 144:12), 'For our sons are like saplings, well-tended in their youth.'&quot; And he stated after this about this thing, that they are not [completely] compared to trees. For trees will not give their strength when they age. But the righteous &quot;in old age, they still produce fruit.&quot; And King David, peace be upon him, also stated (Psalms 71:18), &quot;And even in hoary old age do not forsake me, God, until I proclaim Your strength to the next generation, Your mighty acts, to all who are to come.&quot;</p>

              <p>Immediately Moses had heard all this he understood that all the exiles the Jewish people would have to suffer in the course of their history can be traced back to the original sin committed by Adam. This has been explained in the opening passage of Midrash Eichah Rabbah on Hosea 6,7: והמה כאדם עברו ברית בגדו בי, &quot;They transgressed the covenant just like Adam, they betrayed Me.&quot; This is the reason why G–d Himself grieved over Adam and is quoted as saying איכה about his downfall (Genesis 3,9). Jeremiah simply paraphrased G–d when he commenced his famous elegy with the words איכה ישבה בדד. We can extend this allegory even further: Consider that immediately after the passage dealing with the בן סורר ומורה the Torah continues (21,22) that the body of a person found guilty of a capital offence who has been executed is to be hung on a tree. The verse is an allusion to Adam who had eaten from the tree of knowledge and thereupon experienced the death penalty. However, the Torah goes on in 22,1 that in the future the &quot;ox of your brother who has broken down&quot; will not remain outcast forever, that it is Israel's task to assist in the rehabilitation of Adam by keeping the Torah's commandments. </p>

            <summary>Rashi explains that Jacob's ladder reached from Beersheba to Bethel, with the middle of its slope opposite Jerusalem, showing a connection between the locations. Yitzchak, like his forefathers Abraham and Jacob, prayed in the field, emphasizing the importance of prayer in times of distress. The word &quot;siach&quot; in Genesis 2:5 is interpreted as prayer, highlighting the idea that all creatures, including plants, praise God through prayer. The behavior of the patriarchs in praying in the field is seen as a model for seeking divine intervention in difficult times. The Temple Mount is distinguished as a designated area for prayer, contrasting with fields where distractions may hinder concentration. The strength of the Jewish people is likened to a worm's ability to break mighty cedars, emphasizing the power of prayer in achieving victories. The connection between prayer and livelihood is highlighted, with prayer and sacrifices being rewarded with sustenance, reflecting the importance of acknowledging God's role in providing abundance. Rebecca's reaction to seeing Isaac praying in the field reflects a sense of awe and inadequacy, setting the tone for their relationship. The distinction between Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov in referring to the Temple Mount as a mount, field, and house respectively symbolizes the First, Second, and Third Temples, with the Third Temple representing a permanent dwelling place for God.</summary>

              <p>And the First Temple was in the merit of Avraham, the Second Temple was in the merit of Yitzchak and the Third Temple [will be] in the Merit of Yaakov. And this is the meaning of that which they said in Pesachim (88a), &quot;Not like Avraham, who called it, mount - as it is stated (Genesis 22:14), 'on the mount where the Lord is seen.' And not like Yitzchak who called it, field (Genesis 24:63). Rather like Yaakov, who called it, house - as it is stated (Genesis 28:19), 'this is none other than the house of God.'&quot; And this is the meaning of that which it said (Isaiah 2:3), &quot;Come, Let us go up to the mount of the Lord, to the house of the God of Yaakov.&quot; And it meant to say that Avraham called it, mount, which indicates destruction - as the First Temple was to be destroyed in the future. And likewise, Yitzchak called it, field, which [also] indicates destruction. But Yaakov called it, house, which indicates permanent dwelling - and that is the Third Temple. And behold that the first two Temples were in the merit of Avraham and Yitzchak. And we have already explained this thing in its place as well (Netzach Yisrael 55) - that this is why the First Temple was called, Ariel (the lion of God), for a lion is from the right side, and that was the trait of Avraham. And we discussed this at length in the other place. And hence the ten miracles in the Temple were also in the merit of Avraham, who was tested with ten tests. For the test indicates that Avraham was a spiritual man, and that he was separated by his worth; and he therefore withstood ten tests. So too were there ten miracles that were not natural in the First Temple.</p>

                <h4>Haamek Davar on Genesis 2:5:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>The apparent meaning of this verse relates to the field as the source of sustenance for the world. As it says in Kohelet (5:8) &quot;Even the King is subservient to the field,&quot; meaning even the king worries about the produce of the field. According to this explanation, we don't understand the message of the verse. But there is a deeper meaning to the word siach (bushes) based on the gemara Avoda Zara(7b), &quot;Siach means prayer as the Torah says (Bereshit 24:63) 'And Isaac went forth to pray (lasuach) in the field'&quot;. Tosafot adds that it means fixed prayer also known as avoda shebalev (service of the heart). From the very start of creation God established that earning one's livelihood in the normal way of the world is involved with entreating God for His Providence by prayer or by sacrifices where possible. Both of these are called avoda (service), more than other mitzvot (commandments) of the Torah. Based on the verse (Mishlei 12:11) &quot;He who tills (oved) his soil will be sated with bread&quot; we may explain that all of man's activities can be performed to earn a livelihood or for some other purpose, but tilling the soil is done only to earn one's livelihood. And such is the difference between the avoda of performing other mitzvot and the avoda of prayer or sacrifices. The reward for observing other mitzvot is given in olam haba (the world to come) and also in olam haze (this world) one may receive rewards of wealth or honor, measure-for-measure. The reward for prayer and sacrifices, however, is primarily livelihood, as seen in gemara Ketubot (10b) which interprets the word mizbeach  (altar) as being related to nourishment (see also H.D. Bamidbar xx:xx) and also in gemara Shabat (10a) which states that fixed prayer sustains life. (See also Harchev Davar Bereshit 48:22.) The blessings recited over each type food also promote the abundance of that type as seen in gemara Berachot (35b) which considers someone who eats without reciting the blessing to be stealing from God and from the people of Israel and to be as evil as Yeravam ben Navat .(Based on Mishlei 28:24 &quot; He who robs his father or his mother and says, &quot;This is not a sin,&quot; is the companion of a destroyer.&quot;) The explanation is that by not reciting the blessing one denies God the pleasure of providing an abundance of that food, in effect stealing from Him and from the people of Israel. And such a person is a companion of Yeravam who prevented the people from bringing sacrifices, thus denying them livelihood. (See Melachim I chapter 12.) </p>

              <p>וכל שיח השדה “and all the trees of the field, etc.” The Torah should really have written the words עצי השדה instead of שיח השדה, “shrubs of the field.” The reason the Torah chose the expression שיח is connected with Genesis 24,63 ויצא יצחק לשוח השדה, Yitzchak went out to the field to pray.” The expression שיח refers to prayer. The Torah hints by the use of this word that all the trees and plants pray to G-d, i.e. praise Him and acknowledge Him. Our sages have also based this on Psalms 65,14 יתרועעו אף ישירו, “they raise a shout and break out in song.” David had been speaking about pastureland in that Psalm. The “song” attributed to the plants is their praise of G-d. G-d had wanted that all is creatures including the plants praise Him.</p>

              <p>וישאו בני ישראל את עיניהם...ויצעקו בני ישראל אל ה', “the Children of Israel raised their eyes....and they cried out to Hashem.” The Torah tells us that they fell back on a tried remedy, i.e. prayer, which had helped their forefathers in times of distress. We know that Avraham prayed from Genesis 19,27 where the Torah describes him as rising early in the morning “to the place, etc.” The words “to the place” are a euphemism for someone directing his prayer to G’d. We find similarly that Yitzchak was praying in Genesis 24,43 where the Torah describes him as coming from a שיחה, i.e. a prayer-session. We find that the Torah describes Yaakov as having prayed at the place where he had the dream of the ladder (Genesis 8,11). The reason the Jewish people have been compared to a worm (Isaiah 41,14 “do not fear worm Yaakov, etc.”) is that just as a worm has no strength of its own other than that of its mouth with which it is able to defeat the mighty cedars, so the strength of the Jewish people is their mouth, i.e. the power of their prayers. Prayer is something soft which has the power to break something hard. The Gentiles have been compared to cedars as we know from Ezekiel 31,3: “here Assyria used to be a cedar in Lebanon,” etc., etc. In verse 12 the prophet describes how this magnificent tree was cut down.” Psalms 29,8 also describes the forests being stripped bare (by the worms). Israel’s victories are due to prayer and Torah. We base this on Deut. 4,29: “when you will seek out the Lord your G’d from there (your state of distress) you will find Him.” We have a similar message in Psalms 20,8: “they (call) on chariots, they (call) on horses, but we call on the name of the Lord our G’d.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>כי אם בית אלהים THIS IS NONE OTHER THAN THE HOUSE OF GOD —R. Eleazar said in the name of R. José the son of Zimra: “This ladder stood in Beersheba and [the middle of]) its slope reached opposite the Temple” (Genesis Rabbah 69:7). For Beersheba is situated in the South of Judah, Jerusalem in the North of it on the boundary between Judah and Benjamin and Bethel in the North of Benjamin’s territory, on the border between the land of Benjamin and that of the children of Joseph. It follows, therefore, that a ladder whose foot is in Beersheba and whose top is in Bethel has the middle of its slope reaching opposite Jerusalem. Now as regards what our Rabbis stated (Chullin 91b) that the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “This righteous man has came to the place where I dwell (i.e., the Temple at Jerusalem, whilst from here it is evident that he had come to Luz) and shall he depart without staying here over night?”, and with regard to what they also said, (Pesachim 88a) “Jacob gave the name Bethel to Jerusalem”, whereas this place which he called Bethel was Luz and not Jerusalem, whence did they learn to make this statement (which implies that Luz is identical with Jerusalem)? I say that Mount Moriah was forcibly removed from its locality and came hither (to Luz), and that this is what is meant by the “shrinking” of the ground that is mentioned in the Treatise (Chullin 91b) — that the site of the Temple came towards him (Jacob) as far as Bethel and this too is what is meant by ויפגע במקום, “he lighted upon the place” (i.e., he “met” the place, as two people meet who are moving towards each other; cf. Rashi on Genesis 5:11). Now, since Jacob’s route must have been from Beersheba to Jerusalem and thence to Luz and Haran and consequently when he reached Luz he had passed Jerusalem, if you should ask, “When Jacob passed the Temple why did He not make him stop there?” — If it never entered his mind to pray at the spot where his fathers had prayed should Heaven force him to stop there to do so? Really he had reached as far as Haran as we say in the Chapter גיד הנשה (Chullin 91b), and Scripture itself proves this since it states, “And he went to Haran”. When he arrived at Haran he said, “Is it possible that I have passed the place where my fathers prayed without myself praying there?” He decided to return and got as far as Bethel where the ground &quot;shrank” for him. This Bethel is not the Bethel that is near Ai (cf. Genesis 12:8) but that which is near Jerusalem, and because he said of it, “It shall be the House of God”, he called it Bethel. This, too, is Mount Moriah, where Abraham prayed, and it is also the field in which Isaac offered prayer as it is written, “[Isaac went out] to meditate (i. e., to pray; cf. Genesis 24:63) in the field”. Thus, too, do we read in the Treatise (Pesachim 88a) in a comment on the verse Micah 4:2: “[O come ye and let us go up] to the mountain of the Lord (i.e. the mountain upon which the Temple is built) and to the house of the God of Jacob”. What particular reason is there for mentioning Jacob? But the text calls the Temple not as Abraham did who called it a mount, and not as Isaac did, who called it a field, but as Jacob did who called it Beth[el]—the House of God. (To here from “This Bethel” is to be found in a certain correct Rashi-text)</p>

              <p>I CONSIDER IMPUDENT ONE WHO PRAYS IN A FIELD. See Artscroll note 41. And if you ask: but it is written that Yitzchok went out to pray in the field (Braishis 24). Certainly it would be logical that we could follow the behavior of our father Yitzchok, who actually initiated the Minchoh prayer at that time. We can answer: that there the verse is speaking about Mt. Moriah the eventual Temple Mount, as we say in P’sochim perek Ho’eeshoh (88a) in reference to the Temple Mount being referred to as a mountain, the Gemara says not like Yitzchok who called it a field etc., we see that our Sages knew by means of tradition that the field discussed in the verse is Mt. Moriah. The Temple Mount is an area designated for prayer and as such it is no contradiction to our Gemara which is speaking of praying in a field that is not designated for prayer. Tosfos suggests a second approach to reconcile the two Gemaros. Alternatively, we can answer that the valley of fields mentioned here is speaking about a valley where it is common for people to pass by and is used by road travelers. Because people travel there, it is difficult to concentrate while praying. It is arrogant for one to pray there, because he seems to be saying that I am capable of praying properly even in a place where there are distractions. On the Temple Mount there were no distractions when Yitzchok prayed there. We cannot learn from Yitzchok’s behavior that it is permitted to pray in an area where there are likely to be distractions.</p>

And siḥa means nothing other than prayer, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to meditate [lasuaḥ] in the field” (Genesis 24:63).</p>

        <summary>Rebekah recognized Isaac, descended from the camel with respect and modesty, adjusting her posture to face him appropriately. She covered her face with a veil, reflecting proper behavior as a betrothed woman. Rebecca was impressed by Isaac's greatness and covered herself upon seeing him, recognizing his attractiveness and the presence of his angel. The Rabbis suggest that the Torah often provides general statements rather than detailed ones, emphasizing the praise for God in the story. In II Kings 5:21:1 and Psalms 37:24:1, Rashi interprets similar expressions as &quot;leaning over&quot; and &quot;faltering,&quot; respectively. In Targum, Rivkah saw Yitzchok and bowed down on the camel.</summary>

            <summary>Rebekah saw Isaac walking towards her, recognized him, and voluntarily descended from the camel out of respect and modesty, not falling but inclining herself towards the ground. This action demonstrated her chastity and deference to Isaac, as she prepared to meet him. Ibn Ezra disagrees with Rashi's interpretation of her falling, suggesting that she simply adjusted her posture to face Isaac appropriately. Rebekah's actions upon seeing Isaac reflect her proper behavior as a betrothed woman, covering her face with a veil until properly married.</summary>

She fell from fear. Another exegesis of this line: the sequence here has been distorted. After seeing a figure approaching, she asked about the identity of that person. When told by Eliezer that “this is my master,” (actually his master’s son) she hastily descended from the camel and covered her face with a veil, as a sign of her chastity. Her descent from the camel was totally voluntary, just as when someone prostrates himself in prayer, it is described as ויפול על פניו, meaning: “he deliberately bowed his face to the ground.”</p>

              <p>[SHE ALIGHTED FROM THE CAMEL.] Of her own free will. (The Hebrew reads va-tippol (she fell). Krinsky explains that I.E. translates she fell as she willingly fell from the camel. Weiser explains that she came off the camel in order to bow; that is, she alighted.)  Compare, he fell upon his face (Num. 16:4). What is reported in the following verse took place before, for the meaning of va-tomer el ha-eved is: And she had said unto the servant. (The sequence of events was as follows: And Rebekah lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac (v. 64) and she said unto the servant, “What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “It is my master.” And she took her veil and covered herself (v. 65). And she alighted from the camel (v. 64) (Cherez).) </p>

              <p>ותפול מעל הגמל, “she fell off the camel.” Rivkah did not “fall”” off the camel she was riding on when she saw Yitzchak; rather, she inclined her head as one does prior to falling off an animal.” This interpretation is supported by the choice of the word מעל in our verse. Had she really fallen off, the Torah would have written: ותפול מהגמל. This is also why Onkelos translates these words as ואתרכנית, the same expression he used when he translated what Eliezer was going to say to Rivkah at the well, where the Torah wrote הטי נא כדך, “please incline your jug” (24,14). We have a similar example in Kings II 5,21 where Jeremiah wrote of Naaman ויראה נעמן רץ אחריו ויפול מעל המרכבה לקראתו, “when Naaman saw him (Gechazi) run after him, “he fell” from the chariot toward him, etc.” There too the meaning clearly is not that the general Naaman literally fell out of his chariot because he saw Gechazi running. The meaning is that he bent down, inquiring why Gechazi had run after him, etc.  Ibn Ezra interprets ותפול literally, adding that she fell down deliberately, i.e. on her face and prostrated herself. It is similar to Numbers 16,4 where it says of Moses ויפול על פניו, “he ‘fell’ on his face.” Moses did not fall against his will but he prostrated himself deliberately. When the Torah here continues with: ותאמר אל העבד, “she said to the servant,” we must understand this as what she said prior to prostrating herself.</p>

              <p>AND SHE SAW ISAAC. Rashi comments: “She saw his lordly appearance and felt abashed (“Abashed.” In our Rashi: “and she gazed at him in astonishment.”)  of him.” And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained that the latter verse, [namely, Verse 65, And she said unto the servant, What man is this], preceded Verse 64. Thus the expression, And she said unto the servant, means “And she had already said to the servant.” In Ibn Ezra’s opinion there are many such verses in the Torah. This is truly so, but here it is not correct, for in this case you would have to mix the verses and transpose their parts as follows: And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and she saw Isaac [Verse 64] — and she said unto the servant: What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said: It is my master [Verse 65] — and she alighted from the camel [Verse 64] — and she took her veil, and covered herself [Verse 65]. In my opinion [we need not mix the verses, but the sense thereof is as follows]: When Rebekah saw a man walking in the field towards her, hastening on the road and walking in the field towards them, she knew that he had come to see them and greet them or to bring them into his house for lodging, and so she did as was ethically proper for women, and she stood modestly.</p>

              <p>AND SHE ALIGHTED (‘VATIPOL’) FROM THE CAMEL. Rashi comments: “She let herself slide towards the ground, as the Targum renders it, ‘She inclined herself [towards the earth but did not actually reach the ground]. Similarly, Let down thy pitcher (Above, Verse 14.)  was translated by Onkelos to mean ‘incline.’ And He bowed down the heavens (Psalms 18:10.)  — the Targum translates: ‘and He bent.’ A similar case is the verse, Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, (Ibid., 37:24.)  which means though he bends himself towards the earth, yet he shall not touch the ground.” But Onkelos’ opinion is not that she let herself slide off the camel to the earth, for if so, she actually fell off the camel and did not just incline herself. Similarly, all expressions of “inclining” merely mean a bending towards one side. Onkelos’ opinion, however, is that on the camel upon which she was riding she bent herself towards one side in order to turn her face away from him. A similar case, in my opinion, is the verse: And when Naaman saw one running after him, ‘vayipol’ from upon the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? (II Kings 5:21.)  The word vayipol here only means that he bent himself in the chariot towards the runner who was on the ground to ask of him whether all is well. And so indeed it is said there, When the man turned back from his chariot to meet thee. (Ibid., Verse 26.)  It is possible that as far as Onkelos is concerned, the expression, from on the camel, is like “on the camel,” [the letter mem in the word mei’al (from on) being redundant]. A similar case is the verse, For great ‘mei’al’ the heavens is Thy mercy, (Psalms 108:5.)  [which means “for great on the heavens is Thy mercy,” and not “from on the heavens”]. A redundant letter mem like this is also found in these verses: There shall be no more ‘misham’ an infant of days, nor an old man, (Isaiah 65:20.)  [which means “there shall be no more there,” and not “from there”]; Ye waters that are ‘mei’al’ the heavens, (Psalms 148:4.)  [which means “ye waters that are on the heavens,” and not “from on the heavens”]. In line with the plain meaning [of Scripture, however, the letter mem in the word mei’al is not redundant, but instead] it is like the mem in the verse, And, behold, there came many people ‘miderech’ (from a way) round-about. (II Samuel 13:34.)  [And thus in the verse before us, mei’al hagamal would mean that she alighted “from on the camel.”] There are many similar verses.</p>

He thinks, that just as elsewhere, that word merely means that she adjusted her posture so as to be able to face Yitzchok in a manner she deemed appropriate. In his view the word השמיטה would mean falling or sliding all the way to the ground. Rivkah avoided facing Yitzchok directly and turned somewhat sideways. </p>

              <p>“Rebecca lifted her eyes, she saw Isaac, and she fell from upon the camel” (Genesis 24:64).  “Rebecca lifted her eyes, she saw Isaac” – Rav Huna said: She saw that his hand was outstretched in prayer. She said: ‘He is certainly a great man,’ and that is why she inquired about him. (See the next verse.)   “She fell [vatipol] from upon the camel” – she tilted herself downward, (It does not mean that she actually fell to the ground.)  just as it says: “When he stumbles [yipol], he will not fall” (Psalms 37:24). (The verse shows that yipol does not necessarily mean to fall.)  “She said to the servant: Who is that man who is walking in the field toward us? The servant said: He is my master. She took the veil, and covered herself” (Genesis 24:65).  “She said to the servant: [Who is that [halazeh] man]” – Rabbi Ḥiyya said: She saw that he was attractive and was overwhelmed before him, just as it says: “Behold, here comes that [halazeh] dreamer” (Genesis 37:19). (Halazeh is used in reference to Joseph, who was very attractive (see Genesis 39:6). The same was true of Isaac.)  The Rabbis said: [Halazeh means:] He and his accompanying angel; halazeh [as an abbreviation for] that different one [alon zeh]. (Rebecca saw that the individual accompanying Isaac was no ordinary man.)   “The servant said: He is my master. [She took the veil, and covered herself]” – there are two people who covered themselves with a veil, and they both bore twins: Rebecca and Tamar. Rebecca – “she took the veil”; Tamar – “she covered herself with a veil, and she wrapped herself” (Genesis 38:14).  “The servant related to Isaac all the matters that he had done” (Genesis 24:66).  “The servant related to Isaac [all the matters]” – Rabbi Eliezer said: The general statements of the Torah (Such as here, where the Torah makes the general statement that Eliezer related “all the matters,” but does not specify what they were.)  are more common than its detailed statements, as, if it had desired to write it [the details of what had transpired], it would have written two or three [more] columns. The Rabbis say: He revealed to him the matters that involved praise [for God], [such as] that the path was miraculously shortened for him.</p>

She asked Eliezer who the man was before dismounting from the camel, as she had observed him approaching them from the field. Eliezer confirmed that it was Isaac, prompting her to veil herself formally. The use of the additional letter &quot;lamed&quot; in the word &quot;hazeh&quot; indicates that the person referred to was still at a distance, as seen in other instances in the Torah.

She had not enquired about every person that they met on the journey, but in the case of Yitzchok, the fact that he approached sideways had made her wonder if, by chance, this was Yitzchok or someone from his household. This is why she added the words: ההולך בשדה לקראתנו, she had observed that this man was busy in the field and only after he had seen them did he come walking in their direction.

Furthermore, why did the Torah have to write the words בשדה לקראתנו, “in the field toward us?” It appears that the verse is somewhat abbreviated. What Rivkah wanted to know was why the man approaching them had detoured from the regular path and was coming across the field in their direction. </p>

This means, Isaac is my master. In the Torah portion until now, Eliezer said that Isaac was the son of his master, Abraham, but he did not call Isaac his master. The explanation is that because Isaac did not have a wife, he did not call him master. As soon as Rebecca came to Isaac, he began to call him master. When one is without a wife, he is not a master.

              <p>Chapter 40: Torah [1] And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old (Genesis 27:1). Twenty generations passed until Abraham, in which old age is not mentioned except for him, as it says, &quot;Now Abraham was old&quot; (Genesis 24:1). And Isaac also stood [before God] and it came to pass, that when Isaac was old (Genesis 27:1). And Jacob also stood [before God], as it says, &quot;And the eyes of Israel were dim with age&quot; (Genesis 48:10). The verse (Psalms 102:17) says, &quot;He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.&quot; The only way [to achieve this level of prayer] is through old age, as it says, &quot;The beauty of young men is their strength, and the glory of old men is their gray hair&quot; (Proverbs 20:29). Abraham merited his son through five things, as our Rabbis taught: the father merits a son through five things: through his [the father's] name, through his [the father's] good deeds, through his [the father's] wealth, through his [the father's] strength, and through his [the father's] wisdom. Similarly, Isaac [merited his son through five things], and similarly Jacob [merited his son through five things]. Similarly, Jacob merited Joseph [through these five things], who resembled him in appearance and in title, as it says, &quot;And Joseph was handsome in form and appearance&quot; (Genesis 39:6). [He resembled him] in wisdom, as it says, &quot;Behold, he is the master of dreams&quot; (Genesis 37:19). He had beauty, appearance, and wisdom. And in Isaac's case, it is written, &quot;Who is this man?&quot; (Genesis 24:65). What is the meaning of &quot;this man&quot; in reference to Joseph? That he was handsome and had wisdom. Likewise, Isaac was also built with wisdom. And just as Joseph stood up to his brothers in strength, so did Isaac stand up in strength against all the men of Gerar. Just as Joseph was wealthy, so was Isaac wealthy, as it says, &quot;And the man became great and went forward and became very great&quot; (Genesis 26:13). The verse (Genesis 26:8) explains [the word] &quot;wisdom&quot; as meaning &quot;the greatness of his children.&quot; From where do we learn that Isaac was handsome like Joseph? It is written about Joseph, &quot;And Joseph was handsome in form and appearance,&quot; and when he went to his brothers, what did they say? &quot;Behold, the master of dreams is coming!&quot; (Genesis 37:19). And it is said about Isaac, &quot;Who is this man?&quot; (Genesis 24:65). What is the meaning of &quot;this man&quot; in reference to Joseph? That he was handsome and had wisdom. Likewise, Isaac was also built with strength, as it says, We know this from the fact that he dug many wells, as it says, &quot;Isaac dug again the wells of water&quot; (Genesis 26:18), and &quot;Isaac's servants dug in the valley&quot; (Genesis 26:19), and &quot;they dug another well&quot; (Genesis 26:21). He had strength in his hands. From where do we know that he was wealthy? It says, &quot;The man became great, and he grew richer and richer until he was very wealthy&quot; (Genesis 26:13). And from where do we know that he lived to a ripe old age of 180 years? It says, &quot;And Isaac lived one hundred and eighty years&quot; (Genesis 35:28). Abraham was the son of Terah, and Isaac was the son of Abraham. Why does the Torah mention this? Because God said to Isaac, &quot;You have merited these five things, so I will add another five years to your life, like your father Abraham.&quot; That is why it says, &quot;Look upon your servants&quot; (Psalms 119:16). Anyone who has merit will receive these five things, and anyone who does not have merit will receive five calamities in return. And who was this? Joab, as it is said: &quot;Let Joab and his descendants be perpetually guilty of their bloodshed. May they be afflicted with leprosy, jaundice, and starvation.&quot; (2 Samuel 3:29) Leprosy corresponds to strength; one who has leprosy has no strength. Jaundice corresponds to beauty; even if someone is young and jaundiced, there is no beauty in them. Starvation corresponds to wealth, as it says, &quot;Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed. Leave your simple ways and you will live&quot; (Proverbs 9:5-6). One who is starving has no leisure to engage in Torah study. Falling by the sword corresponds to the five aspects of praise. These are five calamities corresponding to five aspects of praise. One who does not merit praise inherits these five kinds of calamities, like Joab. But one who does merit praise receives them like Isaac, as it is said, &quot;And it came to pass, when Isaac was old&quot; (Genesis 27:1), and David cries out, &quot;May your children be like your ancestors&quot; (Psalms 45:17). Therefore, it says, &quot;And it came to pass, when Isaac was old.&quot;</p>

              <p>“She removed the garments of her widowhood from upon her; she covered herself with a veil, and she wrapped herself, and she sat at Petaḥ Einayim, which is on the road to Timna, for she saw that Shela had matured, and she had not been given to him as a wife” (Genesis 38:14).  “She removed the garments of her widowhood from upon her; she covered herself with a veil” – there were two who covered themselves with a veil, Tamar and Rebecca, and both of them bore twins. Rebecca – “she took the veil and covered herself” (Genesis 24:65); Tamar – “she covered herself with a veil, and she wrapped herself.”  “She sat at Petaḥ Einayim” – Rabbi Ami said: We reviewed the entire Bible, and we did not find a place whose name is Petaḥ Einayim. What is petaḥ einayim? It teaches that she directed her glance to the entrance [petaḥ] to which all eyes [einayim] are directed. (This is a reference to the gates of prayer.)  She said: May it be Your will, Lord my God, that I will not emerge from this house empty-handed. Alternatively, “at Petaḥ Einayim” – it teaches that she opened his eyes [shepateḥa lo et haayin] (She removed his hesitations. )  by saying to him: ‘I am ritually pure, and I am unmarried.’</p>

                <h4>Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Toldot 7:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Thus has R. Tanhuma interpreted (Gen. 27:1): NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD &lt; AND HIS EYES WERE TOO WEAK TO SEE &gt;. You find that there are twenty generations from Adam to Abraham, and there is no &lt; mention of &gt; old age written about &lt; any of &gt; them except Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD. (For parallel accounts, see above, 5:4.)  Isaac arose, &lt; and &gt; it is also written (in Gen. 27:1): NOW IT CAME TO PASS, THAT WHEN ISAAC WAS OLD. Jacob arose, &lt; and &gt; it is also written (in Gen. 48:10): NOW ISRAEL'S EYES WERE DIM WITH AGE. This text is related (to Ps. 90:16): LET YOUR WORK BE WORTHY FOR YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR GLORY ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN. Now GLORY can only be old age and gray hair, as stated (in Prov. 20:29): THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNG IS THEIR STRENGTH; BUT THE GLORY OF THE OLD IS GRAY HAIR. Ergo (in Ps. 90:16): AND YOUR GLORY ON BEHALF OF THEIR CHILDREN. &lt; These words mean &gt; that Abraham endowed Isaac with five things. Thus have our masters taught (in 'Eduy. 2:9): A FATHER ENDOWS HIS SON WITH FIVE THINGS: WITH BEAUTY, WITH STRENGTH, WITH WEALTH, WITH WISDOM, AND WITH &lt; LENGTH OF &gt; YEARS. How is it shown about BEAUTY? In that Isaac was as handsome as Joseph. It is written of Joseph (in Gen. 39:6): NOW JOSEPH WAS WELL BUILT. Also, when he went to his brothers, they said (in Gen. 37:19): HERE COMES THIS (hallazeh) DREAMER. It is also said of Isaac (in Gen. 24:65): WHO IS THIS (hallazeh) MAN &lt; WALKING IN THE FIELD TO MEET US &gt;? Thus Isaac was as handsome as Joseph. How is it shown that Isaac was mighty in STRENGTH? Look at how many wells he dug! Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:18-22): THEN ISAAC REDUG &lt; THE WELLS OF WATER &gt;…. AND ISAAC'S SERVANTS DUG…. AND THEY DUG ANOTHER WELL…. THEN HE MOVED FROM THERE AND DUG &lt; ANOTHER WELL &gt;…. Look at the power which he had! Where is it shown about WEALTH? Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:13): AND THE MAN GREW &lt; RICHER AND RICHER &gt;…. It also says (in vs. 14): AND HE POSSESSED FLOCKS &lt; AND HERDS &gt;…. Where is it shown about WISDOM? Where he said to his father (in Gen. 22:7 at the time of his being bound): HERE ARE THE FIRE AND THE WOOD…. [How is it shown] about &lt; LENGTH OF &gt; YEARS? In that he was one hundred and eighty years old &lt; when he died &gt;, while Abraham was &lt; only &gt; one hundred and seventy-five. On account of these five things {through which he had attained merit}, five years more than his father's were added to him. It is therefore stated (in Ps. 90:16): LET YOUR WORK BE WORTHY FOR YOUR SERVANTS…. Anyone who has merit is meritorious in these five things, and anyone who does not have merit is not meritorious and receives five retributions that correspond to them. (See yQid. 1:7 (61a).)  And who is this anyone? This is Joab, of whom it is stated (in II Sam. 3:29): MAY IT (Abner's blood) FALL UPON THE HEAD OF JOB AND HIS SON; (Masoretic Text: ALL HIS FATHER’S HOUSE.)  [MAY THE HOUSE OF JOAB NEVER LACK ONE WITH A DISCHARGE, A LEPER, A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE, ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD, AND ONE LACKING BREAD]. ONE WITH A DISCHARGE corresponds to STRENGTH. In the case of one who has a discharge, there is no one weaker than he. A LEPER corresponds to BEAUTY. In the case of one who is a leper, even a young &lt; leper &gt;, there is no one more ugly than he. A MALE WHO HANDLES THE SPINDLE corresponds to WEALTH; for he [is one] {like a poor woman is one} who, if not spinning flax, has nothing of which to eat. ONE LACKING BREAD corresponds to WISDOM, as stated (in Prov. 9:5, where Wisdom says): COME AND EAT OF MY BREAD. And ONE WHO FALLS BY THE SWORD corresponds to &lt; LENGTH OF &gt; YEARS. The one who sins is afflicted by them, but the one who is meritorious receives, as did Isaac. David also gave praise (in Ps. 45:17 [16]): INSTEAD OF YOUR PARENTS THERE WILL BE YOUR CHILDREN.</p>

Then she bore twins, Esau and Jacob, as stated (in Gen. 25:24): BEHOLD, THERE WERE TWINS IN HER WOMB.

              <p>Until when does the merit of the patriarchs endure? Rabbi Tanḥuma said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Menaḥama, and some say Rabbi Berekhya bar Ḥelbo [said it] in the name of Rava bar Zavda: Until Yehoaḥaz. That is what is written: “But the Lord showed them favor and had mercy on them…until now” (II Kings 13:23) – until now the merit of the patriarchs endured. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Until Elijah. That is what is written: “It was at the time of offering up the afternoon offering that Elijah the prophet approached, [and he said: Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today it will be known that You are God in Israel]” (I Kings 18:36).  Shmuel said: Until Hosea. That is what is written: “Now I will reveal her repulsiveness in the eyes of her paramours, and no man will deliver her from My hand” (Hosea 2:12). The man stated here is no one other than Abraham, just as it says: “Now, restore the man’s wife” (Genesis 20:7). And “man” is non other than Isaac, as it is stated: “Who is that man?” (Genesis 24:65). And “man” is none other than Jacob, as it is stated: “Jacob was a complete man” (Genesis 25:27).  Rabbi Yudan said: Until Hezekiah, just as it said: “For abundant authority and for unending peace…[from now, forever; the zealotry of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this]” (Isaiah 9:6). (From that point forward, the zealotry of the Lord would prevail, because the merit of the patriarchs had run out.)   Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Berekhya: If you see that the merit of the patriarchs has failed and the merit of the matriarchs has faltered, go and cleave to acts of kindness. That is what is written: “For the mountains will move, and the hills will collapse” (Isaiah 54:10); the mountains are the patriarchs and the hills are the matriarchs, and then: “My kindness will not be moved from you, [My covenant of peace shall not collapse]” (Isaiah 54:10). (The verse is understood to mean, if My attribute of kindness is not moved from you, in that you perform acts of kindness for others, My covenant of peace with you will not falter. )   Rabbi Aḥa said: The merit of the patriarchs endures forever. Forever, we mention and say: “For the Lord your God is a merciful God, He will neither forsake you, nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your patriarchs” (Deuteronomy 4:31).</p>

              <p>The Netziv (Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin, 1816–1893, dean of the yeshiva in Volozhin) made the sharp observation that Isaac and Rebecca seem not to have communicated closely.

Rebbi Aḥa believed it extends forever, sealed with the tribes, while Rebbi Yudan bar Ḥanan advised clinging to grace when the merit of the fathers and mothers falters.

              </summary>
              <p>(Lev. rabba 36(5).)  How far did the merit of the forefathers extend? Rebbi Tanḥuma said in the name of the Elder Rebbi Ḥiyya, (Bar) [Rebbi] Naḥman said it in the name of Rebbi Berekhiah, Rebbi Ḥelbo in the name of Rebbi Abba bar Zavda, up to Joaḥaz. The Eternal was compassionate about them and had mercy for them etc., up to now (2K. 13:23.) . Up to that moment, the merit of the forefathers existed. Samuel said, up to Hosea’s [time]. But now, I shall uncover her scandalous behavior before the eyes of her lovers, and no man may save her from My hand (Hos. 2:12.) . Man can only mean Abraham, as you say, but now return theman’s wife, for he is a prophet (Gen. 20:7.) . Man can only mean Isaac, as you say, who is this man coming in the field towards us (Gen. 24:65.) ? Man can only mean Jacob, as you say, but Jacob was a simple man (Gen. 25:27.) . Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said, up to Elijah: It was when the time of the afternoon service came that Elijah the prophet approached and said, O Eternal, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, today it shall be proclaimed that You are God in Israel and I am Your servant (1K. 18:36. Since Elijah’s prayer was granted, this gives a terminus post quem.)  etc. Rebbi Yudan said, up to Hezekias, to increase dominion and peace without end (Is. 9:6.) .  (Sifra Behuqqotai Pereq 7(11), Ex. rabba 44(3). The argument really is not about the patriarchs’ merits but about the validity of the Covenant.)  Rebbi Aḥa said, the merit of the forefathers extends forever: For the Eternal is a Merciful Power, etc., up to and He shall not forget your forefather’s covenant (Deut. 4:31.) . This teaches that the covenant was sealed with the tribes. Rebbi Yudan bar Ḥanan in the name of Rebbi Berekhiah: The Holy One, praise to Him, said to Israel: If you see that the merit of the fathers reels, and the merit of the mothers trembles, go and cling to grace. (Is. 54:10.) For mountains may reel, and hills tremble; for mountains may reel, this is the fathers’ merit, and hills tremble, this is the mothers’ merit. After that, but My Grace will not leave you and My Covenant of Peace will not reel, says the One Who has mercy on you, the Eternal.</p>

She said: ‘He is certainly a great man,’ and that is why she inquired about him. (See the next verse.)   “She fell [vatipol] from upon the camel” – she tilted herself downward, (It does not mean that she actually fell to the ground.)  just as it says: “When he stumbles [yipol], he will not fall” (Psalms 37:24). (The verse shows that yipol does not necessarily mean to fall.)  “She said to the servant: Who is that man who is walking in the field toward us? The servant said: He is my master. She took the veil, and covered herself” (Genesis 24:65).  “She said to the servant: [Who is that [halazeh] man]” – Rabbi Ḥiyya said: She saw that he was attractive and was overwhelmed before him, just as it says: “Behold, here comes that [halazeh] dreamer” (Genesis 37:19). (Halazeh is used in reference to Joseph, who was very attractive (see Genesis 39:6). The same was true of Isaac.)  The Rabbis said: [Halazeh means:] He and his accompanying angel; halazeh [as an abbreviation for] that different one [alon zeh]. (Rebecca saw that the individual accompanying Isaac was no ordinary man.)   “The servant said: He is my master. [She took the veil, and covered herself]” – there are two people who covered themselves with a veil, and they both bore twins: Rebecca and Tamar. Rebecca – “she took the veil”; Tamar – “she covered herself with a veil, and she wrapped herself” (Genesis 38:14).  “The servant related to Isaac all the matters that he had done” (Genesis 24:66).  “The servant related to Isaac [all the matters]” – Rabbi Eliezer said: The general statements of the Torah (Such as here, where the Torah makes the general statement that Eliezer related “all the matters,” but does not specify what they were.)  are more common than its detailed statements, as, if it had desired to write it [the details of what had transpired], it would have written two or three [more] columns. The Rabbis say: He revealed to him the matters that involved praise [for God], [such as] that the path was miraculously shortened for him.</p>

Rashi, on the other hand, provides linguistic analysis in Exodus 5, explaining the meaning of the phrase &quot;let them not regard vain words&quot; as &quot;let them not always be conversing about vain and idle matters.&quot; In Isaiah 41, Rashi translates the Hebrew phrase &quot;let us talk&quot; as &quot;let us tell your words.&quot;</summary>

                <h4>Ramban on Exodus 24:1:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>AND UNTO MOSES HE SAID: ‘COME UP UNTO THE ETERNAL etc.’ “This section was told to Moses before the giving of the Ten Commandments, on the fourth day of Sivan.” This is Rashi’s language. “And the Eternal said unto Moses: ‘Come up to Me into the mountain, and be there’ (Verse 12 (further in this section).)  — this was said to Moses after the Giving of the Torah.” These too are Rashi’s words. But if so, the sections of the Torah are not in chronological order, nor even in their ordinary sense! Moreover, it is written here, And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Eternal, and all the ordinances, (Verse 3.)  which are these ordinances written above, concerning which He said, And these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them. (Above, 21:1.)  For it is not correct to interpret the expression: and all the ordinances, (Verse 3.)  to mean [as Rashi wrote], the ordinances which “the sons of Noah” (See Vol. I, p. 417, Notes 147-8.)  were commanded, or the laws which were given to the Israelites in Marah (See above, 15:25.)  which they had already heard and knew, and besides, the word vayesapeir (and he told) (Verse 3.)  always indicates new things which one tells! But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has already grasped this subject correctly, in explaining the verses to be in their proper order, when he commented: (On the preceding Verse (23:33).)  “Up to here is the Book of the Covenant.” On the basis of this statement it can be seen that all the sections of the Torah are in methodical arrangement. For after the Giving of the Torah immediately on the same day G-d said to Moses, Thus shall you tell the children of Israel: Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven, (Above, 20:19.)  and He began to warn them again against idolatry, by saying, Ye shall not make with Me etc., (Ibid., Verse 20.)  and He continued to command him, Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them, (Above, 21:1.)  and all the commandments following that, and finally He finished with the admonition against the worship of idols which they find in the Land, and against making a covenant with their worshippers. He then said to Moses, “After you have commanded them this, come up unto the Eternal, thou and Aaron.” The section mentions that Moses did according to the command of G-d, and came to the camp and told the people all the words of the Eternal (Verse 3.)  as He had commanded him, Thus shall you tell the children of Israel: Ye yourselves have seen etc.; (Above, 20:19.)  and all the ordinances, (Verse 3.)  as He had commanded him, Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them. (Above, 21:1.)  The people received everything with joy and said, All that the Eternal hath spoken will we do, (Above 19:8. See though my Hebrew commentary, p. 447, where it is pointed out that since this verse relates to an event before the Revelation and Ramban is now discussing the events after the Revelation, we must perforce understand his use of that verse, in a stylistic manner, namely, that the people joyfully accepted upon themselves the duty of observing all of G-d’s commandments.)  meaning that all these things which G-d has told you we will do, for we believe in your words; just as he narrated in the Book of Deuteronomy [that the people said to him], and thou shalt speak unto us all that the Eternal our G-d may speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it, (Deuteronomy 5:24.)  and then Moses wrote them down. Thus on that day he wrote down in a book all that he had been commanded — the statutes, the ordinances, and the laws — and he rose up early in the morning (Verse 4.)  of the following day to make a covenant with them concerning all this. He built the altar and offered the sacrifices, (Verse 4.)  and put half of the blood upon the altar of G-d, and half of it he put in basins (Verse 6.)  [in order to sprinkle upon the people], (As explained further in Ramban, (also in Rashi). For the reason of exact division into two equal parts see further in the text of Ramban and also in Note 479.)  and he took the book which he had written the day before and read it in their hearing, (Verse 7.)  and they accepted upon themselves to make the covenant with Him, saying. All that the Eternal hath spoken will we do, and hearken (Verse 7.)  to you and to whatever you will command in His Name. Then he sprinkled upon them half of the blood [which he had put in the basins], for this is the sign of a covenant, when two things (By putting half of the blood upon the altar of G-d and the other half upon the people, Moses indicated that “the two [parties to the covenant] come into equal parts.” See Deuteronomy 26:17-18, and also Vayikra Rabbah 6:5, where the equal division of the blood is explained as signifying that G-d swore to Israel never to exchange it for another nation, and Israel swore eternal fidelity to G-d.)  come in equal parts. Now after he finished what he did with them, he had to fulfill the word of G-d which He told him, Come up… thou and Aaron, etc. and it is with reference to this that it is said, Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu etc. (Verse 9.)  He completed that which he had been commanded, (I.e., And Moses alone shall come near unto the Eternal (Verse 2).)  by coming near alone unto the Eternal. It is with reference to this that it is said, And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud etc. (Further, Verse 18.)  Thus the act of the covenant took place on the day after the Giving of the Torah, and on that day was the ascent, when Moses went up into the mountain and he stayed from then on for forty days. It is with reference to this that Scripture explains, and on the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud, (Ibid., Verse 16.)  [i.e., the seventh day of the month Sivan, which was the day after the Giving of the Torah], and it is said, And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud. (Further, Verse 18.)  All this is correctly and clearly explained. Now I have seen in the Mechilta (Mechilta above, 19:10.)  That the Rabbis differed on this matter. Some say (This is the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.)  that the making of the covenant took place before the Giving of the Torah — on the fifth day of Sivan — and Moses said to them: “Now you are bound, held and tied; tomorrow come and accept upon yourselves all the commandments.” But Rabbi Yosei the son of Rabbi Yehudah says: “All these acts were done on one and the same day,” that is to say all these acts were performed on the same day, namely the day after the Torah was given — all that Moses told the people and the writing of the Book of the Covenant — all as we have explained. And to this one [i.e., Rabbi Yosei the son of Rabbi Yehudah] we listen, since he has spoken according to the accepted opinion. (See Peah 4:1 for origin of this expression [“to this one we listen etc.”].) </p>

              <p>ואל ישעו בדברי שקר AND LET THEM NOT REGARD VAIN WORDS — let them not think and speak always about “words of wind” saying, “Let us go and sacrifice”. Of similar meaning is, (Psalm 119:117) “And I will speak of (ואשעה ב־) thy statutes continually”. The phrase (Deuteronomy 28:37) למשל ולשנינה “[thou shalt become] a proverb and a byword” we translate in the Targum by “a topic of conversation (שועי)”, and the word ויספר (Genesis 24:66) “and he related” by ואשתעי “and he spoke about”. One cannot possibly say that the word ישעו has the same meaning as the verbs in (Genesis 4:4) “And the Lord turned (וישע) to Abel” and in (Genesis 4:4) “but to Cain and his offering he did not turn (שעה)”, and that we must translate אל ישעו by “Let them not turn”, for if this were so Scripture should have written אל דברי שקר or לדברי שקר (instead of בדברי) for so is the construction in all such cases. Examples are: (Isaiah 17:7) “A man shall turn to (ישעה אל) his Maker”; (Isaiah 17:8) “and he shall not turn to (ישעה על) the altars”; (Isaiah 31:1) “they turn not unto (שעו על) the Holy One of Israel”. I do not find the construction of a ב following these verbs in the sense of “turning to”, but after an expression of דבר “speaking” — as when one intently directs his conversation upon a matter — the construction with כ is quite an appropriate one. For instance: (Ezekiel 33:30) “those who intently direct their conversation (הנדברים) upon thee (בך)”; (Numbers 12:1) “And Miriam and Aaron directed their speech (ותדבר) upon Moses (במשה)”; (Zechariah 4:1) “And the angel who directed his conversaion (הדובר) upon me (בי)”; (Deuteronomy 11:9) “To turn your conversation (לדבר) intently upon them (בם)”; (Psalm 119:46) “And I will direct my speech (אדברה) upon thy testimonies (בעדותיך)”. So, too, here: ואל ישעו בדברי שקר means “let them not always be conversing about vain and idle matters”.</p>

        <summary>Yitzchok's deep love for Rivkah was based on her role in helping him fulfill his Creator's will and symbolized by bringing her into Sarah's tent, leading to his comfort after Sarah's death. The marriage of Isaac and Rebekah was orchestrated by Eliezer's prayer and God's guidance, with their union celebrated by a great feast. Isaac's marriage to Rebekah resulted in Abraham taking another wife, Keturah, out of a sense of unsettledness. Isaac's marriage to Rebekah is seen as a reason for Abraham's subsequent marriage.</summary>

              <p>Genesis ‎24,67. “Yitzchok brought Rivkah into the tent of his ‎mother Sarah, and he wed her and she became his wife and ‎he loved her.” We need to examine what the Torah meant by ‎Yitzchok loving Rivkah that is so extraordinary that it has to be ‎spelled out here. A husband can love his wife on two different ‎levels. He may love her, i.e. be physically attracted to her as she ‎enables him to satisfy his biological urges. If this is his “love,” it is ‎not love at all, but is merely love of his self. There are husbands ‎who do not love their wives because they are instruments of ‎fulfilling their physical desires, but because their wives enable ‎them to perform their Creator’s will better and more profoundly. ‎This is the true meaning of “someone loving his wife.” The Torah ‎testifies that Yitzchok’s love for Rivkah was of the latter category.‎</p>

These phenomena had stopped with her death. As soon as Rivkah entered the tent the light began to burn again. This was taken by Yitzchok as a sign that Rivkah would replace the mother had held dear in his heart as long as she had been alive. (Rashi’s source is Bereshit Rabbah 60,16)</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויביאה יצחק האהלה שרה אמו , “Yitzchak brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah.” Here the Torah first refers to Rivkah merely with the pronoun “her, whereas when the same verse continues to report that Yitzchak married Rivkah she is mentioned by name.” The normal procedure should have been to mention Rivkah by name at the beginning of the verse and to refer to her by pronoun when she becomes the subject again in the same verse. Why did the Torah depart from the norm? Perhaps the underlying consideration was to mention Sarah first as she had been her predecessor in that tent and Rivkah had only been born after Sarah had already died and Bethuel had fathered Rivkah (22,23). At that juncture the Torah had seen fit to report Sarah’s death (23,2) which meant that at the time Yitzchak was bound Sarah had already died. Bereshit Rabbah 55,4 said that Yitzchak was 37 years old at that time and that when Sarah heard what was going to happen to him her soul departed and she died. The Torah itself testifies that Yitzchak was 40 years old when he married Rivkah (25,20), which makes Rivkah 3 years old when she was married. Keeping all this in mind explains why the Torah first spoke only about Yitzchak bringing Rivkah into the tent of his mother Sarah as at that tender age she was not yet a real soul-mate for him. Yitzchak’s love for Rivkah was kindled when he observed how perfectly she filled the role his mother Sarah had fulfilled in her tent. At that point, Yitzchak felt ready to complete the proceedings of marriage, i.e. ויקח יצחק את רבקה ותהי לו לאשה, Yitzchak married Rivkah and she became a real wife for him.”</p>

The words: “Yitzchak brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah,” teach that if someone’s wife dies and he had (grown up) children from her he should not remarry until he married off his children first. Having done so, he should remarry. The Midrash derives all this from the sequence of what the Torah tells us here about the conduct of Avraham who waited with remarrying until after Yitzchak had a home of his own.</p>

              <p>AND ISAAC BROUGHT HER INTO HIS MOTHER SARAH’s TENT. The construct is missing here [for the noun ohel (tent) appears with the definite article, and in this form it cannot be used in construct with “his mother Sarah.” The verse then should be understood as if it were written, “and Isaac brought her into the tent which was the tent of his mother Sarah.”] There are many cases like this. The purport of the verse is to tell of the honor that Isaac bestowed upon his mother for from the time that Sarah died they did not take down her tent because they said, “Let not another woman come into the tent of the honorable mistress.” But when he saw Rebekah he brought her into that tent in her honor and there he took her as his wife. This is the meaning of the words, and he loved her, and he was comforted, indicating that he was deeply grieved for his mother, finding no comforter until he was comforted by his wife through his love for her. Otherwise, what reason is there for Scripture to mention a man’s love for his wife? But Onkelos explained: And Isaac brought her into the tent and, behold, she was like Sarah his mother. It is for this reason that Scripture mentions the love he had for her because it was on account of her righteousness and the aptness of her deeds that he loved her and was comforted by her. And so the Rabbis mentioned in Bereshith Rabbah, (60:15.)  “Before Sarah died there was a blessing of miraculous increase in the dough. [After her death it stopped, and when Rebekah came the blessing reappeared.”]</p>

              <p>Wiederum ein Grundzug, der sich gottlob bei den Nachkommen Abrahams und Saras, Isaaks und Rebekkas nicht verwischt hat! Je mehr sie sein Weib wurde, desto mehr liebte er sie! Wie diese Ehe des ersten jüdischen Sohnes, werden die jüdischen Ehen, die meisten jüdischen Ehen, nicht durch die Leidenschaft, sondern durch die Vernunft geschlossen. Eltern und Verwandte überlegen, ob die jungen Leute zu einander passen; und darum steigt die Liebe, je mehr sie sich kennen lernen. Die meisten nichtjüdischen Ehen werden jedoch nach dem geschlossen, was sie &quot;Liebe&quot; nennen, und da braucht man nur in die nach dem Leben gezeichneten Novellen-Schilderungen zu blicken, um zu gewahren, welche Kluft da zwischen der &quot;Liebe&quot; vor der Ehe und nach derselben gähnt, wie schal und fade alles nachher, wie man sich alles ganz anders vorgestellt usw. Diese &quot;Liebe&quot; war blind, jeder Schritt in die Zukunft hinein bringt Enttäuschung; von der jüdischen Ehe aber heißt e5: ויקח את רבקה ותהי לו לאשה ויאהבה! Da ist die Hochzeit nicht Blütengipfel, sondern Wurzelkeim der Liebe!</p>

              <p>Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah. As a distinguished woman, Sarah likely had her own tent, in which she kept her personal possessions. This tent, located in Hebron, remained empty after her death, and it was here that Isaac brought Rebecca. It is possible that this is the tent referred to earlier, in the story of Abraham’s hospitality to the angels (18:9–10). He took Rebecca, she became his wife, and he loved her. Isaac was comforted after his mother. Evidently, his mother had died not long before. As Sarah’s only son, Isaac felt a deep inner void upon her passing. Upon the arrival of Rebecca, he finally felt that he could be comforted after his mother’s demise. He brought Rebecca to Sarah’s tent because she was expected to take over the matriarchal role in the family, a function that she would indeed fulfill in an important sense later.</p>

Nachmanides writes that the reason that the Torah mentions Yitzchok’s loving Rivkah in one and the same breath as his finally comforting himself over the loss of his mother, was because Rivkah represented a replacement of all the virtues Sarah had possessed. </p>

It seemed to Isaac that this was Sarah’s tent and it was just like his mother Sarah was still alive. When Sarah was alive, there was a light in her tent that was lit from Sabbath to Sabbath. The blessing was in the dough that Sarah had made. A cloud stood over Sarah’s tent and as soon as Sarah died, these three things disappeared. As soon as Rebecca came, these three things returned. Thus, it appeared to Isaac that his mother was still alive. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:67.)  Ibn Shuaib writes. Sarah came after her death into the tent of Rebecca to see the joy of her son Isaac.

            <summary>Abraham's sacrifice of the ram on Mount Moriah was accepted by God as equivalent to sacrificing Isaac, benefiting all mankind through his descendants. The &quot;mouth of the earth&quot; that swallowed Korach and his followers was created after the sixth day of Creation but activated at a suitable time by man. The trials of the righteous, like Abraham, lead to spiritual elevation and material success earned through hard work. The moral imperative of the akeydah is now a call for all of Abraham's descendants, symbolized by blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah to remind of Abraham's successful trial and evoke submissive feelings in each of us.</summary>

                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 21:1:18</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>When Abraham sacrificed the ram, he was not yet certain if that act had been accepted as a substitute for Isaac and would be considered equivalent to his having actually sacrificed Isaac physically. He called the place &quot;the mountain where it is proper to demonstrate obedience (fear) of the Lord,&quot; to indicate what he had come to accomplish there. Beyond this, he expressed the hope that also in the future this site would be looked up to as the place where his act of obedience had been duly noted. The second call of the angel confirmed to him that his intention had in fact been considered by G-d as if he had already carried out the deed, and this would benefit the whole of mankind through his descendants, and that the world at large would know all about it. Something else created after sunset on the sixth day of Creation, and being activated when a suitable opportunity presented itself, is the &quot;mouth of the earth&quot; which swallowed Korach and his followers. Moses suggested that if a gehinam had not yet been created, this would be a good time to create it and to consign Korach and his followers to it. The use of the earth's &quot;mouth&quot; then had not yet been decreed, and awaited an opportunity for man to trigger it (compare Bamidbar Rabbah 18). The same consideration can be applied to the other examples listed in that Mishnah in Avot. Abraham returned to Beer Sheva to lead a life of spreading blessings for his fellow men (he planted the Eshel). As pointed out in the opening Midrash, the ultimate justification for subjecting the righteous to trials lies in the fact that such tzaddikim emerge spiritually elevated. When such righteous people also enjoy material success, the midat hadin, G-d’s attribute of justice, can point out that such material wealth had not been bestowed arbitrarily, but had been earned the hard way by its recipients. In Michah 6,8, we are taught that the trial of the akeydah in its applied sense had become the claim G-d has on all of us. The moral imperative which the call to the akeydah represented, and which Abraham had demonstrated to be within man's capacity to respond to, has since become the call addressed to each one of Abraham's descendants, even if no first born is needed as an actual sacrifice on the altar. The commandment to blow the shofar, the ram's horn, on New Year's day, is to remind the midat hadin, attribute of justice, of the successful trial of Abraham, and of the fact that the hachna-ah, submissive feelings, evoked in us at the sound of the shofar, are the symbolic akeydah of each one of us. </p>

If the number of dotted letters is greater than the number of undotted letters, one expounds the dotted letters. Here, where the number of dotted letters is greater than the number of undotted letters, one expounds the dotted letters, [which spell out]: ‘Where is he [ayo] – Abraham?’ Rabbi Azarya said: Just as they said [to Abraham]: “Where is Sarah?” so they said to Sarah: ‘Where is Abraham?’  “He said: Behold, in the tent” – that is what is written: “Blessed beyond women is Yael, wife of Ḥever the Kenite; beyond the women in the tent, she shall be blessed” (Judges 5:24). Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman, Rabbi Elazar said: Beyond the women of the generation of the wilderness, who dwelled in tents, as it is stated: “Each man at the entrance of his tent” (Numbers 11:10). Why should she be more blessed than they were? They bore children and kept the world going, but what use would it have been? Were it not for her, they would have been eradicated. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Beyond the matriarchs. (Sarah (here), Rebecca (Genesis 24:67), and Leah and Rachel (Genesis 31:33), are all mentioned in connection with tents.)  They bore children, etc., but were it not for her, they would have been eradicated.</p>

Sarah his mother.”)  – all the days that Sarah was alive, there was a cloud suspended over the entrance to her tent. When she died, that cloud ceased. When Rebecca came, the cloud returned. All the days that Sarah was alive, the doors were kept wide open [for guests]. When Sarah died, that opening ceased. When Rebecca came, the opening returned. All the days that Sarah was alive, there was [divine] blessing bestowed upon her dough. When Sarah died, that blessing ceased. When Rebecca came, it returned. All the days that Sarah was alive, there was a lamp kindled from Shabbat night until Shabbat night. When Sarah died, that lamp ceased. When Rebecca came, it returned. When he saw that she was acting just like his mother, separating ḥalla in purity, and shaping loaves from her dough in purity, immediately, he “brought her into the tent.” (The verse means to say that he brought her into the tent because she was just like Sarah in her righteousness.)   Rabbi Yudan said: The Torah teaches you that if an [unmarried] person has adult children, he should see to marrying them off first and then take a wife for himself. From whom do you learn it? From Abraham. First, “Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah” and then, “Abraham took another wife, and her name was Ketura” (Genesis 25:1).</p>

Rather, to what is it [alluding]? Before the sun of one righteous individual sets, He causes the sun of another righteous individual to rise. The day that Rabbi Akiva died, Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] was born, and they read this verse in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” The day that Rav Ada bar Ahava died, Rav Hamnuna his son was born, and they read in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” The day that Rav Hamnuna died, Rabbi Avin his son was born, and they read in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” The day that Rabbi Avin died, Abba Hoshaya of Teraya was born, and they read in his regard: “The sun rises and the sun sets.” Before the sun of Sarah set, the sun of Rebecca rose. That is what is written: “Betuel begot Rebecca” (Genesis 22:23), and then, “Sarah died in Kiryat Arba” (Genesis 23:2), and it is written: “Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah” (Genesis 24:67). (See Bereshit Rabba 60:16, where this verse is interpreted to mean that Rebecca was a worthy replacement for Sarah.)  Before the sun of Moses set, the sun of Joshua rose. Before the sun of Joshua set, the sun of Otniel, who is Yabetz, rose. So it is with all of them in each and every generation; that is, “the sun rises and the sun sets.”</p>

After Sarah’s death, he first betrothed Isaac and then took a wife for himself. Where do we learn this? It is written: Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and after: Abraham took another wife. Isaac said to himself: “I have taken a wife, but my father is without a wife.” What did Isaac do? He went and bought him (Abraham) a wife. Rabbi said: Hagar and Keturah were one and the same person. Why then was she called Keturah? Because she had been bound up (keshurah) like a water bag.

As long as Sarah had been alive, G–d's Presence had never departed from that tent; Sarah had kept a light burning from one Sabbath Eve to the next. This light went out when Sarah died. Now that Rebeccah entered, it began burning again. The reason that the verse mentions Sarah by name, [after all we all know that Isaac's mother was Sarah! Ed.] is to tell us that Rebeccah was like Sarah in all respects. Rabbi Yehudah adds that just as Isaac's features resembled those of his father so much that he was frequently mistaken for Abraham, so Rebeccah's features resembled those of Sarah to such an amazing degree that this had to be emphasized. The Torah points out that Isaac was comforted so as to show us that this was because he had found such a perfect replacement for his mother. The Torah deliberately avoids saying that Isaac was consoled over Sarah's death, but mentions only אחרי אמו, to show that he found continuity. Thus far the Zohar.</p>

            <summary>The chapter recounts the finding of a wife for Yitzhak, ensuring the continuation of the line, with the assurance that God will take care of it. Many meeting scenes in the Bible take place at a well, and the chapter involves a journey made by Avraham's emissary, with key words being &quot;go,&quot; &quot;journey,&quot; and &quot;grant success,&quot; and &quot;take&quot; often used for &quot;marry&quot; (Genesis 24:1-67).</summary>

              <p>YOUR HEADS. Roshekhem (your heads) is similar to haohelah (the tent) in into the tent Sarah his mother (Gen. 24:67) (Translated literally. According to I. E. into the tent Sarah his mother is short for into the tent, the tent of Sarah his mother. Similarly, your heads is short for your heads the heads of. See I.E. on Gen. 24:67 (Vol. 1, p. 243).)  and even the prophecy, Odad the prophet (Translated literally.)  (II Chron. 15:8). (According to I.E. even the prophecy, Odad the prophet is short for even the prophecy, the prophecy of Odad the prophet. See I.E. on Gen. 24:67 (Vol. 1, p. 243).)  Roshekhem shivtekhem (your heads, your tribes) is to be interpreted as your heads, who are the heads of your tribes. (Roshekhem shivtekhem is short for roshekhem roshe shivtekhem.)  Roshekhem (your heads) is like the word va-niram (we have shot at them) (Num. 21:30). (Num. 21:30 reads, va-niram avad cheshbon (we have shot at them, Heshbon is destroyed). According to I.E. this is to be interpreted as And their king, the king of Heshbon was destroyed. See I.E. on Num. 21:30 (Vol. 4, p. 175).)  The word is to be so interpreted for the princes (The heads of the tribes.)  were closest to the ark. (According to I.E. our verse records the hierarchical arrangement of the Israelites before the ark, when the covenant was made. If we take our verse literally the word “tribes” breaks up the arrangement. Hence I.E. insists that our verse reads, your heads, the heads of your tribes.)  After them came the elders, followed by the officers, after whom came all the men of Israel, that is, the males, followed by the male little ones, after whom came the women, followed by the strangers.</p>

              <p>The last full episode of the Avraham cycle is the longest in the book. Its leisurely pace, attention to detail, and concentration on speeches as well as action belie the importance of what is being recounted: the finding of a wife for Yitzhak, who is biologically to continue the line. Yet after all that has happened in the previous chapters, we know that this will be taken care of by God. That is implied in Avraham’s assured “he himself [God] will send his messenger on before you” (v.7). Many meeting/betrothal scenes in the Bible take place at a well (e.g., Yaakov, Moshe); this was probably a literary convention (see Culley 1976b and Alter 1981 for a discussion of the significance of such a phenomenon). Like other crucial moments in Avraham’s life the chapter involves a journey, albeit one made by his emissary. It is therefore natural that the key words of the chapter are “go,” “journey,” and “grant success.” “Take” also appears frequently, as the biblical term often used for “marry.”</p>

Thus, it appeared to Isaac that his mother was still alive. (Rashi, Genesis, 24:67.) </p>

And it is written immediately afterward: “And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah” (Genesis 25:1). After seeing his son marry, Abraham was disquieted by the fact he was not married.

        <summary>The text emphasizes the importance of surpassing boundaries with strength to bring goodness into holiness, using Elisha's story as an example. Commentary sources provide differing views on Keturah, with some highlighting her positive qualities and connection to Hagar. In Jewish thought, Isaac reconciles with his family after the binding incident, settling near a well. Midrash discusses the establishment of daily prayers by Abraham and the blessings of Moses to Israel. Musar connects the incense offering to the universe and prayer as a reflection of the relationship between the משפיע and the מושפע. Quoting commentary sources offer insights into Sarah's banishment of Hagar's son, the priestly blessing, and the exemption of women from the command to be fruitful. The Talmud discusses the differences between Keturah's children and Isaac, as well as claims to the land of Canaan. The Targum identifies Keturah as Hagar, suggesting she had been with Abraham from the beginning.</summary>

              <p>“You shall have a place prepared outside of the encampment, and there you shall go outside [to attend to your needs]. And you shall have a shovel among your weapons, and it shall be, when you sit outside, you shall dig therewith, and turn back to cover that which came out of you.” (Devarim, 23:13–14) “A prepared place” signifies the tekifut (unbridled strength)  (Tekifut, see note 61, Sefer Shemot. Also, the word used here for place, yad, also means arm, as in the expression “an arm of strength,” yad chazaka.)  and the power with which one may surpass his boundaries and from there bring goodness into Kedusha (holiness). “And you shall have a shovel among your weapons” (is related to what is said in the Gemara, Tamid, 28a), “he who wants to live [or ‘which is the right way a man should choose?’], he should seize meticulous integrity [abundant faithfulness].” This is the meaning of “you shall have a shovel among your weapons,” meaning that with all your actions you should proceed with confidence and tekifut. ((“Yateid [shovel] can also mean ‘nail’ – compare with, “I shall plant it firmly (like) a yateid in a faithful (strong) place” (Yeshaya 22). [Hagahot Peretz])  “And it shall be when you sit outside” represents a time when a man of Israel acts, God forbid, in a way that is beyond his boundaries. Then, “and you shall dig therewith,” meaning that it shall be set before you and you shall be ashamed of it. In examining the formulation of this verse, compare it with (lyov, 39:29), “from there he seeks his prey” (Both “dig” and “seek” use the word chafar.) “And turn back and you shall cover it,” means that afterwards find a way to do the same action in a way that is permissible (see Yoma, 87a). “And you shall cover that which came out of you” means that the next time you do it you atone for the past.  (See Avoda Zara, 17a, where Dordiya came close to sinning with a prostitute, and subsequently made teshuva (repented). God then brought it about that she converted and he married her.)  We find this with Avraham Avinu (Bereshit, 25:1), “and Avraham went further, and took a wife, and her name was Ketora.” After all his trials he was tested another time concerning Hagar, and it was made clear that even the first time it was from God’s will. ((He did nothing wrong when he first married Hagar. It looked shady because she was a maidservant, but God revealed retro that it was His true will from the outset. [Hagahot Peretz])   This is as we find in the Gemara (Shabbat, 49a) with the incident of Elisha the master of wings. At that time, the Romans passed an edict that anyone found wearing tefillin would have their brain pierced by the authorities. Elisha went out in the marketplace wearing his tefillin, and a commissar spotted him. They chased him, and just before he was caught, he took off his tefillin and put them in his hands. The commissar ordered him to open his hands, and when he did so, they contained the wings of a dove. He first went outside in his tefillin because he had confidence that surely no one could do him any harm, since he was fulfilling the commandment of God. Then when the commissar caught him, he also trusted that God would not let harm befall him, so he did not bring angry complaints against God’s of judgment, for God sent him confidence even then. Therefore, God answered him, and he found the wings of a dove in his hands. This means that he put himself in a position where he would be enticed by God, as it is written (Hoshea, 7:11), “a tempted dove.” The miracle he experienced made it clear that when he first went outside wearing tefillin it was only a result of the tekifut that God had sent him, and by means of it he was saved.</p>

Tur HaArokh and Da'at Zekenim also discuss Keturah's positive qualities and possible connection to Hagar. Rashi and Tze'enah Ure'enah provide additional insights into Keturah's character and actions, with Rashi highlighting her purity and Tze'enah Ure'enah discussing her fidelity to Abraham.

              <p>ויוסף אברהם ויקח אשה, “Avraham continued life as usual by taking a wife;” this is a reference to Hagar who now had a another name, Keturah. We find a similar formulation to the above in Isaiah 8,5: ויוסף ה' דבר אלי עוד, “the Lord continued by speaking to me again;” the Torah wished to teach us civilised norms by reporting this, i.e. that when widower’s sons have grown up but have not married yet, he should wait with remarrying until his children are married. (According to matnot kehunah in Breshit Rabbah the apparently superfluous word ויוסף, “he continued,” is to teach us that it was the same woman to whom he had been married once before, i.e. Hagar.) In order to make the point that a widower under the right conditions is to marry again is why the above line has been written immediately after the Torah had reported the marriage of Yitzchok to Rivkah.</p>

              <p>KETURAH. Keturah is not to be identified with Hagar (See Bereshit Rabbah 61:4; also Rashi’s comments.)  because Scripture explicitly states, But unto the sons of the concubines (pilagshim), that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts (v. 6). (“Concubines” indicates that Abraham had more than one concubine. If Keturah and Hagar were one and the same person the verse would have read concubine. I.E. goes on to note that pilegesh (concubine) refers exclusively to a handmaid to forestall the argument that verse 6 refers to male slaves (pilagshim has a masculine ending) and therefore negate his argument that Abraham had more than one concubine.)  The meaning of pilegesh (concubine) is a handmaid. This term cannot refer to a male. We can explain upon concubinage (Ezek. 23:20) as referring to females. (The printed editions have, “We can explain on concubines as women.” If we accept this reading the point that I.E. is apparently making is that even though the word pilagshim has a masculine ending it refers to females (Weiser). However, Filwarg and Krinsky, as well as Weiser himself, point out that I.E. may be alluding to Ezek. 23:20, And she doted on concubinage (pilagshehem) with them, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses. The words be-saram (whose flesh) and zirmatam (whose issue) are masculine; hence the concubines spoken of in this verse appear to be males. Indeed, Kimchi in his comments on Ezek. 23:20 quotes an opinion which maintains that the concubines referred to in this verse are male slaves. Therefore I.E. points out that pilagshim refers only to females. Filwarg suggests amending our texts of I.E. to read pilagshehem, as in Ezek. 23:20. In this case the allusion to Ezekiel would be unmistakable. The fact of the matter is that Vat. Ebr. 38 reads al pilagshehem, and we have translated accordingly.) </p>

Seeing that the continuity of his own seed [the Jewish people having originated in seed from both a Jewish father and a Jewish other, Ed.] had been assured, he was not concerned with the antecedents of Keturah. We can be certain, however, that he selected a woman who personally possessed all the good qualities he would have desired also for a wife for his son. The only thing he did not insist on was such a woman’s national background. He was certainly not looking for experiencing disappointments with any children from Keturah, having experienced enough disappointment with Ishmael. We may safely assume that Keturah was not of Canaanitic descent, seeing that even Hagar the Egyptian had not been of such descent. (compare 17,3) Keturah was not a concubine, This is why the Torah writes ויקח אשה, as apposed to the mention of פלגשים, concubines, (verse 5). The sons of the concubines are not mentioned by name whereas the sons of Keturah are all mentioned by their names. This fact alone clearly shows that their status was superior to the sons of Avraham’s concubines. The essential difference between a wife and a concubine is that though both are exclusive partners of the men with whom they live, the former, when becoming wives, underwent the ceremony known as chuppah, and the union was celebrated with a wedding party, whereas a concubine was not accorded all this pomp and ceremony. [after the Torah was given, the essential; difference in status was that no financial settlement, ketuvah, was made when a concubine was taken by a man as his companion.

              </summary>
              <p>Daß Abraham sich wieder verheiratete, ist schon deshalb nicht auffallend, weil er ja noch fünfunddreißig Jahre nach Saras Tode lebte, mehr als die jetzt durchschnittliche Dauer einer Ehe. Außerdem ist ja, nach dem Worte der Weisen, der Mann nicht &quot;ganz&quot; wenn ohne Frau, die Aufgabe eines Menschen ist jederzeit zu groß, als daß sie von einem allein voll gelöst werden könnte. Unter Ketura wäre nach R. Jehuda (ב&quot;ר) Hagar zu verstehen, also daßelbe Weib, das ihm Sara zugeführt. Dabei ist nicht zu übersehen, wie rein und menschlich die Weisen ein Verhältnis auffassen, das später so trüb und betrübend erscheint. Jizchak, sagen sie, sei nach dem Brunnen an der Wüste hingegangen, um seinem Vater von dort selbst Hagar, seine, wie wir es nennen, seine &quot;Stiefmutter&quot;, zuzuführen! Und er hatte doch seine Mutter so lieb gehabt! Und er war doch, als er dort hinging, noch untröstlich über den Heimgang seiner Mutter! Mag man dies nun als historische Tatsache, oder als Lehrandeutung fassen, so bekundet es ja, in letzterem Falle sogar noch mehr, die Anschauung, die der Zeit unserer Weisen eigen war. Wie tief sinkt dagegen selbst unsere Gegenwart herab, in welcher eine zweite Frau das Verhältnis von erwachsenen Kindern zum Vater gespannt, wenn nicht gar feindlich zu gestalten pflegt! Nach R. Jehuda hieße das ויוסף ויקה, er nahm wieder, und zwar על פי דבור in Folge eines Geheißes desselben göttlichen Wortes, das früher ihm Sara Folge zu leisten geboten, die ihre Entlassung von ihm gefordert. Hagar habe seitdem als קטר) קטורה chaldäisch Knoten) verschlossen und einsam, ohne weitere Verbindung mit einem Manne, gelebt, woher ihr Name (auch Hagar, verwandt mit חגר ,אגר, bedeutet ähnliches), sonst hätte sie wohl auch Abraham nicht wieder nehmen dürfen.</p>

              <p>ושמה קטורה, “whose name was Keturah.” Rashi claims that Keturah was identical with Hagar, who appears in a new guise. Her new name reflected her new and improved attitudes, comparable to the incense offered on the altar, the most beloved of Israel’s sacrificial offerings. In order to reconcile this comment with what Rashi had written on Genesis 21,14 where Hagar is described as ותלך ותתע, as returning to the idolatrous practices she had absorbed in her home as a child, we would have to postulate that in the interval she had become a penitent. Although she was of Egyptian origin [and therefore no better than a Canaanite from the point of view of Avraham’s criteria for intermarriage Ed.] she was not only of perfectly good character, but seeing that the first time Avraham had married he had done so with Divine approval, she was now also permissible to him as a wife.
    I have seen a comment in Bereshit Rabbah 61,4 that even at this stage Avraham married her at G’d’s instructions This is why the Torah wrote ויוסף אברהם ויקח, “he again married, etc.” The word ויוסף is to tell us that just as it had been with G’d’s approval that he had married Hagar the first time, he still enjoyed G’d’s approval when he took her back. The Midrash describes an argument between two scholars of the Talmud who debated this subject.

From here we learn that when a person’s wife dies and he has children, he should not marry again until he marries off his children. If he would marry before he marries off his children, then his children will have to make bad matches. People will say that he will have children with the other wife and they will inherit everything. Therefore, Abraham first gave his son a wife, since it is not just that the old one should take a wife and the youth should be without a wife.

              <p>“Her name was Keturah” [25:1]. Abraham took a wife who was called Hagar, his first servant, and had another name, and was called Keturah. This means, bound. That is to say, she did not allow any other man to sleep with her while she was separated from Abraham. Many kings and nobles wanted to take Hagar as a wife, since she was the daughter of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. She waited and took no man. She had many children with Abraham, but they were all of little significance. (Rashi, Genesis, 25:1, 6.)  Bahya writes. Keturah was Hagar. That is why the verse says, “Abraham again took a wife” [25:1]. Abraham again took a wife. Why does it have to say again, but could say, he took a wife. The explanation is that it says again because he had her as a wife previously and he was taking her again. (Bahya, Genesis, 25:6.)  Another explanation is that it had to be Hagar, since how appropriate would it be that Abraham should give all of his money to Isaac and not give an inheritance to the children of Hagar, as the verse says, “Abraham willed all that he owned to Isaac” [25:5], and did not give to the children of Hagar. The Talmud says that one may not take away from one son and give it to another son, even from an evil one to a good son. They should inherit equally. (B. Baba Bathra, 130a.)  The explanation is that Hagar was the maid of Sarah and she was from Egypt. A servant and her children are equal in that the servant does not inherit. Another explanation is that Hagar was called Keturah because her deeds were beautiful, like the incense. (Rashi, Genesis, 25:1.)  Even though Rashi writes above in the Torah portion that Hagar again returned to idol worship, but the explanation is that she again repented and that is why she was called Keturah. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 25:1.) </p>

He also arose and took Ishmael and returned him to his father, as it says, &quot;His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him&quot; (Gen. 25:9) &quot;He shall reconcile parents with children and children with their parents&quot; (Malachi 3:24). Afterwards, Isaac returned to that welland settled there, as it says &quot;After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac.

              <p>“My beloved is like a gazelle or a fawn [ofer ha’ayalim]…” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, in truth you came to us first. “My beloved is like a gazelle” – just as the gazelle leaps, so the Holy One blessed be He leapt and bounded from Egypt to the sea and from the sea to Sinai. In Egypt, “I will pass in the land of Egypt…” (Exodus 12:12). At the sea, “this is my God and I will exalt Him” (Exodus 15:2). At Sinai, “He said: The Lord came from Sinai” (Deuteronomy 33:2). “Or a fawn” – Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: To the fawn of deer. (Rabbi Yosei teaches that &quot;ofer ha'ayalim&quot; means a fawn, and not a certain type of deer.)   “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9) – this is the wilderness of Sinai. “Watching from the windows” (Song of Songs 2:9) – “the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai…” (Exodus 19:20). “Peering through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9) – “God spoke all these matters…” (Exodus 20:1). “My beloved spoke up and said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10) – “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2).   Another matter: “My beloved is like a gazelle” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, You told us that You will come to us first. “My beloved is like a gazelle” – just as the gazelle appears and is then concealed, so, the initial redeemer appeared and was then concealed. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Like the initial redeemer, so will be the ultimate redeemer. The initial redeemer, this is Moses; he appeared to them and was then concealed from them. How long was he concealed from them? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Three months; that is what is written: “They encountered Moses and Aaron…” (Exodus 5:20). (“Encountered” indicates that there had been an interruption in the contact between them.)  The ultimate redeemer, too, will appear to them and will then be concealed from them. How long will he be concealed from them? Rabbi Tanḥuma said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Hoshaya: Forty-five days. That is what is written: “From the time of the abolishing of the daily offering and the setting up of the abomination of desolation there will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days” (Daniel 12:11), and it is written: “Happy is one who waits, and reaches one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days” (Daniel 12:12). How many are these extra days? They are the forty-five days that he will be concealed from them and will then reappear to them.   Where will he take them? (Where will they be during those forty-five days?)  Some say to the Judean desert, and some say to the wilderness of Siḥon and Og. Anyone who believes him and follows him will eat roots of the broom tree and saltwort leaves; that is what is written: “Who pick saltwort from bushes, and the root of the broom tree is their food” (Job 30:4). Anyone who does not follow him will go and make peace with the nations of the world, and they will ultimately kill him. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: At the conclusion of forty-five days, the Holy One blessed be He will cause manna to fall for them. That is what is written: “I will yet settle you in tents as in the appointed [moed] days” (Hosea 12:10), and it says: “The appointed time [moed] of your exodus from Egypt” (Deuteronomy 16:6). “Or a fawn” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: To the fawn of deer.  “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9) – this is the western wall of the Temple, which is never destroyed. Why? It is because the Divine Presence is in the west. “Watching from the windows” (Song of Songs 2:9) – due to the merit of the patriarchs; “peering through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9) – due to the merit of the matriarchs. Just as there is a distinction between a window and a crack, so there is a distinction between the merit of the patriarchs and the merit of the matriarchs. “My beloved spoke up and said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10) – what did He say? “As I live, the utterance of the Lord, that you will don all of them like jewelry, and you will tie them like a bride” (Isaiah 49:18).  Another matter: “My beloved is like a gazelle” (Song of Songs 2:9) – just as this gazelle leaps from place to place, from fence to fence, from tree to tree, and from booth to booth, so, the Holy One blessed be He leaps and bounds from this synagogue to that synagogue. Why to that extent? It is order to bless Israel, as it is stated: “In every place I mention My name, [I will come to you and I will bless you]” (Exodus 20:21). By what merit? It is by the merit of Abraham our patriarch, as it is written: “So [ko] you shall bless,” just as it says: “So [ko] shall be your offspring” (Genesis 15:5). “Or a fawn” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: To the fawn of deer.  “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9) – when the Holy One blessed be He came to visit Abraham our patriarch on the third day since his circumcision, just as it says: “The Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, and he was sitting [yoshev]…” (Genesis 18:1). Yashav is written. (Yoshev is written without a vav, so it looks like yashav.)  He sought to stand; the Holy One blessed be He said to him: Sit, Abraham, you are a paradigm for your descendants, as when your descendants enter synagogues and study halls and recite Shema, they sit and My glory stands. What is the source? “God stands [nitzav] in the assembly of the Almighty” (Psalms 82:1) – Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: It is not written here, “God omed,” (The word “stands” would usually be rendered as omed.)  but rather, “God nitzav,” at the ready. This is just as it says: “It will be before they call, I will answer” (Isaiah 65:24). That is why it is stated: “Behold, he is standing behind our wall”; these are the synagogues and study halls.  “Watching from the windows” (Song of Songs 2:9) – when the Holy One blessed be He said to Aaron and his sons: “So you shall bless…,” Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, to the priests You said that they should bless us. We need only Your blessings and to be blessed from Your mouth.’ That is what is written: “Look from Your holy abode, from Heaven, and bless Your people Israel” (Deuteronomy 26:15). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Although I said to the priests that they should bless you, with them I stand and bless you.’ That is why the priests spread their hands, saying: The Holy One blessed be He is standing behind us. That is why it says: “Watching from the windows” – from between the priests’ shoulders; “peering through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9) – from between the priests’ fingers. “My beloved spoke up and said to me” – “and I will bless them” (Numbers 6:27).  “So you shall bless” – that is what is written: “I will render you a great nation…” (Genesis 12:2). Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair said: The Holy One blessed be He blessed Abraham with seven blessings, and these are they: “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2); “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2); “I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:2); “you will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2). I will bless those who bless you” (Genesis 12:3); “one who curses you, I will curse” (Genesis 12:3), “[all the families of the earth] will be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3). These correspond to the seven verses in the act of Creation in which “that it was good” is written. (Seven including Genesis 1:31: “And it was very good.”)   Rabbi Levi bar Ḥayata and Rabbi Abba son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: There are three expressions of greatness and four blessings written here. He apprised him that there would be three patriarchs and four matriarchs. But is it not that there are only two expressions of greatness? “I will render you [ve’e’eskha]” is an expression of greatness (Thus, there are, in fact, three expressions of greatness.) , as it is written: “It is the Lord who appointed [asa] Moses [and Aaron]” (I Samuel 12:6).  Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – this is that we recite: God of Abraham. “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2) – this is that we recite: God of Isaac. “I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:2) – this is that we recite: God of Jacob. Do we, perhaps, conclude with all of them? The verse states: “You will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2) – it is with you they conclude: The Shield of Abraham, and we do not conclude with all of them. (This midrash is referring to the first blessing of the Amida prayer.)  Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ze’eira said: “You will be a blessing” – your blessing precedes Mine, as after they recite Shield of Abraham, only then do they recite: Who revives the dead.   Another matter: “You will be a blessing [berakha]” (Genesis 12:2) – you will be a pool [berekha]. Just as this pool purifies the impure, you, too, draw the distant under the wings of the Divine Presence. “I will render you [ve’e’eskha] a great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – Rabbi Berekhya said: It is not written here, Etenkha, (See Genesis 17:20: “I will make him [untativ] a great nation.” asimekha) , (See Genesis 46:3: “I will make you [asimekha] a great nation there.”)  but rather ve’e’eskha. (This connotes creation of a new entity.)  After I create you as a new creation, just as it says: “God made [vayaas] the firmament” (Genesis 1:7), then you will be fruitful and multiply.  “A great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – Abraham said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, from Noah, did You not produce seventy nations?’ He said to him: ‘That nation in whose regard it is written: “For who is a great nation” (Deuteronomy 4:7), I am producing from you.’ Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen bar Ḥama said: When did the Holy One blessed be He render Abraham a great nation? It was when they departed from Egypt, came to Sinai, received the Torah, and arrived in the Land of Israel. Moses looked at them and said: They have been rendered just as the Holy One blessed be He promised to the elder, as it is stated: “And who is a great nation” (Deuteronomy 4:8). Alternatively, “a great nation” – as I will give your descendants the Torah, and from it they will be called a great nation, as it is stated: “It is a particularly wise and understanding people, this great nation” (Deuteronomy 4:6).   “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2) – Rabbi Berekhya said: Because travel causes a person three phenomena: It lessens procreation, it lessens his expenditure, (It reduces his disposable income.)  and it lessens his reputation; that is why it was stated to him: “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – travel will not lessen your procreation; “I will bless you” – travel will not lessen your expenditure; “I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:2) – it will not lessen your reputation.  People say in a parable: From house to house, a cloak; from place to place, a soul. However, you will lose neither a soul nor property.  “You will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2) – it is already written: “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2); why does the verse state: “You will be a blessing”? Rabbi Eliezer said: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘From when I created My world until now, I needed to bless My creations,’ as it is stated: “God blessed them…” (Genesis 1:28), and it says: “God blessed Noah and his sons” (Genesis 9:1). ‘But from here on, the blessings are granted to you; to one whom you see fit to bless, bless.’ Nevertheless, Abraham did not bless his sons. Why is it so? It is analogous to a king who had an orchard and he entrusted it to a sharecropper. In that orchard there was one tree that was an elixir of life and one tree a deadly poison. The sharecropper said: I will cultivate and complete [my work], and the king will do with his orchard what he chooses. So, the king, this is the Holy One blessed be He. The orchard, this is the world. He granted it to Abraham, as He said to him: “You will be a blessing.” What did Abraham do? He had two sons, one righteous and one wicked: Isaac and Ishmael. Abraham said: If I bless Isaac, Ishmael will request to be blessed, and he is wicked. Rather, I am a servant; I am flesh and blood. Tomorrow, I will pass from the world, and what the Holy One blessed be He wishes to do in His world, He will do. When Abraham passed away, the Holy One blessed be He appeared to Isaac and blessed him, as it is stated: “It was after the death of Abraham, [God blessed Isaac his son]” (Genesis 25:11). Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve tribes, as it is stated: “All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve, and this is that which their father spoke to them, and he blessed them” (Genesis 49:28). From here on, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The blessings are granted to you. The priests will bless My children, just as I said to Abraham their patriarch: “You will be a blessing.”’ That is why it is stated: “So you shall bless…”</p>

              <p>“Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah; he took Rebecca, she became his wife, and he loved her, and Isaac was comforted after his mother” (Genesis 24:67).  “Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah” (The word “of” is actually missing in the Hebrew, so that the verse literally means: “Isaac brought her into the tent. Sarah his mother.”)  – all the days that Sarah was alive, there was a cloud suspended over the entrance to her tent. When she died, that cloud ceased. When Rebecca came, the cloud returned. All the days that Sarah was alive, the doors were kept wide open [for guests]. When Sarah died, that opening ceased. When Rebecca came, the opening returned. All the days that Sarah was alive, there was [divine] blessing bestowed upon her dough. When Sarah died, that blessing ceased. When Rebecca came, it returned. All the days that Sarah was alive, there was a lamp kindled from Shabbat night until Shabbat night. When Sarah died, that lamp ceased. When Rebecca came, it returned. When he saw that she was acting just like his mother, separating ḥalla in purity, and shaping loaves from her dough in purity, immediately, he “brought her into the tent.” (The verse means to say that he brought her into the tent because she was just like Sarah in her righteousness.)   Rabbi Yudan said: The Torah teaches you that if an [unmarried] person has adult children, he should see to marrying them off first and then take a wife for himself. From whom do you learn it? From Abraham. First, “Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah” and then, “Abraham took another wife, and her name was Ketura” (Genesis 25:1).</p>

              <p>“Abraham took another wife, and her name was Ketura” (Genesis 25:1).  “Abraham took another wife, and her name was Ketura.” It is written: “Happy is the man who has not walked…” (Psalms 1:1). “Who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked” (Psalms 1:1) – this [“the wicked”] refers to the generation of the Dispersion. “Has not stood in the path of sinners” (Psalms 1:1) – these are the people of Sodom, as it is stated: “The people of Sodom were extremely wicked and sinful to the Lord” (Genesis 13:13). “And has not sat [yashav] in the company of the insolent one” (Psalms 1:1) – this refers to Avimelekh, (He is considered insolent because after expelling Abraham he said to him: “In accordance with the kindness that I have shown you” (Genesis 21:23).)  as it is stated: “Behold my land is before you, [dwell [shev] wherever it suits you]…” (Genesis 20:15). (Abraham did not accept Avimelekh’s offer to dwell near him.)  “But whose desire is the Torah of the Lord” (Psalms 1:2) – “For I love him, so that he will command [his children and his household after him that they keep the way of the Lord]…” (Genesis 18:19). “And he meditates on His Torah” (Psalms 1:2) – Rabbi Shimon said: He [Abraham] had no father to teach him, and he did not have a teacher. From where, then, did he learn Torah? The answer is that the Holy One blessed be He set his two kidneys [kilyotav] (The kidneys were considered the seat of thought in the body.)  as two teachers of a sort, and they would flow forth and teach him Torah and wisdom. That is what is written: “I bless the Lord who counsels me, even on nights when my thoughts [khilyotai] are anguished” (Psalms 16:7). “He will be like a tree planted” (Psalms 1:3) – the Holy One blessed be He planted him in the Land of Israel. “Which brings forth its fruit in season” (Psalms 1:3) – this refers to Ishmael. “And whose leaf does not wither” (Psalms 1:3) – this refers to Isaac. “And whatever he does will prosper” (Psalms 1:3) – this refers to the sons of Ketura, as it is stated: “Abraham took another wife, and her name was Ketura.”</p>

(After his circumcision he went on to produce a child, Isaac.)  “If its root grows old in the earth” (Job 14:8) – “Abraham was old” (Genesis 24:1). “And its trunk dies in the dirt” (Job 14:8) – “Sarah died” (And was buried in the earth.)  (Genesis 23:2). “It will blossom from the scent of water” (Job 14:9) – due the scent of mitzvot and good deeds, he will blossom. (Because of his virtuous behavior, he was enabled to father more children in his old age.)  “And produce branches” (Job 14:9) – “[branches] of a sapling” is not written here, but rather, “[branches] like a sapling” – the addition is greater than the tree itself: “Abraham took another [wife]…” (And through this new wife he produced even more offspring than he had previously.) </p>

              <p>“In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not rest your hand” (Ecclesiastes 11:6) – Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Eliezer said: If you sowed in the early season, sow in the late season [as well], as you do not know “which will succeed” (Ecclesiastes 11:6), whether that of the early season or that of the late season, “or whether they both alike will be good” (Ecclesiastes 11:6). Rabbi Yehoshua said: If a poor person comes to you in the morning, give him charity, [and if another comes] in the evening, give him [as well], as you do not know for which of them the Holy One blessed be He will record about you, (You do not know which act will be recorded as a good deed by God. )  for this one or for that one, “or whether they both alike will be good.”  Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva, Rabbi Yishmael says: If you studied Torah in your youth, study Torah in your old age [as well], as you do not know which of them will endure, this one or that one, “or whether they both alike will be good.” Rabbi Akiva says: If you had students in your youth, procure students for yourself in your old age [as well], as you do not know which of them will endure, this one or that one, “or whether they both alike will be good.”  Rabbi Akiva had twelve thousand students from Akko to Antipatris (That is, from one end of the the land of Israel to the other.)  and they all died in one time period. Why? Because they were miserly (With their knowledge, not wishing to share it with the other students.)  toward one another. Ultimately, he produced seven [disciples]: Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Shimon, Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua, Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar, and Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov. Some say: Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yosei, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, Rabbi Ḥanina ben Ḥakhinai, and Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar. He said to them: ‘My sons, the previous students died only because they were miserly toward one another. See to it that you do not act in accordance with their actions.’ They arose and filled the entire Land of Israel with Torah knowledge.   Rabbi Dostai in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: If you had children in your youth, take a wife in your old age and produce [more] children. (This is another interpretation of the Ecclesiastes verse: “In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening do not rest your hand.”)  From whom do you learn this? From Abraham, who had children in his youth, and took a wife in his old age and produced [more] children. That is what is written: “Abraham took another [wife]…”</p>

              <p>“And her name was Ketura” – Rav said: This is Hagar. Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: ‘But is it not written “[Abraham took] another [vayosef]”?’ He said to him: ‘[That means only that] he married her on the basis of a divine command, just as it says: “The Lord continued [vayosef] speaking to me again, saying”’ (Isaiah 8:5). He said to him: ‘But is it not written “and her name was Ketura”?’ He said to him: ‘That is because she was perfumed [mekuteret] with mitzvot and good deeds.’ [He said to him:] But is it not written: “And to the sons of the concubines (Plural. If Hagar and Ketura were one and the same, Abraham would have had only one concubine.)  of Abraham [Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was still alive…]”?’ (Genesis 25:6). He said to him: ‘Pilagsham (The omission of the yud intimates that the word could be interpreted as a single concubine.)  is written. “While he was still alive [ḥai]” – [this alludes to Hagar] the one who had sat by the well and said to the One who lives [ḥai] forever: See my misery.’  Rabbi Berekhya said: Even though it says: “She [Hagar] went off and wandered in the wilderness…” (Genesis 21:14), lest you say that perhaps some person was suspected [of becoming immorally involved] with her, the verse states: “And her name was Ketura” – from the word ‘bound up’ [ketar]; she was like one who seals a treasure and takes it out bound and sealed. (Her name indicates that she was chaste after leaving Abraham.)   Bar Kappara said: Additions [tosafto] that are granted by the Holy One blessed be He are even greater than the original item. Cain was the original son [of Eve], and Abel, because he was considered an addition, as it is written: “She continued [vatosef] giving birth…[to Abel]” (Genesis 4:2) – he was born with his two twin sisters. (Whereas Cain was born with just one twin sister (see Bereshit Rabba 22:2).)    Joseph was the original son [of Rachel], and Benjamin, because addition is written in his regard, (See Genesis 30:24.)  he produced ten children, as it is written: “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Bekher…” (Genesis 46:21).   Er was the original son [of Judah], and Shela, because an expression of addition is used for him, (See Genesis 38:5.)  he produced ten courts. That is what is written in Chronicles: “The sons of Shela son of Judah: Er, father (The term father in this passage refers to the head of a court.)  of Lekha; and Lada father of Maresha; and the families of the house of the craft of fine linen, of the house of Ashbe’a...” (I Chronicles 4:21–23).  Job’s age was originally (Before he began to suffer from his afflictions.)  only seventy years, and one hundred and forty years were added to his life, as it is written: “After this, Job lived for one hundred and forty years” (Job 42:16).  Hezekiah’s original reign (Before being reprimanded by Isaiah and praying for forgiveness (Isaiah 38:1–3).)  was only fourteen years, but fifteen years were added to it, as it is stated: “Behold, I am adding fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5).  Ishmael was the original son, and the sons of Ketura, because an expression of addition is used regarding them (Genesis 25:1.)  [the verse tells us] “She bore him Zimran…” (Genesis 25:2). (The verse goes on to list six children.) </p>

Rami bar Yeḥezkel said: Zimran – [he was called this] because they [his descendants] would “prune [mezamrin]” the world [of its inhabitants]; (They were fierce warriors and killed many people.)  Yokshan – because they acted with ferocity [mitkashin] in the world. The Rabbis said: Zimran – because they would sing praises [mezamrin] in idol worship; Yokshan – because they would bang [makshin] on the drum for idol worship.  “Yokshan begot Sheva and Dedan…[Ashurim, Letushim, and Le’umim]” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Although the Aramaic translators say [for these last three names]: Merchants, iron workers, and heads of nations, they were [in fact] all heads of nations.</p>

              <p>“The Lord, God of your fathers [shall add to you one thousand times as you are…]” (Deuteronomy 1:11) – Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov said: In considering Moses’s blessings, they contain [unlimited blessing] from one end of the world to the other. What is written? “One thousand times [pe’amim]” – “one thousand times [paam]” is not written here, but rather, “one thousand times [pe’amim].” (The plural term pe’amim is employed, rather than the singular paam. This is  expounded to mean one thousand times one thousand.)   Another matter, “shall add to you…as you are” – Rabbi Aḥa said: Israel could have said to him: ‘Our master Moses, are we responsible for any of the matters regarding which you are rebuking us?’ (They could have responded to him that he was rebuking them for the sins of their parents, for which they were not responsible (Etz Yosef). )  Nevertheless, they accepted his rebukes and were silent. (Translation based on the textual emendation suggested in Etz Yosef. )  That is why it says: “As you are” – righteous like you, who receive rebukes and are silent.  Another matter, why did he bless them with an expression of addition? It is because the addition of the Holy One, blessed be He, is larger than the principal. The way of the world is that a person takes from another a litra of meat, and says to him: ‘Add more for me.’ How much does he add for him? One ounce. But the Holy One blessed be He, His addition is larger than the principal. How so? Isaac was the principal son for Abraham. But what He added for [Abraham] was more numerous than the principal, as it is stated: “Abraham took an additional wife” (Genesis 25:1). (Abraham’s additional wife, Keturah, bore him six sons (see Genesis 25:2); many more than the one son, Isaac, who was his principal son. )   Joseph was the principal son for Rachel, Benjamin was an addition. From where is this derived? As it is written: “May the Lord add another son for me” (Genesis 30:24). What is written? “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Bekher, and Ashbel…” (Genesis 46:21) – they are more than Joseph. (Benjamin had ten sons, many more than Joseph, who had only two sons. )   Hezekiah’s principal reign was fourteen years. What the Holy One blessed be He added for him was more numerous than the principal. From where is this derived? As it is stated: “I will add fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5) – the addition of the Holy One blessed be He was more numerous than the principal. That is why [Moses] blessed them with an expression of addition.   “And He will bless you” (Deuteronomy 1:11) – Rabbi Levi said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who told the commander of his army to distribute to each of his soldiers a litra of gold. (There are one hundred gold pieces in a litra.)  He went and gave some of them five gold pieces and some of them ten gold pieces. They said to him: ‘The king told you to give each of us a litra of gold, and you gave each of us five gold pieces?’ He said to them: ‘These are from what is mine; when the king comes, he will give you from what is his.’ So Israel said to Moses: ‘The Holy One blessed be He did not set a limit for our blessings, and you said one thousand times?’ He said to them: ‘What I blessed you, I blessed you from my own; the Holy One blessed be He will bless you “as He spoke to you”’ (Deuteronomy 1:11).</p>

Eleazar: You learn from here that an addition of the Holy One is more than the original. (Below, 7:20; see Gen. R. 61:4.)  Abraham had previously sired no one but Isaac. When the Holy One made an addition for him, he made his addition &lt; even &gt; more, as stated (in Gen. 25:2): AND SHE BORE HIM &lt; ZIMRAN, JOKSHAN, MEDAN, MIDIAN, ISHBAK, AND SHUAH &gt;. Thus you find in the case of the first Adam that when &lt; Eve &gt; gave birth, she bore Cain (Gen. 4:1). Then afterwards (in Gen. 4:2): AND IN ADDITION SHE BORE &lt; HIS BROTHER ABEL &gt;. And so you find in the case of Rachel that she bore Joseph and said (in Gen. 30:24): MAY THE LORD ADD ANOTHER SON FOR ME. He added Benjamin for her and his twin sister. Where is it shown to be so? Here (in Gen. 35:17), &lt; where &gt; &quot;This is a son for you&quot; is not written, but FOR THIS ALSO IS A SON FOR YOU. And so you find in the case of King Hezekiah, all the days of his reign were fourteen years; but when the Holy One made an addition for him, he added fifteen years. (Is. 38:5; cf. II Kings 20:6:) SEE, I AM ADDING [FIFTEEN YEARS] TO YOUR LIFE. Now when the prophets saw that an addition of the Holy One was more than the original, they began to bless Israel with an addition. Moses said (in Deut. 1:11): MAY THE LORD [GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS] ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS A THOUSAND TIMES [MORE THAN YOU ARE]…. David said (in Ps. 115:14): MAY THE LORD ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS. Also in the world to come the Holy One has procured an addition (rt.: YSP) for his people, as stated (in Is. 11:11): AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY, THE LORD WILL EXTEND (rt.: YSP) HIS HAND A SECOND TIME &lt; TO PROCURE THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE &gt;.</p>

And if [a religious obligation] presents itself to you in the evening, DO NOT WITHHOLD YOUR HAND IN THE EVENING, BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH of them will endure for you, whether that of the morning, that of the evening, (ibid., cont.): OR WHETHER THEY BOTH [ARE EQUALLY GOOD].

(Eccl. 11:6:) BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH WILL SUCCEED. From whom do you learn &lt; this fact &gt;? From Abraham, who in his youth only sired one &lt; child &gt; but in his old age sired twelve. R.

Samuel the son of Nahman declared: Since there are three periods in each day, a man should pray three times every day—in the morning, when the sun is in the east; at noon, when the sun is at its zenith; and in the afternoon, when the sun is in the west. R. Joshua the son of Levi stated: Abraham established the morning prayer, as it is said: And Abraham arose early in the morning (Gen. 22:3); Isaac instituted the afternoon prayer, as it is said: And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide (ibid. 24:63); and Jacob introduced the evening prayer, as it is said: And he lighted upon the place and tarried there all night because the sun was setting (ibid. 28:1).</p>

              <p>And Abraham took another wife (Gen. 25:1). What is written previously concerning this matter? And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent (Gen. 24:67). You learn from this that if a man’s wife should die, leaving him sons, he should not remarry until his sons are betrothed. Only then should he remarry. Abraham did so. After Sarah’s death, he first betrothed Isaac and then took a wife for himself. Where do we learn this? It is written: Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and after: Abraham took another wife. Isaac said to himself: “I have taken a wife, but my father is without a wife.” What did Isaac do? He went and bought him (Abraham) a wife. Rabbi said: Hagar and Keturah were one and the same person. Why then was she called Keturah? Because she had been bound up (keshurah) like a water bag.

He came there at midday, and found there Ishmael's wife. He said to her: Where is Ishmael? She replied to him: He has gone with his mother to feed the camels in the desert. He said to her: Give me a little bread and water, for my soul is faint after the journey of the desert. She fetched it and gave it to him. Abraham arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, for his son, and (thereupon) Ishmael's house was filled with all good things of the various blessings. When Ishmael came (home) his wife told him what had happened, and Ishmael knew that his father's love was still extended to him, as it is said, || &quot;Like as a father pitieth his sons&quot; (Ps. 103:13). After the death of Sarah, Abraham again took (Hagar) his divorced (wife), as it is said, &quot;And Abraham again took a wife, and her name was Keturah&quot; (Gen. 25:1). Why does it say &quot;And he again&quot;? Because on the first occasion she was his wife, and he again betook himself to her.

              <p>The incense-offering is the mystical element which establishes the connection between the &quot;lower&quot; and the &quot;upper&quot; domains of this universe. Rashi also explains the word קטורת as identical with the alternate name of Hagar, i.e. קטורה, to mean that her deeds were comparable to an incense offering because she &quot;tied up&quot; her door [euphemism for her vagina Ed.] and did not remarry until Sarah had died and Abraham was free to marry her (Genesis 25,1). Our sages suggest that Nadav and Avihu entered the Holy of Holies in order to teach a lesson concerning the mystical dimension of the incense-offering. They wanted to demonstrate that G–d anxiously awaits the prayers of the righteous. All of these notions are alluded to in Psalms 141,2: תכון תפלתי קטורת לפניך, &quot;Take my prayer as an offering of incense before You.&quot; The subject of prayer teaches us the mystical dimension of the משפיע and the מושפע The latter prays with his eyes facing downwards while his heart is turned upwards toward G–d, the cause who turns His attention to what happens &quot;down&quot; here in our world. We in our hopes pour out our hearts heavenwards for He is the עילה, cause, whereas we are the עלולים, effects. </p>

              <p>For the son of this maidservant shall not inherit:  And [just] because he banished him, is it impossible for him to return for his inheritance after the death of his father? So it appears that it was speaking about the inheritance of his deeds. As Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she bore for Avraham, laughing with sexual immorality - from the angle that he was the son of Hagar the Egyptian, [as] she gave birth to one similar to herself. For it is known that the Egyptians are awash in licentiousness, as it is stated (Ezekiel 23:20), &quot;and whose issue was like that of horses&quot;; and their offspring are similar to them. Therefore Sarah said to banish him, so that Yitzchak would not learn from his deeds. But perhaps you will say, it is the opposite - maybe Yitzchak will change him and bring him back to the good! It is about this that she said, &quot;I knew it through prophecy that he will not inherit with my son from the good deeds of his father, Avraham.&quot; And hence the concern remained that Yitzchak would learn from him.

              <p>&quot;Be fruitful and multiply, etc.&quot; It is not far fetched to say that the reason the Torah exempted women from the mitzvah of Pru U'Rvu and obligated only men is because the laws of Hashem and His ways &quot;... are pleasant and all of his paths peaceful&quot; [Mishlei 3:17] and he did not amass on a Jewish person what the body can not tolerate.  Everything that is prohibited by the Torah there is a permitted alternative as detailed in [Tractate Hullin 8th chapter] &quot;Kal Habasar&quot;. Due to this principle there is only one day in the calendar th at we are [biblically]  obligated to not eat [Yom Kippur] and the preceding day [the 9th] we are warned and obligated TO eat. Similarly the Torah does not prevent marital relations from any creature besides for Moshe Rabenu because there was no one else as exalted and required such carefulness with his body as Moshe. Similarly, the during wartime when the [Jewish] army is successful and the passions run high  Hashem realized there is no way to stop the [soldiers wild] spirit as he desires the beautiful [captive] women [Deuteronomy 21:11] and the Torah allowed this women to the soldier [as outlined by Deuteronomy 21:11]. The Torah is only bending in response to evil inclinations and passions. This principle [of the Torahs ways are pleasant] became a corner stone of legal policy to our predecessors who established laws and exempted a Yibum who's children died after her husband died. Women endanger themselves in pregnancy and childbirth, that has been established as a legal principle that death is prevalent [see Tosfos Ketubot 83b]. As a result women are not commanded with the mitzvah of Pru U'Rvu. For the same reason a woman is allowed to drink a potion that makes her sterile [from having children] as Yehudit the wife of Rav Hiya [Yevamot 65b]. Women desire to have children is much stronger than men, as we see with Rachel who demanded from Jacob children &quot;or its as if I'm dead&quot;. This explains what Rav Yosef said in Tractate Yevamot [65b] that women are exempt from Pru U'Rvu. The verse states &quot;I am El-Shadai, Pre Urve&quot; [singular form] and it doesn't use the plural form Pru U'Rvu. Adam and Even who were commanded together with Pru U'Rvu were commanded before the first sin and at that time there was no pain associated with childbirth. Therefore it was a mitzvah for both Adam and Eve to Pru U'Rvu. After the sin when there is pain in childbirth and frequently can be dangerous and life threatening [its not longer a mitzvah for women]. We see that women are known to swear never to become pregnant again while in labor. Noah [after he left the arc] was commanded with Pru U'Rru [in the plural form, and this was after the first sin], however the Torah in the verses preceding the command its written in the Torah that G-d blessed Noah and his sons, whereas their wives are not mentioned, since they are not obligated in the command of Pru U'Rvu. By Jacob its written &quot;Pre Urve&quot; [Genesis 25:1] [in the singular form] which is accurate [way the command should have been addressed].

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Bamidbar 6:24:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>A Midrashic approach: The word יברכך implies being blessed with material wealth; the word וישמרך implies that the recipient is preserved so that he can perform G’d’s commandments as a result of the material wealth G’d has blessed him with. The words יאר ה' פניו אליך , mean that G’d may grant you the kind of children who are full of Torah knowledge. The Midrash bases this insight on Proverbs 6,25 כי נר מצוה ותורה אור, “for like a single candle lighting a narrow area is the performance of a single commandment, whereas the performance of the Torah in all its aspects provides great light.” Furthermore, the same words include the blessing that “from you will stem priests who in turn will illuminate the Altar in the Temple,” as it is written in Maleachi 1,10 ולא תאירו מזבחי חנם, “you will not light up My Altar without recompense.” We have another verse supporting this point in Leviticus 6,5 where the Torah writes: “and the fire on the Altar will never be extinguished.”   Concerning the precise meaning here of the word ויחונך, Rabbi Chiyah the great taught that it means that the Lord will make His camp near you (from the root חנה). Another approach holds that the word promises that G’d will make prophets descend from your loins; that school of thought bases itself on the verse in Zecharyah 12,10 ושפכתי על בית דוד ועל יושבי ירושלים רוח חן ותחנונים, “I will pour out over the house of David and over the people of Jerusalem a spirit of pity and compassion.” These are the ingredients which we think of when we think of prophets. Still another approach sees in the word ויחונך a reference to grace in the sense of being held in esteem, being appreciated. The word appears in that meaning in Esther 2,17 where we are told that all who saw Esther, including the king, immediately formed this positive opinion of her.  On the final verse, ישא ה' פניו אליך וישם לך שלום, “may the Lord raise His countenance toward you and grant you peace,” we must compare the meaning of this expression to Deut. 10,17 אשר לא ישא פנים ולא יקח שוחד, “Who does not play favourites nor accept bribes.” How can we reconcile these two apparently contradictory concepts of asking the very same G’d whom we applaud for not playing favorites in Deut. 10,17 to play favourites with the entire Jewish people in the priestly blessing formulated by the same G’d? [The word ישא has to be translated then as “will forgive.” Ed.] If the victim of an unfavorable decree has repented before the decree has been sealed his repentance is effective. If not, such as in Deut. 17,10 it is not.   A second approach to the first verse. The word יברכך implies being blessed with sons, the word וישמרך implies being blessed with daughters who require additional protection and safeguarding on the part of their parents. This is reflected in the promise in Psalms 121,5 ה' שומרך, ה' צלך על יד ימינך, ”the Lord is your guardian; the Lord is your protection, at your right hand.”  The verse יאר ה' פניך אליך describes the element life which is associated with light, such as in באור פני מלך חיים, “in the light of the king’s face there is life” (Proverbs 16,15). The word appears in a similar connotation in Psalms 67,2 אל-הים יחננו ויברכנו יאר פניו אתנו סלה, ”May G’d be gracious to us and bless us; may He illuminate us with His face, Selah.”  Concerning the last verse of the blessing(s)ישא ה' פניו אליך , this means that “in every direction you turn may G’d arrange for you to find peace and harmony and be protected from all unpleasant happenings.” This is a form of G’d’s personal benevolent supervision of our fates generally referred to as השגחה פרטית. We find the reverse of this threatened by G’d as part of threats of the prophet Isaiah when he quoted G’d as saying: “I am going to turn My watchful eye away from you (G’d refusing to hear our prayers)” (Isaiah 1,15).  In Berachot 20, the sages derive from the wording ישא ה' פניו אליך that although when you look at this verse superficially you get the impression that it contradicts the verse where G’d says that He does not play favorites, using the word לא אשא פנים this way is misleading. All that is meant is that G’d will lift our countenances, i.e. respond to our first having raised our face to Him in prayer and supplication. This is not what is called “playing favorites,” i.e. using double standards. This idea is even reflected in the text of the Torah. We read in Deut. 8,10: “you will eat and be satisfied and you will bless the Lord your G’d.” Assume that father, mother, and children assemble around the family table to consume their daily meal and they find that there is not enough to sate even one of them, never mind all of them. They will turn their faces to G’d, and each one will hold back and help himself to a minimum making sure there will be enough to go around. When G’d observes such conduct, He will most certainly be affected by it and make sure that in the future this family will not be lacking for anything. This is also the deeper meaning behind the famous line in Song of Songs 3,7 that Solomon’s bed was watched over by 60 guards. Did then Solomon need these guards? Was he in danger of attacks by assassins, by terrorists? What is meant by these words is that the priestly blessing which comprises 60 letters was engraved on the edge of Solomon’s bed.  Another explanation of this line in Song of Songs: the bed mentioned in Song of Songs is not that of King Solomon at all. It is the “bed” of He who owns peace, i.e. G’d. The “bed” is the Holy Temple; The reason the Temple is compared to a bed is that just as the function of the bed is for those on it to practice the commandment of increasing the human population of the world, so it was a propensity of all the furnishings in the Temple to increase and multiply. We have a glimmer of this in Kings I 8,8: “the staves (attached to the Holy Ark) were growing longer so that they would wind up being visible in the Sanctuary in front of the Shrine. A verse indicating something similar is found in Chronicles II 3,6 where Ezra describes the gold of the Temple as זהב פרוים, understood to mean “gold which had the capacity to multiply, which produced fruit.” A third scriptural verse which at least alludes to this phenomenon as far as the materials used for the Temple is concerned is found in Kings I 7,2 where the entire Temple is described as בית יער הלבנון, &quot;The Lebanon Forest House,” suggesting that just as a forest and its trees keep growing, so the Temple would keep expanding. The next words in that verse in Song of Songs, i.e. כלם אחוזי חרב, “all of them trained in warfare, i.e. “swordsmen,” refer to names of the Lord. The words following i.e. איש חרבו על ירכו, “each one with his sword on his loins”, beg the question what the ירך, the seat of a man's semen has to do in this verse. The answer is that these words describe that even if Solomon (symbol of the Jewish people) had frightening dreams at night, dreams during which he (they) felt in immediate danger, thanks to the encouragement derived by the proximity of all these names of G’d the people would rouse themselves in the morning, go to the Synagogue, and shake off any fear experienced during the night in a nightmare. They would find the effects of the dream dissolve without any further ado. In order to provide the Jewish people in the desert with this remedy, G’d instructed Aaron and his sons to bless the people in the way the Torah specified. G’d said: “in the past when I needed to extend a blessing to My creatures I would bless Adam and Chavah, as we know from Genesis 1,28 ‘G’d blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply etc.’” G’d blessed Noach when the latter was in need of such as blessing as we know from Genesis 9,1: “G’d blessed Noach and his sons.” He blessed Avraham as we know from Genesis 25,1: “G’d had blessed Avraham with everything.” From Avraham’s time on, G’d changed His mode of administering blessings directly and assigned the task to Avraham saying to him: “become a source of blessing” (Genesis 12,2). Avraham responded by siring two sons, Ishmael and Yitzchak. Avraham failed to bless either of them. In order to understand Avraham’s failure to bless either one of his sons, let us illustrate this by means of a parable. A king who owned an orchard entrusted it to a profit-sharing farmer to look after it. The orchard in question contained within it right in the center two trees, one of which contained the elixir of life whereas the second one contained a poison which would kill. The farmer was in a quandary, saying to himself that if he watered both trees he would further the growth of the deadly tree. If, on the other hand, he did not water either tree he would cause the elixir of life to die out. He decided to serve out his contract and to leave the decision of what to do to the king, the owner, after he himself had bowed out of the picture. The “king” in the parable is G’d. The “orchard” is earth. The “farmer” is Avraham, and the two trees, the elixir of life and the poisonous one, are Yitzchak and Ishmael respectively. Avraham said to himself: “if I bless Yitzchak, Ishmael will demand to be blessed also. Seeing that he is wicked, I cannot do that. I prefer to pass and not exercise my discretion. After all, I am only flesh and blood, not all-knowing like the Lord.” What happened? After Avraham had died we find that the Torah records that G’d bestowed the blessing He had first given to Avraham on his son Yitzchak after his father had died (Genesis 25,11). Yitzchak in turn blessed Yaakov. Yaakov blessed all his twelve sons as we read in Genesis 49,28 “all these (aforementioned ones) are the twelve tribes of Israel and this is what he had said to them when he blessed them.” From that point on, G’d said to Moses: “the blessings are at your (Israel collectively) disposal. The priests shall be the ones to administer them (Based on Tanchuma Nasso 9).</p>

Moreover, the rabbis suggest that this new name is meant to allude to her elevated behavior. (The name Ketura is understood to be a derivative of the Hebrew word ketoret, sweet-smelling incense.)  Granted, our sages also suggest that she strayed and worshiped idols once she left Avraham’s house (Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 30). Nonetheless, in the cultural context of the times, this should not come as a surprise. (It has been suggested that the same fate met the “converts” of Avraham and Sarah once they left the couple’s inspiring presence.) Consequently, whether or not we accept that Ketura was Hagar according to the simple reading of the text, (Rashi accepts this to be the simple meaning of Bereshit 25:1, while Rashbam and Ibn Ezra do not.)  it is clear that Hagar is far from being a Biblical villainess.</p>

They said to Rabbi Tarfon: It is written: “Keturah” (Genesis 25:1), not Yoḥani. Rabbi Tarfon read, i.e., said, about them the phrase “the children of Keturah” as they were able to contribute only this small piece of information.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>In mysticism, the different colors along the spectrum symbolize different Divine attributes. (See further Meditation and Kabbalah, pgs. 179-183.)  The color white symbolizes chesed, unbridled generosity and love. The color red represents din, “harsh justice.” Mitzvos aseh require us to take actions; we must extend ourselves to express our love for God. What we do is the basis of who we are; thus our deeds provide added life to the white bones, the body part that frames a person’s form and shape. Mitzvos lo ta’aseh are injunctions, forbidding acts that are injurious to our spiritual well-being. Observance of these laws entails constriction, pulling oneself in, and refraining from what our sensory urges seek. Scrupulous adherence to the commands of Mitzvos lo ta’aseh is thus an exhibition of din—fear and justice—setting boundaries and rigorously maintaining them. (Our forefather Abraham was the ultimate paradigm of chesed, Heavenly giving and love. Abraham even sought to perform kindness with idolators and the sinners of Sodom (see Parashas Vayeira). Since mitzvos aseh are expression of giving, extending oneself for God’s sake, Abraham is the personification of mitzvos aseh. The gematria of Avraham (1+2+200+5+40) is 248, which is the number of mitzvos aseh. Isaac was the paradigm of din (sometimes called gevurah), setting limits and constriction. Isaac’s greatest moment was when he allowed himself to be bound on the altar, an act of remarkable discipline and withdrawal. Isaac is the personification of mitzvos lo ta’aseh. As a result, when God first appeared to him and gave Isaac a Mitzvah to live in the Land of Israel, it was phrased as a prohibition, “Do not go down to Egypt, stay in this land…” (Gen. 25:2). (Emunas Etecha, Lech Lecha, 5759.))  The goal of Mitzvos lo ta’aseh is to preserve the spiritual well-being of the person; thus they parallel sinews that tie the muscles to the bones and maintain the person. (The nefesh part of the soul is the part that has 613 “pieces” that correspond to the various body parts. See also Maharal in Tiferes Yisrael, Chapter Four. Rabbi Chaim Vital in Sha’arei Kedushah, Sha’ar 1. Da’as Tefillah, pgs. 97-98, Razei Ha-Bosem, pg. 154.) </p>

            <summary>In Bereshit Rabbah 47:2, the text discusses God's blessings to Sarah, indicating two blessings - one for a son and one for the ability to nurse. In Shemot Rabbah 30:3, the commentary explains how the use of &quot;ve'eleh&quot; and &quot;eleh&quot; in the Torah adds or rejects previous matters. In Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Chayei Sara 10:1, the text relates Abraham's additional wife, Ketura, to the concept of God's additions being greater than the original. Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 30:8 gives examples of additions being greater than the original, such as additional sons for Rachel and Joseph. Bereshit Rabbah 61:5 discusses the names and characteristics of the descendants of Abraham. Devarim Rabbah 1:13 explores the concept of God's blessings being greater than what is expected, using examples like the additional sons given to Rachel and the extension of Hezekiah's reign.</summary>

              <p>“I will bless her, and I will also give you a son from her; I will bless her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples will be from her” (Genesis 17:16).  “I will bless her, and I will also give you a son from her; [I will bless her…]” (The verse indicates that God gave her two blessings.)  – Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: I will bless her by giving her a son, and I will bless her with the blessing of milk. (The blessing was that despite her old age she would be able to nurse her son.)  Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: Was she already given tidings regarding milk? Why, she was not even pregnant yet. Rather, it teaches that the Holy One blessed be He restored her body to the days of her youth. Rabbi Abahu in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina: [God said:] ‘I will impose fear of her over all the idolaters so that they will not torment her and call her the barren woman.’  Rabbi Yudan in the name of Reish Lakish: She did not even have a womb, and the Holy One blessed be He now carved out a womb for her.  “Kings of peoples will be from her” – Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: From here Abraham expounded when he remarried Ketura. (The midrash identifies Ketura as Hagar. Sarah had said that she regarded Hagar’s children as her own (Genesis 16:2). This verse foretells that Sarah would become the forebear of “Kings of peoples,” and it was to fulfill this prophecy that Abraham remarried Ketura-Hagar and fathered six children from her (Genesis 25:1–2).) </p>

              <p>“And her name was Ketura” – Rav said: This is Hagar. Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: ‘But is it not written “[Abraham took] another [vayosef]”?’ He said to him: ‘[That means only that] he married her on the basis of a divine command, just as it says: “The Lord continued [vayosef] speaking to me again, saying”’ (Isaiah 8:5). He said to him: ‘But is it not written “and her name was Ketura”?’ He said to him: ‘That is because she was perfumed [mekuteret] with mitzvot and good deeds.’ [He said to him:] But is it not written: “And to the sons of the concubines (Plural. If Hagar and Ketura were one and the same, Abraham would have had only one concubine.)  of Abraham [Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was still alive…]”?’ (Genesis 25:6). He said to him: ‘Pilagsham (The omission of the yud intimates that the word could be interpreted as a single concubine.)  is written. “While he was still alive [ḥai]” – [this alludes to Hagar] the one who had sat by the well and said to the One who lives [ḥai] forever: See my misery.’  Rabbi Berekhya said: Even though it says: “She [Hagar] went off and wandered in the wilderness…” (Genesis 21:14), lest you say that perhaps some person was suspected [of becoming immorally involved] with her, the verse states: “And her name was Ketura” – from the word ‘bound up’ [ketar]; she was like one who seals a treasure and takes it out bound and sealed. (Her name indicates that she was chaste after leaving Abraham.)   Bar Kappara said: Additions [tosafto] that are granted by the Holy One blessed be He are even greater than the original item. Cain was the original son [of Eve], and Abel, because he was considered an addition, as it is written: “She continued [vatosef] giving birth…[to Abel]” (Genesis 4:2) – he was born with his two twin sisters. (Whereas Cain was born with just one twin sister (see Bereshit Rabba 22:2).)    Joseph was the original son [of Rachel], and Benjamin, because addition is written in his regard, (See Genesis 30:24.)  he produced ten children, as it is written: “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Bekher…” (Genesis 46:21).   Er was the original son [of Judah], and Shela, because an expression of addition is used for him, (See Genesis 38:5.)  he produced ten courts. That is what is written in Chronicles: “The sons of Shela son of Judah: Er, father (The term father in this passage refers to the head of a court.)  of Lekha; and Lada father of Maresha; and the families of the house of the craft of fine linen, of the house of Ashbe’a...” (I Chronicles 4:21–23).  Job’s age was originally (Before he began to suffer from his afflictions.)  only seventy years, and one hundred and forty years were added to his life, as it is written: “After this, Job lived for one hundred and forty years” (Job 42:16).  Hezekiah’s original reign (Before being reprimanded by Isaiah and praying for forgiveness (Isaiah 38:1–3).)  was only fourteen years, but fifteen years were added to it, as it is stated: “Behold, I am adding fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5).  Ishmael was the original son, and the sons of Ketura, because an expression of addition is used regarding them (Genesis 25:1.)  [the verse tells us] “She bore him Zimran…” (Genesis 25:2). (The verse goes on to list six children.) </p>

Rami bar Yeḥezkel said: Zimran – [he was called this] because they [his descendants] would “prune [mezamrin]” the world [of its inhabitants]; (They were fierce warriors and killed many people.)  Yokshan – because they acted with ferocity [mitkashin] in the world. The Rabbis said: Zimran – because they would sing praises [mezamrin] in idol worship; Yokshan – because they would bang [makshin] on the drum for idol worship.  “Yokshan begot Sheva and Dedan…[Ashurim, Letushim, and Le’umim]” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Although the Aramaic translators say [for these last three names]: Merchants, iron workers, and heads of nations, they were [in fact] all heads of nations.</p>

              <p>“The Lord, God of your fathers [shall add to you one thousand times as you are…]” (Deuteronomy 1:11) – Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov said: In considering Moses’s blessings, they contain [unlimited blessing] from one end of the world to the other. What is written? “One thousand times [pe’amim]” – “one thousand times [paam]” is not written here, but rather, “one thousand times [pe’amim].” (The plural term pe’amim is employed, rather than the singular paam. This is  expounded to mean one thousand times one thousand.)   Another matter, “shall add to you…as you are” – Rabbi Aḥa said: Israel could have said to him: ‘Our master Moses, are we responsible for any of the matters regarding which you are rebuking us?’ (They could have responded to him that he was rebuking them for the sins of their parents, for which they were not responsible (Etz Yosef). )  Nevertheless, they accepted his rebukes and were silent. (Translation based on the textual emendation suggested in Etz Yosef. )  That is why it says: “As you are” – righteous like you, who receive rebukes and are silent.  Another matter, why did he bless them with an expression of addition? It is because the addition of the Holy One, blessed be He, is larger than the principal. The way of the world is that a person takes from another a litra of meat, and says to him: ‘Add more for me.’ How much does he add for him? One ounce. But the Holy One blessed be He, His addition is larger than the principal. How so? Isaac was the principal son for Abraham. But what He added for [Abraham] was more numerous than the principal, as it is stated: “Abraham took an additional wife” (Genesis 25:1). (Abraham’s additional wife, Keturah, bore him six sons (see Genesis 25:2); many more than the one son, Isaac, who was his principal son. )   Joseph was the principal son for Rachel, Benjamin was an addition. From where is this derived? As it is written: “May the Lord add another son for me” (Genesis 30:24). What is written? “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Bekher, and Ashbel…” (Genesis 46:21) – they are more than Joseph. (Benjamin had ten sons, many more than Joseph, who had only two sons. )   Hezekiah’s principal reign was fourteen years. What the Holy One blessed be He added for him was more numerous than the principal. From where is this derived? As it is stated: “I will add fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5) – the addition of the Holy One blessed be He was more numerous than the principal. That is why [Moses] blessed them with an expression of addition.   “And He will bless you” (Deuteronomy 1:11) – Rabbi Levi said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who told the commander of his army to distribute to each of his soldiers a litra of gold. (There are one hundred gold pieces in a litra.)  He went and gave some of them five gold pieces and some of them ten gold pieces. They said to him: ‘The king told you to give each of us a litra of gold, and you gave each of us five gold pieces?’ He said to them: ‘These are from what is mine; when the king comes, he will give you from what is his.’ So Israel said to Moses: ‘The Holy One blessed be He did not set a limit for our blessings, and you said one thousand times?’ He said to them: ‘What I blessed you, I blessed you from my own; the Holy One blessed be He will bless you “as He spoke to you”’ (Deuteronomy 1:11).</p>

              <p>(Gen. 25:1:) THEN ABRAHAM TOOK AN ADDITIONAL (Again the translation of the verse has been changed to fit the midrashic context.)  WIFE. This text is related (to Job 8:7): THOUGH YOUR BEGINNING WAS TRIFLING, YOUR END SHALL GREATLY FLOURISH. R. Simeon ben Laqish said in the name of R. Eleazar: You learn from here that an addition of the Holy One is more than the original. (Below, 7:20; see Gen. R. 61:4.)  Abraham had previously sired no one but Isaac. When the Holy One made an addition for him, he made his addition &lt; even &gt; more, as stated (in Gen. 25:2): AND SHE BORE HIM &lt; ZIMRAN, JOKSHAN, MEDAN, MIDIAN, ISHBAK, AND SHUAH &gt;. Thus you find in the case of the first Adam that when &lt; Eve &gt; gave birth, she bore Cain (Gen. 4:1). Then afterwards (in Gen. 4:2): AND IN ADDITION SHE BORE &lt; HIS BROTHER ABEL &gt;. And so you find in the case of Rachel that she bore Joseph and said (in Gen. 30:24): MAY THE LORD ADD ANOTHER SON FOR ME. He added Benjamin for her and his twin sister. Where is it shown to be so? Here (in Gen. 35:17), &lt; where &gt; &quot;This is a son for you&quot; is not written, but FOR THIS ALSO IS A SON FOR YOU. And so you find in the case of King Hezekiah, all the days of his reign were fourteen years; but when the Holy One made an addition for him, he added fifteen years. (Is. 38:5; cf. II Kings 20:6:) SEE, I AM ADDING [FIFTEEN YEARS] TO YOUR LIFE. Now when the prophets saw that an addition of the Holy One was more than the original, they began to bless Israel with an addition. Moses said (in Deut. 1:11): MAY THE LORD [GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS] ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS A THOUSAND TIMES [MORE THAN YOU ARE]…. David said (in Ps. 115:14): MAY THE LORD ADD TO YOUR NUMBERS. Also in the world to come the Holy One has procured an addition (rt.: YSP) for his people, as stated (in Is. 11:11): AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT DAY, THE LORD WILL EXTEND (rt.: YSP) HIS HAND A SECOND TIME &lt; TO PROCURE THE REST OF HIS PEOPLE &gt;.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>(Gen. 25:19:) THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISAAC BEN ABRAHAM. (Except for most of the last section (# 24), Toledot is not found in Buber’s Oxford MS. Buber has filled in the gap mostly from Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34.)  This text is related (to Prov. 17:6): GRANDCHILDREN ARE A CROWN FOR ELDERS, AND THE GLORY OF CHILDREN IS THEIR PARENTS. (Cf. Gen. R. 63:2; Tanh., Gen. 6:4.)  Who caused Abraham to be magnified? Jacob, as stated (in Is. 29:22): THUS SAYS THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF JACOB, WHICH REDEEMED ABRAHAM. Why? Because, if one is meritorious as a Torah scholar together with his son and his grandson, it will never again be cut off from him. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:9f.): AND MAKE THEM (the statutes and ordinances) KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AS ON THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD &lt; BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT HOREB &gt;. Just as the gift of &lt; the &gt; Torah did not become cease on the day it was given; so for one who teaches his son and his grandson Torah, it shall never again depart from him. And so it was when the Holy One saw Abraham was busy with the Torah. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): BECAUSE ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE &lt; AND KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY LAWS &gt;. It is also written (above, in 18:19): FOR I HAVE KNOWN HIM. Then Jacob arose up and did not move from the Torah, as stated (in Gen. 25:27): BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN WHO SAT IN THE TENTS (i.e., in the academies). (For this interpretation, see Gen. R. 63:10; Targum Onqelos, Gen. 25:27; PRK 5:7.)  What stipulation did the Holy One make with them? (According to Josh. 1:8:) &lt; THIS &gt; BOOK OF THE LAW SHALL NOT DEPART &lt; FROM YOUR MOUTH &gt;…. It is also written (in Prov. 10:1): A WISE SON SHALL MAKE A FATHER GLAD. This is Isaac, since it is stated (in Gen. 21:12): FOR IN ISAAC SHALL YOUR SEED BE NAMED. (Prov. 10:1, cont.:) BUT A FOOLISH SON. This is Ishmael. Thus it is written (in Gen. 25:12): NOW THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISHMAEL BEN ABRAHAM. There are children who suffer disgrace through their parents. Josiah suffered disgrace through his father, as stated (in II Chron. 33:23): FOR AMON INCURRED A LOT OF GUILT. Hezekiah suffered disgrace through &lt; his father &gt; Ahaz, as stated (in Is. 8:16): BIND UP THE TESTIMONY. (According to Gen. R. 42:3; Lev. R. 11:7; Ruth R., proem 7; and Esther R., proem 11, this verse alludes to Ahaz, who had seized (ahaz) the synagogues and the academies.)  There are also parents who suffer disgrace through their children. Eli suffered disgrace through his sons, [as stated (in I Sam. 2:12): NOW ELI'S SONS WERE SCOUNDRELS. And Samuel also suffered disgrace through his sons], as stated (in I Sam. 8:3): BUT HIS SONS DID NOT WALK IN HIS WAYS. It did not, however, turn out in this way for Abraham. Instead he was magnified through Isaac, as stated (in Gen. 25:19, cont.): ABRAHAM SIRED ISAAC. Did he sire no one but Isaac? Now look, it is written {(in Gen. 25:19): THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISHMAEL.} [(in Gen. 16:15): SO HAGAR BORE A SON TO ABRAM.] And in addition &lt; there are &gt; the sons of Keturah: Zimran and Jokshan, &lt; etc. &gt; (cf. Gen. 25:2). But it does not say that Abraham sired anyone but Isaac, simply because Isaac was righteous. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 25:19): ABRAHAM SIRED ISAAC.</p>

              <p>Another matter, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances,” Rabbi Abahu said: Every place where ve’eleh is written, it adds to the previous matter, and every place that eleh is written it rejects the previous matter. How so? “This is [eleh] the legacy of the heavens and the earth on the day that they were created” (Genesis 2:4). What did it reject? He had been creating heavens and earth and examining them. They were not pleasing to Him, and He would restore them to emptiness and disorder. When He saw this heavens and earth, they were pleasing to Him. He said: “This is the legacy of the heavens and the earth,” but what came before was not a legacy.  Similarly, “this is [eleh] the legacy of Noah” (Genesis 6:9). What did it reject? It rejected the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and Keinan and his counterparts. Therefore it says: “The sons of Yefet, Gomer and Magog” (Genesis 10:2). (The Torah enters into great detail when enumerating the descendants of Noah, but not with the preceding generations.)   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:12), adds to the previous matter. Who are they? What is written beforehand, as it is stated: “She bore him (Ketura bore for Abraham.)  Zimran and Yokshan” (Genesis 25:2). Here, too, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham…the firstborn of Ishmael is Nevayot” (Genesis 25:12–13). They were wicked like them. (The sons of Ishmael were wicked like the sons of Ketura. )   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy [toledot] of Isaac son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:19) adds to the previous matter, to what was written beforehand: “The sons of Ishmael” (Genesis 25:16). Who was it? It was Esau and his sons, for he was a son of Isaac. If so, it may be said that since only “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy” is written, Jacob, too, who was part of the legacy of Isaac, is included with Esau? You find that every [time the word] toledot appears in the Bible it is written defectively, (It is written without a vav between the tav and lamed or without a vav between the dalet  and the tav.)  except for: “This is the legacy [toledot] of the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 2:4), and “this is the legacy [toledot] of Peretz” (Ruth 4:18). And there is a compelling reason why it says: “This is the legacy [toledot] of the heavens and the earth” in full. It is because the Holy One blessed be He created His world and there was no angel of death in the world. That is why it is complete. When Adam and Eve sinned, the Holy One blessed be He minimized all the toledot in the Bible. When Peretz arose, his toledot became full, because the Messiah will emerge from him, in whose days the Holy One blessed be He will eliminate death, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8). That is the reason that toledot of the heavens and earth and toledot of Peretz are full. This is the reason that toledot of Isaac is defective, to exclude Jacob from the category of the wicked. (The Messiah can also be traced back to Jacob, and therefore the word toledot should have been written regarding Isaac with the vav. It is written without the vav as an indication that it is referring only to Esau and not to Jacob. )   Similarly, “this is [eleh] the legacy of Jacob” (Genesis 37:2), it rejected the chieftains of Esau.  Similarly, “these are [ve’eleh] the names of the children of Israel” (Exodus 1:1), adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: The children of Reuben and the children of Simeon. (This is a reference to the listing of the descendants of Jacob who came down to Egypt (see Genesis 46:8–27). )   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Aaron” (Numbers 3:1) adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: “These are the counted, that Moses and Aaron…counted” (Numbers 1:44). Just like those beforehand were righteous, so, too, these were righteous. (Although the verses regarding Aaron proceed to list Nadav and Avihu, who were killed due to the offering of a strange fire before God (see Numbers 3:2–4), on the whole they were still considered righteous. )   Here, too, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances” adds to the previous matter, that which was written beforehand: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances” (Exodus 15:25).  Another matter, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances.” What is written before this portion? “They shall judge the people at all times” (Exodus 18:22). And it says here: “These are the ordinances,” and the [Ten] Commandments are in the middle. This is analogous to a noblewoman who was walking, an armed guard on this side and an armed guard on that side, and she was in the middle. So, too, the [giving of the] Torah had justice before it and justice after it and it was in the middle. Likewise it says: “I walk on the path of righteousness” (Proverbs 8:20). The Torah says: In which path do I walk? I will walk in the path of those who perform righteousness. “In the midst of the paths of justice” (Proverbs 8:20), the Torah in the middle and justice before it and after it; before it, as it is stated: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances,” justice after it, as it is stated: “These are the ordinances.”</p>

            <summary>Rabbeinu Bahya explains that Yitro's mixed feelings towards the Egyptians were due to his ancestry and connections to both the Egyptians and the descendants of Avraham and Keturah, as well as the popular saying that a convert shows sensitivity towards his former co-religionists for ten generations. Da'at Zekenim clarifies the sequence of events in the sale of Joseph, involving the Ishmaelites, Midianites, and Medonites, all descendants of Avraham and Keturah, and explains why Potiphar bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites. Chizkuni discusses the interpretation of Moses marrying a Kushite woman, suggesting that she may have been a queen from Kush, not Tzipporah, and emphasizes the cursed lineage of the Kushites and Midianites, despite their connection to Avraham and Keturah.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>על אודות האשה הכושית, they wondered why Moses had chosen this point in time to separate from Tzipporah and concluded that it was because she was a Negress (ugly), and they could not understand that he had married her in the first place seeing that she had always been a Negress. A different interpretation of this line: She had been a queen in her land, the land of Kush. This would fit with what we have read in Chronicles that Moses had been a King in that land. At the time, he had to marry a local woman. Now there was no need for him to remain married to a Kushite woman. If this were correct, our verse would not refer to Tzipporah, for the line: “for he had married a Kushite woman,” would not make any sense as Tzipporah was a Midianite woman as we know from Exodus 2,21. The Kushites were descended from Cham, the third son of Noach, and as such were a cursed people, and a Jew would not have married a woman from a cursed nation [although, Keturah, Avraham’s second and last wife, was an Egyptian and therefore also from a cursed nation, as Mitzrayim was the second son of Cham, Kush having been his firstborn (Genesis 10,6) Midian himself was a son of Keturah an Egyptian (Genesis 25,2), and therefore descendant of a cursed nation.

              </summary>
              <p>וימכרו את יוסף לישמעלים, “they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites. According to Rashi, the subject here are the brothers, who sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites, whereupon the latter sold him to the Midianites who in turn sold him to the Egyptians. If so, we must understand the whole paragraph as follows: They (the brothers who had sat down to eat but had not eaten yet) raised their eyes (verse 25) and they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites approaching, (from the east travelling south) while at the same time Midianite merchants arrived at the pit from a different direction who (eventually) hauled Joseph out of the pit. (verse 28) [Remember the brothers had sat down for lunch some distance from the pit so that they would not hear Joseph’s cries. Ed.] These Midianites sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver. The reason why the Torah mentions this at this stage is that we should not wonder when the Torah in verse 36 reports that the Medanim had sold Joseph already some time previously to the Egyptians. The individual Egyptian who purchased Joseph was Potiphar. Most of this had taken place while the brothers had still argued among themselves if to sell him to the Ishmaelites. They had been pre-empted in the meantime by the Midianites. The Midianites in the meantime had become witnesses to the discussions among Joseph’s brothers and had bought Joseph subsequently from the Ishmaelites. They were certain that Joseph had been hauled up from the pit in order that he could be sold to them. There were two separate groups of people, some called Medanim, and the others Midianim. The Ishmaelites who were traveling in the direction of Egypt, were the ones who sold Joseph to Potiphar once they had arrived in Egypt. If you were to say why does the Torah write in verse 36 the Medanim had sold him to Egypt, so that eventually he was sold to Potiphar, etc.? We would have expected the subject in that verse to have been the Midianites! Rash’bam in his commentary on the Chumash claims that the three people mentioned in this story, i.e. the Ishmaelites, Midianites, and Medonites, were all members of the same people though not of the same tribe. Their founder fathers were all brothers from the same mother and father Avraham-Keturah (Hagar), as we know (assuming that Keturah was identical with Hagar) (Compare Genesis 25,2) The query mentioned above was already raised by Rashi, (verse 3) we quote him (the Midrash which he quotes) literally: the word פסים in the garment described as כתונת פסים, contains a hint of future problems, being sold four times, Joseph would endure. The letter פ refers to Potiphar to whom he had been sold. The letter ס refers to the סוחרים, the merchants (verse 28) the letter י to the Ishmaelites, and the letter ם to the Medonites. The problem with the Midrash is that only three sales have been reported in the Torah. In view of this difficulty I suggest the following: concerning the line (verse 25) ‘they raised their eyes and here there was approaching a caravan of Ishmaelites, etc.;” this happened while the brothers were discussing among themselves how to proceed from there. They hit on the idea of selling Joseph to the members of that caravan. Before the caravan of |shmaelites had even reached them, another group of Midianite merchants had passed the pit from the opposite direction and hearing his cries, sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites before even having raised him from the pit, for the measly amount of 20 pieces of silver. They then hauled Joseph from the pit alive. The Ishmaelites sold him to the Medonites, and these in turn sold him to Potiphar. So we do have four separate sales. When the Torah wrote in Genesis 39,1 that Potiphar acquired him from the Ishmaelites, this is quite correct as when Potiphar set eyes on him he looked very handsome, and he reasoned that “negroes do not sell whites, whereas whites sell negroes;” in other words, he considered it unlikely that the Medonites had come by Joseph legally, and he wanted reassurance that he did not buy someone who had been kidnapped. The |shmaelites who had sold him to the Medonites gave Potiphar a guarantee that everything was completely legal. (B’reshit Rabbah 86,3)</p>

              </summary>
              <p>The Midrash (Sanhedrin 94) views Yitro’s reaction as expressed by the word ויחד somewhat differently, understanding the root of the word as חדד. Accordingly, Yitro had mixed feelings which expressed themselves in goose-flesh at the news of what had overtaken the Egyptians at the Sea of Reeds. The Talmud says that his reaction reflects the truth of the popular saying that a convert displays some sensitivity concerning what befalls his former co-religionists until the tenth generation. Yitro was a tenth generation descendant of Mizrayim the son of Cham, Noach’s youngest son. The Egyptians of his time were his allies. At the same time he himself as a Midianite was also a descendant of Avraham and Keturah (Genesis 25,2) as already mentioned. There had been ten generations between Noach and Avraham. Similarly, there had been ten generations from Cham son of Noach, to Midian son of Avraham. This is the background to the popular saying quoted in the Talmud that the affinity to former associations by a convert is noticeable for ten generations.</p>

        <summary>Chasidut discusses the concept of returning to one's roots, with marriage symbolizing a reunion of soul halves and a connection to one's roots in the Land of Israel. Commentary from various sources interprets the names Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim in Genesis 25:3, with different explanations provided. The Midrash describes the descendants of Zimran and Yokshan, as well as the relationship between the seventy nations and Jacob's descendants. In the Second Temple period, Abraham's sons with Keturah settled in different regions and played a role in the naming of Africa. The Targum identifies the sons of Dedan as Ashurim, Letushim, and Leumim, describing them as merchants, negotiators, and chiefs of peoples.</summary>

            <summary>The text discusses how everything seeks to return to its root, with children attracted to their parental home and individuals seeking marriage as a reunion of their original soul halves. The ultimate redemption for the Jewish people is seen as a return to their roots in the Land of Israel, with marriage symbolizing this return. The bond between husband and wife is believed to continue even after death, with souls fused together. The laws of marriage are derived from the machpelah cave, where the patriarchs and matriarchs were buried together, symbolizing the unity that can be achieved in marriage. This unity is seen as a connection to one's roots and a reflection of the ultimate redemption.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>Everything in nature seeks to return to its root. So as well is a child always attracted to his parental home. Home as the source of one’s life has the quality of a root, and branches are attracted to their roots. Consider the strength of the bond between father and child. The father is the source of the son, he is a root, and the son is an offshoot. Since the attraction to source is so powerful the son seeks to emulate his father and earn his father’s approval. (Tzion Ve-Arehah, pg. 31.)  Similarly every man is attracted to his wife, and when single he feels forlorn and incomplete. This too stems from the need to reconnect to one’s roots. Before birth each soul is a duality, with a male half and a female half. When we are born, only half of a soul enters the world at a time. There is another half, of the opposite gender, that is born into another family. The urge for marriage is a desire to return to the perfect state, the most natural form in which we were originally created. Marriage is not a union of disparate individuals; it is a reunion of the halves that were initially one soul. (See further Made in Heaven, pg. 1, note 1. The primordial unity of souls is hinted at in the verse hemmah me-hevel yachad, “They are together from mist.” Since the point of mere soul mist, male was together with female. Perhaps this concept can explain a difficulty that is found in Rabbinic sources about mar-riage. Legal authorities stress that marriage should be performed with symbolic omens of blessing. For instance, ideally one should marry at the beginning of the lunar month when the moon, the symbol of the Jewish nation, is growing in luster. Second, there is a widespread custom to place the wedding canopy under the stars, the artifact of God’s blessing to Abraham that Jews will be as plentiful as the celestial lights. Yet the Rabbis derived the laws of marriage from the purchase of the machpelah cave, the Tomb of the Patriarchs, where Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah are interred. Can a cemetery and death be a good omen? The answer is yes, the machpelah cave indicates the heights of union married individuals can reach. Marriage is not merely a partnership of bodies and lives, it is a reunion of souls. As a result it does not have to end. The body stops living at the point of death but the soul lives on and a marriage where husband and wife are fully connected to each other, continues after death. Even in the next world the two souls are fused. That is why our patriarchs and matriarchs were buried as couples in the same cave, to indicate that during their lifetimes they had fully fused their person-alities, and therefore the bond fully continued on a soulful level after death. Perhaps the name Chevron (where the machpelah cave is located) reflects this concept, since Chevron stems from the word chibbur, “connection.” Deriving the laws of marriage from the purchase of the machpelah cave is a wonderful omen, showing that in marriage an absolute unity can be achieved during the lifetime of the couple and that union can continue after physical death (Emunas Etecha, Parashas Vayetze, pg. 86). Every nation’s root is their homeland; that is why Englishmen are loyal to England and Americans are loyal to America. The root of the Jewish nation is the Land of Israel. That is why Jews are innately attracted to the Land of Israel. In the realm of person, the roots of the Jewish people are our forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God introduced Himself to each with commandments about the Land of Israel. God’s first words to Abraham were Lech lecha, “Leave your land, birthplace, and family and go to the Land that I will show you [Israel]” (Gen. 12:1). To Isaac, He said, “Do not go down to Egypt; reside in the land that I will command you to stay there. Stay in this land [Israel]” (Gen. 25:2-3). And Jacob’s first message was, “I am the God of Abraham…. The land that you are lying on will be given to you and your descendants” (Gen. 28:13). Since the land of Israel is the root of the nation in the dimension of space, in the dimension of people our roots first began their relationships with God through hearing of the bond to the land (Emunas Etecha, Parashas Lech Lecha 5759). The ultimate redemption will return Jewry to their land and thus will return us to our root. Since marriage is also a return to the root, marriage is the symbol of the redemption. That is why in the blessings celebrating marriage the seventh blessing requests the ultimate redemption. At a time of return to a root it is fitting to pray for the ultimate return to the Source. Thus, the prophet Jeremiah promised, “Once again it will be heard in the cities of Judea and in the outskirts of Jerusalem the sounds of joy and gladness, the sounds of groom and bride, the sounds of people declaring, let us thank God” (Jer. 33:10-11).) </p>

Radak discusses the selectivity of the Torah in mentioning certain descendants of Keturah. Tur HaArokh notes that the names could be those of eventual nations.

Altogether the Torah mentions by name 16 such sons and grandsons. We are hard-pressed to know the reason for the Torah’s selectivity in mentioning only part of the many grandsons, etc. Perhaps those whom Avraham or at least Keturah still knew before they died, are mentioned by name, whereas those who were born by his/her sons after he had died were not mentioned. Considering that Avraham had married Keturah when he was 140 years old or older, he lived for only another 35 years, it would have been unlikely that he saw grandchildren from Keturah, considering that we have no record of anyone marrying below the age of 29 in those days.</p>

But I cannot reconcile Onkelos’ translation with the language of the text.” (Onkelos translates Asshurim as meaning “camps,” Letushim as “owners of tents who spread about in all directions,” and Leumim as “islands” or “sea-districts.” Upon this Rashi comments that he cannot make Onkelos’ translation fit in exactly with the words of the text. Ramban now proceeds to explain Onkelos’ understanding on the verse and also the reason why he was forced to make this translation.)  It appears to me that Onkelos was of the opinion that Asshurim means camps, companies that travel the roads from city to city, just as it says, a company of Ishmaelites. (Further, 37:25.)  Onkelos thus considered Asshurim as being derived from the expressions, To His steps (‘ba’ashuro’) hath my foot held fast; (Job 23:11.)  His steps (‘ashurav’) do not slide. (Psalms 37:31.)  And Onkelos’ opinion of Letushim is that they are the ones who dwell in tents that are scattered over the face of the earth, resting today in one place and tomorrow in another, for the letter lamed and nun interchange in many places, [thus Letushim would be like Netushim (scattered ones)] just like lishchah and nishchah, (Nehemiah 13:7.)  [both of which mean “chamber”]; And on that day men were appointed over ‘haneshachoth’ (the chambers). (Ibid., 12:44.)  From this root is derived the expression, a sword ‘netushah,’ (Isaiah 21:15.)  which is the same as letushah (sharpened). And of the word Le’ummim Onkelos said ulenagvon, [which is Aramaic for the Hebrew word] iyim (islands). (See Isaiah 41:1 and Targum.)  Onkelos was stirred to this translation by the word hayu [and the children of Dedan ‘hayu’ (were) Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim], when it would have been proper to express it similarly to the verse, And Mitzraim begot Ludim, and Ananim, and Lehabim, and Naphtihim. (Above, 10:13.)  And in Bereshith Rabbah we find: (61:4.)  “Rabbi Shmuel the son of Rav Nachman said that even though we translate these names and say, ‘Merchants, flaming ones, and heads of peoples,’ all of them were heads of peoples.” The matter is as I have explained. The translators rendered Asshurim as “merchants, those who walk the road.” From the word Letushim (sharp, shiny) they derived “men of wickedness,” their faces are faces of flame, (Isaiah 13:8.)  burning as torches, from the roots: to sharpen ( liltosh ) his plowshare, and his coulter; (I Samuel 13:20.)  He sharpened ( yiltosh ) his eyes upon me. (Job 16:9.)  But Rabbi Shmuel the son of Rav Nachman said that even though they are accustomed to thus translate these names, they are still only the proper names of the heads of people, there being no descriptive name among them at all. And such is the case.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>אשורם ולטושם The names of chieftains of clans (Genesis Rabbah 61:5). As regards the translation of Onkelos I cannot make it fit in exactly with the words of the text. He explains אשורם by למשירין which means “camps” (cf. שיירא a caravan). If you say that this cannot be correct on account of the א in אשורם which is not a root letter in the word from which משירין is derived (whilst in אשורם we have an א) then I would reply that we find some words which should have no א at the beginning, but still א is placed before them. Such are אנך in (Amos 7:7) “a wall made by a plumbline (אנך)”, where the word is of the same root as נכה in (2 Samuel 4:4) “stricken (נכה) in his feet”, and אסוך, a cruse containing anointing oil, in (2 Kings 4:2) “a pot (אסוך) of oil” which is of the same root as וסכת in (Ruth 3:3) “wash thyself and (וסכת) annoint thyself”.</p>

Indeed Scripture says (1 Samuel 30:16) “Behold they were spread (נטושים) over all the ground”, for ל and נ may interchange (so that לטושים is equivalent to נטושים).</p>

              <p>אשורים ולטושים ולאומים. According to Rashi these are all names of the eventual nations they developed into. Personally, I fail to reconcile what Onkelos says on these name with the wording of the text.
    Nachmanides writes that he understands Onkelos as saying that אשורים are camps and caravans which move from city to city, similar tote caravans of Ishmaelite traders described in the story of the sale of Joseph. The word is related to Job 23,11 באשורו אחזה רגלי, “I have followed in his tracks.” The word לטושים he understands as referring to Bedouins, dwellers in tents, instead of people housed in permanent structures. These are apt to be abandoned in time of need. The letter ל and נ are often used interchangeably as in נשכה instead of לשכה.”office.” (Nechemyah 13,7) Onkelos translates לאומים as נגון, i.e. a word meaning “islands.” (island dwellers) Probably Onkelos was alerted to the change in the text from יקשן ילד, “Yakshon sired,” to בני דן היו instead of בני דן ילדו, to see in the three wordsאשורים, ולטושים, and ולאומים something other than additional offspring. We would have expected a formulation parallel to Genesis 10,13 ומצרים ילד.

It is that Jacob, because he took four wives, Leah, Rachel, Zilpa, and Bilha, he says: “Your father’s sons.” Isaac took Rebecca, he said: “Your mother’s sons.”  “Cursed be one who curses you…” – and elsewhere it says: “Those who bless you are blessed, and those who curse you are cursed” (Numbers 24:9). It is that Bilam, because he was a hater, began with a blessing and concluded with a curse. Yitzḥak, who was a lover, opened with a curse and concluded with a blessing.   Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Rabbi Ḥiyya said: The wicked, because their beginning is tranquility and their end is suffering, they begin with blessing and end with curse.

              <p>How The Nation Of The Troglodytes Were Derived From Abraham By Keturah. Abraham after this married Keturah, by whom six sons were born to him, men of courage, and of sagacious minds: Zambran, and Jazar, and Madan, and Madian, and Josabak, and Sous. Now the sons of Sous were Sabathan and Dadan. The sons of Dadan were Latusim, and Assur, and Luom. The sons of Madiau were Ephas, and Ophren, and Anoch, and Ebidas, and Eldas. Now, for all these sons and grandsons, Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies; and they took possession of Troglodytis, and the country of Arabia the Happy, as far as it reaches to the Red Sea. It is related of this Ophren, that he made war against Libya, and took it, and that his grandchildren, when they inhabited it, called it (from his name) Africa. And indeed Alexander Polyhistor gives his attestation to what I here say; who speaks thus: &quot;Cleodemus the prophet, who was also called Malchus, who wrote a History of the Jews, in agreement with the History of Moses, their legislator, relates, that there were many sons born to Abraham by Keturah: nay, he names three of them, Apher, and Surim, and Japhran. That from Surim was the land of Assyria denominated; and that from the other two (Apher and Japbran) the country of Africa took its name, because these men were auxiliaries to Hercules, when he fought against Libya and Antaeus; and that Hercules married Aphra's daughter, and of her he begat a son, Diodorus; and that Sophon was his son, from whom that barbarous people called Sophacians were denominated.&quot;</p>

Since Abraham was very old and had been infertile until the births of Ishmael and Isaac, some commentaries suggest that these were the sons of Ketura alone, and were not Abraham’s, although he raised them in his house. 18 However, this explanation is not particularly convincing. It seems more likely that whereas Abraham considered himself elderly and advanced in age, he was still quite capable of procreation and he himself fathered a number of children from Ketura. It can also be inferred from here and from the story of the birth of Ishmael that it was Sarah who was infertile.</p>

              <p>(From this point to the end of the tractate is an aggadic addendum.)  The greatest man among the Anakim (Josh. 14, 15.) —among the Anakim refers to our father Abraham whose height was equal to that of seventy-four men; his eating and drinking were of a similar proportion, equal to those of seventy-four men; so too his strength. What did he do? (This is probably a reference to Gen. 25, 6, But unto the sons of the concubines … Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away … eastward, unto the east country.)  He removed the sixteen (So GRA in accordance with Gen. 25, 2-4. V, M and H incorrectly ‘seventeen’.)  sons of Keturah, built for them a walled city of iron and settled them in it. The sun never penetrated into it because it was exceedingly high, so Abraham handed to them disks of precious stones and pearls of which use will be made (So GRA. V, M and H read, ‘and they will be used’.)  in the hereafter when the Holy One, blessed be He, will cause the sun and moon to be confounded, as it is written, When the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, (Is. 24, 23.)  because use will be made of these [disks as luminaries]. Og (King of Bashan; Deut. 3, 11.)  is identical with Eliezer, (Abraham’s servant; cf. Gen. 15, 2, XXIV, 2ff.)  and [he was so huge that] he could hide Abraham’s feet in the palm of his hand. Once he was rebuked [by Abraham] and from fright his tooth fell out. Abraham picked it up and made ivory beds of it in which he slept. Others say that he made of it a chair which he used (lit. ‘and sat in it’.)  all his life. Who gave him to Abraham? Nimrod. (Mentioned in Gen. 10, 8ff.)  Og went and built sixty cities, the smallest of which was sixty miles high, as it is stated, Threescore cities, all the region of Argob. (Deut. 3, 4.)  And what did he eat? A thousand oxen and the same [number of] other animals, and his drink consisted of a thousand measures. A (So GRA. V, M and H read ‘and what was the’.)  drop of his semen weighed thirty-six pounds. (V and H add ‘and so for all generations’, which makes no sense.)  It was taught: What did our father Jacob do when his sons brought him the coat [stained] with blood? (Cf. Gen. 37, 31ff.)  He did not believe them at all. Whence do we infer this? For it is written, But he refused to be comforted, (ibid. 35.)  because no consolations are acceptable for a living person. One, however, who is dead passes naturally from the mind, (lit. ‘he is forgotten from the heart of his own accord’.)  as it is stated, I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind. (Ps. 31, 13.)  What then did he do? He proceeded to make a test with sheaves, (GRA transposes the order of V, M and H by putting the test of the sheaves before that of the stones, and omits ‘according to the first opinion’.)  writing upon them the respective names of the tribes, their constellations and the months, and said to them, ‘I order you to prostrate yourselves before Levi because he wears the Urim and Thummim’, (Cf. Ex. 28, 30.)  but they did not stand up. ‘Before Judah who is king’, but they did not stand up; but when he mentioned Joseph to them, they all stood up and bowed before Joseph. But it was not yet quite clear that he was alive. So Jacob went to the mountains, hewed twelve stones, arranged them in a row, and wrote on each the name of its tribe, the name of its constellation and the name of its month. On one stone he wrote ‘Reuben, lamb, Nisan’ (The name of the tribe, constellation and month.)  and similarly on every stone. He began from Simeon and said to them, ‘I order you to stand up for Reuben’, but they did not stand up. ‘For Simeon’, but they did not stand up. ‘For every tribe’, but the stones did not stand up. As soon, however, as he mentioned the name of Joseph to them, they stood up at once and bowed before Joseph’s stone. (The translation follows the text of GRA.)  For this reason, all the tribes were written on Joseph’s stone. Similarly, all Israel are called by Joseph’s name, as it is stated, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock. (Ps. 80, 2 where Joseph is a synonym of all Israel.)  So also all the heads of the families of the priests and Levites, [e.g.] Eliashib, (Neh. 3, 1.)  because of the phrase lahashibo ’el ’abiw; (In the story of Joseph (Gen. 37, 22), E.V. to restore him to his father. The name Eliashib is broken up in three parts corresponding in sound and meaning to these three Heb. words. From ‘For this reason’ to ’abiw is the reading of GRA. V and H have instead: ‘but from the mishmaroth, Eliashib the priest’.)  Elḳanah, (Connected with ḳanah, ‘he bought’.)  because Potiphar had bought him [as it is stated,] And Joseph ms brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar … bought him. (Gen. 39, 1. V inserts in parentheses, And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Ẓaphenath, paneah, etc. (ibid. XLI, 45), which has no relevance to the subject.)  When Rebekah left her father’s house (Cf. ibid. XXIV, 59ff.)  she was three years old, (V, M and H add ‘and three days’.)  because it is customary among kings, when a daughter is born to them, to hear of it after three days; (H reads ‘after three years and three days’.)  but as her father did not hear [of her birth] he did not defile her up to that time; and now a miracle happened to her in that her father died so that he should not defile her, as it is written, Neither had any man known her, (Gen. 24, 16.)  and by man only her father could be meant, (From ‘he did not’ to ‘meant’ is GRA’s reading. V, M and H read: ‘therefore a miracle happened to her that she should not be defiled’.)  for such was the practice of the Arameans to lie with their virgin daughters after they were three years of age, (‘After … age’ is inserted by GRA; omitted in V, M and H.)  and then to give them away in marriage. (V, M and H add: ‘on account of that which is written, Neither had any man known her, and by man only her father could be meant’.)  Dinah was six years old when she bore Asenath from [her association with] Shechem, (Cf. Gen. 34.)  corresponding to (lit. ‘the number of’.)  the six years which Jacob served Laban in payment for the flock, (ibid. XXXI, 41.)  thus completing (lit. ‘until’.)  the twenty years of his service. [The Archangel] Michael then descended and took her away to the house of Potiphar. From here onward let the man of understanding increase knowledge. (From ‘completing the twenty years’ to ‘knowledge’ is GRA’s text. V and M have instead: ‘and he added twenty years, because he died. From this point onwards let the man of understanding increase knowledge. And Michael descended and led her to Potiphar’s house’.) </p>

The Talmud emphasizes the impossibility of fulfilling all pious conduct permutations in one lifetime, with the reward for observance being indescribable. Abraham's actions set a precedent for blessings passing down generations, with Esau receiving punishment for confronting Jacob. Sforno, Redeeming Relevance, Ramban, Ibn Ezra, and Chizkuni provide various interpretations of the events, while Geviha ben Pesisa challenges Ishmael's descendants' claim to Canaan with Abraham's property division as evidence.

            <summary>Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac, despite the Talmudic prohibition against a father transferring his estate from an unworthy son to a worthy one. This was justified by the belief that Isaac was the only heir specified by God, and the other sons were practicing idolatry. Abraham may have taught them a permissible name for God to counteract this influence. Some interpretations suggest that Abraham gave Isaac active possession of the property he had previously granted him as a blessing or legacy. Despite the legal issues surrounding inheritance, it is believed that both Abraham and Ishmael were actually converts, not born as Jews, and therefore could not legally inherit from each other.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>ויתן אברהם את כל אשר לו ליצחק, “Avraham gave all that was his to Yitzchok.” How could he have done so, seeing that the Talmud in tractate Baba batra folio 133 denies a father the right to transfer his estate even from a unworthy son to a worthy son, the reason being that the son from whom his potential inheritance is taken away may have a worthy son himself, whereas the son to whom it has been transferred may have an unworthy son. (Compare Talmud tractate Pessachim 49) We read in Job 27,17 concerning the definition of a righteous person that יכין וצדיק ילבש וכסף נקי יחלק, “the just will put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.” [The problem is how could Avraham disinherit his firstborn son Yishmael legally? Ed.] It is especially puzzling since according to the Talmud in tractate Yuma folio 28, credits him with even having observed Rabbinic ordinances, such as certain procedures for preparing food when a festival day is followed by the Sabbath when preparing food is forbidden. We have to conclude that both Avraham and Yishmael were actually converts, neither having been born as Jews. Converts do not legally inherit their fellow converts, neither by Biblical law nor by Rabbinic decree. (Talmud tractate Kidushin folio 17). Rabbeinu Chananel bar Sh’muel suggests that Avraham gave all he had to Yitzchok before the sons of Keturah had been born, This is indicated by this having been reported already in Genesis 24,36: where he is reported immediately after Sarah having given birth to him as receiving all of his father’s estate. [Seeing that Yishmael, as Hagar’s son was the son of a slave woman, he could not legally own anything that had been Avraham’s or Sarah’s as slaves do not own their master’s or their mistress’ property. So where was the problem? Ed.]</p>

The word דייתיקי comes from עתיק יומין, which means “Hashem.” Alternatively, דייתיקי comprises three words, דאי תהא קאי, and means, “the gift will be established.” In other words, Avraham now gave Yitzchok active possession of the property he had previously granted him. </p>

              <p>ויתן אברהם את כל אשר לו ליצחק, “Avraham deeded all that was his to Yitzchok. Some people question this procedure, basing themselves on Ketuvot 53 where the Talmud rules that a father must not re-allocate part of his estate from a son who is morally unfit to one who has developed morally and ethically to his liking, seeing he does not know how the grandson from either son will turn out. It is stated there that a convert the son of Hagar, i.e. a slave woman, cannot inherit at any rate, as whatever is his belongs to his master. Whereas this is a good answer concerning the status of Yishmael, it leaves unanswered the question how Avraham could disinherit the sons of Keturah. I believe that there is no difficulty at all, seeing the Torah had told Avraham specifically that his seed will only be known through Yitzchok, i.e. that Yitzchok will be his only heir. It does not mean that the other sons were intrinsically unfit because of their character or some other impediment,
    According to Rashi, quoting Sanhedrin 91, Avraham handed to these sons שם טומאה, i.e. seeing they referred to their idols by the sacred name of the Creator, he taught them to refer to these idols by some other name.
    It is also possible that the meaning of this strange sounding comment by the Talmud is that he informed them of a name for G’d which it is permissible to use even in their state of ritual impurity. All this, because he observed that these sons of Keturah were practicing different forms of idolatry and worshipping those idols. The reason that these sons of Avraham also practiced this form of idolatry was their being so anxious to obtain information about their impending fate, something which the religion of their time promised to have for those who practiced their cults. By informing them of this name for the true G’d, he told them that by invoking it they would become privy to knowledge of the future. [According to the Maharal from Prague the reason Avraham taught his sons the “names” of these idolatries, i.e. the essence of their teachings, was to enable them to counter the damaging influence the power of these demons exercised upon them. According to the author of the כתב והקבלה, Rabbi Mecklenburg, the מתנות, “gifts” Avraham gave to his sons was the know how to protect themselves against the insidious influence of the various religious cults prevalent in their neighborhood..

            <summary>The Talmud demonstrates that it is impossible for one person to fulfill all possible permutations of pious conduct in one lifetime. The impact of Torah in its totality is infinitely greater than the reward for individual mitzvot, with the reward for observance being so great it cannot be defined. The ongoing closeness between Israel and God is reflected in changing blessings and conceptions of holiness, leading to an increasingly intimate relationship. The Jewish people desired a reward in olam haba to distinguish themselves from animals, with Torah study reinforcing this distinction. Moses emphasized that the reward for observance is &quot;indescribable&quot; in order to preserve its comprehensive value.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>The variety of ways of pious conduct by individuals mentioned in the Talmud, demonstrates that it simply is not given to one person to fulfil all possible permutations in one lifetme. Performance and study of each of the sections brings its own reward in terms of happiness, enlightenment etc., but the impact of Torah in its totality is infinitely greater, and even different conceptually. The reward for fulfilment of each mitzvah may vary from &quot;gold&quot; to &quot;fine gold,&quot; but the reward for the totality of observance is eykev rav, is so great that it cannot be defined in terms which our imagination understands. Similarly, when the Mishnah in Peah 1,1, promises dividends in this world for certain types of good deeds performed, whereas the &quot;capital&quot; is reserved for the world to come, the concept is identical with that expressed by the Psalmist. A study of the expressions used by our ancestors when blessing their children, or Israel as a whole, reveals that the change in the wording used reflects the ongoing and ever increasing closeness that existed between the various recipients on the one hand, and G'd on the other, just as already Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had different conceptions of mikdash the holy sanctuary, Abraham calling it &quot;mountain,&quot; Isaac &quot;field&quot; and Jacob &quot;house,&quot; respectively, there has been dynamic progress towards an increasingly intimate relationship between Israel and G'd. The uniqueness of this relationship is seen when Moses says &quot;hail unto you Israel, who is like you?&quot; Here he had paraphrased the words he had used in the song of thanksgiving after crossing the sea of reeds, when he had sung &quot;who is like You O Lord, amongst the deities?&quot; The reason the Jewish people wanted the reward in olam haba spelled out is, that they felt unless there was such a thing, the advantage of man over other creatures in this universe would not only be illusory, but man would actually be worse off than the animals. This very thought is in Solomon's mind, when he asks &quot;what is man's gain in return for his toil?&quot; (Kohelet 1,2) He refers to the comparison with the &quot;inferior&quot; creatures. Torah study and observance, force these conclusions on man. (see chapter thirty three) Moses' reply was that description in detail of that reward would deprive it of part of its value. Whenever we specify something, we give finite limits to the matter thus defined. Therefore, in order to preserve the comprehensive value of the reward, it could only be described as &quot;indescribable.&quot;</p>

              <p>[3] Another interpretation: [Genesis 28:10-11] &quot;And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of that place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.&quot; The holy meaning of &quot;He will keep the feet of His holy ones&quot; (1 Samuel 2:9) is that the Holy One, blessed be He, will protect the righteous. This refers to Abraham, who pursued the kings. &quot;Who has stirred up one from the east, whom He calls in righteousness to His feet?&quot; (Isaiah 41:2) And the wicked shall be silent in darkness. These are the eighteen kings whom he slew in darkness, as it is said, &quot;And he divided himself against them by night&quot; (Genesis 14:15). Another explanation of &quot;He will keep the feet of His holy ones&quot; is Jacob, when he went out to go to Haran. For the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;Behold, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go&quot; (Genesis 28:15). &quot;And the wicked shall be silent in darkness&quot; refers to Esau, as it is written, &quot;All darkness is laid up for his treasures&quot; (Job 20:26). &quot;And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Esau for stubble&quot; (Obadiah 1:18). &quot;And the wicked shall be silent in darkness&quot; - when he went out to pursue Jacob in the tenth hour, and the Holy One, blessed be He, brought in the sun and made the day ten hours long, as it is said, &quot;And he lighted upon the place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set&quot; (Genesis 28:11), and Esau was standing in darkness and silence, not knowing where to go. Therefore, it is said, &quot;For by strength shall no man prevail&quot; (1 Samuel 2:9). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;Perhaps you are strong?&quot; Even in the future, He will do the same for Israel, as it is said, &quot;But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble&quot; (Proverbs 4:18-19). If you wonder about this matter, behold, it has already occurred in this world, as it is said, &quot;No man saw his brother&quot; (Exodus 10:23). &quot;May the footsteps of His pious ones be guarded.&quot; When Jacob left his father's house, he only took his staff in his hand, as it is stated: &quot;For with my staff, I crossed this Jordan&quot; (Genesis 32:11). The Holy One Blessed be He said to Isaac, &quot;Just as your father Abraham did, so do for yourself. He did not give you all that he had, as it is stated: &quot;And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac&quot; (Genesis 25:5). And similarly, &quot;And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had&quot; (Genesis 24:2). What is the meaning of &quot;who ruled&quot;? Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak said that he had control over all that Abraham had, and he even said to him, &quot;Even if you lose what I have, take a wife for my son from there.&quot; Immediately, the servant took ten camels and all the good things of his master were in his hand (Genesis 24:10). This demonstrates that the halacha was in his hand (as it is stated: &quot;And Abraham gave all that he had,&quot; Genesis 25:5), and furthermore, the servant began to distribute gifts. To this (i.e. Abraham's actions) we attribute the blessings, and to this (i.e. Isaac's actions) we attribute the rings. And Solomon cried out: &quot;There is one who scatters and yet increases more&quot; (Proverbs 11:24). May the Holy One Blessed be He be praised, as it is stated: &quot;And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). Look at all that Abraham did for Isaac, but Isaac did not do the same for Jacob. Instead, he sent him away empty-handed. The Holy One Blessed be He said to him, &quot;You have withheld from this poor man, from your own lack.&quot; As it is stated: &quot;And yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest; then your poverty will come as a robber, and your want like an armed man&quot; (Proverbs 6:10-11). If Jacob had nothing, the Divine Presence would have departed from him. And he could not speak with him except at the time of his death. Come and see what Esau did to Jacob; he saw him empty-handed and did not have mercy on him. Instead, he said, &quot;Let me go first, and if I cannot pass, then I will kill him.&quot; As it is stated: &quot;Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions...because he pursued his brother with the sword&quot; (Amos 1:11). Jacob turned his eyes to the Holy One Blessed be He and performed miracles for him. He placed his staff in the water, and the Jordan River split apart, as it is stated: &quot;With my staff, I crossed this Jordan&quot; (Genesis 32:11). Esau waited on the way, but Jacob did not pass by there. He felt that he had crossed the Jordan. What did Esau do? He pursued him and came ahead to the place of Makhpelah. Jacob said, &quot;I have neither bread nor anything else with me. I will go in and warm my body in this bath.&quot; Esau surrounded the bath so that Jacob could not leave. Jacob pretended to be dead so that he would not have to leave. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;You are joined against a wicked man. I said, 'Here I am with you, etc.' &quot; Jacob said to him at that time, &quot;You have done this for your name's sake; I am sure of it.&quot; And Jacob went out and encountered the place, and there was no encounter except prayer, as it is said, &quot;Do not pray and do not encounter me&quot; (Jeremiah 7:16). David said, &quot;Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in&quot; (Psalms 121:4-8).</p>

(In which he bequeathed all his property to Isaac.)    Rabbi Ḥama said: It was not blessings that he [Abraham] bequeathed to him, but gifts. This is analogous to a king who had an orchard, which he gave over to a sharecropper. In it, there were two trees intertwined into a single twining; one produced life-giving [fruits] and the other produced poisonous [fruits]. That sharecropper said: ‘If I water the one that is life-giving, the one that is poisonous will be watered along with it, but if I refrain from watering the poisonous one, how will the one that is life-giving survive?’ He then said: ‘I am a mere [temporary] sharecropper. I have performed my duties as sharecropper, and whatever the owner of the orchard wishes to do, he will do.’ So, Abraham said: ‘If I bless Isaac, my son Ishmael and Ketura’s sons will want to be included. If I do not bless Ishmael’s sons and Ketura’s sons, how can I bless Isaac?’ He then said: ‘I am flesh and blood, here today, in the grave tomorrow. I have already done my part; from here on, what the Holy One blessed be He wishes to do in His world, let Him do.’ When Abraham died, the Holy One blessed be He revealed himself to Isaac and blessed him. That is what is written: “It was after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son…” (Genesis 25:11).</p>

              <p>“But to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, during his lifetime, eastward, to the east country” (Genesis 25:6).  “But to the sons of the concubines…” – In the days of Alexander of Macedonia, the children of Ishmael came to lodge a claim against Israel regarding the birthright. Two evil families, the Canaanites and the Egyptians, came with them. They [the rabbis] said: ‘Who will go and contend with them?’ Gevia ben Kosem said: ‘I will go and contend with them.’ They told him: ‘Be careful that you do not cede the Land to them.’ He said: ‘I am going to contend with them; if I am victorious, it is well and good, and if not, you can always say: Who is this lowly person, that he should represent us?’ He went and contended with them. Alexander of Macedonia said to them: ‘Who is lodging a claim against whom?’ The Ishmaelites said: ‘We are lodging a claim against them [Israel], and it is on the basis of their own Torah that we come against them. It is written: “Rather, he shall acknowledge the firstborn, son of the hated wife [to give him a double portion]” (Deuteronomy 21:17). By right, Ishmael is entitled to receive a double portion.’ Gevia ben Kosem said to him: ‘My lord the king, may a person not do as he pleases for his owns sons?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘Is it not written: “Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac”?’ (Genesis 25:5). They said to him: ‘Where is the document of gifts that he divided among his sons?’ He said to them: “And to the sons of the concubines of Abraham, Abraham gave gifts.” They departed from there shamefacedly.  The Canaanites said: ‘It is on the basis of their own Torah that we come against them. It is written everywhere: “To the land of Canaan,” “the land of Canaan” – let them give us back our land.’ Gevia ben Kosem said to them: ‘My lord the king, may a person not do as he pleases with his slave?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘What is written? “Cursed is Canaan, a slave of slaves…. [And he said: Blessed be the Lord, God of Shem, and Canaan shall be slaves unto them]” (Genesis 9:25–26). The Land is ours and they are slaves to my lord the king.’ (Alexander, being a Greek, was descended from Yefet (Genesis 10:2), and Canaan was cursed to be a slave to Yefet as well (see Genesis 9:27).)  They departed from there shamefacedly.  The Egyptians said: ‘It is on the basis of their own Torah that we come against them. Six hundred thousand [Israelite] men departed from our midst laden with silver vessels and gold vessels, as it is written: “They stripped Egypt” (Exodus 12:36). Let them give us back our silver and our gold.’ Gevia ben Kosem said to him: ‘My lord the king, six hundred thousand people spent two hundred and ten years in their midst, among them silversmiths and among them goldsmiths, who normally receive one dinar a day as wages. The philosophers sat and calculated and did not even reach one hundred years [of labor] before the land of Egypt would be found to be bankrupt.’ They departed from there shamefacedly.  He [Alexander] once sought to ascend to Jerusalem. The Samaritans (Who were always antagonistic towards the Jews, and especially towards their Temple in Jerusalem (see Ezra chapter 4).)  went and said to him: ‘Be aware that they will not allow you to enter their Holy of Holies.’ When Gevia ben Kosem sensed this, he went and made two felt shoes for him and placed on them two gems, each valued at twenty thousand silver dinars. When he [Alexander] reached the Temple Mount, he [Gevia] said to him: ‘My lord the king, remove your shoes and put on these felt shoes, the floor being slippery, so your feet should not slip.’ (It is forbidden to enter the Temple Mount wearing shoes (Mishna Berakhot 9:6).)  When he reached the Holy of Holies, they said to him: ‘Until here we have permission to enter; from here on, we do not have permission to enter.’ He said to him [Gevia]: ‘When I leave here, I will flatten your forehead’ [variant reading: Your hump]. He said to him: ‘If you can do that, you would be an expert doctor, and could charge a great fee.’ (Gevia had a misshapen forehead or back.)   “And sent them away from Isaac his son [eastward, to the east country]” – he said to them: As far east as you can go, go east, (This explains the apparent repetitiveness of: “eastward, to the east country.”)  so you will not be burned by Isaac’s coals. (If you ever have a territorial dispute with Isaac, you will be burnt, so you had better keep your distance.)  But Esau, because he came to confront Jacob, he received his punishment from him. That is what is written: “Is it for you to be jovial, like those in antiquity whose legs led them afar to live? Who devised this against Tyre [Tzor] the glorious…” (The prophet is warning the people of Tzor not to be jovial in their confrontation with Israel. That would be the proper mood for those other descendants of Abraham, who went to settle far away from Israel to avoid such confrontation.)  (Isaiah 23:7–8). Rabbi Elazar said: Every instance of Tzor that is written in the Bible with a vav, the verse is speaking of the city of Tyre; when it is without a vav, the verse is speaking of Rome. (The Romans are considered to be descendants of Edom, or Esau.)  “The glorious [ma’atira]” – Rabbi Abba said: It was surrounded [with riches] like a crown [atara]. Rabbi Yanai said in the name of Rabbi Shimon son of Rabbi Yanai: It was surrounded by thorns. (According to this interpretation, the verse is not speaking of the glory of Tzor, but of its ultimate downfall and desolation.) </p>

              <p>“This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, blessed the children of Israel before his death” (Deuteronomy 33:1). Halakha: A person of Israel who passed before the ark (He served as prayer leader.)  and erred, (He is unable to continue the prayer for some reason.)  how must he act? So the Sages taught: One who passes before the ark and errs, let another pass in his stead. Our Rabbis taught us, Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: If one erred in the first three blessings, he returns to the beginning of “Shield.” (“Shield of Abraham,” the first blessing of the Amida prayer.)  Rav Huna said: If one erred in the middle three (There are actually thirteen middle blessings in the weekday Amida prayer. Thus, the midrash is referring to a case in which someone made a mistake in one of the thirteen middle blessings. In the Musaf prayer of Rosh Hashanah there are three middle blessings.)  blessings, he returns to “the holy God.” (The third blessing ends with the words &quot;the holy God.&quot; The midrash states that the person who made the mistake starts from the fourth blessing, which begins right after the words &quot;the holy God.&quot;)  Rav said: If one erred in the final three, he returns to the beginning of “we give thanks.” (Which is the first of the last three blessing)   Another matter, one who passes before the ark and erred, another passes in his place. From where does he begin? It is from the beginning of the blessing where he erred. From where did they derive it? It is from the patriarchs of the world. Why? It is because each of them would begin only from where the other ended. How so? Abraham blessed Isaac. From where is it derived? It is as it is written: “Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac” (Genesis 25:5). What did he give him? Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: He gave him the birthright, like the matter that is stated: “He sold his birthright to Jacob” (Genesis 25:33). Rabbi Neḥemya said: He gave him a blessing, like the matter that is stated: “May God give you [of the dew of the heavens and the fat of the earth…]” (Genesis 27:28). Isaac arose to bless Jacob, he said: ‘From the place that father ended, I will begin. Father ended with veyiten, I, too, will begin with veyiten,’ as is it is stated: “May God give you [veyiten lekha].” With what did Isaac end? It was with summoning, as it is stated: “Isaac summoned Jacob and blessed him” (Genesis 28:1). Jacob arose to bless the tribes, he said: ‘I will begin only with summoning,’ as it is stated: “Jacob summoned his sons” (Genesis 49:1). With what did he end? It was with zot, as it is stated: “And this [vezot] is what their father spoke to them” (Genesis 49:28). Moses arose to bless Israel, he said: ‘I will begin only with zot.’ From where is it derived? It is from what is written regarding the matter: “This is [vezot] the blessing.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:9): HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS. When Jacob set out from his father's house, he set out with only his staff, as stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): FOR WITH &lt; ONLY &gt; MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN. The Holy One said to Isaac: Did your father, Abraham, do this to you? Did he not give you everything that he had? It is so stated (in Gen. 25:5): BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC. &lt; There is &gt; also this (in Gen. 24:2): SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE, THE ONE WHO RULED OVER ALL THAT HE HAD. R. Samuel bar Isaac said: What is the meaning of THE ONE WHO RULED? When he had made him a ruler over all that he had, he said: Even if you &lt; must &gt; give away everything that belongs to me, take a wife for my son from there. (Gen. 24:10:) THEN THE SERVANT TOOK TEN CAMELS FROM THE CAMELS OF HIS MASTER, AND WENT WITH ALL HIS MASTER'S GOODS IN HIS HAND. This refers to a diatheke (The Greek words means “covenant.”)  {gift certificate} which he carried in his hand. (See Gen. R. 59:11 and some versions of PRE 16. Both use the word diatheke in this context. Cf. Gen. R. 61:6.)  (Ergo, in Gen. 25:5:) BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC. The servant began distributing earrings to one woman, necklaces (Lat.: catellae.)  to another, and rings to still another. This is what the text means (in Prov. 11:24): THERE IS ONE WHO DISPENSES LIBERALLY AND STILL INCREASES. The Holy One has blessed him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:11): AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC. But Isaac did not do so for Jacob. Instead he had him set out empty-handed. The Holy One said (in Prov. 11:24, cont.): ANOTHER HOLDS BACK FROM WHAT IS RIGHT, YET THE RESULT IS WANT. And what happened to him (Isaac)? The Divine Presence departed from him. So you find him (the Holy One) speaking with him only when he died. Come and see what Esau the Wicked did to Jacob. He saw him empty-handed and did not show him mercy. Instead he said: See, I am ahead of him, and he cannot pass me on the way. So I will kill him there. And where is it shown? Where the prophet said so (in Amos 1:11): &lt; THUS SAYS THE LORD: FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF EDOM AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT RESCIND IT (the punishment) &gt; BECAUSE HE PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD. Jacob knew &lt; about it &gt; and raised his eyes to the Holy One. Now he had performed miracles with him (Jacob); so he put {his staff for him in his hand} [his staff into the Jordan]. Then the Jordan divided for him, and he crossed. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): FOR WITH MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN. So Esau was waiting on the way, but Jacob did not pass on the way. When Esau perceived that Jacob had fled and crossed the Jordan, what did he do? He pursued him and found him in a cave, a place like the bath that is in Tiberias. (Cf. Gen. R. 75:5.)  Jacob had said: There is no bread and no food at hand. I shall go in and get warm in the bath. Esau the Wicked came and had the bath surrounded the so that he would die in it. The Holy One said to him: &lt; Since &gt; you are the most wicked man in the world, are you to be paired (The verb is related to the Greek noun zeugos (“yoke of beasts”).)  against him? Immediately the Holy One said to Jacob: What are you afraid of? See, I am with you. Jacob said to him: Sovereign of the World, inasmuch as I am trusting you and you are making me a promise, I will have trust [and set out. (Gen. 28:10:) AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA].</p>

              </summary>
              <p>R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi, “There are four things that the evil drive would refute [as irrational], and for each of them is written [the word,] huqqah (i.e., an unquestioned statute). (Although Huqqah is normally translated simply as “statute,” the word more fully denotes a command that demands implicit and unquestioned obedience. Huqqah is therefore translated “unquestioned statute” throughout this section.)  Now these concern the following: (1) the nakedness of a brother's wife, (2) diverse kinds, (3) the scapegoat, and (4) the red heifer.” (PR 14:12; Numb. R. 19:5; see Yoma 67b.)  In regard to the nakedness of a brother's wife, it is written (in Lev. 18:16), “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife”; [yet if the brother] dies without children [it is written] (in Deut. 25:5), “her brother-in-law shall have sexual intercourse with her [and take her for a wife].” And it is written about the sexual prohibitions (in Lev. 18:5), “And you shall keep [all] My unquestioned statutes [...].” In regard to diverse kinds, it is written (in Deut. 22:11), “You shall not wear interwoven stuff, [wool and flax together]”; yet a linen cloak (Gk.: sindon.)  with [wool] tassels is permitted. (See Numb. 15:37-38.)  And for [this commandment also] it is written, [that it is] an unquestioned statute. [Thus it is written (in Lev. 19:19),] “You shall keep My unquestioned statute. You shall not mate your cattle with a different kind…, [nor shall you wear a garment with diverse kinds of interwoven stuff].” In regard to the scapegoat, it is written (in Lev. 16:26), “And the one who sets the azazel-goat free shall wash his clothes”; yet it is [the goat] itself that atones for others. And for [this commandment also] it is written (in Lev. 16:34), “And this shall be to you an unquestioned statute forever.” In regard to the red heifer, where is it shown? Since we are taught (in Parah 4:4), “All engaged with the [rite of the red] heifer from beginning to end render [their] garments unclean”; yet it is [the heifer] itself that purifies [what is] unclean. And for [this commandment also] it is written, [that it is] an unquestioned statute. Thus it is written (in Numb. 19:2), “This is an unquestioned statute of the Torah.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Another interpretation of &quot;Happy is the man&quot; (Psalm 1:1): This refers to the righteous men. The prophets are happy because they give form to the image of God, and to the one who plants the tree. This is what the scripture means by &quot;For the Lord God is a sun and shield&quot; (Psalm 84:12). Rabbi Chiya bar Abba said: &quot;Happy are they who are like the sun, which shines forth, and like a shield, which protects.&quot; Another interpretation of &quot;shield&quot;: This refers to the Persian Targum for a curtain that surrounds a person, protecting them from the four winds. And how do we know that it includes the fourth wind? It is written, &quot;You crown us with loving-kindness&quot; (Psalm 5:13). Another interpretation of &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;shield&quot;: This refers to Abraham, our forefather. &quot;Sun&quot; refers to Abraham, as it is written, &quot;Who raised up righteousness from the east&quot;  (Isaiah 41:2) The shield represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;I am your shield&quot; (Genesis 15:1). The God represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;You are a prince of God in our midst&quot; (Genesis 23:6). Grace and glory God gives represent Abraham, as it is written, &quot;And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold&quot; (Genesis 13:2). &quot;He does not withhold good from those who walk with integrity&quot; represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;Walk before me, and be blameless&quot; (Genesis 17:1). If Scripture speaks of Abraham in this way, then when it says, &quot;He does not withhold good from those who walk with integrity,&quot; what does it mean to walk with integrity? Rather, just as Abraham, who walked with integrity before the Holy One, Blessed be He, had a shield, so too anyone who walks with integrity before Him has a shield. After him, what is written? &quot;Happy is the man who trusts in You&quot; (Psalms 84:13). Abraham is not written here, but rather &quot;man,&quot; meaning all people. David said, &quot;Happy is the man whom You discipline, Lord, and whom You teach from Your law&quot; (Psalms 94:12). Rabbi Yudan opened by saying, &quot;Do not boast before the king, and do not stand in the place of great men&quot; (Proverbs 25:6). Rabbi Yudan read it from the place where this section was closed and from the place where the previous section was opened. Rabbi Pinchas worked an extended passage from Psalms 119:100, &quot;I understand more than the aged.&quot; At first, the Holy One, Blessed be He, blessed His world, as it says, &quot;And God blessed them&quot; (Genesis 1:28). Once Noah stood, He blessed him, as it says, &quot;And God blessed Noah and his sons&quot; (Genesis 9:1). Once Abraham stood, He blessed him, as it says, &quot;And God blessed Abraham in everything&quot; (Genesis 24:1). What is the meaning of &quot;it will be a blessing&quot;? Rav Nachman said that He handed the blessings over to him and said, &quot;Until now, I have been required to bless the world, but from now on, the blessings are in your hands, and whomever you bless will be blessed.&quot; Once Isaac stood, he blessed him, as it says, &quot;And Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac&quot; (Genesis 25:5). What did he give him? Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Nechemia, and the Rabbis (said): Rabbi Yehuda said it was the firstborn. Rabbi Nechemia said it was a blessing. And the Rabbis said it was burial and a deed of inheritance. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Chama: they only gave him gifts. And why didn't they give him a blessing? It is like a king who had a garden and gave it to a tenant, and in it were all kinds of trees intertwined with each other, one of the Tree of Life and one of the Tree of Death. The tenant said, &quot;If I water the Tree of Life, the Tree of Death will live with it. And if I do not water it, how will the Tree of Life live?&quot; The tenant returned and said, &quot;This year I will complete my tenancy and go, and what do I care about the king's garden?&quot; Abraham said, &quot;I will not bless Isaac now because the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah are now being blessed.&quot; I am flesh and blood today, but tomorrow I will be in the grave, and what needs to be done in his world will be done. When Abraham died, God revealed Himself to Isaac and blessed him, as it says, &quot;After Abraham's death, God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). And so He did to Jacob, as it says, &quot;God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan Aram, and He blessed him&quot; (Genesis 35:9). And Isaac stood and blessed Jacob with giving, as it says, &quot;May God give you of the dew of heaven&quot; (Genesis 27:28), and he sealed it with a call, &quot;And Isaac called Jacob, and he blessed him&quot; (Genesis 28:1). Jacob stood to bless the tribes and began with what Isaac had sealed. This is what is written, &quot;And Jacob called to his sons and said&quot; (Genesis 49:1), and he sealed it with this, as it says, &quot;And this is what their father said to them&quot; (Genesis 49:28). Moses stood to bless Israel, and said, &quot;Jacob is the firstborn of the Holy One, blessed be He,&quot; and he began with a call and sealed it with &quot;And this is the blessing&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:1), and he sealed it with &quot;Happy are you&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:29). When David stood, he opened with &quot;God is my Lord,&quot; and sealed it with &quot;Blessed are You, God&quot; (Psalms 118:27).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>“These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his household” (Exodus 1:1).  That is what is written: “He who spares his rod hates his son, and he who loves him seeks for him admonition” (Proverbs 13:24). The way of the world is that a person whom another tells him: ‘So-and-so struck your son,’ he would harass him. What is the meaning when the verse states: “He who spares his rod hates his son”? It is to teach you that anyone who withholds rebuke from his son, his son will ultimately set out on a path of depravity and he will hate him.  As we find regarding Ishmael, who was beloved (Literally, he had longings for his father, which could explain his father’s love for him.)  by his father Abraham, who did not chasten him, and he set out on a path of depravity. He then hated him and expelled him from his home emptyhanded. What did Ishmael do? When he was fifteen years old, he began to bring an idol from the marketplace, and he played with it and worshipped it in the manner that he saw others doing. (Although he made it look like he was just playing with it and even mocking it, in fact his intention was to worship it.)  Immediately, “Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she bore to Abraham, playing [metzaḥek]” (Genesis 21:9), and metzaḥek means nothing other than idol worship, like you say: “They rose to carouse [letzaḥek]” (Exodus 32:6).  (This verse is written in the context of the sin of the Golden Calf.)   Immediately, “She said to Abraham: Expel this maidservant and her son” (Genesis 21:10), so that my son will not learn his ways. Immediately, “the matter was very troubling in the eyes of Abraham regarding his son” (Genesis 21:11), because he emerged to a path of depravity. “God said to Abraham: Let it not be troubling in your eyes about the lad…everything that Sarah says to you, heed her voice” (Genesis 21:12). From here you learn that Abraham was subordinate to Sarah in prophecy. Immediately, “Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water…” (Genesis 21:14), teaching you that he hated Ishmael because he set out on a path of depravity, and sent him and his mother Hagar emptyhanded, and for that reason expelled him from his home.  Is it conceivable that Abraham, in whose regard it is written: “Abram was very wealthy in livestock, in silver, and in gold” (Genesis 13:2), would send his wife and his son from his house emptyhanded, without garments and without sustenance? Rather, it is to teach you that once he [Ishmael] set out on the path of depravity, he [Abraham] paid no attention to him. (Consequently the verse states that he gave them bread and water, implying that he did not give them other means of support. )  What ultimately became of him? When he banished him, he sat at the crossroads and would rob people, as it is stated: “He will be a wild man” (Genesis 16:12).  Similarly, “Isaac loved Esau” (Genesis 25:28); therefore he set out on a path of depravity, because he did not chasten him, as we learned: The wicked Esau violated five transgressions on that day. He consorted with a betrothed young woman, killed a person, denied the revival of the dead, denied the principle [of belief in God], and scorned the birthright. In addition, he desired the death of his father and sought to kill his brother, as it is stated: “Let the days of mourning for my father approach and I will kill Jacob my brother” (Genesis 27:41), and he caused Jacob to flee from his fathers.  And he [Esau] too went to Ishmael to learn from him the path of depravity and to add to his wives, as it is stated; “Esau went to Ishmael, [and took Maḥalat the daughter of Ishmael…in addition to his wives, as his wife]” (Genesis 28:9).  Similarly, David did not chastise Avshalom and did not chasten him, [and Avshalom] set out on the path of depravity. He sought to kill his father, he lay with his [father’s] concubines, and forced him to walk barefoot, weeping; and thousands and tens of thousands from Israel fell. In addition, he caused him endless hardships, as it is written: “A psalm by David when he fled from Avshalom, etc.” (Psalms 3:1). What is written afterward? “Lord, how numerous are my tormentors, etc.” (Psalms 3:2). The path of depravity (A wayward child)  in a person’s household is worse than the war of Gog and Magog, as regarding Gog and Magog it is written: “Why do nations rage and peoples meditate in vain?” (Psalms 2:1), and there it is written: “Lord, how numerous are my tormentors.”  David acted similarly with Adoniya, as he did not chasten him with chastisement and he did not scold him; therefore, he set out on the path of depravity, as it is written: “His father never distressed him, [saying: Why did you do so? …and she bore him after Avshalom]” (I Kings 1:6). But wasn’t Avshalom the son of Maakha, and Adoniyahu the son of Ḥaggit? What is: “And she bore him after Avshalom”? Rather, because [Avshalom] set out on the path of depravity because his father did not chasten him, and in Adoniyahu’s regard, it is written: “His father never distressed him,” he, too, set out on the path to depravity. Therefore, it is written: “And she bore him after Avshalom.”   “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition” (Proverbs 13:24); this is the Holy One blessed be He. It is because he loves Israel, as it is written: “I have loved you, said the Lord” (Malachi 1:2) that he promotes them through suffering. You find three excellent gifts that the Holy One blessed be He gave to Israel, and he gave them all to them by means of suffering: The Torah, the Land of Israel, and life in the World to Come. The Torah, as it is written: “Happy is the man whom You afflict, Lord, whom You teach from Your Torah” (Psalms 94:12). The Land of Israel, as it is written: “For you know in your heart [that as a man rebukes his son, so the Lord your God rebukes you]” (Deuteronomy 8:5); what is written after it: “For the Lord your God will bring you [to a good land]” (Deuteronomy 8:7). The World to Come, as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, the Torah is light, [and the reproofs of instruction are the way of life]” (This indicates that the way to merit everlasting life is through reproof, which involves suffering. )  (Proverbs 6:23).  Anyone who chastises his son, the son adds love for his father and he honors him, as it is stated: “Admonish your son, and he will give you rest [and provide delights to your soul]” (Proverbs 29:17), and it is stated: “Admonish your son, as there is hope” (Proverbs 19:18). And he adds love for him, as it is stated: “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition” – because he sought for him admonition, therefore he loves him.  You find that Abraham chastised his son Isaac, taught him Torah, and guided him in his path, as it is written in Abraham’s regard: “Because Abraham heeded My voice, [and kept My commission, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws]” (Genesis 26:5), and it is written: “And this is the legacy of Isaac, Abraham’s son: [Abraham begot Isaac]” (Genesis 25:19), to teach you that he was similar to his father in every sense; in beauty, wisdom, wealth, and good deeds.  Know [that Isaac internalized Abraham’s lessons and accepted his authority], for he was thirty-seven years old when his father bound him, and it is written: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years” (Genesis 24:1), and he bound him and tied him, and [Isaac] did not prevent [him from doing so]. Therefore, “Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac” (Genesis 25:5); that is: “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition.”  Similarly, Isaac would seek admonition for Jacob, as he taught him Torah and chastised him in his study hall, as it is stated: “Jacob was a simple man, [a dweller in tents]” (Genesis 25:27). He learned what his father taught him and then he took his leave from his father and secluded himself in the house of Ever to study Torah. Therefore, he merited blessing and inherited the land, as it is stated: “Jacob settled in the land of his father's residence, in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 37:1).  Jacob our patriarch, too, chastised his sons, chastened them, and taught them his ways, until ultimately, there were none among them who was defective, as it is written: “These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt [with Jacob]” (Exodus 1:1); the verse likened them all to Jacob, as they were all righteous like he was. That is: “And he who loves him seeks for him admonition.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>“Like columns of smoke.” Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: When Israel was wandering from journey to journey, the pillar of cloud would descend and the pillar of fire would ascend, and the smoke from the arrangement of wood [on the altar] would ascend like two sparks of fire. (From the two altars, the copper altar used for sacrificial offerings and the gold altar used for incense.)  They would emerge from between the two staves of the Ark and burn before them snakes, fiery serpents, and scorpions. The nations of the world would see and say: ‘They are gods and all their actions are performed with fire.’ Due to their terror of Israel, fear and trembling would beset them. That is what is written: “Terror and fear will beset them” (Exodus 15:16). “Beset them” is not written, but rather “will beset them”—from here and on. “Perfumed with myrrh,” this is our patriarch Abraham. Just as myrrh is the first of all the spices, (See Exodus 30:23.)  so too, Abraham our patriarch was the first of all the righteous. Just as myrrh, anyone who gathers it, his hands have a bitter residue, so too, Abraham our patriarch would embitter and torment himself with suffering. Just as myrrh emanates its fragrance only in fire, so Abraham divulged his good deeds only in the fiery furnace. (Abraham was thrown into a fiery furnace due to his rejection of idolatry (see Bereshit Rabba 38:13).)   “And frankincense,” this is our patriarch Isaac, who was sacrificed like a handful of frankincense on the altar. “With all the powders of the merchant,” this is Jacob our patriarch, whose bed was unflawed and no waste was found among them. (In contrast to Abraham and Isaac, all of Jacob’s sons were righteous.)  Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Just as there are all kinds of spices in the peddler’s box, so too, priesthood is from Jacob, and Levites and royalty from Jacob. Isaac, Abraham gave him everything that was his, as it is stated: “Abraham gave everything that was his to Isaac” (Genesis 25:5). However, all of Jacob’s wares were only from the dust that was beneath his feet. (He solidified his hold on the blessings he received only in the aftermath of his struggle with Esau’s angel, symbolized by dust [avak], as the verse states: “A man wrestled [vaye’avek] with him there” (Genesis 32:25). See Genesis 32:25–30. (Matnot Kehuna).)  Rabbi Yudan said two [statements]. Rabbi Yudan said: All the wares with which Israel engages and is successful in this world are due to the merit of that dust of Jacob our patriarch. Rabbi Yudan said another: All the merchandise (The midrash is using the term merchandise to refer to large-scale business, as opposed to “wares,” which is seen as small-scale peddling.)  that Israel produces and succeeds with in this world are due to the merit of that dust of Jacob our patriarch. Rabbi Azarya said two [statements]: All the wars in which Israel engages and succeeds are due to the merit of that dust of Jacob our patriarch. Rabbi Azarya said another: All the Torah that Israel performs in this world is due to the merit of Jacob our patriarch. Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Simon [said] in the name of Rabbi Abahu: That dust, the Holy One blessed be He took it and placed it under His throne of glory. That is what is written: “The Lord, his way is in the tempest and in the storm, and clouds are the dust of his feet” (Nahum 1:3).</p>

            <summary>Sforno explains that Avram's son would succeed him while he was still alive, as seen in Genesis 25:5-6. Redeeming Relevance suggests that Sarah's death during the Akeida was an inevitable consequence and added to Avraham's test of submission, explaining the disappearance of Yitzchak from the text. Ramban discusses the deed of gift given to Yitzchak and the transposition of goods, while Ibn Ezra explains the duty of a husband's brother in levirate marriage. Chizkuni notes that Avraham did not give Ishmael silver or gold due to his degeneracy and lack of inheritance, intending to give him gifts after Sarah's death.</summary>

              <p>ויקח לחם וחמת מים, “he took bread and hose full of water.” Rashi points out that he did not give Hagar silver or gold, as he himself had grown to dislike Ishmael, seeing that he had become a degenerate. Besides, at this stage Avraham did not have any “inheritance” at his disposal that he could give away, seeing that he himself was only a stranger in the land, just as was his son Ishmael. We have learned in the Talmud Kidushin 17 that when a father and a son convert to Judaism they are both “strangers,” i.e. converts, but no longer legally considered as related to one another. As a result, there does not exist a “fatherson” relationship to base any inheritance claim on. (Choshen Mishpot 283) Nonetheless, it had been Avraham’s intention after Sarah’s death to give his son Ishmael “gifts,” as opposed to an inheritance, as is clear from how he treated the sons of Keturah, his concubine after Sarah’s death (and Yitzchok having married and having received his full inheritance. Genesis 25,5).</p>

              <p>AND ALL THE GOODS OF HIS MASTER BEING IN HIS HAND. Rashi comments: “This refers to a deed of gift of all his possessions which he wrote in favor of Isaac so that they would be eager to send him their daughter.” And so it is also stated in Bereshith Rabbah, (59:15.)  “He carried with him a disposition of property.” According to this opinion, the verse stating, And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac, (Further, 25:5.)  means that he caused him to take possession of the belonging at the time of his death so that the other children would not contest his ownership, just as it is said, And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived. (Ibid., Verse 6.)  If so, the word “taking” applies also to the first part of the verse, And the servant ‘took’ ten camels, and departed, and all the goods of his master he took in his hand. Perhaps [the words of the verse are to be transposed as follows]: “And the servant took ten camels and all the goods of his master in his hand, and departed.” Others (This interpretation is found in the commentary of Chizkuni.)  explain the sense of the verse as meaning that immediately upon being sworn, the servant himself went and took many camels from his master’s camels because all his master’s goods were in his hand, he being the officer and captain over all and authorized to take from him whatever he desired, just as the verse says, that ruled over all that he had. (Verse 2 here.)  The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the meaning of this verse is similar to that of the verse concerning Hazael, general of Aram, And Hazael went to meet him [Elisha the prophet], and took a present with him, and every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, (II Kings 8:9.)  [which means “and ‘of’ every good thing of Damascus].” Here too Scripture states that he took in his hand of all his master’s goods ten camels’ burden. The sense of the verse concerning Hazael is that the camels carried all that was good and excellent among those species of fruits and precious things that were found in Damascus or in his master’s house, and in addition they carried a present with them. In a similar sense is the verse, ten asses laden with the good of Egypt, (Further, 45:23.)  [which means laden with the good and excellent fruits of Egypt]. The verses, however, shorten expressions when the subjects are understood.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>If we are to understand the Midrash as recording an actual historical event, it would seem reasonable to say that here, too, God made a necessary trade-off. The test of the Akeida could not be accomplished without Sarah dying in the way that she did. In addition to being an inevitable consequence, her death could be one more component of the test itself. As mentioned earlier, God made every facet of Avraham’s test as difficult as is possible. Since, according to the Midrash, Sarah’s death was an obvious consequence of the Akeida, Avraham may well have realized that his killing Yitzchak would likely result in the death of Sarah as well. This thought would have served as one more devastating psychological barrier for Avraham in his test of submission. (Viewing the tangential events surrounding the Akeida as additional facets of Avraham’s test also solves another problem that has troubled commentators from the Talmudic period to the present: After we read of Avraham and Yitzchak’s every action on the way to the Akeida, Yitzchak mysteriously disappears (most conspicuously in Bereshit 22:19), only to reappear several chapters later. When he reappears, Avraham inexplicably disappears. The next time that they clearly reappear together is at Avraham’s funeral. (In Bereshit 25:5 when we are told that Avraham gave his inheritance to Yitzchak, that does not imply that he did so in Yitzchak’s presence.) Many explanations are tendered, but they all seem forced, or divorced, from the story line. Could it be that Yitzchak did go back home – but without Avraham? After the Akeida, the human bond between father and son was forever ruptured. Even though Yitzchak agreed with every action taken by his father, a human being cannot see his father in the act of killing him and remain the same. Yitzchak’s associations with his father could no longer be what they were before this pivotal event in both of their lives. Yitzchak’s “disappearance” is another indication of the inevitable cost of a test such as the Akeida.) </p>

But the secondary things of the daily duties are fitting to the imperfect, who have risen only to the primary learning of the schools.

These were the “gifts” he bestowed upon the sons of the concubine(s).

Job is described there as the most outstanding personality in the whole ארץ קדם, the land given (in part) to the sons of Avraham’s concubine(s). We are entitled therefore to consider the land of Utz as identical with the region of Aram.</p>

              <p>נתן אברהם מתנות, “Avraham had already given gifts.” According to the Talmud in tractate Sanhedrin folio 91, these “gifts” were the ability to utter the names of the holy name of the Lord without thereby incurring severe harm. Even nowadays, according to our author, the Moslems who are trained in theology are able to do this without coming to any harm thereby. It was difficult for Rabbi Moses to understand how Avraham a great and devout man could possibly have taught the holy Name of the Lord to wicked people. In view of this problem, Rabbi Yaakov, son of Rabbi Nachman, interpreted that line in the Talmud differently by saying that the word טומאה used in the Talmud there refers to the names of certain demons. The names of these demons are associated with the evil spirits making their homes in certain ruins, or certain cemeteries as described by the Talmud in tractate Chagigah folio 3. This is alluded to by the fact that the spelling of the word “matanot” is spelled as if it were a singular, the letter ו having been omitted. As spelled in the Torah here, the numerical value of the letters in the words נתן אברהם מתנת equals the numerical value of למדם להשביע השדים. [I have not quite figured this out. At any rate, the idea is that Avraham taught these sons of his how, when they used the names of deities when swearing an oath, they could do it in such a way as not to be guilty of violating the third of the Ten Commandments. To The reader who is interested in pursuing this further I suggest that he turns to the commentary on Sanhedrin 91 by Rabbi Reuven Margolies, page 136 מרגליות הים. Ed.]

              <p>EASTWARD. Kedemah (eastward) means unto the East country. And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon (Jer. 27:8) (This is the literal reading of the verse. J.P.S. translates, And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.)  is similar. East means east of the land of Israel. (Eastward refers to the entire eastern compass point, be it northeast or southeast (Weiser). According to this interpretation unto the east country is an explanation of eastward in the same way that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is an explanation of him.)  Others say that kedemah (eastward) means to the place where the son of Ishmael dwelt. (This explanation is that kedemah means to Kedemah. Kedemah was a son of Ishmael (v. 15). According to this interpretation the verse is not redundant in stating unto the east country, for it is telling us where Kedemah dwelt.)  The first of these two interpretations is the correct one.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ולבני הפילגשים אשר לאברהם, “and to the sons of the concubines who were Abraham’s, etc.” According to Bereshit Rabbah 61,4, the word פלגשם is spelled without the letter י which indicates a plural ending, suggesting that Avraham had only one concubine ever, Hagar, and that he had remarried her after Yitzchak was married. Keturah was none other than Hagar whom we know from both Lech Lecha and Vayera. The reason she is here called פלגש, “concubine,” is only because she was descended from slaves. In 16,3 she was called אשה, “wife,” because Avraham had given her a כתובה, a financial settlement, something not given to concubines. Sanhedrin 21 explains the verse in a similar fashion. [Our versions of the Torah have פילגשים with an extra letter י, not without any letter י. Ed.]  The reason why the Torah did not tell us whose daughter Keturah was may have been that she was a Canaanite and therefore the Torah did not want to bother with her genealogy, (Nachmanides). Had she been Egyptian, or from any nation other than the Canaanites, the Torah would have given us more details about her background. We have proof of this when the Torah detailed the genealogy of the women whom Esau and Ishmael married (compare 28,9). Seeing that Keturah was a member of an accursed nation, the Torah preferred not to go into details (for the sake of Avraham?) Do not question me how it was possible for Avraham to marry a local Canaanite woman after he had made such a point of making even his trusted servant Eliezer swear that he would not take a woman of Canaanite descent for his son Yitzchak. The prohibition never applied to anyone with the exception of Yitzchak who was predestined to carry on the line of Avraham and to be a further link in the formation of the Jewish people. Only concerning Yitzchak had G’d said: “for through Yitzchak your seed shall be known” (Genesis 21,12). Once Yitzchak was married and the stage had been set for fulfilment of the prophecy that Yitzchak would become the founding father of the Jewish people, Avraham had no reason not to marry any woman who was qualfied as suitable for him on the strength of her personal virtues. Bereshit Rabbah 61,4 which held that Keturah was none other than Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, Avraham’s other son, claims that the name Keturah reflects the concept of קטורת, incense, because her personal deeds were as pleasing to G’d as incense is to Him as a sacrificial offering. The approach reflected by this Midrash would account for the fact that this paragraph has been introduced with the words ויסף אברהם ויקח, “Avraham continued and married (remarried), etc.” After all, she had already been his servant before he had expelled her at the command of G’d and Sarah. The expression ויוסף has been used also in that sense in Genesis 35,26 when the Torah reports that Yehudah did not again sleep with Tamar after he had become aware of her true identity.</p>

He gave them gifts consisting of silver and gold and livestock according to his own evaluation of who deserved how much. He most certainly gave even more valuable gifts to Ishmael and to the sons of Keturah even though the Torah does not specifically mentions this. If he gave gifts to people towards whom he had no legal obligation at all, it is obvious that people towards whom he did have such an obligation would receive their due.</p>

              <p>BUT UNTO THE SONS OF THE CONCUBINES, THAT ABRAHAM HAD. By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, since it was said to Abraham, For in Isaac shall seed be called to thee, (Above, 21:12.)  and in no other seed, all his consorts were concubines to him, not as wives since their children would not be among his heirs. Thus, Hagar, Sarah’s handmaid, was his concubine. However, Keturah he took unto himself as a wife for if she whom he took as a concubine had been a handmaid in his house, Scripture would not have said, And Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah. (Verse 1 here.)  She is called “concubine” in Scripture — it is written in Chronicles, And the sons of Keturah, Abraham’s concubine (I Chronicles 1:32.)  — only for the reason that I have explained, [namely, that it had been said to Abraham, For in Isaac shall seed be called to thee]. Thus we note that Abraham took unto himself a wife from the daughters of Canaan! And should you say that she was an Egyptian or from the land of the Philistines, we may yet question why he did not send to his country and to his kindred as he did in the case of his son. But the answer is that he guarded only the seed of Isaac since it was concerning him that the Covenant was made. Furthermore, Scripture does not say, “And Abraham took a wife by the name of Keturah, the daughter of a certain Hivite or Philistine or Egyptian from a certain land,” as it says concerning Esau’s wives (Further, 26:34 and 28:9.)  and similar cases. Rather, Scripture mentions only Keturah’s name because she was a Canaanite, and therefore it cut short her genealogy. Scripture does so in many places where it is not concerned with the genealogy. Perhaps Keturah was called “concubine” because she was a handmaid who was descended from a family of slaves. And if she was a handmaid in his [Abraham’s] household and he had connection with her, Scripture would not mention her genealogy since even among the matriarchs, such as Zilpah and Bilhah, it mentions only their names. Now Rashi wrote, “Wives are those whom a man marries with a marriage-contract; concubines have no marriage-contract, as it says in reference to the wives and concubines of David, in Tractate Sanhedrin.” (21a.)  But the matter is not so. A woman is called a concubine only when there is no betrothal, for a marriage-contract is only a Rabbinic ordinance. And the correct text in Tractate Sanhedrin is: “A concubine has no marriage-contract or betrothal.” However, it is possible that the sons of Noah (See Seder Bereshith, Note 222.)  too when they married wives, as is their law, by intercourse, were accustomed to write them a marriage-contract which granted dowry and gift. (Further, 34:12.)  However, for one who wished to be a concubine to them, whom he could send away when he pleased and whose children would not be among his heirs, he would not write anything. But according to the opinion of our Rabbis that Keturah is Hagar, (Bereshith Rabbah 61:4.)  she was certainly a concubine [since it clearly says that Hagar was Sarah’s handmaid]. (Above, 16:1.) </p>

              <p>ולבני הפילגשים, “and to the sons of the concubines, etc” No doubt Hagar’s status in the household of Avraham had been that of a concubine, whereas Keturah was his wife in the full sense of that term. If she had been a servant maid in his household and he had raised her to the status of concubine the Torah would not have described this as ויקח אשה ושמה קטורה, “He married a woman named Keturah.” If the Torah here describes Keturah as a concubine, this was only since G’d had decreed that Yitzchok would be Avraham’s sole heir, so that sons from any other woman would have to content themselves with gifts handed to them during their father’s lifetime. Avraham had taken these women from the Caaanite women, for if Keturah had been an Egyptian or Philistine by birth the Torah could not have said that Avraham dispatched these sons somewhere to the Far East, but he would have sent them back to Egypt or the land of the Philistines when their mother had come. The prohibition of marrying Canaanite women applied only to Avraham’s heirs, not to children who would not inherit his estate, and thus represent his outlook on life.

              <p>“To Abraham’s sons by the concubines, Abraham gave gifts” [25:6]. Abraham gave gifts to the children of the concubines. The Torah wrote the word concubines without a yud. This shows that he had only one concubine and she was called Keturah. Abraham took her because she was pious. Rabbi (Most likely, this is a printing mistake and it should say Rashi. In Hebrew the difference is changing the letter bet to shin. The context also supports this view.)  asks a question. Why does the verse call her wife, as the verse says, “he took a wife” [25:1]. Later Scripture calls her a concubine. This means, a concubine. The explanation is that a concubine has no marriage contract, but Hagar did have a marriage contract, but she was like a concubine. That is why the verse calls her a wife, that is to say, an important woman. For her children to inherit, she was like a concubine. (Rashi, Genesis, 25:6.)  Rashi asks another question. If Abraham had given everything to Isaac, what presents did he give to the children of the concubines? The explanation is that he gave them an impure name. That is, he taught them the names of demons and magic. (Ibid.)  Another explanation of impure name is that Abraham taught them to be able to utilize the name even when they were impure, since they did not maintain a state of purity. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 25:6.)  Debek Tov asks a question. Why did Abraham do this? The explanation is that Abraham knew well that they would come among the nations and they would worship idols. That is why he taught them the name of the Holy One. Even when they will be impure, they should not commit sins. (Devek Tov, Genesis 25:6, note 30.)  Rashi asks a question. Abraham had given a letter to Isaac that he would inherit everything when Eliezer went for Rebecca. Why did he give it again here? Rabbi Nehemiah gives an explanation. He gave the blessings into his hands. He should bless whomever he wants and whomever he will bless will be blessed. (Rashi, Genesis, 25:5.) </p>

            <summary>The hegemony was apportioned to Jacob and Esau, both called &quot;the generations of Isaac&quot; due to their strong bond. Unlike Ishmael, who is not referred to as &quot;the generations of Abraham,&quot; Esau is still reckoned as Isaac's son. Isaac favored Jacob and Esau equally, almost making Esau his favorite son. Their intertwined fates are reflected in their designation as &quot;the generations of Isaac,&quot; with their later history foreshadowed in the Parshah.</summary>

              <p>We see, then, that the hegemony was apportioned to these two twins, each to inherit it at different times. And because of this strong bond between them they were both called &quot;the generations of Isaac,&quot; for which reason the parshah opens (Genesis 25:19): &quot;And these are the generations of Isaac…&quot; That is, these two, Jacob and Esau, the subjects of this Parshah, are the generations of Isaac. For though Esau was an evildoer, he is still reckoned as Isaac's son — unlike Ishmael (Genesis [21:10]: &quot;…for the son of this bondwoman will not inherit with my son, Isaac&quot;), who is not accorded the honor of being referred to as &quot;the generations of Abraham,&quot; as Isaac is, for which reason it is added &quot;Abraham begot Isaac.&quot; The reason for this is that Isaac and Ishmael were not equally beloved of Abraham; but he made Isaac the apple of his eye and bequeathed to him the glory of his wealth, whereas to the sons of the concubines he gave gifts and sent them away form Isaac. After that they had no relationship with Isaac whatsoever and deserved to be forgotten. This was not the case, however, with Jacob and Esau vis-à-vis Isaac — to the point that it was almost Esau who was his favorite son! For both of them were the sons of the noble mistress [Rivkah], attached to each other from birth and conception, and conjoined in kingdom almost forever, as I have explained. For this reason Esau's name cannot be forgotten, though he be an evil-doer, for our fates are so inextricably intertwined. For this reason both of these children are referred to as &quot;the generations of Isaac,&quot; and the parshah goes on to describe how their later history is foreshadowed.</p>

            <summary>Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines, sending them away from Isaac his son; he sent them eastward to avoid confrontation with Isaac. Gevia ben Kosem defended Israel against claims from Ishmael, Canaanites, and Egyptians in the days of Alexander of Macedonia, using Torah references to prove ownership of the land. Abraham's concubines were sent away by him during his lifetime, and the Midrash discusses the significance of this act, highlighting the importance of legacies and additions in biblical narratives.</summary>

              <p>“And her name was Ketura” – Rav said: This is Hagar. Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: ‘But is it not written “[Abraham took] another [vayosef]”?’ He said to him: ‘[That means only that] he married her on the basis of a divine command, just as it says: “The Lord continued [vayosef] speaking to me again, saying”’ (Isaiah 8:5). He said to him: ‘But is it not written “and her name was Ketura”?’ He said to him: ‘That is because she was perfumed [mekuteret] with mitzvot and good deeds.’ [He said to him:] But is it not written: “And to the sons of the concubines (Plural. If Hagar and Ketura were one and the same, Abraham would have had only one concubine.)  of Abraham [Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was still alive…]”?’ (Genesis 25:6). He said to him: ‘Pilagsham (The omission of the yud intimates that the word could be interpreted as a single concubine.)  is written. “While he was still alive [ḥai]” – [this alludes to Hagar] the one who had sat by the well and said to the One who lives [ḥai] forever: See my misery.’  Rabbi Berekhya said: Even though it says: “She [Hagar] went off and wandered in the wilderness…” (Genesis 21:14), lest you say that perhaps some person was suspected [of becoming immorally involved] with her, the verse states: “And her name was Ketura” – from the word ‘bound up’ [ketar]; she was like one who seals a treasure and takes it out bound and sealed. (Her name indicates that she was chaste after leaving Abraham.)   Bar Kappara said: Additions [tosafto] that are granted by the Holy One blessed be He are even greater than the original item. Cain was the original son [of Eve], and Abel, because he was considered an addition, as it is written: “She continued [vatosef] giving birth…[to Abel]” (Genesis 4:2) – he was born with his two twin sisters. (Whereas Cain was born with just one twin sister (see Bereshit Rabba 22:2).)    Joseph was the original son [of Rachel], and Benjamin, because addition is written in his regard, (See Genesis 30:24.)  he produced ten children, as it is written: “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Bekher…” (Genesis 46:21).   Er was the original son [of Judah], and Shela, because an expression of addition is used for him, (See Genesis 38:5.)  he produced ten courts. That is what is written in Chronicles: “The sons of Shela son of Judah: Er, father (The term father in this passage refers to the head of a court.)  of Lekha; and Lada father of Maresha; and the families of the house of the craft of fine linen, of the house of Ashbe’a...” (I Chronicles 4:21–23).  Job’s age was originally (Before he began to suffer from his afflictions.)  only seventy years, and one hundred and forty years were added to his life, as it is written: “After this, Job lived for one hundred and forty years” (Job 42:16).  Hezekiah’s original reign (Before being reprimanded by Isaiah and praying for forgiveness (Isaiah 38:1–3).)  was only fourteen years, but fifteen years were added to it, as it is stated: “Behold, I am adding fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5).  Ishmael was the original son, and the sons of Ketura, because an expression of addition is used regarding them (Genesis 25:1.)  [the verse tells us] “She bore him Zimran…” (Genesis 25:2). (The verse goes on to list six children.) </p>

              <p>“But to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, during his lifetime, eastward, to the east country” (Genesis 25:6).  “But to the sons of the concubines…” – In the days of Alexander of Macedonia, the children of Ishmael came to lodge a claim against Israel regarding the birthright. Two evil families, the Canaanites and the Egyptians, came with them. They [the rabbis] said: ‘Who will go and contend with them?’ Gevia ben Kosem said: ‘I will go and contend with them.’ They told him: ‘Be careful that you do not cede the Land to them.’ He said: ‘I am going to contend with them; if I am victorious, it is well and good, and if not, you can always say: Who is this lowly person, that he should represent us?’ He went and contended with them. Alexander of Macedonia said to them: ‘Who is lodging a claim against whom?’ The Ishmaelites said: ‘We are lodging a claim against them [Israel], and it is on the basis of their own Torah that we come against them. It is written: “Rather, he shall acknowledge the firstborn, son of the hated wife [to give him a double portion]” (Deuteronomy 21:17). By right, Ishmael is entitled to receive a double portion.’ Gevia ben Kosem said to him: ‘My lord the king, may a person not do as he pleases for his owns sons?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘Is it not written: “Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac”?’ (Genesis 25:5). They said to him: ‘Where is the document of gifts that he divided among his sons?’ He said to them: “And to the sons of the concubines of Abraham, Abraham gave gifts.” They departed from there shamefacedly.  The Canaanites said: ‘It is on the basis of their own Torah that we come against them. It is written everywhere: “To the land of Canaan,” “the land of Canaan” – let them give us back our land.’ Gevia ben Kosem said to them: ‘My lord the king, may a person not do as he pleases with his slave?’ He said to him: ‘Yes.’ He said to him: ‘What is written? “Cursed is Canaan, a slave of slaves…. [And he said: Blessed be the Lord, God of Shem, and Canaan shall be slaves unto them]” (Genesis 9:25–26). The Land is ours and they are slaves to my lord the king.’ (Alexander, being a Greek, was descended from Yefet (Genesis 10:2), and Canaan was cursed to be a slave to Yefet as well (see Genesis 9:27).)  They departed from there shamefacedly.  The Egyptians said: ‘It is on the basis of their own Torah that we come against them. Six hundred thousand [Israelite] men departed from our midst laden with silver vessels and gold vessels, as it is written: “They stripped Egypt” (Exodus 12:36). Let them give us back our silver and our gold.’ Gevia ben Kosem said to him: ‘My lord the king, six hundred thousand people spent two hundred and ten years in their midst, among them silversmiths and among them goldsmiths, who normally receive one dinar a day as wages. The philosophers sat and calculated and did not even reach one hundred years [of labor] before the land of Egypt would be found to be bankrupt.’ They departed from there shamefacedly.  He [Alexander] once sought to ascend to Jerusalem. The Samaritans (Who were always antagonistic towards the Jews, and especially towards their Temple in Jerusalem (see Ezra chapter 4).)  went and said to him: ‘Be aware that they will not allow you to enter their Holy of Holies.’ When Gevia ben Kosem sensed this, he went and made two felt shoes for him and placed on them two gems, each valued at twenty thousand silver dinars. When he [Alexander] reached the Temple Mount, he [Gevia] said to him: ‘My lord the king, remove your shoes and put on these felt shoes, the floor being slippery, so your feet should not slip.’ (It is forbidden to enter the Temple Mount wearing shoes (Mishna Berakhot 9:6).)  When he reached the Holy of Holies, they said to him: ‘Until here we have permission to enter; from here on, we do not have permission to enter.’ He said to him [Gevia]: ‘When I leave here, I will flatten your forehead’ [variant reading: Your hump]. He said to him: ‘If you can do that, you would be an expert doctor, and could charge a great fee.’ (Gevia had a misshapen forehead or back.)   “And sent them away from Isaac his son [eastward, to the east country]” – he said to them: As far east as you can go, go east, (This explains the apparent repetitiveness of: “eastward, to the east country.”)  so you will not be burned by Isaac’s coals. (If you ever have a territorial dispute with Isaac, you will be burnt, so you had better keep your distance.)  But Esau, because he came to confront Jacob, he received his punishment from him. That is what is written: “Is it for you to be jovial, like those in antiquity whose legs led them afar to live? Who devised this against Tyre [Tzor] the glorious…” (The prophet is warning the people of Tzor not to be jovial in their confrontation with Israel. That would be the proper mood for those other descendants of Abraham, who went to settle far away from Israel to avoid such confrontation.)  (Isaiah 23:7–8). Rabbi Elazar said: Every instance of Tzor that is written in the Bible with a vav, the verse is speaking of the city of Tyre; when it is without a vav, the verse is speaking of Rome. (The Romans are considered to be descendants of Edom, or Esau.)  “The glorious [ma’atira]” – Rabbi Abba said: It was surrounded [with riches] like a crown [atara]. Rabbi Yanai said in the name of Rabbi Shimon son of Rabbi Yanai: It was surrounded by thorns. (According to this interpretation, the verse is not speaking of the glory of Tzor, but of its ultimate downfall and desolation.) </p>

See also above, 5:5.)  with trials, with an inn, (Gk.: pandokeion.)  and with a legatum.

The Holy One said: By your life, I am beginning &lt; the aging process &gt; with you, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): NOW ABRAHAM WAS AGED. (Heb.: zaqen. In Scripture (Gen. 18:11) Abraham and Sarah are the first persons to whom this word is applied.)  • With trials: Where is it shown? Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, if you had not given contentment to the generation of the flood, they would not have provoked you to anger. But, if you had brought trials upon them, they would not have rebelled against you. The Holy One said to him: With you I am beginning to have one suffer trials through his child. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 21:8.): SO THE CHILD (Isaac) GREW AND WAS WEANED. (The passage goes on to show how the weaning led in vs. 11 to Abraham being distressed.)  {R. Joshua} [R. Osha'ya] and R. Abbin differed. (Gen. R. 53:10.)  The one said that he was weaned from trials. The other said that he was weaned from the evil drive to the good drive. • With an inn, according to what is written (in Gen. 21:33): AND AT BEER-SHEBA HE PLANTED AN ESHEL, i.e., an inn. (Eshel, which is commonly translated here as “tamarisk tree,” can also mean “inn.” Gen. R. 54:6; Sot. 10a.)  • With a legatum {i.e., a gift}: Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 25:6): BUT TO ABRAHAM'S SONS BY CONCUBINES ABRAHAM GAVE GIFTS. </p>

The reason that the word פלגשם in that verse is spelled defectively, without the letter י to indicate the plural ending, is to allude to the name i.e. שם of the קליפה.

              <p>A Midrashic (Bereshit Rabbah 59,11) approach: the words וכל טוב אדוניו בידו, “all the bounty of his master in his hand,” refer to a document which Eliezer carried in his hand in which Avraham had appointed Yitzchak as his sole heir. Avraham had done this in order to encourage the parents of any bride Eliezer would choose to allow their daughter to marry out of the country. The Torah writes: “in his hand,” to inform us of this. The word וילך, “he went,” is also meant to draw attention to this, as obviously, Eliezer did not “walk” all that way but rode on one of the camels. The combined words וילך וכל טוב אדוניו בידו, are a clear hint that Eliezer walked while holding something in his hand. What did he hold in his hand? “The gift-certificate donating all of Avraham’s wealth to his son Yitzchak,” in the event that he would not be alive when the servant returned. The word וילך appears a second time in the same verse to show that Eliezer set out armed with such a document which was going to be helpful to his mission.  According to this interpretation, the words ויתן אברהם את כל אשר לו ליצחק, “Avraham (now) gave all that was his to Yitzchak,” a verse we find only in 25,5 have been repeated there only in order to forestall any claims by any other children of Avraham to part of his estate. The fact is he had already given his accumulated wealth to Yitzchak before the sons of Keturah had been born. They only shared in possessions Avraham acquired after he had remarried.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND, BEHOLD, A CARAVAN OF ISHMAELITES CAME FROM GILEAD. When they looked up and saw at a distance men approaching from the direction of Gilead, (Ramban’s intent is to explain why Scripture refers to these men first as Ishmaelites, then as Midianites (Verse 28), and again as Ishmaelites (ibid.), and finally as Midianites (Verse 36).)  they recognized them as a camel caravan of Ishmaelites on their way to Egypt, for it was from Gilead that balms and spices came, and it was their custom to bring it to Egypt. This was why Judah said to them, “Behold these men come from afar and are travelling to a distant country. Let us sell him to them so that the matter should not become known.” And when they came near they discovered them to be merchants of spices and balms — Midianites, merchantmen (Verse 28 here.)  — who had hired the camels from the Ishmaelites. They sold Joseph to the Midianites who purchased him for profit, but the company of Ishmaelites, the lessors of the camels, would not purchase him for their own investment purposes. The verse which states, And they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites, (Verse 28 here.)  means that it was to them that the Midianites who bought him turned him over, for they were the ones who transported the merchandise to Egypt. This is also the meaning of the verse, From the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither, (39:1.)  for he was in their care. But the Midianites were his masters, and they made trade with him. This is the sense of the verse, And the Midianites sold him to Egypt. (Verse 36 here.)  All stories in Scripture are written in this manner: sometimes it is told in the name of the authority who commands that it be done, and other times in the name of the agent who performs the act. Such a case is the verse, All the great work of the Eternal which He did, (Deuteronomy 11:7.)  while elsewhere it states, Which Moses did in the sight of all Israel. (Ibid., 34:12.)  Similarly it says, Thus all the work that king Solomon did in the house of the Eternal was finished, (I Kings 7:51.)  but it was Hiram that did it, as it is written, And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. (Ibid., Verse 14.)  In the case of Joseph himself, the verse says, And whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it, (Further, 39:22.)  thus ascribing the action both to he who commanded it and the one who did it. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra says that the Midianites are called Ishmaelites, just as Scripture, in speaking of Midianite kings, says, Because they were Ishmaelites. (Judges 8:24.)  But the matter is not as Ibn Ezra considered it to be since the verse which states, For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites, (Judges 8:24.)  alludes to “the children of the east” whose war it was, as it is written, Now all the Midianites and Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together, (Ibid., 6:33.)  and “the children of the east” are Ishmaelites, for concerning all the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, it is said, And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. (Above, 25:6.)  It is also possible that the kings were Ishmaelites who ruled over Midian. Otherwise, why should “kings of Midian” (Judges 8:26.)  be called by the name of Ishmael their brother? In line with the literal sense of Scripture the correct interpretation concerning the sale of Joseph is as we have said. But our Rabbis have said (Bereshith Rabbah 84:2.)  that he was sold several times [and have thereby explained why his captors are alternately referred to as Midianites and Ishmaelites].</p>

As soon then as this was over, she introduced the stranger; and for the camels, the servants of Laban brought them in, and took care of them; and he was himself brought in to supper by Laban. And, after supper, he says to him, and to the mother of the damsel, addressing himself to her, &quot;Abraham is the son of Terah, and a kinsman of yours; for Nahor, the grandfather of these children, was the brother of Abraham, by both father and mother; upon which account he hath sent me to you, being desirous to take this damsel for his son to wife. He is his legitimate son, and is brought up as his only heir. He could indeed have had the most happy of all the women in that country for him, but he would not have his son marry any of them; but, out of regard to his own relations, he desired him to match here, whose affection and inclination I would not have you despise; for it was by the good pleasure of God that other accidents fell out in my journey, and that thereby I lighted upon your daughter and your house; for when I was near to the city, I saw a great many maidens coming to a well, and I prayed that I might meet with this damsel, which has come to pass accordingly. Do you therefore confirm that marriage, whose espousals have been already made by a Divine appearance; and show the respect you have for Abraham, who hath sent me with so much solicitude, in giving your consent to the marriage of this damsel.&quot; Upon this they understood it to be the will of God, and greatly approved of the offer, and sent their daughter, as was desired. Accordingly Isaac married her, the inheritance being now come to him; for the children by Keturah were gone to their own remote habitations.</p>

            <summary>Abraham was a giant, with the height and strength of seventy-four men, who built a city for his sons and gave them precious stones for the future. Og, identified as Eliezer, was huge and built sixty cities, consuming vast amounts of food and drink. Jacob tested his sons with stones, eventually revealing Joseph's true identity. Rebekah was miraculously protected from defilement, and Dinah bore Asenath at the age of six before being taken by the Archangel Michael to Potiphar's house.</summary>

                <h4>Tractate Soferim 21:9</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(From this point to the end of the tractate is an aggadic addendum.)  The greatest man among the Anakim (Josh. 14, 15.) —among the Anakim refers to our father Abraham whose height was equal to that of seventy-four men; his eating and drinking were of a similar proportion, equal to those of seventy-four men; so too his strength. What did he do? (This is probably a reference to Gen. 25, 6, But unto the sons of the concubines … Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away … eastward, unto the east country.)  He removed the sixteen (So GRA in accordance with Gen. 25, 2-4. V, M and H incorrectly ‘seventeen’.)  sons of Keturah, built for them a walled city of iron and settled them in it. The sun never penetrated into it because it was exceedingly high, so Abraham handed to them disks of precious stones and pearls of which use will be made (So GRA. V, M and H read, ‘and they will be used’.)  in the hereafter when the Holy One, blessed be He, will cause the sun and moon to be confounded, as it is written, When the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, (Is. 24, 23.)  because use will be made of these [disks as luminaries]. Og (King of Bashan; Deut. 3, 11.)  is identical with Eliezer, (Abraham’s servant; cf. Gen. 15, 2, XXIV, 2ff.)  and [he was so huge that] he could hide Abraham’s feet in the palm of his hand. Once he was rebuked [by Abraham] and from fright his tooth fell out. Abraham picked it up and made ivory beds of it in which he slept. Others say that he made of it a chair which he used (lit. ‘and sat in it’.)  all his life. Who gave him to Abraham? Nimrod. (Mentioned in Gen. 10, 8ff.)  Og went and built sixty cities, the smallest of which was sixty miles high, as it is stated, Threescore cities, all the region of Argob. (Deut. 3, 4.)  And what did he eat? A thousand oxen and the same [number of] other animals, and his drink consisted of a thousand measures. A (So GRA. V, M and H read ‘and what was the’.)  drop of his semen weighed thirty-six pounds. (V and H add ‘and so for all generations’, which makes no sense.)  It was taught: What did our father Jacob do when his sons brought him the coat [stained] with blood? (Cf. Gen. 37, 31ff.)  He did not believe them at all. Whence do we infer this? For it is written, But he refused to be comforted, (ibid. 35.)  because no consolations are acceptable for a living person. One, however, who is dead passes naturally from the mind, (lit. ‘he is forgotten from the heart of his own accord’.)  as it is stated, I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind. (Ps. 31, 13.)  What then did he do? He proceeded to make a test with sheaves, (GRA transposes the order of V, M and H by putting the test of the sheaves before that of the stones, and omits ‘according to the first opinion’.)  writing upon them the respective names of the tribes, their constellations and the months, and said to them, ‘I order you to prostrate yourselves before Levi because he wears the Urim and Thummim’, (Cf. Ex. 28, 30.)  but they did not stand up. ‘Before Judah who is king’, but they did not stand up; but when he mentioned Joseph to them, they all stood up and bowed before Joseph. But it was not yet quite clear that he was alive. So Jacob went to the mountains, hewed twelve stones, arranged them in a row, and wrote on each the name of its tribe, the name of its constellation and the name of its month. On one stone he wrote ‘Reuben, lamb, Nisan’ (The name of the tribe, constellation and month.)  and similarly on every stone. He began from Simeon and said to them, ‘I order you to stand up for Reuben’, but they did not stand up. ‘For Simeon’, but they did not stand up. ‘For every tribe’, but the stones did not stand up. As soon, however, as he mentioned the name of Joseph to them, they stood up at once and bowed before Joseph’s stone. (The translation follows the text of GRA.)  For this reason, all the tribes were written on Joseph’s stone. Similarly, all Israel are called by Joseph’s name, as it is stated, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock. (Ps. 80, 2 where Joseph is a synonym of all Israel.)  So also all the heads of the families of the priests and Levites, [e.g.] Eliashib, (Neh. 3, 1.)  because of the phrase lahashibo ’el ’abiw; (In the story of Joseph (Gen. 37, 22), E.V. to restore him to his father. The name Eliashib is broken up in three parts corresponding in sound and meaning to these three Heb. words. From ‘For this reason’ to ’abiw is the reading of GRA. V and H have instead: ‘but from the mishmaroth, Eliashib the priest’.)  Elḳanah, (Connected with ḳanah, ‘he bought’.)  because Potiphar had bought him [as it is stated,] And Joseph ms brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar … bought him. (Gen. 39, 1. V inserts in parentheses, And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Ẓaphenath, paneah, etc. (ibid. XLI, 45), which has no relevance to the subject.)  When Rebekah left her father’s house (Cf. ibid. XXIV, 59ff.)  she was three years old, (V, M and H add ‘and three days’.)  because it is customary among kings, when a daughter is born to them, to hear of it after three days; (H reads ‘after three years and three days’.)  but as her father did not hear [of her birth] he did not defile her up to that time; and now a miracle happened to her in that her father died so that he should not defile her, as it is written, Neither had any man known her, (Gen. 24, 16.)  and by man only her father could be meant, (From ‘he did not’ to ‘meant’ is GRA’s reading. V, M and H read: ‘therefore a miracle happened to her that she should not be defiled’.)  for such was the practice of the Arameans to lie with their virgin daughters after they were three years of age, (‘After … age’ is inserted by GRA; omitted in V, M and H.)  and then to give them away in marriage. (V, M and H add: ‘on account of that which is written, Neither had any man known her, and by man only her father could be meant’.)  Dinah was six years old when she bore Asenath from [her association with] Shechem, (Cf. Gen. 34.)  corresponding to (lit. ‘the number of’.)  the six years which Jacob served Laban in payment for the flock, (ibid. XXXI, 41.)  thus completing (lit. ‘until’.)  the twenty years of his service. [The Archangel] Michael then descended and took her away to the house of Potiphar. From here onward let the man of understanding increase knowledge. (From ‘completing the twenty years’ to ‘knowledge’ is GRA’s text. V and M have instead: ‘and he added twenty years, because he died. From this point onwards let the man of understanding increase knowledge. And Michael descended and led her to Potiphar’s house’.) </p>

        <summary>Radak explains that the phrase &quot;וַיְחִי&quot; is in the past tense, with the root of the verb being either חיי or חיה. HaKtav VeHaKabalah notes that according to the Sages, Abraham should have lived another five years but died early to avoid witnessing Esau's moral decline. Rashi explains that the phrase &quot;מאה שנה ושבעים שנה וחמש שנים&quot; indicates Abraham's strength and righteousness at different ages. Steinsaltz mentions that Abraham lived for many years after Sarah's death. The Zohar explains that the days of the righteous are eternal, as seen in the examples of Sarah and Abraham, and even though Ishmael was not initially righteous, he repented, leading to his days being described in a similar way to Abraham's. In Midrash Tanchuma, Abraham observed the Torah even before it was given, and the failure to observe the sabbatical year led to Israel's exile. The Torah repeats the word &quot;year&quot; or &quot;years&quot; multiple times when describing the ages of various individuals to emphasize specific qualities or stages of their lives. R. Joshua b. Levi found in a book of ’aggadta that the 175 sections of the Torah correspond to the years of Abraham's life, leading to the practice of reading 175 orders in the Torah every Sabbath. Onkelos states that Abraham lived to be 175 years old, while Targum Jonathan also confirms this age but adds that Abraham lived for 100 years before having Isaac.</summary>

(By buying her a burial plot.)  “Will find life” – “The years of Abraham's life that he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years” (Genesis 25:7). “Righteousness, and honor” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘My craft is performing kindness.

              <p>“These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life that he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years” (Genesis 25:7).  “Abraham expired and died at a good old age, aged and content, and he was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:8).  “These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life.” It is written: “The Lord knows the days of the faultless; their legacy will last forever” (Psalms 37:18). “The Lord knows the days of the faultless” – this is Abraham, as it is stated: “Be faultless” (Genesis 17:1). “Their legacy will last forever” – “these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life,” as the Holy One blessed be He was fond of the years of the righteous and recorded them in the Torah, so the legacy of their days would be remembered forever – “at a good old age, aged and content.”  “[Abraham] expired” – Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai said: The pious men of old would suffer from intestinal illness for ten or twenty days [before dying], which teaches you that sickness cleanses [the soul]. Rabbi Yehuda said: Anyone in whose regard “expiring” is stated, died of intestinal illness.  It is written: “Might and grandeur are her clothing, [and she rejoices at the final day]” (Proverbs 31:25) – the entire reward granted to the righteous is prepared for them in the future, and the Holy One blessed be He shows them the granting of the reward that he is destined to give them in the future while they are still in this world, and their souls are satisfied [with what they have seen], and they go to sleep, [i.e., expire peacefully].  Rabbi Elazar said: This is analogous to a feast that the king prepared. He invited the guests [beforehand] and showed them what they would be eating and drinking. Their souls were satisfied, and they went to sleep [with this feeling of satisfaction]. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He shows the righteous the granting of their reward that he is destined to give them in the future while they are still in this world, and they go to sleep, as it is stated: “For now, I would lie down and be silent. [I would sleep; then there would be rest for me]” (Job 3:13) – this shows that at the moment of the departure of the righteous [from this world], the Holy One blessed be He shows them the reward granted to them.  When Rabbi Abahu was dying, he was shown thirteen rivers of [precious] balsam oil. He asked: ‘Whose are these?’ They said to him: ‘Yours.’ He said: ‘These are for Abahu? “And I had said: For nothing I labored, I expended my strength for emptiness and futility; but indeed, my portion is from the Lord”’ (Isaiah 49:4).  Zavdi ben Levi, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and Rabbi Yosei ben Parta, the three of them recited these verses as they were dying. One of them said: “For this, everyone who is devoted to You should pray at the time of finding” (Psalms 32:6); “For our heart rejoices in Him…” (Psalms 33:21). Another said: “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies” (Psalms 23:5); “But let all who take refuge in You rejoice” (Psalms 5:12). Another said: “For one day in Your courtyard is better than one thousand” (Psalms 84:11). The Rabbis say: “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20). All this shows that at the moment of the departure of the righteous from the world, the Holy One blessed be He shows them the reward granted to them.  Ben Azai says: “Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His devoted ones” (Psalms 116:15). When does the Holy One blessed be He show them the reward that is prepared for them? (When does He show them how precious they are in His eyes?)  It is adjacent to their death. That is what is written: “the death of His devoted ones.” That is why: “And she rejoices at the final day” (Proverbs 31:25).  What is the difference between the death of youths and the death of the elderly? Rabbi Yehuda said: A lamp, when it becomes extinguished on its own, [when the oil has run out,] it is good for it and good for the wick. But when it does not become extinguished on its own, [and there is still oil in it,] it is bad for it and bad for the wick. Rabbi Abahu said: A fig, when it is picked at its proper time, it is good for it and good for the fig tree. (This is why the Torah makes a point of writing that Abraham died “at a good old age, aged and content.”)  But when it is picked not at its proper time, it is bad for it and bad for the fig tree. (If a person dies in ripe old age, this is the natural course of things, but if he dies young, before his time, it is unnatural and detrimental to his soul, which was not able to reach its full potential.)   Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and his students – and some say it was Rabbi Akiva and his students, and others say it was Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta and his students – had the routine that they would come early in the day and sit and study beneath a certain fig tree. The owner of the fig tree would come early each day and pick its fruit. They said: ‘Is he, perhaps, suspicious of us?’ (Is that why he keeps coming by when we are here?)  What did they do? They changed their place. He went to them and said to them: ‘My masters, the one mitzva that you sat and afforded me, that you were sitting and studying beneath my fig tree, you have deprived me of it.’ They said to him: ‘We had said that perhaps you were suspicious of us.’ He reassured them and they returned to their place. What did he do? He woke up early in the morning, but he did not go to pick the fruit. (He refrained from picking the fruit while they were there, as he did not want to make them feel that he suspected them.)  The sun shone upon it [the tree] and they [the figs] became infested with worms. They said: ‘The owner of a fig tree knows when it is the proper time to harvest the fig tree, and he picks its fruits [at that specific time]. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He knows when it is the proper time for the righteous to depart from the world and he removes them [at that specific time].’ That is what is written: “My beloved descended to his garden, to the beds of fragrant plants, [to eat in the gardens, to pluck lilies]” (Song of Songs 6:2). (The Beloved One in Song of Songs refers to God. Plucking the lilies is a metaphor for removing the righteous from this world.)   “At a good old age [beseiva]” – Reish Lakish said: There are three people in whose regard seiva is stated: Abraham, and it was beneficial for him; David, (I Chronicles 29:28.)  and it was beneficial for him; Gideon, (Judges 8:32.)  and it was not beneficial for him. Why? “Gideon crafted it into an ephod” (Judges 8:27) – for idol worship.</p>

              <p>(Lev. 25:14:) AND WHEN YOU MAKE A SALE TO YOUR NEIGHBOR, [OR BUY FROM YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HAND,] LET NONE OF YOU DECEIVE HIS FELLOW. Thus you shall not deceive one another, for I also have sold. When? When Abraham observed the commandments of the Holy One. Before the Torah was given, our father Abraham kept it [and observed all the commandments that are in the Torah. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Alexandra: Abraham even observed the eruvim of cooked foods. (See above, Tanh. (Buber), Gen. 3:1, and the notes there.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): BECAUSE ('QB 'ShR) ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE AND KEPT MY CHARGE: &lt; MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS &gt;. What is the meaning of 'QB? (Gen. R. 95:3; Cant. R. 5:16:1; PR 21:12; cf. Ned. 32a.)  R. Simeon ben Laqish said: At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One. (So also Numb. R. 18:21. According to other traditions Abraham recognized his creator at the age of forty-eight (Gen. R. 30:8; 46:2; Cant. R. 5:16:1), at the age of fifty (PR 21:12), or at the age of one (Gen. R. 95:3).)  'QB is a number. ' (i.e., 'ayin) is seventy, Q (i.e., Qof) is one hundred, &lt; and &gt; B (i.e., bet) is two, for a total of one hundred seventy-two. Now (according to Gen. 25:7) Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five &lt; years &gt;. Deduct from them. &lt; The result is &gt; three, when he was little. Ergo: At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One.] When the Holy One saw how Abraham loved the commandments, he began buying heavenly and earthly &lt; places &gt; for him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19): BLESSED BE ABRAM OF GOD MOST HIGH, [BUYER (Qoneh. A more traditional rendering of this word here would be MAKER.)  OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. So also it says (Gen. 13:15): FOR ALL THE LAND WHICH YOU SEE, TO YOU I WILL GIVE IT.] The Holy One said: All the world is wholly mine; and I bought it for Abraham, because he has observed my commandments. But you [through your sins] have cause me to be [like] an alien who rents a house from its owners, for so Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 14:8): WHY ARE YOU LIKE A FOREIGNER IN THE LAND? When you sinned before me, I sold you, as stated (in Ps. 44:13 [12]): YOU SHALL SELL YOUR PEOPLE FOR NO MONEY…. For that reason, if someone has to sell a house, a field, or &lt; some &gt; article, you shall not deceive one another. It is therefore written (in Lev. 25:14): LET NONE OF YOU DECEIVE HIS FELLOW. (Ibid., vs. 17) AND LET NO ONE DECEIVE HIS NEIGHBOR.</p>

              <p>(Gen. 25:29:) NOW JACOB HAD BOILED &lt; A STEW &gt;. Esau came in from the field and saw that Jacob's face was blackened. He said to him: What are you doing? He said to him: Do you not know that our grandfather Abraham is dead, and I am cooking food? (See Gen. R. 63:11 ; BB 16b; (bar.); Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, Gen. 25:27; PRE 35.)  Now he was going to prepare the mourner's meal on his behalf. Esau said to him: My friend and my enemy, &lt; both &gt; alike have died. Abraham has died, and Nimrod has died. SO (according to Gen. 25:32) WHAT IS THE USE OF THIS BIRTHRIGHT TO ME? What was he cooking? Lentils, because from ancient times they had brought lentils (on account of) [unto] the mourner and lentils to the house with a wedding. (Gen. 25:29:) THEN ESAU CAME. (See Gen. R. 63:12; PRK 3:1; cf. BB 16b; PR 12:5.)  They have said: This wicked man committed three transgressions on that day. He robbed, since it is written (of Edom in Obad. 5): IF THIEVES HAVE COME TO YOU, PLUNDERERS (rt.: ShDD) (The midrash may also see an allusion here to Gen. 25:27: A MAN OF THE FIELD (SDH).)  OF THE NIGHT. He also seduced a maiden who was betrothed, as stated (in Gen. 25:7): &lt; EDOM BECAME A MAN &gt; OF THE FIELD. A field is nothing but a maiden, since it is stated (in Deut. 22:25): IF IN THE FIELD [THE MAN FINDS A MAIDEN] &lt; WHO IS BETROTHED, AND THE MAN SEIZES HER AND LIES WITH HER &gt;…. And he took a life, since it is stated (in Gen. 25:29): AND HE WAS EXHAUSTED. EXHAUSTED can only &lt; imply &gt; &quot;killing.&quot; Thus it is stated (in Jer. 4:31): WOE UNTO ME, NOW!

              </summary>
              <p>(Lev. 25:14:) “When you sell property to your kinsman.” This text is related (to Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth, [and he does not know that loss will come to him].” This verse speaks about many people. “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth.” This was Cain. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “You moved quickly to inherit the world. By your life, you shall have a loss [in the matter].” Ergo (in Prov. 28:22), “and he does not know that loss will come to him.” And what happened to him? That he wandered about the world, as stated (in Gen. 4:12), “you shall become a ceaseless wanderer on the earth.” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This was Ephron the Hittite. (See Tanh. (Buber), Exod. 6:5; and the parallels listed there; and Tanh. (Buber), Deut. 4:4.)  When Abraham's wife Sarah died, Abraham went to Ephron for him to sell him the cave. Ephron said to him, “Give me its price.” He said to him (in Gen. 23:15), “What is a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver between you and me?” Abraham began piling up the silver for Ephron, as stated (in Gen. 23:16), “So Abraham heeded Ephron, and Abraham weighed out […].” Ben Ma'ma said, “Although R. Hanina has said, ‘All the shekels in the Torah are sela'im,’ these [shekels] are an exception, since they are centenaria. (The word is Latin. One centenarium was worth 100,000 sesterces. According to a fourth-century inscription of northern Africa, a centenarium was a hundred pieces (e.g., of gold). See A. Souter, A Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A.D. (Oxford: Clarendon, 1957).)  [So it was] four hundred centenaria [that] Abraham piled up before Ephron.” When Ephron saw the silver, he moved quickly and hastily, as stated (in Gen. 23:6), “bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “You have moved quickly after money. By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” And what was his loss? R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said, “Every [mention of] Ephron which is written here [in Scripture], before he took the silver from Abraham, is written plene as 'prwn (i.e., with the vowel o represented by the Hebrew consonant w); but this [usage] (in Gen. 23:16) is deficient (hsr), ‘and Abraham weighed out the silver for Ephron ('prn). It is written with the w missing (hsr).” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This is the one who lends at interest, because he is anxious to become wealthy. He lends in order to receive interest from the borrower and becomes wealthy from the interest. But a curse is given through his riches, as stated (ibid., cont.), “and he does not know that loss will come to him.” Another interpretation (of Prov. 28:22), “An evil-eyed person moves quickly after wealth”: This represents those who engage in business in the sabbatical year, in that they move quickly to become rich. They do not observe the sabbatical year, and think they will become rich. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, “By your life, you shall have a loss in the matter.” Since he did not observe the sabbatical year, the curse began entering into his money, and he sells [all that he had]. What is written above the matter (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord.” And after that it is written (in vs. 14), “When you sell property.” R. Eleazar Haqappar said, “It is written (in Cant. 5:15), ‘His legs are pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold.’ This column has a capital above and a pedestal (Gk.: basis.)  below.” (See Lev. R. 25:8.)  R. Samuel ben Guriah said, “You have no section in the Torah which does not have a capital above and a pedestal below. (The parallel in Lev. R. 25:8 explains that each section can be expounded with reference to what precedes and follows it.)  What is written above of the matter (in Lev. 25:1-2)? ‘Then the Lord spoke unto Moses on Mount Sinai, saying, “Speak unto the Children of Israel [….] ‘the land shall observe [a Sabbath for the Lord].’”’ Then after that [comes] the section on the jubilee (in vs. 8), ‘And you shall count seven [Sabbaths of years].’ If one has not observed the sabbatical year and the jubilee, or [even] one of them, in the end, I will make it that he will sell his land, [as stated] (in vs. 14), ‘When you sell property to your kinsman.’ (T’Arakh. 5:9; below, 9:8.)  [If] he repents, [all] is well; but if not, he will end up selling his field, as stated (in vs. 25), ‘When your relative becomes poor and sells some of his property.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up selling his house, as stated (in vs. 29), ‘And when someone sells a dwelling house.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up going around [begging] at doorways, as stated (in vs. 35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor [… you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you].’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to you, as stated (in vs. 39), ‘And when your relative becomes poor] near you and is sold to you.’ [If] he repents, that is preferable; but if not, he will end up being sold to the gentiles, as stated (in vs. 47), ‘And when a foreigner and a sojourner near you becomes wealthy, [while your relative near him becomes poor and is sold to a sojourning foreigner near you….].’ Now it is not merely the individual himself [at issue here], but that person and all Israel; for so you find in the days of Jeremiah, because they profaned the sabbatical year, they were sold to the gentiles, as stated (in II Chron. 36:17-18), ‘So He brought up the king of the Chaldeans upon them [….] And all the vessels of the house of God […] and the treasures of the house of the Lord […].’ Behold the case of [all] Israel.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “See how they will be sold to the gentiles because they profaned the sabbatical year.” He said to him, “Master of the world, did You not say this (in Lev. 25:35), ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you, [you shall maintain him as a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you]?’ Fulfill what You said to them and called them, ‘My relatives (ah) and friends,’ as stated (in Ps. 122:8), ‘For the sake of My relatives (ah) and friends’: (Lev. 25:35:) ‘And when your relative becomes poor, and his strength fails near you,’ [i.e.,] when their strength fails before Nebuchadnezzar, the Divine Presence, as it were, will be with them. It is so stated (in Is. 43:14), ‘for your sake I have sent to Babylon.’ (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘You shall maintain (literally, hold on to) him.’ Hold them (i.e., Israel), lest they perish. But how? (Lev. 25:35, cont.:) ‘As a foreigner and sojourner and let him live near you.’ Although they became foreigners and sojourners in Babylon, if You do not give them grace, they will perish, [so just] ‘let him live near You.’” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “Because of their sins I have sold My house to the Chaldeans.” It is so stated (in Lev. 25:29), “And when someone sells a dwelling house.” This is the house of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Ps. 132:13), “For the Lord has chosen Zion; he has desired it for His dwelling.” And what happened [to it]? (II Kings 25:9 = Jer. 52:13:) And he burned the house of the Lord [...].” (Lev. 25:29, cont.:) “A walled city.” This is the city of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated] (in II Chron. 36:19), “and they broke down the wall of Jerusalem […].” That is what the Holy One, blessed be He, says (in Lev. 25:47), “And when a foreigner and a sojourner [near you] becomes wealthy.” This wealthy foreigner is Nebuchadnezzar, and this sojourner is the Median Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “And is sold to a sojourning foreigner.” This [sojourning foreigner] is the Greek Empire. (Ibid., cont.:) “Or to a foreigner's family.” This is the Edomite Empire (i.e., Rome). Moses said to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Master of the world, why were they sold to these empires?” He said to him, “Because they profaned the sabbatical year.” It is so stated (in II Chron. 36:20–21), “Then he carried off unto Babylon those left from the sword,” and the end of the Scripture is “[until the land made up] its Sabbaths; as long as it lay desolate, it observed Sabbath, to fulfill seventy years.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses at the end of all of these sections, “Is it your wish that they do not go into exile? [Then] warn them concerning the sabbatical years and the jubilees.” That is what He has said at the end of all the sections (in Lev. 26:2), “You shall observe My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary. I am the Lord.” What is the meaning of “I am the Lord?” I am the one who is going to give you a good reward, if you observe them; but if not, I am going to exact retribution from them through the Empires. Therefore, say to them to be careful about the sabbatical year. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:2), “the land shall observe a Sabbath for the Lord,” so that they do not attain [the punishments in] those sections written below (in Lev. 26:14-45). (Lev. 25:14:) “When you sell property to your kinsman or buy from your neighbor's hand, do not deceive.” [Thus] you shall not deceive one another. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “For I also sold the whole world to Abraham and did not deceive him. He [then went back and sold it to Me,” as stated (Genesis 14:19), “the Buyer (Qoneh. A more traditional rendering of this word here would be MAKER.)  of heaven and earth.” When? When Abraham observed the commandments of the Holy One, blessed be He. Before the Torah was given to Israel, our father Abraham kept it [and observed all the commandments that are in the Torah]. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Alexandra, “Abraham even observed the [rabbinic precept of] eruvim of cooked foods.” (See Tanh. (Buber), Gen. 3:1, and the notes there.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5), “Because ('qb 'shr) Abraham heeded [My voice and kept My charge: My commandments, My statutes, and My Torahs].” What is the meaning of 'qb? (Gen. R. 95:3; Cant. R. 5:16:1; PR 21:12; cf. Ned. 32a.)  R. Simeon ben Laqish said, “At the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He.” (So also Numb. R. 18:21. According to other traditions Abraham recognized his creator at the age of forty-eight (Gen. R. 30:8; 46:2; Cant. R. 5:16:1), at the age of fifty (PR 21:12), or at the age of one (Gen. R. 95:3).)  How is this shown? 'Qb is a number. (I.e., 'ayin) is seventy, q (i.e., qof) is one hundred, [and] b (i.e., bet) is two, for a total of one hundred seventy-two. Now (according to Gen. 25:7) Abraham lived one hundred seventy-five [years]. Deduct from them. [The result is] three, when he was little. Ergo, at the age of three years Abraham recognized the Holy One, blessed be He. When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw how Abraham loved the commandments, He began buying heavenly and earthly [places] for him, as stated (in Gen. 14:19), “Blessed be Abram of God most high, Buyer of heaven and earth.” So also it says (Gen. 13:15), “For all the land (or earth) which you see, to you I will give it.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “All the world is wholly Mine; and I bought it for Abraham, because he has observed My commandments. But you, through your sins, have caused him to be [like] an alien who rents a house from its owners, for so Jeremiah has said (in Jer. 14:8), ‘why are you like a foreigner in the land […]?’ When you sinned before Me, I sold you, as stated (in Ps. 44:13), ‘You shall sell Your people for no money […].’ For that reason, if someone has to sell a house, a field, or [some] article, you shall not deceive one another.” It is therefore written (in Lev. 25:14), “shall not deceive his brother.” (Lev. 25:15-18:) “According to the years after the jubilee […]. According to the multitude of years, you shall increase […]. A man shall not deceive his brother […]. So you shall carry out my statutes and judgements.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Just as I sold my people and returned again to reinstate them, as stated (Jer. 3:14), ‘”Turn back, faithless children,” says the Lord; “for I am a master to you.”’ It is also written (in Is. 52:3), ‘For thus says the Lord, “You were sold for free, and you shall be redeemed for no money.”’ So too you should not sell the land absolutely, as stated (in Lev. 25:23), ‘[it] shall not be sold permanently.’ The Land [of Israel] is dear to me because I have made it holier than all the [other] lands in the world.” You yourself know, when the Land of Israel was distributed to the tribes, it did not pass from tribe to tribe. Rather [it was distributed] to each tribe separately. You yourself know. Look at how many lawsuits the daughters of Zelophehad brought, so that their inheritance would not pass from one tribe to another. Moreover the Holy One, blessed be He, conceded to their words, as stated (in Numb. 27:7), “The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right.” (Numb. 36:9:) “Thus no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another.” Therefore, if a redeemer is found for it, fine; but if not, whoever buys it acquires it until the jubilee. Then on the jubilee he releases it. Thus it is stated (in Lev. 25:41), “Then he shall depart from you, he and his children with him and he shall return to his family.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “When the year of the redemption draws near, I will redeem you, as stated (in Is. 63:4), ‘For a day of vengeance was in My heart, but there came My year of redemption.’”</p>

There seems no need for the verse to state &quot;sister of Nebaioth.&quot; What do we learn from the fact that it says &quot;sister of Nebaioth&quot;? We learn that Ishmael died and Nebaioth [Ishmael's firstborn therefore] married off his sister to Esau. Jacob our forefather hid [from Esau] 14 years in the land of Israel and served Eber. Eber died two years after Jacob went to Aram-Naharaim. [Jacob] left and went to Aram-Naharaim and he was found by the well when he was 77 years old and he was in Laban's house for 20 years: 7 before he married any matriarchs, 7 from when he married in the Matriarchs and 6 years after the 11 tribes and Dinah were born. It comes out that all the tribes were born in seven years besides Benjamin. Each and every one each 7 months. He left Aram-Naharaim and came to Succoth and stayed there 18 months as is written &quot;And Jacob went to Succoth&quot; (Genesis 33:17).

              <p>When an ox gores man, the Torah says: סקול יסקל, etc.&quot; (21,28). The Torah distinguishes between a שור תם, an ox that has a history of behaving peacefully, and one that has demonstrated aggressiveness. If the normally tame ox has killed a human being, it immediately is categorised as an aggressive beast, the owner being considered as having been forewarned. I have explained these distinctions at length in my commentary on פרשת וישב, in connection with the festival of חנוכה.   אדם הראשון, first man, was considered מועד לעולם, forewarned from the outset (Baba Kama 3). This means that he was unable to make excuses for his sin, having been told by G–d directly what he must not do. יעקב on the other hand, is described as איש תם (the choicest of human beings), and only had to pay half for any sins he had committed (i.e. cost of any damage he caused), since he never died (cf. Taanit 5, that יעקב אבינו לא מת). This means that though he &quot;died,&quot; he did not die completely as was explained in that context (see Akeydat Yitzchak chapter 32).</p>

            <summary>The Torah repeats the word &quot;year&quot; or &quot;years&quot; multiple times when describing the ages of various individuals, such as Sarah, Abraham, and Ishmael, to emphasize specific qualities or stages of their lives. This repetition can be seen as a feature of the Holy Tongue to enhance clarity and meaning, with some commentators suggesting that it signifies purity and beauty at different stages of life. Additionally, the Torah's enumeration of Jacob's years in a different order may highlight the importance of his final years. The period of exile and oppression in Jewish history was predicted in the Covenant of the Pieces during Abraham's time and linked to Abraham's failure to fully trust God, ultimately leading to the liberation of the Israelites from Egypt after four hundred years of exile. The repetition of specific words in the Torah serves to convey deeper meanings and insights into the lives and experiences of the individuals mentioned.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>מאה שנה, “one hundred years;” Rashi comments on the reason why the word: שנה, “year,” is repeated here three times, when the Torah could have simply written: מאה עשרים ושבע שנה, “one hundred and twenty seven years.” He suggests that the Torah wished us to know that Sarah was as free from sin at a hundred as she had been at twenty, and that she was as beautiful at twenty as she had been at seven. This, of course, raises the question why the Torah, in reporting the death of Yishmael at 137 years (Genesis, 25,32) used exactly the same formulation? We can answer this by pointing out that when reporting Sarah’s age, each group of years is reported separately, as an individual unit, whereas when reporting Yishmael’s age at death, the groups of years are introduced in the construct mode, i.e. מאת, not מאה, i.e. all the years had the same common factor. Not only that, but the Torah sums up her years once more with the words: שני חיי שרה, “the years of Sarah’s life,” i.e. all her years were earmarked by a common denominator. If, when Avraham’s death is reported our sages have seen fit to read something into the way his years are reported, although there too just as at the death of Yishmael we find the word מאת in the construct form, this can be accounted for by the word: ימי, “days of,” which are superfluous and therefore available for interpretation. (Genesis 25,7) Rashi also adds that Sarah was free from sin at twenty as if this was something exceptional; this sounds strange as at that time everyone was free from sin, i.e. not held accountable until the age of twenty? We must understand Rashi as if he had written: ”just as she was free from sin at 20, she remained free from sin until the end of her life. Accountability for sins at the age of 12 or 13 for females and males respectively, commenced only after the Torah had been given. [Our midrashim describe Yishmael as “innocent” when expelled by Sarah, as he was below 20 years of age. Ed.] Sarah had not required cosmetics at twenty anymore than she had required it at the age of seven. We know from Rivkah, who accepted jewelry at the age of three in order to enhance her appearance, that girls in those days felt the need to enhance their natural charms at an early age. (Compare Genesis 24,22) There is a Midrash in pessikta zutrata according to which the reference to her being one hundred as meaning that she was as beautiful at a hundred as she had been at twenty, whereas she was as free from sin at twenty as she had been at seven.</p>

              <p>Indeed, when the noun מְאַת (hundred of) as a construct cardinal has with it numerals representing tens and ones and the name מְאַת comes before these other numerals – that which is counted must be repeated, since a noun that is in construct state must come right after its corresponding noun without a break.  Genesis 25:7 says, ואלה ימי שני חיי אברהם אשר חי מאת שנה ושבעים שנה וחמש שנים (And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred seventy-five years), using the words מאת שנה ושבעים שנה וחמש שנים for “a hundred seventy-five years”, where the noun which is counted שנה (year) is repeated, in accordance with Rule 77.</p>

              <p>We need to consider why the Torah enumerates the years of Jacob's life in a different manner from the way it enumerated the lives of Abraham and the other patriarchs. When the Torah told us about the number of years Abraham lived, it commenced with the larger unit first, i.e. 100 years plus seventy years plus five years (compare Genesis 25,7). We find the same thing in Genesis 35,28 when Isaac's life is described; the same also is the case when the Torah described the number of years Sarah lived (Genesis 23,1). Perhaps the reason that the Torah reversed this in Jacob's case is to drive home the point that Jacob's last 17 good years were the key to his whole life.</p>

                <h4>Peirush Hafla'ah on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, In the Beginning Our Fathers Were Idol Worshipers 3:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>According to Rabbi Horowitz, God has a plan for history. Exile is a result of sin but it is also part of this divine plan – we are told that God calculated the end of the subjugation. In the following section, Horowitz suggests that the period of exile and oppression was predicted in the Covenant of the Pieces (sections) in the time of Abraham. God said that Israel would be enslaved 400 years. How do we arrive at this number? First, he suggests that Israel’s exile was partially a product of Abraham’s failure to trust God. But even then, God led our forefather to feel with certainty that there would an end to the exile. Built into the exile was the ultimate punishment of Egypt as well. In a land not their own: Abraham was not distressed about Israel’s future subjugation because he knew that in the end his descendents would be redeemed. This is hinted at throughout the story of the Exodus. The garrison city which Israel was forced to build for Pharaoh was called Pit’hom –from Pi Tehom, the mouth of emptiness, because in the end Israel’s service in Egypt would amount to nothing for the Egyptians and the Israelites would even leave Israel with great wealth. Israel’s exiles culminating in the Exodus is also hinted at in the expression “In a land not their own;” is a reference to the four exiles that the patriarchs faced, two in the time of Isaac and two in the time of Jacob; Isaac spent time in Beer Lehai Roi (Genesis 25:7)  after his father’s death, and in Avimelekh’s kingdom, and Jacob spent time with Laban in Aram and then in Egypt. Lo lahem is an abbreviation of the four exiles” Lechai, Avimelekh, Laban Ha-Arami, Mitzraim. The first letters of these four words spells Lo lahem. Another interpretation of “a land not their own:” We learn that a person who is not satisfied with what he already has does not have anything (Pirkei Avot: “Who is rich? One who is satisfied with his portion.”) . If he desires more than he has, then even the things in his possession are not his because he lacks trust in God. Our ability to trust in God protects us – it allows us to be satisfied with what we have. The evil inclination, on the other hand, rules over that which our eyes see while wisdom is present for those who desire only that which is already in their hands. That is why Egypt is called “a land that is not their own,” while the land of Israel is said to be an inheritance. Abraham sinned because when he responded to God’s promise by asking, “How shall I know that I am to possess it?” (Genesis 15:8)  Abraham’s desire lengthened the time of the exile and until Israel was worthy of inheriting the land. God told him that “that the iniquity of the Amorites was not complete,” and that they would not inherit until the fourth generation, (Genesis 15:16)  implying that it was not Abraham’s righteousness that allowed them to inherit the land but the wickedness of the nations who were already there that allowed for their liberation. Also, the land could not be inherited as long as there were divine sparks that were hidden in the land. By asking this question Abraham sinned and strengthened the nation’s hold on the land. Israel’s exile was all part of the redemptive process that began with the birth of Isaac. According to the Torah there were four hundred years from the birth of Isaac until the Exodus from Egypt. (Genesis 15:13)  The four hundred years can be divided into three periods: 1. from the birth of Isaac until the Jews arrived in Egypt. 2. The period of slavery: from Joseph until the birth of Miriam. It was during this period that Pharaoh enslaved Israel by using, “farekh” (The word pharekh, ruthless, is midrashically read as peh rakh, literally a soft tongue. According to the Midrash Pharaoh was able to con the Israelites into slavery with soft words and only then did he begin to oppression.) , light enslavement. 3. The period of oppression: from the birth of Miriam leading up to the Exodus. Together these two last periods together were 86 years. It was during this final period that God revealed Himself to Moses as YHVH, the name of God associated with compassion. This is why Pharaoh had never heard of YHVH; Pharaoh only recognized Israel’s God as Elohim. The gematriah of the name Elohim is 86, equal to the number of years of enslavement and oppression in Egypt. The time from the birth of Isaac until the oppression of the nation is 314 years which is hinted at in God’s name, El Shaddai. This is also alluded to in the verse: “I am YHVH; I appeared to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as El Shaddai, but I did not make myself known to them as YHVH.” El Shaddai is associated with compassion since it was a time of exile but not a time of oppression. Thus the period from the birth of Isaac until the death of Joseph was 314 years. And the period from the death of Joseph until the birth of Miriam was 54 years, alluded to in the verse: “Know well that your offspring shall be strangers in a land not theirs (314 years from the birth of Isaac until the death of Joseph) and they shall be enslaved and oppressed (between the death of Joseph and birth of Miriam until the Exodus – 86 years) four hundred years. But I will execute judgments on the nations they served and in the end they shall go free with great wealth.” (Genesis 15:13-14. The words dan anokhi – “I will ‘judge’” is taken as an allusion to the 54 years of slavery that took place between the death of Joseph and the birth of Miriam. The word dan has the gematriah of 54. How did Rabbi Horowitz come up with the connection between this number and the period of slavery? This is not clear. The period between the death of Pharaoh and the Exodus would have been 70 years. Horowitz points out that Joseph was 30 when he was brought to Pharaoh. There were seven years of plenty, and two more years of famine before Jacob agreed to send his sons to Egypt. They would have arrived in the third year – which means Joseph would have been forty when they arrived and he lived until he was 110 – which would have been another seventy years, between the arrival of the family and the death of Joseph. From that point to the birth of Miriam was another 54 years. From Miriam’s birth until the Exodus would have been eighty six years, Miriam’s age when Moses returned from Midian (since she was six years older than Moses). Together from the time of the descent into Egypt until the Exodus would thus be 210 years: 70 years plus 54 years plus 86 years. The 54 years would be the remainder after adding up the years of Joseph’s life plus Miriam’s age. It is hinted at in the word dan. The first 70 years would have been a time of exile without enslavement, the second period from the death of Joseph to the beginning of the enslavement, and the final period from the birth of Miriam to the period of oppression.)  Egypt was thus doubly punished for their treatment of the Israelites. Normally, because they were Noahides, they should have been punished with death but not required to pay for their poor treatment of the Israelites. However these two crimes happened separately: they had to pay for the years of slavery (Israel left with great wealth) and with death for their oppression of Israel during the final period.</p>

              <p>Still, it is quite acceptable to write the word “year” or “years” after every unit of years in order to separate these 3 different parts of a person’s life by inserting the word “year,” or “years” between each group. It is appropriate to separate a century from a decade and a decade from individual years lived. We find such patterns when the Torah describes the lifetime of Avraham as well as when it describes the lifetime of Ishmael.  The unusual way about describing Sarah’s lifetime is only the repetition of the words שני חיי שרה, “the years of the lives of Sarah.” From these words our sages derive the message that all her years were lived in the same state of piety, etc.</p>

We encounter a similar “waste” of the word “year” and “years” in Genesis 6,9 in connection with Noach, as well as in connection with בני ישראל, “the Children of Israel” in Numbers 8,19 where that word occurs no fewer than five times We also find such a repetitive use of the word “year” when we are told about Avraham’s death in Genesis 25,7. Even when reporting the death of Ishmael in Genesis 25,17 the word שנה is repeated three times. Some commentators claim that this is a feature of the Holy Tongue, which endeavours to be clear and unambiguous. When a large number of years (unit) is mentioned the word שנה, “year” appears in the singular mode, whereas when less than ten years are mentioned the years appear in the plural mode, i.e. שנים. There is an aggadic approach to these seemingly superfluous words, especially in our verse here (mentioned by Rashi) which sees in the wording an allusion to the fact that Sarah at her death was as pure and beautiful as at 7 or at 20 years respectively. Seeing that the word שנה did not occur at the beginning of the verse, the verse concludes with the summary שני חיי שרה.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Everything that has been handed down to us about Avram ‎suggests that he was unwavering in his faith in G’d from his very ‎youth, and certainly did not have any theological relapses. ‎Nachmanides stated with absolute certainty, basing himself on ‎Genesis 25,8 that Avram had always considered anything that ‎happened to him as being G’d’s desire and meant for his own ‎good. Nachmanides understood this as being the meaning of the ‎words: ‎זקן ושבע ימים‎, “of old age, satisfied and satisfied in years.” ‎Contrary to most people, who are described in Kohelet ‎Rabbah, 5,9 as leaving behind many unfulfilled aspirations ‎when they die, Avraham died fully fulfilled. In Baba Batra ‎‎117, as well as in Sanhedrin 91 the meaning of the word ‎מורשה‎ is discussed, there being different opinions of how the ‎distribution of the ancestral plots in the Land of Israel was ‎determined by lottery; if the lottery only applied to the tribal ‎allocations, or to families. The discussion also concerns whether ‎only Jews who partook in the Exodus or their offspring were ‎allocated land, or whether the allocation included Jews who had ‎lived before that period, including Avram, Yitzchok, etc. Avram’s ‎question of ‎במה אדע כי אירשנה‎, meant: “how will I know that I ‎personally will be included in the distribution of the land at that ‎time? He knew that he would not inherit a plot of land in Israel as ‎part of his father Terach’s merit, as he had been the first convert ‎to Judaism, something that was confirmed in Sukkah 49. ‎Since he did not endure slavery in Egypt as did the generation of ‎the Exodus, he was not sure that he would qualify at the time of ‎the distribution. Avram’s question had been triggered by G’d ‎saying to him:, ‎לתת לך את הארץ הזאת לרשתה‎, “to give to you this ‎land in order to inherit it.” (15,7) Avram wanted to know if he ‎would live long enough to take part in the distribution of the ‎land in Joshua’s time, or how he was to understand the words: ‎לתת לך‎, “to give to you.” The Talmud in Sukkah 49 quotes ‎psalms 47,10 where we encounter the expression ‎עם אלוקי אברהם‎, ‎‎“the nation that worships the G’d of Avraham”; a sage raised ‎question whether G’d perhaps is not also the G’d of the people of ‎Yitzchok and the G’d of the people of Yaakov.” The answer given ‎is that Avraham was the first convert from which the Jewish ‎people developed, so that he enjoys a special status. As a reward, ‎G’d gave the land of Israel especially to him. Avraham wanted to ‎know if, since the land of Israel becomes a ‎מורשה‎, his share would ‎be due to his father bequeathing it to him. The term ‎ירש‎, “to ‎inherit,” always implies that one inherits from a father. If ‎Avram’s question had been ‎במה אדע כי תתן לי‎, “how will I know ‎that You give it to me,” it would have been inappropriate, of ‎course. G’d had spoken about “giving;” Avram asked only about ‎the hereditary aspect, ‎אירשנה‎. We will deal with the expression ‎במה אדע‎, somewhat later in this paragraph.‎ When G’d introduced His reply to Avram’s question with the ‎words: ‎ידוע תדע כי גר יהיה זרעך‎, “you must truly realize that your ‎descendants will be strangers, etc.,” this can best be understood ‎when referring to a commentary by the Zohar I 87 on the ‎verse: (Genesis 2,4)‎אלה תולדות  השמים והארץ בהבראם ‏‎. The letter ‎ה‎ in ‎smaller script in the middle of this word alerts the reader not to ‎read the word as a single word, but as ‎באברהם ברא‎, i.e. G’d created ‎the universe on account of, or with the eventual assistance of ‎Avraham.” Had G’d not foreseen that someone like Avram will be ‎born, He would not have considered it worth His while to create ‎the human race. The fact that Avraham, on his own, without ‎prompting, would proclaim the name of the Creator, made it ‎worth G’d’s while to put up with all the sins man would commit. ‎Avraham would be the one to acquaint his peers with the concept ‎that G’d is One, is unique, is in charge of the universe and yet had ‎granted the creatures he made in His image freedom of choice to ‎choose their own path in life. The fact that this Avraham would ‎sire a Yitzchok, and Yitzchok in turn would sire a Yaakov who ‎raised 12 sons who would form the nucleus of the Jewish nation, a ‎nation of priests, made it all worthwhile for G’d. When the Jewish ‎people collectively accepted G’d’s Torah, without critically ‎examining what was written therein first, this was a crowning ‎moment not only for the Jewish people, but it enabled G’d to ‎converse with a mortal human being, Moses, as if he were on His ‎own level, i.e. ‎פנים אל פנים‎, face to face.‎ When G’d introduced His reply to Avram’s question with the ‎words: ‎ידוע תדע כי גר יהיה זרעך‎, “you must truly realize that your ‎descendants will be strangers, etc.,” this can best be understood ‎when referring to a commentary by the Zohar I 87 on the ‎verse: (Genesis 2,4)‎אלה תולדות  השמים והארץ בהבראם ‏‎.

Moses reminded the people in Deut. 5,4 how 40 years earlier, ‎when most of them had not yet been alive, G’d had addressed the ‎whole nation on the ‎פנים אל פנים‎ “face to face level,” [until the ‎people asked Moses to be their interpreter instead. Ed.] At that ‎time all creatures on earth were in awe of their Creator. When the ‎people had consecrated the Tabernacle in the desert as a “home” ‎for Hashem in the lower parts of the universe, G’d took delight in ‎the world He had created, as we know from Taanit 26 where ‎the Talmud understands Song of Songs 3,11 ‎ביום חתונתו וביום שמחת ‏לבו‎, “on His wedding day, the day when His heart rejoices,” as ‎referring to G’d’s feelings on the day of the revelation at Mount ‎Sinai, and the day when the Tabernacle was consecrated, ‎respectively. This is the kind of ‎נחת רוח‎, “pleasure, satisfaction,” ‎that man in the lower part of the universe can contribute to G’d ‎in the loftier spheres, in heaven. On both of these occasions the ‎joy was reciprocal, G’d showing that He can associate with ‎earthlings and take pleasure from this. The Israelites’ enthusiastic ‎response after the splitting of the sea and their miraculous and ‎escape from Pharaoh’s pursuing armies, was another occasion ‎when the reciprocal nature of the relationship between G’d and ‎His “chosen” people was demonstrated publicly. Nowadays, ‎almost 4000 years later, we recall these events and praise the Lord ‎every week when we pronounce the blessings over wine. Not a ‎day goes by without our giving thanks to the Lord for the Exodus ‎from Egypt‎. At the time when Avram lived, the world, i.e. the planet earth ‎and man on it, was still in a state of semi-collapse, its continued ‎existence far from assured, until Yitzchok and Yaakov continued ‎the work that Avram had started when he kept proclaiming the ‎power and goodness of the Creator. This assurance of the earth’s ‎continued existence was only confirmed with the creation of the ‎Jewish people, and this people’s leaving Egypt as G’d’s people, ‎after having slaughtered the Passover, and proven that they ‎considered the Creator as their highest authority. The Tur, commenting on why we mention the Exodus ‎of Egypt in the weekly Kiddush, as opposed to the ‎‎Kiddush on the festivals whose link to the Exodus is self-‎evident, explains that the Sabbath harbours within it the ‎כח ‏המוליד‎, the power that enables creatures to regenerate themselves ‎by producing offspring. This “power” is conditional on the ‎observance of the Sabbath (in some form). Terach, Avram’s ‎father, while able to produce physical offspring, was unable to ‎produce offspring equipped with the kind of soul that would be ‎active in spreading the message that G’d is the one and only ‎Creator. [I have not been able to find where the Tur writes ‎this, although he writes about man as well as most other living ‎creatures becoming endowed with the ability to procreate bodies ‎in his Torah commentary.

              </summary>
              <p>[AND ABRAHAM EXPIRED.] Expired refers to a death wherein the soul leaves the body in a moment, without pain or delay. Proof of this is he (Jacob) gathered up his feet unto the bed and then immediately expired (Gen. 49:33). (We thus see that gava refers to a quick and painless death.)  Every expiration (gevi’ah) is a death, but not every death is an expiration (gevi’ah). Hence Scripture states, with regard to those who perished in the flood, And all flesh expired (Gen. 7:21).  (According to I.E., Gen. 7:12 teaches that the flood killed swiftly (Weiser).)  </p>

              <p>The meaning of, and (Abraham) died  (There was no need to state “and Abraham died” after stating “and he expired,” since expired means he died quickly.)  is that he died at a ripe old age. (And Abraham died is not redundant since it is not connected to expired but to what follows, i.e., and Abraham died in a good old age (Filwarg).) </p>

              <p>AND WAS GATHERED TO HIS PEOPLE. Some say that this refers to the soul of life which, even while functioning (I.E. uses the term kevod ha-nefesh literally, the glory of life. The “glory” refers to man’s soul which gives life to the body.)  in the body, is a separate entity. When it separates from the body it returns to its source. (According to I.E. man’s soul is derived from a universal soul. While in the body the soul does not share the former’s corporeal properties. It has its own existence and can function independently of the body. It is thus a “separate entity” (Levine, p. 13).)  Others say that and was gathered to his people is a mere idiom. (According to this interpretation there is no philosophical implication in the verse.)  One who follows in the footsteps of his ancestors is said, as it were, to be joining them. But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace (Gen. 15:15) is similar.</p>

              <p>זקן ושבע ימים, “old and content.” Seeing that the Torah had told us previously that Avraham had been blessed by G’d in all that mattered, and that he had been the recipient of material wealth and honour of every conceivable kind, the Torah tells us that because of this he died without any regrets, did not feel that there were things he had not been able to achieve. This was in pronounced contrast to the fate of the average person of whom we are told in Kohelet Rabbah 1,34 that “when a person dies, half his aspirations in life for acquisitions went unfulfilled.” If he had once made the acquisition of say 1 million his objective, he had raised this objective as soon as he had realised it, so that when he died he had felt cheated by life. The author of Kohelet called this syndrome אהב כסף לא ישבע כסף, “he who loves silver will never get enough of it (Kohelet 5,9).”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויאסף אל עמיו, “and he was gathered to his people.” Seeing that essentially, death is a separation of phenomena namely the different raw materials which combine to make up the body, which were previously integrated, the Torah informed us that the soul was gathered into his people, i.e. did not disintegrate. The soul returned to the distinguished environment around G’d’s throne of glory. The soul itself is also known as כבוד, “honour” or “distinction.” We find this term applied to the soul in Psalms 30,13 למען יזמרך כבוד ולא ידום, ”in order that [my] soul sing hymns to You endlessly;” as well as in Isaiah 58,8 כבוד ה' יאספך, “the place where the כבוד of G’d is gathered in.” The choice of the term עמיו, “his people,” is analogous to expressions used in the Bible for the soul such as Exodus 31,14 where the Torah decrees a form of death of the soul with the words ונכרתה הנפש ההיא מקרב עמיה, “and such a soul shall be cut off from amongst its people,” (its fellow-souls, obviously( Innocent souls are gathered together forming a family, a nation. The same thing applied here.  The expression ויגוע to describe the death of the body here may be in order to illustrate that what happened to the body of Avraham was no different than what happened to all the bodies of the animals and the people who died during the deluge where the Torah described their death (Genesis 7,21) as ויגוע כל בשר הרומש על הארץ, “all flesh which moved on the earth died, etc.” Compare also Genesis 6,17 when the deluge had been predicted, and the Torah wrote כל אשר בארץ יגוע, “everything on earth will die.” The author refers to a statement by our sages that the term גויעה for death is used only in connection with the righteous and the obvious problem of the verses quoted from the Torah’s report of the deluge where the sinners died. He says that what was meant by that statement is to be understood as a combination of גויעה plus אסיפה.</p>

In a similar sense is [the verse written in connection with Isaac’s life], and full of days, (Further, 35:29.)  which means that his soul was sated with days, and he had no desire that the future days should bring something new. This is as it is said of David: And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches and honor. (I Chronicles 29:28.)  This is a story of the mercies of the Eternal (Isaiah 63:7.)  towards the righteous ones, and of their attribute of goodness by virtue of which they do not desire luxuries, just as it is said of them, Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, (Psalms 21:3.)  and not as it is said of other people, He that loveth money shall not be satisfied with money, (Ecclesiastes 5:9.)  and as the Rabbis have commented thereon: (Koheleth Rabbah 1:34.)  “No man leaves the world having amassed half of his desires. If he has a hundred, he desires two hundred. If he succeeds in acquiring two hundred, he desires to make of it four hundred, as it is said, He that loveth money shall not be satisfied with money.” (Ecclesiastes 5:9.)  In Bereshith Rabbah the Rabbis have said: (62:3.)  “The Holy One, blessed be He, shows the righteous in this world the reward He is destined to give them in the Coming World, and their souls become full and they fall asleep.” (I.e., they die without pain.)  The Sages were stirred by this and they explained the verse which says, and full of years, with this vision [of the reward that G-d shows the righteous before they die].</p>

Geviah is written concerning the evildoers; because of their evil they die quickly and cannot leave a will for their children, like the generation of the Flood, which perished quickly. Concerning the righteous, geviah is also written, for their benefit, that they die quickly without anguish, but they make a will beforehand. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 25:17.) </p>

              <p>“Old and contented” [25:8]. Abraham died old and contented. Bahya asks a question here. Why does the verse not say, full of years. This means, with many years and many days. The explanation is that Abraham did not go after the desires of the world that he should have desired to have an excess of money. Many die who do not have half the money that is enough. If he would have ten thousand gulden, then he would desire twenty thousand gulden, as the verse says, “a lover of money never has his fill of money” [Ecclesiastes 5:9]. One who loves silver is never satisfied. Our sages said: “no person leaves the world with half of his desires gratified.” (Ecclesiastes Rabbah, 1.13.)  That is why the verse says about Abraham that he was content with everything. He was satisfied. (Bahya, Genesis, 25:8.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>Moses' blessings are viewed as a continuation of Jacob's blessings. Jacob had concluded with the line &quot;and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them.&quot; (Genesis 49,28) So Moses says &quot;and this,&quot; at the beginning of his blessings, whereas we find this term used at the very end of Jacob's blessings. Since Reuben had been demoted at the time of Joseph's sale, and had been the subject of his father's criticism at the time Jacob died, Moses emphasizes that though numerically not strong, Reuben would produce outstanding men in spite of this. The blessing may also include the assurance that Reuben personally had not lost his share in the world to come as the result of the incident with Bilhah. By mentioning Yehudah next, the fact that Reuben had been mentioned first, shows that Moses had not wanted to deny Reuben his rightful place. Yehudah is mentioned next due to his rank. Since it will be he who will lead Israel in battle, provide the kings, Moses blesses Yehudah by imploring G'd to come to Yehudah's aid when the latter finds himself in difficulties. &quot;Though his hands fight on his behalf, be the helper from his adversaries.&quot; (33,7) Since the temporal and spiritual leadership of the nation are to go hand in hand, Levi is mentioned next in the list of tribes to be blessed. Although inquiries re the will of G'd are made via le-ish chassidecha, religious authority, by the use of tumecha ve-urecha, the ineffable name in the High Priest's breastplate, the secular leader is required to stand in the presence of the High Priest. (see chapter 35) Since Moses is himself a member of the tribe of Levi, he apologises for the sin at the &quot;waters of strife,&quot; explaining it as having been due to instructions once received at Massa to hit the rock. (33,8) Since the sin had not been intentional, Aaron is not excluded from the term of endearment &quot;your pious one.&quot; Both on the occasion of the golden calf episode when the Levites had risked their lives for G'ds law, and at Shittim when Pinchas had done so, the tribe had displayed fervent loyalty. The second function of the tribe is to teach the Torah to Israel, yoru mishpatecha, they will teach Your social laws. Thirdly, service in the temple will be performed by members of that tribe, yassimu ketorah be-apecha, they will put incense before You. The position of Priest and Levite being a hereditary one, it is apt to be viewed by some as an undeserved privilege, and will arouse antagonism towards that tribe. Therefore, Moses asks that the Levites' adversaries be crushed, (verse 11) Moses does not mention the tribe of Shimon, the latter still smarting from the affair of Baal Peor, and the wounds on its collective dignity inflicted by Pinchas. Also, it had just lost twelve thousand men. Moses therefore was content not to criticise the tribe of Shimon at this stage. Also, this made it unnecessary for him to bestow thirteen blessings. </p>

              <p>“These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life that he lived, one hundred and seventy-five years” (Genesis 25:7).  “Abraham expired and died at a good old age, aged and content, and he was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:8).  “These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life.” It is written: “The Lord knows the days of the faultless; their legacy will last forever” (Psalms 37:18). “The Lord knows the days of the faultless” – this is Abraham, as it is stated: “Be faultless” (Genesis 17:1). “Their legacy will last forever” – “these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life,” as the Holy One blessed be He was fond of the years of the righteous and recorded them in the Torah, so the legacy of their days would be remembered forever – “at a good old age, aged and content.”  “[Abraham] expired” – Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai said: The pious men of old would suffer from intestinal illness for ten or twenty days [before dying], which teaches you that sickness cleanses [the soul]. Rabbi Yehuda said: Anyone in whose regard “expiring” is stated, died of intestinal illness.  It is written: “Might and grandeur are her clothing, [and she rejoices at the final day]” (Proverbs 31:25) – the entire reward granted to the righteous is prepared for them in the future, and the Holy One blessed be He shows them the granting of the reward that he is destined to give them in the future while they are still in this world, and their souls are satisfied [with what they have seen], and they go to sleep, [i.e., expire peacefully].  Rabbi Elazar said: This is analogous to a feast that the king prepared. He invited the guests [beforehand] and showed them what they would be eating and drinking. Their souls were satisfied, and they went to sleep [with this feeling of satisfaction]. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He shows the righteous the granting of their reward that he is destined to give them in the future while they are still in this world, and they go to sleep, as it is stated: “For now, I would lie down and be silent. [I would sleep; then there would be rest for me]” (Job 3:13) – this shows that at the moment of the departure of the righteous [from this world], the Holy One blessed be He shows them the reward granted to them.  When Rabbi Abahu was dying, he was shown thirteen rivers of [precious] balsam oil. He asked: ‘Whose are these?’ They said to him: ‘Yours.’ He said: ‘These are for Abahu? “And I had said: For nothing I labored, I expended my strength for emptiness and futility; but indeed, my portion is from the Lord”’ (Isaiah 49:4).  Zavdi ben Levi, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and Rabbi Yosei ben Parta, the three of them recited these verses as they were dying. One of them said: “For this, everyone who is devoted to You should pray at the time of finding” (Psalms 32:6); “For our heart rejoices in Him…” (Psalms 33:21). Another said: “You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies” (Psalms 23:5); “But let all who take refuge in You rejoice” (Psalms 5:12). Another said: “For one day in Your courtyard is better than one thousand” (Psalms 84:11). The Rabbis say: “How great is the goodness You have in store for those who fear You” (Psalms 31:20). All this shows that at the moment of the departure of the righteous from the world, the Holy One blessed be He shows them the reward granted to them.  Ben Azai says: “Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His devoted ones” (Psalms 116:15). When does the Holy One blessed be He show them the reward that is prepared for them? (When does He show them how precious they are in His eyes?)  It is adjacent to their death. That is what is written: “the death of His devoted ones.” That is why: “And she rejoices at the final day” (Proverbs 31:25).  What is the difference between the death of youths and the death of the elderly? Rabbi Yehuda said: A lamp, when it becomes extinguished on its own, [when the oil has run out,] it is good for it and good for the wick. But when it does not become extinguished on its own, [and there is still oil in it,] it is bad for it and bad for the wick. Rabbi Abahu said: A fig, when it is picked at its proper time, it is good for it and good for the fig tree. (This is why the Torah makes a point of writing that Abraham died “at a good old age, aged and content.”)  But when it is picked not at its proper time, it is bad for it and bad for the fig tree. (If a person dies in ripe old age, this is the natural course of things, but if he dies young, before his time, it is unnatural and detrimental to his soul, which was not able to reach its full potential.)   Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great and his students – and some say it was Rabbi Akiva and his students, and others say it was Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥalafta and his students – had the routine that they would come early in the day and sit and study beneath a certain fig tree. The owner of the fig tree would come early each day and pick its fruit. They said: ‘Is he, perhaps, suspicious of us?’ (Is that why he keeps coming by when we are here?)  What did they do? They changed their place. He went to them and said to them: ‘My masters, the one mitzva that you sat and afforded me, that you were sitting and studying beneath my fig tree, you have deprived me of it.’ They said to him: ‘We had said that perhaps you were suspicious of us.’ He reassured them and they returned to their place. What did he do? He woke up early in the morning, but he did not go to pick the fruit. (He refrained from picking the fruit while they were there, as he did not want to make them feel that he suspected them.)  The sun shone upon it [the tree] and they [the figs] became infested with worms. They said: ‘The owner of a fig tree knows when it is the proper time to harvest the fig tree, and he picks its fruits [at that specific time]. So, too, the Holy One blessed be He knows when it is the proper time for the righteous to depart from the world and he removes them [at that specific time].’ That is what is written: “My beloved descended to his garden, to the beds of fragrant plants, [to eat in the gardens, to pluck lilies]” (Song of Songs 6:2). (The Beloved One in Song of Songs refers to God. Plucking the lilies is a metaphor for removing the righteous from this world.)   “At a good old age [beseiva]” – Reish Lakish said: There are three people in whose regard seiva is stated: Abraham, and it was beneficial for him; David, (I Chronicles 29:28.)  and it was beneficial for him; Gideon, (Judges 8:32.)  and it was not beneficial for him. Why? “Gideon crafted it into an ephod” (Judges 8:27) – for idol worship.</p>

And yet you say here: “There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife”? (Why is Sarah’s burial mentioned at this point, being that it had happened so many years in the past?)  The explanation is that it is to teach you that everyone who performed kindness to Sarah [in attending her funeral] was privileged to perform kindness for Abraham [in attending his funeral as well].  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Shem and Ever were walking before his bier, and they saw an empty spot alongside her [Sarah] for our patriarch Abraham, and they buried him in that adjacent plot, in the place that was prepared and designated for him. (And that is why Sarah’s burial is mentioned at this point.) </p>

Chizkuni and Derekh Chayyim mention that Abraham died in a good old age, while Moses' death was serene despite the trials he faced.

              <p>So the way of these three forefathers has been explained to you: That Avraham was the beginning. And the beginning of the forefathers indicates the beginning of Israel - that Avraham had goodness all of his days and died &quot;in a good old age&quot; (Genesis 25:8). He was only in pain before this, as was explained (in the previous paragraph). So too was the beginning of Israel in pain, but the end was with goodness. And Yitzchak who was the middle of the forefathers, indicates the middle of Israel. So Yitzchak had goodness at his beginning; but at the end, his eyes dimmed and afflictions came to him. And this thing indicates the darkness of the exile, and the removal of the light of Israel. And also the Temple is called, light - as they, may their memory be blessed, said, &quot;He extinguished the (candle) [light] of the world,&quot; as it is written in the first chapter of Bava Batra (4a). And Yaakov who was the culmination and end of the forefathers indicates the end and culmination of Israel. And Yaakov was the opposite [of Yitzchak], since all of his days were with distress - since he was pursued. Until, at the end, he was restored from his distress. And it is from him that the culmination and end of Israel would be similar to this.</p>

              <p>Moses rarely figures in the lists people make from time to time of the most influential people in history. He is harder to identify with than Abraham in his devotion, David in his charisma, or Isaiah in his symphonies of hope. The contrast between Abraham’s and Moses’ deaths could not be more pointed. Of Abraham, the Torah says, “Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people” (Gen. 25:8). Abraham’s death was serene. Though he had been through many trials, he had lived to see the first fulfilment of the promises God had given him. He had a child, and he had acquired at least the first plot of land in Israel. In the long journey of his descendants he had taken the first step. There is a sense of closure.</p>

              <p>[PERISHED.] Va-yigva (perished) means died. I will explain the exact meaning of this term when I comment on And Abraham expired (va-yigva), and died (Gen. 25:8). It is clear (From verse 21. I.E.’s point is that ha-romes is a general term. The verse then goes on to enumerate exactly what ha-romes includes.)  that remes (creeping thing) is a general term that includes fowl, cattle, animals, small thin swarming things and man. It is possible that all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life (v. 22) refers to every man (v. 21), (Verse 22 thus explains only every man, i.e., those who had a neshamat ru’ach chayyim. According to Cherez, this interpretation postulates that remes does not include man.)  as we do not find the expression neshamah (breath) (Neshamah is the term for soul.)  used in reference to any creature except man. Many say that the soul is termed neshamah because it comes from the heaven (shamayim). The fact that shamayim and neshamah have differing roots does not refute the latter interpretation because there are other similar instances. (Neshamah comes from the root nun, shin, mem. Shamayim comes from the root shin, mem, mem (Weiser).) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND HE EXPIRED (‘VAYIGVA’). Rashi comments: “This expression — ‘expiring’ — is only mentioned in the case of righteous people.” But in the Gemara (Baba Bathra 16b. The Gemara (teaching) constitutes the collected discussions of the Amoraim, centering around the Mishnah. The Mishnah and Gemara combined are known as the Talmud.)  the Rabbis objected, “But it says ‘expiring’ with reference to the generation of the flood: And all flesh expired that moved upon the earth, etc., and every man; (Above, 7:21.)  Every thing that is in the earth shall expire.” (Ibid., 6:17.)  And the Gemara answers: “We were referring to [those places where it mentions both] ‘expiring’ and ‘gathering,’” [as it says in the case of Abraham and in the present verse concerning Ishmael]. The intent of the Rabbis is that the expression “expiring” indicates death without prolonged sickness and without pains. This death is merited only by the righteous people, [and concerning their death both “expiring” and “gathering” are mentioned]. But the men of the generation of the flood, who were overthrown as in a moment, and no hands fell upon them, (Lamentations 4:6.)  as also those who died in the desert — with them Scripture therefore mentions only “expiring”: when our brethren expired. (Numbers 20:3.)  And so is the sense of the verse, And that man expired not alone in his iniquity, (Joshua 22:20.)  meaning that his iniquity did not cause him instant death. But when Scripture so mentions the term “expiring” in reference to death together with the word vayei’aseph (and he was gathered [unto his people]) or vayamoth (and he died), it hints to the death of the righteous ones. In the words of Bereshith Rabbah, (62:2.)  “And Abraham expired, and died, (Verse 8 here.)  Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Ilai said, ‘The early pious men used to suffer with intestinal disease for about ten or twenty days before death, thus establishing the principle that illness cleanses from sin.’ Rabbi Yehudah said, ‘All who are said to have expired died of intestinal disease.’” There in Bereshith Rabbah the Rabbis also said, (31:15.)  “Everything that is in the earth ‘yigva’ (Ibid., 6:17.)  — will shrivel.” It would appear that to the Rabbis, the word gviyah (expiring) was analogous to Their flesh shall consume while they stand upon their feet. (Zechariah 14:12.)  So also is the opinion of Onkelos who translated here ve’isnagid, meaning “fainting,” similar to the expressions: “isnagid (he became faint) and sighed”; (Sanhedrin 39a.)  “You might think he may pay as a fine five negidim (emaciated) oxen.” (Baba Kamma 67b. In case of a thief who makes restitution for stolen oxen. See Exodus 21:37. Now “you might think that if he stole an ox worth one hundred (weights in gold or silver) he may pay as a fine five oxen emaciated (‘and in near-dying condition’ - Rashi). It is for this reason that Scripture says (he shall pay five oxen) ‘tachtav’ “ — in its place. In other words each one of the five oxen must be equal in value to the stolen ox, “for otherwise he might pay him back five emaciated oxen which together will not equal even the value of the one stolen” (Meiri, Baba Kamma ibid.).)  It is so said in the case of the flood, as Scripture states, And He blotted out every being. (Above 7:23. Ramban’s intent here is to be understood in the light of what he has written above on that verse: “And He blotted out every living substance…” After having said, And all flesh perished (‘vayigva’), and having said, whatever was in the dry land, died, Scripture continues to say, “And He blotted out, meaning etc.”(see above p. 112). Here in discussing the meaning of the word gviyah. Ramban brings proof to his theory that gviyah in itself does not mean death but fainting, emaciation, etc. For it is on this basis that we can understand why after having said ‘vayigva’ all flesh Scripture continued to inform us further that it died and was blotted out, since these facts are not included in the term of gviyah.)  And in the case of Ishmael it is stated in the verse before us: And he expired and died, as a man who is powerless and dies, and this is the measure (“A measure.” In the Lisbon edition of Ramban: “the death.”)  meted out to righteous people. (For since in the present verse concerning Ishmael it says both “expired” and “died” the reference must be to the death of a righteous person, as explained in the text above. “It is based upon this (double expression) that the Sages of blessed memory have said that Ishmael repented of his evil ways” (Bachya, p. 219 in my edition).)

But the wise man too “forsaking is added” (Gen. 25:8),  as Moses says in perfect accord with the nature of things: for the subtraction of vainglory is the addition of reality.</p>

              <p>Ben Azzai would say: When someone’s mind is calm as a result of the wisdom they have acquired, that is a good sign. When someone’s mind is not calm as a result of the wisdom they have acquired, that is a bad sign. When someone’s mind is calm in the face of his desire, that is a good sign. When someone’s mind is not calm in the face of his desire, that is a bad sign. When the sages look kindly upon someone (at the time of his death), that is a good sign. When the sages do not look kindly upon someone, that is a bad sign. When someone is facing upward [at the time of his death], that is a good sign. When someone is facing downward, that is a bad sign. When someone looks people in the eye, that is a good sign. When someone avoids looking people in the eye, that is a bad sign. When someone’s face shines, that is a good sign. When someone’s face is gloomy, that is a bad sign. At the hour of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai’s death, he raised his voice and cried. His students said to him: Rabbi! You are a tall pillar, a light to the world, a mighty hammer; so why do you cry? He said to them: Am I going to face a human king? If he were angry with me, it would be only in this world. And if he imprisoned me or killed me, it would be only in this world. And what’s more, I would be able to pacify him with words, or bribe him with money. But no, I am going to face the King of all kings, the Holy Blessed One. And if He is angry with me, it will be in this world and in the World to Come. And what’s more, I cannot pacify Him with words or bribe Him with money. So I have two paths before me: one that leads to Paradise, and one that leads to Gehenna, and I do not know if He will force me into Gehenna or bring me into Paradise. For the verse says about Him (Psalms 22:30), “All who go down into the dirt will submit before him.” (With regard to Moses, it says that he breathed his last breath and died, and was gathered to his people.) It also says (Exodus 33:23), “I will remove my hand.” And then it says (Ezekiel 2:10), “And He spread it out before me, and it had writing on the front and on the back.” “On the front” refers to this world; “on the back” refers to the World to Come. Another interpretation: “On the front” refers to the sufferings of the righteous in this world and the tranquility of the wicked in this world. “On the back” refers to the reward for the righteous in the Future to Come, and the punishment for the wicked in Gehenna. [The verse from Ezekiel continues:]“And on it were written lamentations, dirges, and woes” (Ezekiel 2:10). “Lamentations” refers to the punishment of the wicked in this world, as it says (Ezekiel 32:16), “This is the lamentation with which they shall lament for her; the women of the nations shall lament for her.” “Dirges” refers to the reward for the righteous in the Time to Come, as it says (Psalms 92:4), “Upon the ten-stringed instrument, and upon the lyre and the dirge of the harp.” “Woe” refers to the punishment of the wicked in the World to Come ,as it says (Ezekiel 7:26), “Woe will come upon woe, rumor upon rumor.” He would also say: Clear your house of impurity, and prepare a chair for Hezekiah, king of Judah.</p>

Ishmael repented and acknowledged Isaac's precedence in burying Abraham, showcasing true penitence. The order of mention in Hebrew does not always indicate chronological order, as seen in Genesis 1:5. Isaac reconciled with Ishmael at Be'er Lachai Ro'i in the wilderness. Humility connects a person with the Creator, demonstrated by Hashem's acts of kindness. The Talmud suggests Ishmael repented based on his subordination to Yitzchak during Avraham's burial. Yitzhak never forgot Hagar and Yishmael, reuniting them with Avraham after Sara's death. Isaac and Ishmael buried Abraham together in the Machpelah cave.</summary>

Similarly, in ‎Genesis 25,9 where Avraham’s burial is described, Yitzchok is ‎mentioned ahead of his older brother Yishmael as he was the ‎more righteous of the two.‎</p>

            <summary>Ishmael repented and yielded precedence to Isaac in burying Abraham, showcasing his acknowledgement of Isaac's status as the major descendant of Abraham. This act of respect is highlighted by the fact that Isaac is mentioned before Ishmael in the burial process, despite Ishmael being the older brother. This demonstrates Ishmael's true penitence and recognition of Isaac's righteousness.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>ויקברו אותו יצחק וישמעאל בניו , “and his sons Yitzchak and Ishmael buried him.” Seeing that Ishmael was the senior of the brothers, the Torah should have mentioned his name first. The fact that the Torah did not do so shows that our sages were correct when they said (Baba Batra 16) that Ishmael had become a penitent while Avraham was still alive and that he had acknowledged Yitzchak’s status as Avraham’s major descendant. When Yitzchak died, the Torah writes: “Esau and Yaakov his sons buried him” (Genesis 35,29). Clearly, the contrast between what is written here and what is written there must tell us something, seeing Esau was a non-penitent firstborn born of the same mother as had given birth to Yaakov. Though he had “sold” his birthright, the Torah still lists Esau there as the elder brother. Death is described in six different forms throughout the Bible, three of which are applicable to the wicked and three to the righteous. The three terms applied to a wicked person dying are: מחייה, אבדן, כרת. Death described as מחייה is the worst of the three deaths. It is applied to the deaths of the kind of wicked people who have neither Torah knowledge nor ordinary wisdom to their credit and remained unaware of the Creator and His wonderful deeds. Such people’s death is no different than the death of animals. Their souls perish as absolutely as do their bodies. Proverbs 13,9 ונר רשעים ידעך, “and the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished,” compares the soul of the wicked person to a lamp, explaining that this soul is dependent on the body it inhabits much as the light of a lamp is dependent on its oil supply. When that supply fails the light is extinguished. This group of wicked people has neither reward nor punishment to look forward to ever. [I suppose the reference is to the time of resurrection. Ed.] Examples of such people were the people of the generation who perished during the deluge of whom the sages have said that just as they have been wiped out on earth their life expectancy in the hereafter has also been wiped out (compare Sanhedrin 108). The sages there concentrated on the words וימח את כל היקום, “He erased all creatures” (Genesis 7,23). This line refers to their destruction in this life, whereas the subsequent words וימחו מן הארץ in verse 24 in the same chapter refer to their becoming extinct in any form of life in the future.  The expression אבדן when applied to the death of the wicked refers to such Israelite sinners as died without benefit of having repented their sins prior to their deaths. They are being judged after their physical death in Gehinom; this is the meaning of Leviticus 23,30 והאבדתי את הנפש ההיא. Such a death is worse than the death described by the Torah as כרת. The people guilty of the penalty called כרת are judged and after they have completed whatever length of punishment has been decreed for them, their souls are admitted to the hereafter.   The three types of deaths mentioned in connection with the righteous are:  1) גויעה, אסיפה, ביאה — All three of these types of death are mentioned in connection with Avraham. This means that these three are all of the same category [as Avraham certainly died only once. Ed.] We read in 25,8 ויגוע ויאסף; we also have the Torah telling Avraham about his death in the future where G’d said to him in Genesis 15,15 ואתה תבא אל אבותיך בשלום, “as far as you are concerned you will come to join your fathers in peace.” Expressions of death involving either of the three words mentioned in connection with Avraham apply to the kind of righteous people who transfer to Gan Eden immediately upon the death of their bodies, not having to face any punishment at all. Such a death was the lot of Ishmael, of whom the Torah writes ויגוע וימת ויאסף אל עמיו. Clearly, he had become a penitent.  2) The second type of death involving the righteous is described in the Torah by the word לקיחה, “being taken away.” Such an expression is applied to people who enter Gan Eden while physically alive such as Chanoch (Genesis 5, 24) of whom the Torah wrote: “he was no longer, as G’d had taken him.” The prophet Elijah experienced a similar “death,” as he had told his disciple Elisha (Kings II 2,10) אם תראה אותי לוקח מאתך, “if you will see me taken from you, etc.”   3) The third type of death applicable to the righteous is described as “rest.” This is an expression promising the righteous participation in the resurrection, a time which our sages have described with the words מנוחה or שבת. This promise was applied to Daniel who had been told (Daniel 12,13) ואתה לך לקץ ותנוח ותעמוד לגורלך לקץ הימין, “But you, go on to the end; you shall rest and arise to your destiny at the end of the days.”</p>

              <p>“Isaac and Ishmael buried him” [25:9]. Here one asks a question. Why does the verse name Isaac first? He was younger than Ishmael. Ramban and Bahya write the explanation. This teaches us that Ishmael repented and honored Isaac with going first, because Isaac was more righteous than Ishmael. Thus, Ishmael honored him. If Ishmael had not repented, God would not have allowed him to come to bury Abraham, because he was an evildoer. (Ramban, Genesis, 25:9; Bahya, Genesis, 25:9.) </p>

            <summary>The text explains that in Hebrew language, the order in which things are mentioned does not always indicate their chronological order, as seen in how light is mentioned before darkness in Genesis 1:5. This is similar to other instances in Scripture where the lesser is mentioned before the greater, such as the moon before the sun in Psalms 74:16. This is done to highlight the importance of the light over darkness, even though darkness came before light.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>Now the darkness proceeded the light, as it is written (Genesis 1:2). The great movement (diurnal movement) includes the time of darkness and light, and that is called “yom” (day), that is, a complete day of twenty-four hours. ( Thus “day” includes a period of darkness and a period of light, in that order.)  This does not conflict with the fact that Scripture first mentioned “God called the light ‘day’” (Genesis 1:5) before the night, for this is common with the Hebrew language, namely, when someone mentions two things he should begin with the latter. ( Verses 3 and 4 refer to the light, therefore verse 5 begins by calling the light “day.”)  For example, “I gave Jacob and Esau to Isaac, and I gave to Esau…” (Joshua 24:4). In the same way, “Your’s is the day also the night” (Psalms 74:16), and he mentions the minor luminary (the moon) that governs the night before the greater luminary (the sun), although the latter is more important than the former. Also, do not be perplexed when Scripture says “He formed the light and created darkness” (Isaiah 40:12). Scripture puts the light first because it has advantages over darkness, even though darkness came before the light. Similarly, in the verse “His sons Isaac and Ishmael” (Genesis 25:9). ( Isaac is mentioned first, even though he was the younger son.)  Also, “There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife” (ibid. 49:31), although he buried her. ( Abraham is mentioned first although Sarah was buried first.)  </p>

Ishmael repented during his father's life, as seen in the order of Isaac and Ishmael in the text (Ein Yaakov, Bava Batra 1:41). Ishmael accorded honor to Isaac by allowing him to go first during Abraham's burial, and those who showed kindness to Sarah were privileged to do the same for Abraham (Bereshit Rabbah 62:2).

And yet you say here: “There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife”? (Why is Sarah’s burial mentioned at this point, being that it had happened so many years in the past?)  The explanation is that it is to teach you that everyone who performed kindness to Sarah [in attending her funeral] was privileged to perform kindness for Abraham [in attending his funeral as well].  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Shem and Ever were walking before his bier, and they saw an empty spot alongside her [Sarah] for our patriarch Abraham, and they buried him in that adjacent plot, in the place that was prepared and designated for him.

(The reference is to the Canaanite nations. They are called “pegs,” as in Numbers 33:55: &quot;Those whom you leave over will be like pegs in your eyes and thorns in your side.”)  “It was after Saul’s death” (II Samuel 1:1) – “the Philistines were waging war against Israel” (I Samuel 31:1). The students raised an objection to Rabbi Simon: ‘But is it not written: “After the death of Yehoyada, the princes of Judah came and prostrated themselves to the king”?’ (II Chronicles 24:17).

Rabbi Tanḥuma said: ‘Rabbi Simon came to say [his rule] only concerning [the phrase] “it was after [the death].”’ (Whereas in this verse, the words “it was” are missing from the formula.)   Rabbi Yudan said: [The words “it was after the death” of certain people connote that] the world would have regressed had the Holy One blessed be He not established others in their stead, as it is written: “It was after Abraham’s death,” and it is written: “Isaac dug anew” (Genesis 26:18). “It was after the death of Moses, servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, saying” (Joshua 1:1).

              <p>On this point, however, the Tanaim of the following Baraitha differ. (Gen. 24) The Lord has blessed Abraham bakol (in all things). What does the word bakol mean? R. Maier savs: &quot;He was blessed in not having any daughters.&quot; R. Juda says: &quot;On the contrary he was blessed in having a daughter.&quot; Acherim says: &quot;He had a daughter by the name bakol&quot; R. Elazar the Modai, said: &quot;Abraham, our father, was an astrologer; and therefore all the kings from the West and the East came to his door to ask his advice.&quot; R. Simon b. Jochai said: &quot;A diamond was hanging on Abraham's neck, and when a sick man looked upon it, he was cured. And when Abraham passed away, the Holy One, praised be He! sealed it in the planet of the sun.&quot; Abaye said: &quot;This is the reason for the statement: 'When the sun rises the sick become better.' &quot; There is another explanation [of the word bakol] that as long as Abraham was alive Esau did not become bad. According to still others: &quot;Because Ishmael repented in his days.&quot; That Esau did not rebel in his days, as it is written (Gen. 25, 29-34) and Esau came from the field, etc., and it was taught in a Baraitha that on that day our ancestor Abraham died, and Jacob boiled lentils to offer consolation to Isaac. And whence do we learn that Ishmael had repented? As It happened when Rabina and R. Chama b. Bizna were sitting before Raba while Raba was slumbering, Rabina then said to R. Chama b.

Jochanan, that any death which is termed Geviah, refers only to a death of a righteous?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; came the reply. &quot;But the same expression is also written concerning the generation of the flood?&quot; &quot;Our reference is only when the word geviah (departed) goes together with Asipha (gathered).&quot; But concerning Ishmael both expressions are used.&quot; Meanwhile Raba awoke from his slumber. He then said to them: &quot;Children, thus said R. Jochanan, 'Ishmael repented during his father's life, for it is written (Ib., ib. 9) And his sons Isaac and Ishmael, etc. And from the fact that Isaac is named first, although Ishmael was older, it is to be understood that Ishmael had repented and, knowing that Isaac was better than he, he gave him the preference.' &quot; But perhaps the verse counts them inaccordance with their wisdom. Then the Scripture (Ib. 35, 29) And Esau, and Jacob, his sons, buried him, should also have said, Jacob and Esau, and not according to the age, as it is now. Hence, we infer that Ishmael had repented. </p>

              <p>(Gen. 23:15:) MY LORD, LISTEN TO ME. WHAT IS A PIECE OF LAND WORTH FOUR HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER BETWEEN YOU AND ME? He said to him: If you want to give me four hundred centenarii of silver from the goods {another reading is hervata, which is construed as &quot;dung&quot; in the 'Arukh} (This bracketed note appears in this form in the Buber text.)  of your house, you can give it to me.

              <p>These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begot Isaac (Gen. 25:9). Scripture states elsewhere in allusion to this verse: Children’s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers (Prov. 17:6). The righteous are “regaled” (i.e. saved) by their grandchildren, and their children are regaled by their fathers. How do we know this? We know it because Abraham was saved for Jacob’s sake. After Nimrod caused Abraham to be hurled into the fiery furnace, the Holy One, blessed be He, descended to rescue him. The ministering angels thereupon exclaimed: Master of the Universe, why do You trouble to save him, since so many wicked men will descend from him? The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: I shall save him for the sake of his grandson Jacob, who will descend from him. Whence do we know this to be so? R. Berechiah said: It is written: Thus saith the Lord who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob (Isa. 29:22); that is, He redeemed him from the furnace for the sake of Jacob. Hence, fathers are saved for the sake of their descendants.</p>

            <summary>The Talmud suggests that Yishmael repented and became righteous based on his subordination to Yitzchak during Avraham's burial. The Israelites in Egypt were distinguishable from the Egyptians due to their appearance resembling their fathers, ensuring correct parentage. Isaac and Ishmael reconciled later in life, as seen when they stood together at Abraham's grave. Isaac's wife Rebecca may have been unaware of Abraham's desire for Ishmael to be blessed despite not inheriting the covenant.</summary>

              <p>Isaac surely knew this because, according to midrashic tradition, he and Ishmael were reconciled later in life. We see them standing together at Abraham’s grave (Gen. 25:9). It may be that this was a fact that Rebecca did not know. She associated blessing with covenant. She may have been unaware that Abraham wanted Ishmael blessed even though he would not inherit the covenant, and that God had acceded to the request.</p>

              <p>And there they became a great nation – this indicates that the Israelites were distinguishable there: How did they become distinguishable from the Egyptians? According to the Midrash, they did not adopt the Egyptian language or the Egyptian way of dress. (Mekhilta Parshat Bo, chapter 9)  It is my opinion that the children looked exactly like their fathers, thus the Egyptians could not say that they ruled over their women. We find another example of this idea: “Abraham begot Isaac.”  (Genesis 25:9 The commentaries explain that people might have claimed that Abraham was not the natural father of Isaac since he was so old – therefore God made Isaac look exactly like his father.)  This can help us understand the verse, “I let you grow as numerous as the plants of the field…and you came in herds.” (Ezekiel 16:7 I have translated this verse as it is understood in BT, Sotah 11b and not according to its literal meaning.)  According to the Talmud, after seducing their husbands the women gave birth in the field where the children were hidden until they were old enough to return to their family. Miraculously, every child knew his parents. One might argue that there was confusion, and the children did not return to the correct parents. A further miracle happened – since the children resembled their fathers, one knew that the parents and children were reunited. In this way the scoffers could not claim that the wrong parents were raising children.</p>

              <p>The Talmud states that Yishmael repented and became a righteous man (Baba Batra 16b), and the proof text for this is quite telling. The rabbis point to the fact that Avraham was buried by “Yitzchak and Yishmael” (Bereshit 25:9). This is compared to Yitzchak’s burial, which was performed by “Esav and Yaakov” (Bereshit 35:29). In the first case, the text lists the younger brother first, whereas in the second the older brother comes first. The rabbis extrapolate from the order of the names that by the time Avraham was buried, Yishmael recognized his own inferiority to Yitzchak. On the face of it, that does not make someone into a righteous man. One could be a murderer, a thief or all sorts of other things and still recognize the superiority of a Yitzchak. Apparently, however, this act of subordination is what determined Yishmael’s righteousness.</p>

And yet you say here: “There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife”? (Why is Sarah’s burial mentioned at this point, being that it had happened so many years in the past?)  The explanation is that it is to teach you that everyone who performed kindness to Sarah [in attending her funeral] was privileged to perform kindness for Abraham [in attending his funeral as well].  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: Shem and Ever were walking before his bier, and they saw an empty spot alongside her [Sarah] for our patriarch Abraham, and they buried him in that adjacent plot, in the place that was prepared and designated for him.

              <p>Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” that is what is written: “A greedy man rushes after wealth” (Proverbs 28:22); (The midrash will explain how this relates to the verse “if you lend money to My people,” but it first cites other interpretations of the verse. )  this is Cain, who hastened himself to take the world. How so? When he was with his brother, as it is stated: “It was when they were in the field” (Genesis 4:8), they said one to the other: ‘Come, let us divide the world.’ Cain said: ‘You take the movable property, and I [will take] the land.’ They divided it between them. Abel took the movable property and Cain [took] the land. [Cain] plotted to oust [Abel] from the world. Abel was walking on the earth and Cain was pursuing him. He said to him: ‘Leave what is mine.’ [Abel] went to the mountains, and [Cain] said: ‘Leave what is mine,’ until he stood over him and killed him. That is, “a greedy man rushes after wealth.” This is Cain, who was greedy toward his brother.  “And does not know that lack will come upon him” (Proverbs 28:22). What lack befell [Cain]? It is that the Holy One blessed be He said: “Restless and wandering you shall be on the earth” (Genesis 4:12). What is that? It is that every place that he went, the Holy One blessed be He would bring trouble along with him and they would strike him and pursue him until they would drive him away. Solomon proclaimed in his regard: “If a man would beget one hundred” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); this is Cain who begot one hundred children, “and would live many years” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); he lived as long as Adam lived, “and the days of his years would be numerous” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); he lived seven hundred and thirty-six years longer than his father, “but his soul will not be sated from the goodness” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); as his soul would not be sated with his money, as it is stated: “Restless and wandering you shall be on the earth” (Genesis 4:12). “And moreover, he has no burial” (Ecclesiastes 6:3), as he was in abeyance, gradually weakening until the flood came and swept him away. “I say: A stillborn is better than he” (Ecclesiastes 6:3); this is Abel, his brother, as [Cain] rose up and felled him, [leaving him] dead in the field.  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is Ephron. When Sarah died and Abraham was seeking a place to bury her, he said to them [the Hittites]: “Heed me, and intercede for me with Ephron, son of Tzohar” (Genesis 23:8). Immediately, they went and appointed [Ephron] prefect over them that very day. They said to him: ‘Sell the cave to Abraham.’ He said to them: ‘I will not sell it to him.’ They said to him: ‘If you do not do so we will remove you from your prefecture.’ Immediately, Abraham arose and weighed the silver for him. Rabbi Ḥama said: Every shekel stated in the Torah is a sela, (When the Torah mentions a shekel it refers to the coin known in the Mishna as a sela.)  in the Prophets is a litra, (Twenty-five sela.)  and in the Writings is a centenarium. (One hundred litra.)  Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi said: Except for the shekels of Ephron, which were centenaria. What did Ephron say to Abraham? If you give me four hundred shekel, from the merchandise of your house you will give it to me. (This sum is insignificant to a man as wealthy as you (Matnot Kehuna).)  Because he was greedy regarding Abraham’s money, the verse subtracted a vav from him. (In the verse that states that Abraham paid the money to Ephron, Ephron’s name is spelled without a vav (Genesis 23:16). This symbolizes the fact that Ephron would experience financial setbacks. )  That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” The verse subtracted a vav from the person who was greedy. Moreover, the cave was not called by his name, but rather, by the name of the children of Ḥet, as it is stated: “That Abraham purchased from the children of Ḥet” (Genesis 25:10); it does not say from Ephron, but from the children of Ḥet.  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is Esau. When Isaac died, Jacob and Esau came and divided everything. Jacob said: ‘Shall this wicked be destined to enter, he and his children, the Cave of Makhpela, and he will have a portion and residence with the righteous buried in it?’ Immediately, he took all the money in his possession and made it into a pile and said to Esau: ‘My brother, do you want the portion you have in this cave, or this silver and gold?’ At that moment, Esau said: ‘This kind of burial place is found everywhere. For one grave that I have in the cave, will I lose all this money?’ Immediately, he rose and took all the money and gave him his portion. That is what Jacob says to Joseph: “In my grave that I excavated [kariti] for me” (Genesis 50:5). “I purchased,” is not written, but rather kariti. He said to them: ‘I gave Esau a pile [keri] of dinars.’ That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” What is the lack? It is that he did not enter the Cave of Makhpela.  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” this is the borrower who was too miserly to rent two cows, and he borrows one and rents one. Because he rented only one, if it [the borrowed cow] dies or is injured, he pays. If he rented and it dies, the Torah says: “If he is a renter, it goes for his rent” (Exodus 22:14). (The owner does not receive payment beyond the rent.)  That is, “a greedy man rushes after wealth,” as he was too miserly to rent [both cows], the result is “and does not know that lack will come upon him.” That is what is written: “[If a man borrows from his neighbor and it is injured or dies,] its owner is not with it, he shall pay” (Exodus 22:13).  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” Rabbi Levi said: This is one who does not separate his tithes properly. There was an incident involving one who would separate his tithes properly, and he had one field that would produce one thousand measures, and he would separate from it one hundred measures as tithe. From the remainder, he and the members of his household supported themselves. At the time of his death, he called his son and said: ‘My son, pay attention to this field, such and such measures it produces, such and such measures for tithe, and from it I supported myself all my days.’ When he passed from the world, the first year, the son sowed it, and it produced one thousand measures and he separated from it one hundred as tithe. The second year, miserliness overcame him and he deducted ten, (He separated only ninety measures as tithe.)  and it deducted one hundred; (The next year, the field produced only nine hundred measures.)  likewise the third, likewise, the fourth, likewise, the fifth, until it reached the total of its tithes. (Each year, he deducted ten measures from the tithe and the field produced one hundred measures fewer, until ultimately, the field produced only one hundred measures.)  When his relatives saw that it was so, they rose, donned white garments and wrapped themselves in white outer garments and came to him. He said to them: ‘Have you come to rejoice over my [troubles]?’ They said: ‘Heaven forbid, we came only to rejoice with you.’ In the past, you were the landowner and the Holy One blessed be He was the priest. Now, you have become the priest and the Holy One blessed be He has become the landowner. That is, “and does not know that lack will come upon him.”  Another matter, “rushes after wealth,” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is one who would lend with interest, because he was too miserly to lend to Israelites without interest. “And does not know that lack will come upon him,” as it is written: “He who increases his wealth through usury and interest amasses it for one who cares for the poor” (Proverbs 28:8). Who is “one who cares for the poor”? This is Esau. Is Esau one who cares for the poor? Is he not one who exploits the poor? Rather, he was like generals, commanders, and governors who invade cities, rob, and plunder, and when they return they say: ‘Bring us the poor and we will support them.’ The folk proverb says: She prostitutes herself for apples and distributes them to the ill.  Another matter, what is: “Amasses it for one who cares for the poor”? Everything that the Babylonian kingdom gathers in this world, the Holy One blessed be He gives it to Israel in the future, as it is stated: “Its merchandise and its fee will be sacred to the Lord” (Isaiah 23:18).  Another matter, “if you lend money to My people,” the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you lend money and do not take interest from him, you are My people. Just as I will never stumble, so, too, you will never stumble,’ as it is stated: “He does not lend with usury” (Psalms 15:5) and it is written: “One who performs these will never stumble” (Psalms 15:5).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>At the creation, we find no evidence that birthright was part of the rules guiding the affairs of man. Proof lies in the random order the names of Noach's sons are referred to on different occasions. This was changed when Abraham appeared on the stage of history. His descendants were to play a leading role due to their being descendants of Abraham. In effect G-d had said, &quot;Until now I have bestowed blessings, henceforth I grant Abraham the authority to bestow and direct blessings&quot; (Genesis 12,3). Abraham debated with himself if he were to bestow this power to bless on others. Since he was not certain that he might help weeds to sprout (promote the power of wicked people), if he took it upon himself to transfer this power to bless, he decided to leave well enough alone (Bereshit Rabbah 61). He waited for G-d to make His will known in the matter. G-d did bless his son Isaac (gave him the power to bestow blessings). Since Abraham had two first born sons, he would have had to bestow the blessing (power to bless) on both of them. He was afraid to err; on the other hand, the trait of &quot;chessed,&quot; kindness, for which he was famed would not allow him to deprive Ishmael of a share in favor of Isaac. This in spite of the fact that he knew that his descendants would be known primarily through Isaac. Therefore, considering himself as the manager of the Almighty's orchard, he decided to leave this decision to the owner of the orchard. After Abraham's death, the owner chose Isaac, and thus we come to point two in our parable. When twins were born to Isaac, the older of whom exhibited signs of unfitness, problem three in our parable, this had to be dealt with. Isaac, true to his characteristic of pachad, din, i.e. justice, which our sages have credited him with, did not dare deviate from the principle of transferring power in accordance with birthright. When Jacob says some time later that &quot;the One whom Isaac feared was on my side&quot; (Genesis 31,42), this grants us an insight into the matter. An examination of all the instances in which a direct relationship or communication between G-d and Isaac is described reveals that the term used for &quot;G-d&quot; is invariably elokim, i.e. the attribute of justice. The only exception is the instance when G-d tells Abraham that Isaac is not to be slaughtered after all. This latter instance which taught Abraham that rachamim, mercy is one of G-d’s attributes, is the only time when this factor emerges as playing a role in the relationship between G-d and Isaac. It is understandable then that Isaac of all people would not deviate from the pattern of nobility of birth decreed from above. Isaac's own position as Abraham's heir was due to this very system. Add to this that Isaac personally had not observed any misconduct in Esau, and it becomes clear why he chose Esau to bestow the blessing on. Jacob himself had been very careful never to tell his father of the sale of the birthright, since he had kept hoping that he would secure his father's blessing by virtue of his superior moral conduct, plus the influence of his mother. He did not want to benefit by exposing his brother's unworthiness. This trait of Jacob was very laudable. Leviticus 25,36 tells us, &quot;Your brother shall live alongside you.&quot; Our sages explain that this wording teaches that one's own life takes precedence over that of one's fellow man in a situation where only one of the two lives can be saved. If the object of one's quest for Divine help is personality growth rather than the acquisition of worldly goods, then competing for the attainment of that goal is permissible. Aristotle also states in his Ethics that self-love, when its objective is perfection of self, is virtuous. Our sages, when describing jealousy as a negative trait, do approve of jealousy when it involves envying scholars who know more (Baba Batra 25). The same idea is reflected in Bereshit Rabbah 71 in connection with Rachel's jealousy of her sister Leah (Genesis 30,1). She envied Leah her good deeds. This is why our sages can consider that kind of jealousy a positive quality. On the other hand, &quot;good&quot; character traits employed for a base purpose are viewed as a negative quality (compare Chapter 27 on Dinah). Our problem is to determine whether jealousy under the circumstances described is permitted even when the attainment of one's own purpose involves something detrimental to one's competitor. Consider the definition by our sages of the commandment &quot;Love your fellow man like yourself.&quot; The Talmud Shabbat 31 explains this to mean &quot; do not do to others that which is hateful to yourself.&quot; Aristotle defines it in a similar vein. In other words, we should want for our fellow man what we want for ourselves. We certainly do not need to want for our fellow man what he wants for himself. This is especially so, when our fellow man is wicked or a criminal. In Psalms 139,21, David expresses it in these words: &quot;Must I not hate those who hate You O Lord, and quarrel with those who rise up against You?&quot; Clearly the word &quot;fellow man&quot; referred to in the Torah means someone sharing the same objectives in life that we ourselves believe in. Since Jacob's motivations corresponded to the ones stipulated by our sages, the verse we quoted from Psalms may be applied to him. Having established this point, we return to item four in our parable. The problem is how to restore the position of leadership to those qualified for it. It does not suffice to deny G-d’s special blessings to the undeserving, rather action is needed to channel those blessings to those who deserve them. When Jacob blessed his grandsons prior to his death, he reversed his hands to ensure that Ephrayim would be the recipient of the greater blessing. Er, the firstborn son of Yehudah, is described as unfit, unworthy. Peretz and Zerach respectively, are not treated according to what the order of their birth would call for. Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, is not accorded the privileges his birthright calls for. David was not Yishai's firstborn, neither was Solomon the senior of the surviving sons of David when he was assured that he would be his father's successor. To prove that birthright as an automatic claim to the succession was not practiced at the time of the Exodus, see Numbers 3,3. G-d says, &quot;The day I smote all the firstborn of Egypt, I established an exclusive claim on all the firstborn of Israel.&quot; Obviously, if succession by birthright had been the norm at that time, there would have been no need for G-d to underline that only from that day on would G-d claim the firstborn of Israel as especially beholden to Him. We see then that the practice of succession by birthright had been discontinued at some time, only to be re-introduced at the time of the Exodus. Later, after the episode of the golden calf, when this method of succession had again been found unreliable, the privileges of that group were transferred to the tribe of Levi which had proved its worthiness. This then is the fifth rule that we learned from our parable. Now we understand what the Midrash quoted at the beginning of our chapter had in mind. Since Jacob may well have been aware that the privileges of the firstborn would be abolished once the tabernacle was to be erected, why did he risk his life merely in order to hasten that event? The question is even more justified when we consider that Jacob derived no practical advantage from all his machinations. There is no mention of Jacob ever having offered sacrifices in his capacity as firstborn, and if he had done so, the fact would no doubt have come to the attention of his father. His father could not then have been surprised when he heard from Esau some forty-eight years later, that the latter had traded away his birthright. The Midrash wishes us to know that if Jacob's actions had been motivated by materialistic considerations, this would have been most dishonorable; since he was guided by the desire to secure for himself a higher spiritual level, however, such purpose was laudable. Jacob was aware that the heter bamot, permission to erect altars for G-d wherever one wanted, in order to draw down G-d’s blessing, could lead to grievous abuse if the excercise of the priestly functions was left in the hands of the unworthy. Such abuse would lead to G-d’s blessings being channelled to those who were undeserving, something that could not be pleasing in the eyes of G-d. Therefore, he hastened to restore the source of blessing to those who were fit for it for as long as the condition &quot;wherever I allow My name to be mentioned, I will come and grant My blessing,&quot; existed (Exodus 20,24). He realized that at a later stage a central site for the residence of the shechinah, Divine Presence, would be established, and that then the function of priesthood would be performed only in that central place (tabernacle or temple) and only by priests who had to meet exacting criteria of physical and moral fitness. </p>

              <p>(1) &quot;It happened when Isaac had become old, and his eyesight weakened from seeing,&quot; describes a process not only related to physical eyesight. Achievement of a person's maximal spiritual power is closely related to his physical state, and the proper functioning of all his senses. Of all senses, eyesight is so important that the Bible frequently equates the ability to know and comprehend with the ability to see (I saw them in my heart,” Kohelet 2; &quot;Man cannot see Me, &quot; Exodus 33; “I saw the Lord,&quot; Isaiah 6). In a lesser degree we find this applied to the sense of hearing, i.e. &quot;Hear O Israel&quot; (Deut 6). In a still lesser degree the sense of smell serves as a medium for comprehension and perceptions of the mind. &quot;From afar he can smell war.&quot; (Job 39,25) &quot;He lets him smell the fear of the Lord.&quot; (Isaiah 11) The foregoing leads our sages to state in Sanhedrin 93 that there is substance to smell (though it is not tangible). The sense of taste is ranked still lower among the list of our senses (see commentary on the tree of knowledge in Chapters Seven and Nine), but even it can confer on people perceptions of the true state of affairs. At the lowest rung of the ladder of our senses, re their usefulness as a means of perception, is the sense of touch. The knowledge conveyed by it, is the most unreliable of all our five senses. For that reason, we find that he who relies on it is considered a fool, &quot;You will be groping in the dark at noon as the blind gropes in the dark&quot; (Deut 28,29). Even Aristotle points out that reliance on one's senses cannot be considered sinful except reliance on one's sense of touch. When man's sense of sight functions at optimal efficiency, it hardly ever deceives him, even while his other senses do not function at their respective best. G-d presumably withdrew good eyesight from Isaac at this time to enable him to make the error necessary to prevent Esau from receiving this blessing. The story illustrates the length to which Isaac went to compensate for his failing eyesight by employing all his other senses. Jacob, on the other hand, made every effort to neutralize the powers of perception of these senses of Isaac. Despite Isaac's failing eyesight, he was not altogether blind to Esau's behavior and his unworthiness of the blessing that he as the elder brother should be the recipient of. Therefore, Isaac instructed Esau to perform a mitzvah as a result of which he would qualify for the blessings Isaac had in mind. The reason Isaac lists several activities related to hunting, is to make the performance of each activity the fulfilment of a separate mitzvah of &quot;honor your father.&quot; Even the hunted animal itself will be considered like a sacrifice, seeing it had been killed as an act of obedience to a father's command. The reason Isaac added, &quot;so that my soul can bless you,&quot; was to explain that only this would give him the right to bestow his blessing on Esau. (2) The addition of the words &quot;before I die,&quot; was to let Esau know that unlike Isaac himself who had received the blessing of Abraham by G-d after the death of his father, Esau would not receive it unless it was given to him by his father. For that reason, Isaac did not add the words &quot;before G-d&quot; when he offered the blessing. After all, Esau would receive the blessing only by reason of the power to bless which had been bestowed on his father Isaac, not because he had inherent merit entitling him to the blessing. That, too, is the reason he introduced the blessing with the words, &quot;May the Lord grant you.&quot; Isaac knew full well that, so far, he did not have heaven's approval for what he was about to do. When Jacob appeared on the scene, and Isaac smelled him, he could not understand that the odor seemed to be the one associated with people blessed by G-d. (4) The exclamation &quot;Behold the odor of my son&quot; must be understood as an expression of wonderment. This then prompted the &quot;May the Lord grant you&quot; as a prayer which Isaac hoped would lead to a confirmation of his assessment of the situation. Because he had felt uncomfortable about what he was going to do, he had not confided in either Rebecca or Jacob; he was not aware that he had been overheard. The mention of delicacies &quot;which I have loved&quot; is in fact a reference to his son Esau &quot;whom I have loved.&quot; The fact that Rebecca &quot;overheard&quot; as distinct from &quot;heard&quot; must be mentioned. Had Isaac thought that she had &quot;heard&quot; him, he would never have given Jacob the benefit of the doubt, since he would have concluded that Rebecca had conspired with Jacob in the duplicity. The Torah stating that &quot;Esau went into the field to hunt,&quot; is to alert the reader to Esau's total insensitivity to all the considerations which had motivated Isaac. Else, the Torah would have merely written &quot;he did so,&quot; to indicate that Esau had tuned in to his father's wavelength. When Rebecca told Jacob what she had overheard, she was at pains not to let Jacob know that the blessing would be contingent on the one who would bring the food, otherwise Jacob would have considered the whole charade as completely futile. When she added that Isaac had said &quot;I will bless before the Lord,&quot; she implied that the blessing was connected to the recipient's merit. Thus she encouraged Jacob to feel that his lifestyle up to that point gave him an advantage in his efforts to obtain the blessing. (3) Though aware that his voice was different from that of his brother, Jacob thought that he could imitate it sufficiently well to pass his father's inspection. However, he was far from certain that he could escape detection if the touch test would be applied. Isaac's sense of taste was neutralized by the food being prepared in the manner he was known to like. The goatskins neutralized his sense of touch. </p>

              <p>&quot;Abraham returned to his servants, they arose, and walked together to Be'er Sheva...&quot; (Gen. 22:19)  Where did Isaac go? He went to Be'er Lachai Ro'i, as it says &quot;Isaac had just come back from the vicinity of Beer-lahai-roi, for he was settled in the region of the Negeb.&quot; (Gen.24:62)  Isaac went and fled fraught about his father, his mother, and his God.  How did it happen that he was bound, that they saw fit to do it, and why do it to him.  He went to the wilderness, to a place where no man passed or dwelled.  They said, &quot;no man,&quot; but a woman did pass there, and it was Hagar - Be'er Lachai Ro'i (the well of life's shepherd) is Hagar's well.  Isaac stood at the well until he remembered Ishmael who had played with him when he was a baby.  He remembered Hagar who had walked away with a jug of water on her shoulder.  Isaac sat there with Hagar and Ishmael, cried with and shared anger with them for many days.  One day, he stood at the well opening and behold, the living God saw him, the living God heard his voice in the moment, and Isaac was comforted.  He arose, took Hagar, and brought her back to his father, as it says, &quot;Abraham too another wife, and her name was Keturah.&quot; (Genesis 25:1) Keturah is Hagar whose cries rose like the smoke (ketoret) on the altar. He also arose and took Ishmael and returned him to his father, as it says, &quot;His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him&quot; (Gen. 25:9) &quot;He shall reconcile parents with children and children with their parents&quot; (Malachi 3:24). Afterwards, Isaac returned to that welland settled there, as it says &quot;After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi.&quot;(Genesis 25:11)  This is why it is said about him that he re-dug old wells and brought out of them living water.</p>

              <p>Chapter 33 Writings: [1] &quot;Blessed is the man who fears the Lord&quot; (Psalm 112:1). This means that in the end, everything will be heard by God: &quot;Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man&quot; (Ecclesiastes 12:13). How does one ultimately succeed? Nothing is more beloved than one who fears the Almighty, as it is written, &quot;In the end, everything will be heard,&quot; etc. In the custom of the world, one person says to his friend, &quot;I am rich and have plenty of wheat, oil, and wine.&quot; His friends tell him, &quot;You have everything, where will you put it? If you have no storage, you have nothing.&quot; Similarly, one who is rich and wise in knowledge, but does not have fear of sin, has nothing, as it is written, &quot;In the end, everything will be heard,&quot; etc. For this reason, David said, &quot;Blessed is the man who fears the Lord.&quot; This refers to Abraham, as it is written, &quot;Now I know that you fear God&quot; (Genesis 22:12). &quot;He delights greatly in His commandments&quot; (Psalm 112:1). This refers to Abraham, as it is written, &quot;Because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws&quot; (Genesis 26:5). &quot;His descendants will be mighty on earth&quot; (Psalm 112:2). This refers to Isaac, as it is written, &quot;In Isaac shall thy seed be called&quot; (Genesis 21:12). What is written afterwards? &quot;And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great&quot; (Genesis 26:13). &quot;The generation of the upright will be blessed&quot; (Psalm 112:2). And Abraham was old and well-stricken in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things&quot; (Genesis 24:1). Similarly, God blessed Isaac after Abraham's death, as it is written, &quot;And after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). Therefore it is said, &quot;The generation of the upright will be blessed.&quot;</p>

              <p>[3] Another interpretation: [Genesis 28:10-11] &quot;And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took one of the stones of that place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.&quot; The holy meaning of &quot;He will keep the feet of His holy ones&quot; (1 Samuel 2:9) is that the Holy One, blessed be He, will protect the righteous. This refers to Abraham, who pursued the kings. &quot;Who has stirred up one from the east, whom He calls in righteousness to His feet?&quot; (Isaiah 41:2) And the wicked shall be silent in darkness. These are the eighteen kings whom he slew in darkness, as it is said, &quot;And he divided himself against them by night&quot; (Genesis 14:15). Another explanation of &quot;He will keep the feet of His holy ones&quot; is Jacob, when he went out to go to Haran. For the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;Behold, I am with you, and will keep you wherever you go&quot; (Genesis 28:15). &quot;And the wicked shall be silent in darkness&quot; refers to Esau, as it is written, &quot;All darkness is laid up for his treasures&quot; (Job 20:26). &quot;And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Esau for stubble&quot; (Obadiah 1:18). &quot;And the wicked shall be silent in darkness&quot; - when he went out to pursue Jacob in the tenth hour, and the Holy One, blessed be He, brought in the sun and made the day ten hours long, as it is said, &quot;And he lighted upon the place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set&quot; (Genesis 28:11), and Esau was standing in darkness and silence, not knowing where to go. Therefore, it is said, &quot;For by strength shall no man prevail&quot; (1 Samuel 2:9). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;Perhaps you are strong?&quot; Even in the future, He will do the same for Israel, as it is said, &quot;But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble&quot; (Proverbs 4:18-19). If you wonder about this matter, behold, it has already occurred in this world, as it is said, &quot;No man saw his brother&quot; (Exodus 10:23). &quot;May the footsteps of His pious ones be guarded.&quot; When Jacob left his father's house, he only took his staff in his hand, as it is stated: &quot;For with my staff, I crossed this Jordan&quot; (Genesis 32:11). The Holy One Blessed be He said to Isaac, &quot;Just as your father Abraham did, so do for yourself. He did not give you all that he had, as it is stated: &quot;And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac&quot; (Genesis 25:5). And similarly, &quot;And Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled over all that he had&quot; (Genesis 24:2). What is the meaning of &quot;who ruled&quot;? Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak said that he had control over all that Abraham had, and he even said to him, &quot;Even if you lose what I have, take a wife for my son from there.&quot; Immediately, the servant took ten camels and all the good things of his master were in his hand (Genesis 24:10). This demonstrates that the halacha was in his hand (as it is stated: &quot;And Abraham gave all that he had,&quot; Genesis 25:5), and furthermore, the servant began to distribute gifts. To this (i.e. Abraham's actions) we attribute the blessings, and to this (i.e. Isaac's actions) we attribute the rings. And Solomon cried out: &quot;There is one who scatters and yet increases more&quot; (Proverbs 11:24). May the Holy One Blessed be He be praised, as it is stated: &quot;And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). Look at all that Abraham did for Isaac, but Isaac did not do the same for Jacob. Instead, he sent him away empty-handed. The Holy One Blessed be He said to him, &quot;You have withheld from this poor man, from your own lack.&quot; As it is stated: &quot;And yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest; then your poverty will come as a robber, and your want like an armed man&quot; (Proverbs 6:10-11). If Jacob had nothing, the Divine Presence would have departed from him. And he could not speak with him except at the time of his death. Come and see what Esau did to Jacob; he saw him empty-handed and did not have mercy on him. Instead, he said, &quot;Let me go first, and if I cannot pass, then I will kill him.&quot; As it is stated: &quot;Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions...because he pursued his brother with the sword&quot; (Amos 1:11). Jacob turned his eyes to the Holy One Blessed be He and performed miracles for him. He placed his staff in the water, and the Jordan River split apart, as it is stated: &quot;With my staff, I crossed this Jordan&quot; (Genesis 32:11). Esau waited on the way, but Jacob did not pass by there. He felt that he had crossed the Jordan. What did Esau do? He pursued him and came ahead to the place of Makhpelah. Jacob said, &quot;I have neither bread nor anything else with me. I will go in and warm my body in this bath.&quot; Esau surrounded the bath so that Jacob could not leave. Jacob pretended to be dead so that he would not have to leave. Then the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;You are joined against a wicked man. I said, 'Here I am with you, etc.' &quot; Jacob said to him at that time, &quot;You have done this for your name's sake; I am sure of it.&quot; And Jacob went out and encountered the place, and there was no encounter except prayer, as it is said, &quot;Do not pray and do not encounter me&quot; (Jeremiah 7:16). David said, &quot;Behold, He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. The Lord will keep your going out and your coming in&quot; (Psalms 121:4-8).</p>

              <p>[3] Another interpretation: &quot;Listen to me, Jacob.&quot; Those who are killed and called by his name, as it is said &quot;For thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter&quot; (Psalms 44:23). And Job says, &quot;Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him&quot; (Job 13:15). Those who call upon me every year, as it is said, &quot;I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord&quot; (Psalms 116:13), &quot;I find trouble and sorrow&quot; (Psalms 116:3). These generations said to him, &quot;Lord of the Universe, the earlier generations had the patriarchs as their fathers, and they have the merit of their fathers; we are orphans and have no father to stand up for us.&quot; But you wrote and said, &quot;In you the fatherless find mercy&quot; (Hosea 14:4), &quot;You have seen it, for You have taken note of trouble and grief, to requite it with Your own hand&quot; (Psalms 10:14). You gave many commandments in the Torah to look after the orphans: &quot;When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corner of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am the Lord your God&quot; (Leviticus 23:22). &quot;When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow&quot; (Deuteronomy 24:20). And we are orphans, have mercy upon us, as it is written, &quot;In you the fatherless find mercy&quot; (Hosea 14:4). Obadiah was blessed in his household when his sons became orphans. When was Isaac blessed? After Abraham's death, as it is said, &quot;And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac&quot; (Genesis 25:11). The tribes said, &quot;And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation&quot; (Exodus 1:6). And &quot;the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly&quot; (Exodus 1:7). &quot;Your eyes are on the orphans, who will have compassion on you? God said to them, &quot;Repent and I will heal your backslidings.&quot; He said, &quot;Until they repent, I have stopped healing them.&quot; As it is said, &quot;Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings&quot; (Jeremiah 3:22). And it is also written, &quot;I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely&quot; (Hosea 14:4). Love that never ceases, I love you. Isaac called Esau his firstborn, and I call Jacob my firstborn (Exodus 4:22). The birthright of Isaac was voided and fulfilled in Jacob. Isaac loved Esau, as it is said, &quot;And Isaac loved Esau&quot; (Genesis 25:28), and I love Jacob. His love for Esau was voided and fulfilled in his love for Jacob. How much difficulty have they caused to try to instill hatred between us, and they cannot nullify it, as it is said, &quot;Many waters cannot quench love&quot; (Song of Songs 8:7). These nations are compared to water, as it is said, &quot;Woe to the multitude of many people who make a noise like the noise of the sea&quot; (Isaiah 17:12) Moreover, how many times were the Israelites killed for the sake of returning them to God, and the Assembly of Israel says to them &quot;I cannot remain silent about Him. My soul became aroused in His presence.&quot; (Song of Songs 5:6) &quot;My soul went forth [when he spoke].&quot; (ibid. 5:16) &quot;When He spoke on Sinai, my soul heard [His voice].&quot; (ibid. 6:2) &quot;But my heart is sick with love for Him.&quot; (ibid. 5:8) They said to her, &quot;What is your beloved more than another beloved?&quot; (ibid. 5:9) She said to them, &quot;I will extol His praises and relate His greatness to you. And you will know that I do not pursue Him in vain.&quot; (ibid. 5:16) &quot;My beloved is pure and ruddy.&quot; (ibid. 5:10) &quot;Pure for Israel, ruddy for Esau.&quot; (Rashi on Song of Songs 5:10) &quot;Why are your clothes red?&quot; (Isaiah 63:2) &quot;Dignified from among the myriads&quot; (Song of Songs 5:10), for there are none among the exalted multitudes like Him. &quot;His head is as fine gold&quot; (ibid. 5:11), which is the Torah, as it is written &quot;More desirable than gold, than much fine gold&quot; (Psalms 19:11). &quot;His locks are bushy, and black as a raven&quot; (Song of Songs 5:11), this is the script. Alternatively, &quot;black&quot; refers to the Assembly of Israel, as it is written &quot;I am black&quot; (Song of Songs 1:5), &quot;His eyes are like doves&quot; (Song of Songs 5:12), this is the sun and moon. &quot;His hands are like rods of gold&quot; (ibid.), this is the rainbow. &quot;His body is like polished ivory, inlaid with sapphires&quot; (ibid. 5:14), this is the air. &quot;His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold&quot; (ibid.), these are the mountains, founded on the adonai of fine gold, these are the foundations of the Temple. &quot;His appearance is like Lebanon&quot; (ibid. 5:15), this is the Temple. &quot;Choice as the cedars&quot; (ibid.), which refers to walking with the righteous, as it is written &quot;And I will walk among you&quot; (Leviticus 26:12). &quot;Awaiting the delight [of his beloved],&quot; this refers to the time of the giving of the Torah, and &quot;altogether desirable,&quot; when He receives the penitent. The nations of the world said to them, &quot;Since He receives penitents, where is your beautiful Beloved?&quot; (Song of Songs 5:17) Said the Holy One, blessed be He, &quot;The nations hate Me because of My children, and My children love Me despite all these nations. I give them one hundred worlds filled with the love that I have for My children, as it is said, 'If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love, they would utterly despise him' (Song of Songs 8:7).&quot; This is from the Midrash Aggadah on Genesis. </p>

              <p>“My beloved is like a gazelle or a fawn [ofer ha’ayalim]…” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, in truth you came to us first. “My beloved is like a gazelle” – just as the gazelle leaps, so the Holy One blessed be He leapt and bounded from Egypt to the sea and from the sea to Sinai. In Egypt, “I will pass in the land of Egypt…” (Exodus 12:12). At the sea, “this is my God and I will exalt Him” (Exodus 15:2). At Sinai, “He said: The Lord came from Sinai” (Deuteronomy 33:2). “Or a fawn” – Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: To the fawn of deer. (Rabbi Yosei teaches that &quot;ofer ha'ayalim&quot; means a fawn, and not a certain type of deer.)   “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9) – this is the wilderness of Sinai. “Watching from the windows” (Song of Songs 2:9) – “the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai…” (Exodus 19:20). “Peering through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9) – “God spoke all these matters…” (Exodus 20:1). “My beloved spoke up and said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10) – “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2).   Another matter: “My beloved is like a gazelle” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, You told us that You will come to us first. “My beloved is like a gazelle” – just as the gazelle appears and is then concealed, so, the initial redeemer appeared and was then concealed. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Like the initial redeemer, so will be the ultimate redeemer. The initial redeemer, this is Moses; he appeared to them and was then concealed from them. How long was he concealed from them? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Three months; that is what is written: “They encountered Moses and Aaron…” (Exodus 5:20). (“Encountered” indicates that there had been an interruption in the contact between them.)  The ultimate redeemer, too, will appear to them and will then be concealed from them. How long will he be concealed from them? Rabbi Tanḥuma said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Hoshaya: Forty-five days. That is what is written: “From the time of the abolishing of the daily offering and the setting up of the abomination of desolation there will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days” (Daniel 12:11), and it is written: “Happy is one who waits, and reaches one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days” (Daniel 12:12). How many are these extra days? They are the forty-five days that he will be concealed from them and will then reappear to them.   Where will he take them? (Where will they be during those forty-five days?)  Some say to the Judean desert, and some say to the wilderness of Siḥon and Og. Anyone who believes him and follows him will eat roots of the broom tree and saltwort leaves; that is what is written: “Who pick saltwort from bushes, and the root of the broom tree is their food” (Job 30:4). Anyone who does not follow him will go and make peace with the nations of the world, and they will ultimately kill him. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: At the conclusion of forty-five days, the Holy One blessed be He will cause manna to fall for them. That is what is written: “I will yet settle you in tents as in the appointed [moed] days” (Hosea 12:10), and it says: “The appointed time [moed] of your exodus from Egypt” (Deuteronomy 16:6). “Or a fawn” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: To the fawn of deer.  “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9) – this is the western wall of the Temple, which is never destroyed. Why? It is because the Divine Presence is in the west. “Watching from the windows” (Song of Songs 2:9) – due to the merit of the patriarchs; “peering through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9) – due to the merit of the matriarchs. Just as there is a distinction between a window and a crack, so there is a distinction between the merit of the patriarchs and the merit of the matriarchs. “My beloved spoke up and said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10) – what did He say? “As I live, the utterance of the Lord, that you will don all of them like jewelry, and you will tie them like a bride” (Isaiah 49:18).  Another matter: “My beloved is like a gazelle” (Song of Songs 2:9) – just as this gazelle leaps from place to place, from fence to fence, from tree to tree, and from booth to booth, so, the Holy One blessed be He leaps and bounds from this synagogue to that synagogue. Why to that extent? It is order to bless Israel, as it is stated: “In every place I mention My name, [I will come to you and I will bless you]” (Exodus 20:21). By what merit? It is by the merit of Abraham our patriarch, as it is written: “So [ko] you shall bless,” just as it says: “So [ko] shall be your offspring” (Genesis 15:5). “Or a fawn” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: To the fawn of deer.  “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9) – when the Holy One blessed be He came to visit Abraham our patriarch on the third day since his circumcision, just as it says: “The Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, and he was sitting [yoshev]…” (Genesis 18:1). Yashav is written. (Yoshev is written without a vav, so it looks like yashav.)  He sought to stand; the Holy One blessed be He said to him: Sit, Abraham, you are a paradigm for your descendants, as when your descendants enter synagogues and study halls and recite Shema, they sit and My glory stands. What is the source? “God stands [nitzav] in the assembly of the Almighty” (Psalms 82:1) – Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: It is not written here, “God omed,” (The word “stands” would usually be rendered as omed.)  but rather, “God nitzav,” at the ready. This is just as it says: “It will be before they call, I will answer” (Isaiah 65:24). That is why it is stated: “Behold, he is standing behind our wall”; these are the synagogues and study halls.  “Watching from the windows” (Song of Songs 2:9) – when the Holy One blessed be He said to Aaron and his sons: “So you shall bless…,” Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, to the priests You said that they should bless us. We need only Your blessings and to be blessed from Your mouth.’ That is what is written: “Look from Your holy abode, from Heaven, and bless Your people Israel” (Deuteronomy 26:15). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Although I said to the priests that they should bless you, with them I stand and bless you.’ That is why the priests spread their hands, saying: The Holy One blessed be He is standing behind us. That is why it says: “Watching from the windows” – from between the priests’ shoulders; “peering through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9) – from between the priests’ fingers. “My beloved spoke up and said to me” – “and I will bless them” (Numbers 6:27).  “So you shall bless” – that is what is written: “I will render you a great nation…” (Genesis 12:2). Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair said: The Holy One blessed be He blessed Abraham with seven blessings, and these are they: “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2); “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2); “I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:2); “you will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2). I will bless those who bless you” (Genesis 12:3); “one who curses you, I will curse” (Genesis 12:3), “[all the families of the earth] will be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3). These correspond to the seven verses in the act of Creation in which “that it was good” is written. (Seven including Genesis 1:31: “And it was very good.”)   Rabbi Levi bar Ḥayata and Rabbi Abba son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: There are three expressions of greatness and four blessings written here. He apprised him that there would be three patriarchs and four matriarchs. But is it not that there are only two expressions of greatness? “I will render you [ve’e’eskha]” is an expression of greatness (Thus, there are, in fact, three expressions of greatness.) , as it is written: “It is the Lord who appointed [asa] Moses [and Aaron]” (I Samuel 12:6).  Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – this is that we recite: God of Abraham. “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2) – this is that we recite: God of Isaac. “I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:2) – this is that we recite: God of Jacob. Do we, perhaps, conclude with all of them? The verse states: “You will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2) – it is with you they conclude: The Shield of Abraham, and we do not conclude with all of them. (This midrash is referring to the first blessing of the Amida prayer.)  Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ze’eira said: “You will be a blessing” – your blessing precedes Mine, as after they recite Shield of Abraham, only then do they recite: Who revives the dead.   Another matter: “You will be a blessing [berakha]” (Genesis 12:2) – you will be a pool [berekha]. Just as this pool purifies the impure, you, too, draw the distant under the wings of the Divine Presence. “I will render you [ve’e’eskha] a great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – Rabbi Berekhya said: It is not written here, Etenkha, (See Genesis 17:20: “I will make him [untativ] a great nation.” asimekha) , (See Genesis 46:3: “I will make you [asimekha] a great nation there.”)  but rather ve’e’eskha. (This connotes creation of a new entity.)  After I create you as a new creation, just as it says: “God made [vayaas] the firmament” (Genesis 1:7), then you will be fruitful and multiply.  “A great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – Abraham said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, from Noah, did You not produce seventy nations?’ He said to him: ‘That nation in whose regard it is written: “For who is a great nation” (Deuteronomy 4:7), I am producing from you.’ Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen bar Ḥama said: When did the Holy One blessed be He render Abraham a great nation? It was when they departed from Egypt, came to Sinai, received the Torah, and arrived in the Land of Israel. Moses looked at them and said: They have been rendered just as the Holy One blessed be He promised to the elder, as it is stated: “And who is a great nation” (Deuteronomy 4:8). Alternatively, “a great nation” – as I will give your descendants the Torah, and from it they will be called a great nation, as it is stated: “It is a particularly wise and understanding people, this great nation” (Deuteronomy 4:6).   “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2) – Rabbi Berekhya said: Because travel causes a person three phenomena: It lessens procreation, it lessens his expenditure, (It reduces his disposable income.)  and it lessens his reputation; that is why it was stated to him: “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – travel will not lessen your procreation; “I will bless you” – travel will not lessen your expenditure; “I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:2) – it will not lessen your reputation.  People say in a parable: From house to house, a cloak; from place to place, a soul. However, you will lose neither a soul nor property.  “You will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2) – it is already written: “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2); why does the verse state: “You will be a blessing”? Rabbi Eliezer said: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘From when I created My world until now, I needed to bless My creations,’ as it is stated: “God blessed them…” (Genesis 1:28), and it says: “God blessed Noah and his sons” (Genesis 9:1). ‘But from here on, the blessings are granted to you; to one whom you see fit to bless, bless.’ Nevertheless, Abraham did not bless his sons. Why is it so? It is analogous to a king who had an orchard and he entrusted it to a sharecropper. In that orchard there was one tree that was an elixir of life and one tree a deadly poison. The sharecropper said: I will cultivate and complete [my work], and the king will do with his orchard what he chooses. So, the king, this is the Holy One blessed be He. The orchard, this is the world. He granted it to Abraham, as He said to him: “You will be a blessing.” What did Abraham do? He had two sons, one righteous and one wicked: Isaac and Ishmael. Abraham said: If I bless Isaac, Ishmael will request to be blessed, and he is wicked. Rather, I am a servant; I am flesh and blood. Tomorrow, I will pass from the world, and what the Holy One blessed be He wishes to do in His world, He will do. When Abraham passed away, the Holy One blessed be He appeared to Isaac and blessed him, as it is stated: “It was after the death of Abraham, [God blessed Isaac his son]” (Genesis 25:11). Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve tribes, as it is stated: “All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve, and this is that which their father spoke to them, and he blessed them” (Genesis 49:28). From here on, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The blessings are granted to you. The priests will bless My children, just as I said to Abraham their patriarch: “You will be a blessing.”’ That is why it is stated: “So you shall bless…”</p>

              <p>“Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac” (Genesis 25:5).   “Abraham gave all that was his to Isaac” – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis, Rabbi Yehuda said: [He gave him] the rights of a firstborn son. (Even though Yishmael was older than him.)  Rabbi Neḥemya said: The power to bless. (See Bereshit Rabba 39:11.)  The Rabbis said: The right to burial [in the Makhpela Cave], and a will. (In which he bequeathed all his property to Isaac.)    Rabbi Ḥama said: It was not blessings that he [Abraham] bequeathed to him, but gifts. This is analogous to a king who had an orchard, which he gave over to a sharecropper. In it, there were two trees intertwined into a single twining; one produced life-giving [fruits] and the other produced poisonous [fruits]. That sharecropper said: ‘If I water the one that is life-giving, the one that is poisonous will be watered along with it, but if I refrain from watering the poisonous one, how will the one that is life-giving survive?’ He then said: ‘I am a mere [temporary] sharecropper. I have performed my duties as sharecropper, and whatever the owner of the orchard wishes to do, he will do.’ So, Abraham said: ‘If I bless Isaac, my son Ishmael and Ketura’s sons will want to be included. If I do not bless Ishmael’s sons and Ketura’s sons, how can I bless Isaac?’ He then said: ‘I am flesh and blood, here today, in the grave tomorrow. I have already done my part; from here on, what the Holy One blessed be He wishes to do in His world, let Him do.’ When Abraham died, the Holy One blessed be He revealed himself to Isaac and blessed him. That is what is written: “It was after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son…” (Genesis 25:11).</p>

              <p>“It was after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son, and Isaac lived beside Be’er Laḥai Ro’i (Genesis 25:11).  “It was after the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son” – Rabbi Simon said: Everywhere that it is stated “it was after [the death],” the world regressed. “It was after the death of Abraham” – immediately, “All the cisterns…the Philistines sealed them after Abraham’s death” (Genesis 26:15, 18). “It was after the death of Moses, servant of the Lord” (Joshua 1:1) – immediately, the well, the clouds of glory, and the manna ceased. “It was after Joshua’s death” (Judges 1:1) – immediately, the pegs of the Land waged war against them. (The reference is to the Canaanite nations. They are called “pegs,” as in Numbers 33:55: &quot;Those whom you leave over will be like pegs in your eyes and thorns in your side.”)  “It was after Saul’s death” (II Samuel 1:1) – “the Philistines were waging war against Israel” (I Samuel 31:1). The students raised an objection to Rabbi Simon: ‘But is it not written: “After the death of Yehoyada, the princes of Judah came and prostrated themselves to the king”?’ (II Chronicles 24:17). (There does not appear to be any regression there.)  Rabbi Tanḥuma said: ‘Rabbi Simon came to say [his rule] only concerning [the phrase] “it was after [the death].”’ (Whereas in this verse, the words “it was” are missing from the formula.)   Rabbi Yudan said: [The words “it was after the death” of certain people connote that] the world would have regressed had the Holy One blessed be He not established others in their stead, as it is written: “It was after Abraham’s death,” and it is written: “Isaac dug anew” (Genesis 26:18). “It was after the death of Moses, servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua son of Nun, saying” (Joshua 1:1). And it is written: “It was after Joshua’s death…the Lord said: Judah will ascend” (Judges 1:1–2). It is written: “It was after Saul’s death and David had returned from smiting the Amalekites, and David had stayed in Tziklag [two] days” (II Samuel 1:1), (David immediately took Saul’s place as military leader.)  and it is written prior to this matter, [even] prior to Samuel’s death: “David was the son of a nobleman…” (I Samuel 17:12). (This is the opening verse of the passage describing the beginning of David’s career as a warrior, when he slew Goliath.) </p>

              <p>“These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham” (Genesis 25:12).  “These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham” – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva and the Rabbis were sitting and finding difficulty [with this passage]: ‘Why did the verse see fit to describe the lineage of the wicked man [Ishmael] here, [as well as his age at death]?’ [Just then] Rabbi Levi passed by. They said: ‘Here comes the master of halakha, let us ask him.’ Rabbi Levi said: ‘It is in order to tell you at what age your ancestor [Jacob] was blessed.’ (From knowing the age of Ishmael when he died (see the next verse), it can be derived that Jacob was sixty-three years old when he received his father’s blessing. See Megilla 17a.)  “These are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years, and he expired and died and he was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:17).  “These are the years of the life of Ishmael” – why did the verse see fit to recount the years of the wicked one here? It is because he came from the far reaches of the desert to perform kindness for his father [in attending his funeral].  “They dwelled from Ḥavila to Shur, that is adjacent to Egypt, all the way to Assyria: he settled among all his brethren” (Genesis 25:18).  “They dwelled from Ḥavila…” – here it says: “he settled [among all his brethren]” [nafal, literally, fell down], but elsewhere it says [of Ishmael]: “He will dwell [yishkon] [among all his brethren]” (Genesis 16:12). The explanation is that all the days our patriarch Abraham was alive – yishkon. When our patriarch Abraham died – nafal. (He fell in stature.)  Before he extended his hand against the Temple – yishkon; once he extended his hand against it (See Psalms 83:3–19.)  – nafal. In this world – yishkon; but in the future – nafal.</p>

              <p>R. Chama b. Chanina said further: &quot;What is the meaning of the passage (Deut. 13, 5) Before the Lord thy God shall ye walk. How is it possible that a man should walk after the Shechina, behold, it is said (Ib. 4, 24) For the Lord thy God is a devouring fire, a jealous God. We must therefore say that this means walk after the standard habits of the Holy One, praised be He. Just as He clothed the naked; as it is written (Gen. 3, 21) And the Lord God made unto Adam and to his wife coats of skin and clothed them, so also shall you clothe the naked; just as the Holy One, praised be He, visits the sick, as it is written (Ib. 18, 1) And the Lord appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre, so also shalt thou visit the sick. The Holy One, praised be He, buries the dead, as it is written (Deut. 34, 6) And he buried him in the valley, so also shalt thou bury the dead. The Holy One, praised be He, comes to console the mourner, as it is written (Gen. 25, 11) And it came to pass, after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac, his son, so also shall thou comfort the mourners. (Ib. 3, 21) And the Lord God made unto Adam and to his wife coats of skins and clothed them. Rab and Samuel differ in the explanation of the above passage, one explains it that the coats were made of a thing that came from skin [wool] and the other says: &quot;This means a thing which a man's body relishes when worn closely to the skin [linens].&quot; R. Samlai lectured: &quot;The Torah begins with meritorious deeds and ends with meritorious deeds; it begins with meritorious deeds, as it is written (Ib. 3, 21) And the Lord God made unto Adam and to his wife coats of skins and clothed them. And it ends with meritorious deeds, as it is written (Deut. 34, 6) And He buried him in the valley.&quot; </p>

              <p>Rabbi Berekhya said: Performing acts of kindness is in the Torah at its beginning, in its middle, and at its end. It is at its beginning, as it is written: “The Lord God built the rib [that he took from the man, into a woman, and He brought her to the man]” (Genesis 2:22). [This verse] teaches that the Holy One Blessed be He braided Eve’s hair, and brought her to Adam, and he became the groomsman for them; as in the coastal towns, they call braiding, building. It is in its middle, as it is written: “The Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre” (Genesis 18:1), teaching that He visited him. (God visited Abraham, who was recovering from his circumcision.)  “God blessed Isaac his son” (Genesis 25:11), this is the blessing of the mourners. (He came to console Isaac upon the death of Abraham.)  At its end, as it is stated: “He buried him in the valley” (Deuteronomy 34:6). (God buried Moses.)  Rabbi Ḥanin said: What is the measure of recompense [for acts of kindness]? Jacob died in the land of Egypt. For whom was it fitting to tend to him? Is it not the Holy One blessed be He, who said to him: “I will descend with you to Egypt [and I will also take you up]” (Genesis 46:4)? Joseph came and snatched the mitzva for himself, as it is written: “Joseph ascended to bury his father” (Genesis 50:7). Joseph died in Egypt. For whom was it fitting to tend to him? Is it not the tribes, to whom he administered an oath, as it is stated: “Joseph administered an oath [to the sons of Israel, saying: God will surely remember you, and you shall carry up my bones from here]” (Genesis 50:25). Moses came and snatched the mitzva for himself, as it is stated: “Moses took Joseph’s bones” (Exodus 13:19). Moses died, and the Holy One blessed be He, in His glory, repaid him, as it is stated: “He buried him in the valley” (Deuteronomy 34:6).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>[Another interpretation (of Numb. 6:23): THUS SHALL YOU BLESS.] The Holy One said: In the past I needed to bless my creatures. (Above, Gen. 3:5; Tanh., Gen. 3:4; Numb. 2:9, cont.; Numb. R. 11:2; PRK 31 (suppl. 1):11.)  I blessed the first Adam and his wife, as stated (in Gen. 1:28): THEN GOD BLESSED THEM…. I blessed Noah and his children, as stated (in Gen. 9:1): THEN GOD BLESSED NOAH AND HIS CHILDREN. I blessed Abraham, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN EVERYTHING.  the Holy One said: From now on behold, the blessings are being delivered to you. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 12:2): AND YOU ARE TO BE A BLESSING. What did Abraham do? He begot two , Ishmael and Isaac, but he did not bless them. A parable: (Gen. R. 61:6.)  To what is the matter comparable? To a king who had an orchard (Pardes. Cf. the Gk.: paradeisos.)   gave it to a tenant. Now in the midst of that orchard was a one tree with an elixir of life and another tree with the elixir of death grafted upon it. The tenant said: If I water the tree with the elixir of life, the tree with the elixir of death will drink. The tenant said: I shall work and finish my time. Then whatever the king wants to do in his garden he may do. (Cf. Matthew 13:24–30.)  The king is the Holy One, and the garden is the world. The Holy One delivered it to Abraham. He said to him (in Gen. 12:2): AND YOU ARE TO BE A BLESSING. What did Abraham do? He had two children, one righteous and one wicked, Ishmael and Isaac. Abraham said: If I bless Isaac, Ishmael will want me to bless him, and he is wicked. I am only flesh and blood. When I depart from the world, the Holy One will do his will. When Abraham did depart, the Holy One revealed himself to Isaac and blessed him, as stated (in Gen. 25:11): AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC. Then Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve tribes, as stated (in Gen. 49:28): ALL THESE ARE THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, TWELVE IN NUMBER, . From now on, said the Holy One, behold, the blessings are being delivered to you; and the priests will bless my children.</p>

              <p>(Gen. 8:1:) THEN GOD REMEMBERED NOAH. [Let our master instruct us: In the case of one who sees the bow in the clouds, what blessing must he say? (Tanh., Gen. 2:6.)  Thus] have our masters taught: One who sees a bow in the clouds must say a blessing. What blessing does he say? Blessed be the one who remembers the covenant, is trustworthy in his covenant, and has stood by his word. This is from the Mishnah, (Actually the blessing is found, not in the Mishnah, but in the gemara, Ber. 59a.)  but where is it shown from the Torah? The text reads (in Gen. 9:13): I HAVE SET MY BOW IN THE CLOUD, AND IT SHALL BE A SIGN OF A COVENANT &lt; BETWEEN ME AND THE EARTH &gt;. The conduct of the Holy One is not like the conduct of flesh and blood. In what respect? With flesh and blood, as long as one's close friend is alive, love has its place; and if one dies, love ceases. The Holy One, however, is not like that.

              <p>Another interpretation: When the king loves someone, he honors him with silver, gold, and garments so as to make [him wealthy]. Then, while he is traveling by ship, the wind comes and destroys the ship. Where &lt; now &gt; is the king's gift? Here he had honored him and enriched him. Could he possibly have saved him from the sea? Or from robbers? (Gk.: lestai.)  But the Holy One is not like that. Rather, when he gives one a gift, he protects him, as stated (in Numb. 6:24): THE LORD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU. He blessed Abraham and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 24:1): &lt; NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD, ADVANCED IN YEARS &gt;, AND THE LORD HAD BLESSED ABRAHAM IN ALL THINGS. He blessed Isaac and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 25:11): GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC. He blessed Jacob and preserved him, as stated (in Gen. 35:9): NOW GOD APPEARED UNTO JACOB AGAIN [… AND BLESSED HIM].</p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of I Sam. 2:9): HE SHALL PROTECT THE FEET OF HIS SAINTS. When Jacob set out from his father's house, he set out with only his staff, as stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): FOR WITH &lt; ONLY &gt; MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN. The Holy One said to Isaac: Did your father, Abraham, do this to you? Did he not give you everything that he had? It is so stated (in Gen. 25:5): BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC. &lt; There is &gt; also this (in Gen. 24:2): SO ABRAHAM SAID UNTO THE SENIOR SERVANT OF HIS HOUSE, THE ONE WHO RULED OVER ALL THAT HE HAD. R. Samuel bar Isaac said: What is the meaning of THE ONE WHO RULED? When he had made him a ruler over all that he had, he said: Even if you &lt; must &gt; give away everything that belongs to me, take a wife for my son from there. (Gen. 24:10:) THEN THE SERVANT TOOK TEN CAMELS FROM THE CAMELS OF HIS MASTER, AND WENT WITH ALL HIS MASTER'S GOODS IN HIS HAND. This refers to a diatheke (The Greek words means “covenant.”)  {gift certificate} which he carried in his hand. (See Gen. R. 59:11 and some versions of PRE 16. Both use the word diatheke in this context. Cf. Gen. R. 61:6.)  (Ergo, in Gen. 25:5:) BUT ABRAHAM GAVE ALL THAT HE HAD TO ISAAC. The servant began distributing earrings to one woman, necklaces (Lat.: catellae.)  to another, and rings to still another. This is what the text means (in Prov. 11:24): THERE IS ONE WHO DISPENSES LIBERALLY AND STILL INCREASES. The Holy One has blessed him. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 25:11): AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THE DEATH OF ABRAHAM THAT GOD BLESSED HIS SON ISAAC. But Isaac did not do so for Jacob. Instead he had him set out empty-handed. The Holy One said (in Prov. 11:24, cont.): ANOTHER HOLDS BACK FROM WHAT IS RIGHT, YET THE RESULT IS WANT. And what happened to him (Isaac)? The Divine Presence departed from him. So you find him (the Holy One) speaking with him only when he died. Come and see what Esau the Wicked did to Jacob. He saw him empty-handed and did not show him mercy. Instead he said: See, I am ahead of him, and he cannot pass me on the way. So I will kill him there. And where is it shown? Where the prophet said so (in Amos 1:11): &lt; THUS SAYS THE LORD: FOR THREE TRANSGRESSIONS OF EDOM AND FOR FOUR I WILL NOT RESCIND IT (the punishment) &gt; BECAUSE HE PURSUED HIS BROTHER WITH THE SWORD. Jacob knew &lt; about it &gt; and raised his eyes to the Holy One. Now he had performed miracles with him (Jacob); so he put {his staff for him in his hand} [his staff into the Jordan]. Then the Jordan divided for him, and he crossed. Thus it is stated (in Gen. 32:11 [10]): FOR WITH MY STAFF DID I CROSS THIS JORDAN. So Esau was waiting on the way, but Jacob did not pass on the way. When Esau perceived that Jacob had fled and crossed the Jordan, what did he do? He pursued him and found him in a cave, a place like the bath that is in Tiberias. (Cf. Gen. R. 75:5.)  Jacob had said: There is no bread and no food at hand. I shall go in and get warm in the bath. Esau the Wicked came and had the bath surrounded the so that he would die in it. The Holy One said to him: &lt; Since &gt; you are the most wicked man in the world, are you to be paired (The verb is related to the Greek noun zeugos (“yoke of beasts”).)  against him? Immediately the Holy One said to Jacob: What are you afraid of? See, I am with you. Jacob said to him: Sovereign of the World, inasmuch as I am trusting you and you are making me a promise, I will have trust [and set out. (Gen. 28:10:) AND JACOB SET OUT FROM BEERSHEBA].</p>

              <p>God’s way is not man’s way. As long as a man’s friend lives, his friendship for him continues, but after his friend’s death, his concern for him ceases. The Holy One, blessed be He, however, does not act in that manner. When Abraham died, the Holy One, blessed be He, continued to love his son Isaac, as it is said: And it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac, his son (ibid. 25:11). It may happen that a king bestows gifts of silver, gold, and raiment upon his friend, and the friend then sails away. These possessions may be lost when a storm arises, and the king is powerless to protect him from the sea or from pirates. However, when the Holy One, blessed be He, presents a gift to his beloved one He guards it, as it is said: The Lord bless thee and guard thee (Num. 6:24). He blessed Abraham and guarded him, as it is said: And the Lord blessed Abraham in all things (Gen. 24:1). He acted similarly toward Isaac and Jacob.</p>

              <p>Another interpretation of &quot;Happy is the man&quot; (Psalm 1:1): This refers to the righteous men. The prophets are happy because they give form to the image of God, and to the one who plants the tree. This is what the scripture means by &quot;For the Lord God is a sun and shield&quot; (Psalm 84:12). Rabbi Chiya bar Abba said: &quot;Happy are they who are like the sun, which shines forth, and like a shield, which protects.&quot; Another interpretation of &quot;shield&quot;: This refers to the Persian Targum for a curtain that surrounds a person, protecting them from the four winds. And how do we know that it includes the fourth wind? It is written, &quot;You crown us with loving-kindness&quot; (Psalm 5:13). Another interpretation of &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;shield&quot;: This refers to Abraham, our forefather. &quot;Sun&quot; refers to Abraham, as it is written, &quot;Who raised up righteousness from the east&quot;  (Isaiah 41:2) The shield represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;I am your shield&quot; (Genesis 15:1). The God represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;You are a prince of God in our midst&quot; (Genesis 23:6). Grace and glory God gives represent Abraham, as it is written, &quot;And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold&quot; (Genesis 13:2). &quot;He does not withhold good from those who walk with integrity&quot; represents Abraham, as it is said, &quot;Walk before me, and be blameless&quot; (Genesis 17:1). If Scripture speaks of Abraham in this way, then when it says, &quot;He does not withhold good from those who walk with integrity,&quot; what does it mean to walk with integrity? Rather, just as Abraham, who walked with integrity before the Holy One, Blessed be He, had a shield, so too anyone who walks with integrity before Him has a shield. After him, what is written? &quot;Happy is the man who trusts in You&quot; (Psalms 84:13). Abraham is not written here, but rather &quot;man,&quot; meaning all people. David said, &quot;Happy is the man whom You discipline, Lord, and whom You teach from Your law&quot; (Psalms 94:12). Rabbi Yudan opened by saying, &quot;Do not boast before the king, and do not stand in the place of great men&quot; (Proverbs 25:6). Rabbi Yudan read it from the place where this section was closed and from the place where the previous section was opened. Rabbi Pinchas worked an extended passage from Psalms 119:100, &quot;I understand more than the aged.&quot; At first, the Holy One, Blessed be He, blessed His world, as it says, &quot;And God blessed them&quot; (Genesis 1:28). Once Noah stood, He blessed him, as it says, &quot;And God blessed Noah and his sons&quot; (Genesis 9:1). Once Abraham stood, He blessed him, as it says, &quot;And God blessed Abraham in everything&quot; (Genesis 24:1). What is the meaning of &quot;it will be a blessing&quot;? Rav Nachman said that He handed the blessings over to him and said, &quot;Until now, I have been required to bless the world, but from now on, the blessings are in your hands, and whomever you bless will be blessed.&quot; Once Isaac stood, he blessed him, as it says, &quot;And Abraham gave everything he had to Isaac&quot; (Genesis 25:5). What did he give him? Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Nechemia, and the Rabbis (said): Rabbi Yehuda said it was the firstborn. Rabbi Nechemia said it was a blessing. And the Rabbis said it was burial and a deed of inheritance. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Chama: they only gave him gifts. And why didn't they give him a blessing? It is like a king who had a garden and gave it to a tenant, and in it were all kinds of trees intertwined with each other, one of the Tree of Life and one of the Tree of Death. The tenant said, &quot;If I water the Tree of Life, the Tree of Death will live with it. And if I do not water it, how will the Tree of Life live?&quot; The tenant returned and said, &quot;This year I will complete my tenancy and go, and what do I care about the king's garden?&quot; Abraham said, &quot;I will not bless Isaac now because the children of Ishmael and the children of Keturah are now being blessed.&quot; I am flesh and blood today, but tomorrow I will be in the grave, and what needs to be done in his world will be done. When Abraham died, God revealed Himself to Isaac and blessed him, as it says, &quot;After Abraham's death, God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Genesis 25:11). And so He did to Jacob, as it says, &quot;God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Paddan Aram, and He blessed him&quot; (Genesis 35:9). And Isaac stood and blessed Jacob with giving, as it says, &quot;May God give you of the dew of heaven&quot; (Genesis 27:28), and he sealed it with a call, &quot;And Isaac called Jacob, and he blessed him&quot; (Genesis 28:1). Jacob stood to bless the tribes and began with what Isaac had sealed. This is what is written, &quot;And Jacob called to his sons and said&quot; (Genesis 49:1), and he sealed it with this, as it says, &quot;And this is what their father said to them&quot; (Genesis 49:28). Moses stood to bless Israel, and said, &quot;Jacob is the firstborn of the Holy One, blessed be He,&quot; and he began with a call and sealed it with &quot;And this is the blessing&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:1), and he sealed it with &quot;Happy are you&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:29). When David stood, he opened with &quot;God is my Lord,&quot; and sealed it with &quot;Blessed are You, God&quot; (Psalms 118:27).</p>

              <p>Noah handed on the tradition to Shem, and he was initiated in the principle of intercalation; he intercalated the years and he was called a priest, as it is said, &quot;And Melchizedek king of Salem… was a priest of God Most High&quot; (Gen. 14:18). Was Shem the son of Noah a priest? But because he was the first-born, and because he ministered to his God by day and by night, therefore was he called a priest. Shem delivered the tradition to Abraham; he was initiated in the principle of intercalation and he intercalated the year, and he (also) was called priest, as it is said, &quot;The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek&quot; (Ps. 110:4). Whence do we know that Shem delivered the tradition to Abraham? Because it is said, &quot;After the order of Melchizedek&quot; (ibid.). Abraham delivered the tradition to Isaac, and he was initiated in the principle of intercalation, and he intercalated the year after the death of our father Abraham, as it is said, &quot;And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son&quot; (Gen. 25:11), because he had been initiated in the principle of intercalation and had intercalated the year (therefore) He blessed him with the blessing of eternity. Isaac gave to Jacob all the blessings and delivered to him the principle of intercalation. When Jacob went out of the (Holy) Land, he attempted to intercalate the year outside the (Holy) Land. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob! Thou hast no authority to intercalate the year outside the land (of Israel); behold, Isaac thy father is in the (Holy) Land, he will intercalate the year, as it is said, &quot;And God appeared unto Jacob again, || when he came from Paddan-Aram, and blessed him&quot; (Gen. 35:9). Why &quot;again&quot;? Because the first time He was revealed to him, He prevented him from intercalating the year outside the (Holy) Land; but when he came to the (Holy) Land the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob ! Arise, intercalate the year, as it is said, &quot;And God appeared unto Jacob again,… and blessed him&quot; (ibid.), because he was initiated in the principle of the intercalation, and He blessed him (with) the blessing of the world. Thus were the Israelites wont to intercalate the year in the (Holy) Land. When they were exiled to Babylon || they intercalated the year through those who were left in the (Holy) Land. When they were all exiled and there were not any (Jews) left in the (Holy) Land, they intercalated the year in Babylon. (When) Ezra and all the community with him went (to Palestine), Ezekiel wished to intercalate the year in Babylon; (then) the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Ezekiel ! Thou hast no authority to intercalate the year outside the Land; behold, Israel thy brethren, they will intercalate the year, as it is said, &quot;Son of man, when the house of Israel dwell in their own land&quot; (Ezek. 36:17). Hence (the Sages) have said, Even when the righteous and the wise are outside the Land, and the keeper of sheep and herds are in the Land, they do not intercalate the year except through the keeper of sheep and herds in the Land. Even when prophets are outside the Land and the ignorant are in the Land they do not intercalate the year except through the ignorant who are in the land (of Israel), as it is said, &quot;Son of man, when the house of Israel dwell in their own land&quot;(ibid.) it is their duty to intercalate the year.</p>

And Ishmael, the son of Abraham, went with his ‎children and all that were his and returned unto the land of Havilah to dwell therein; and all the ‎children of the concubines of Abraham went to locate in the lands towards the east, for ‎Abraham had sent them away from his son Isaac, giving them gifts so that they went away. ‎And all that Abraham had left he gave unto Isaac, his son, including all his treasures; and he ‎instructed him - continually, saying: Know it and understand that the Lord is God in heaven and ‎on earth, and that there is no other god besides Him; and it is He who hath taken me from my ‎father's house and from the place of my birth to give me all the pleasures on earth; it is He ‎who hath delivered me from the schemes of the wicked, because I trusted in Him; and He ‎hath brought me unto this place after delivering me from Ur Casdim, and he said unto me: To ‎thy seed shall I give all these lands to possess them, if they observe my commandments, my ‎statutes, and my judgments which I have commanded unto thee, and which I shall command ‎unto them. And now, my son, hearken thou, therefore, to my voice and keep the ‎commandments of the Lord, thy God, which I have taught thee; do not turn from the way of ‎righteousness, neither to the right nor to the left, so that it may be well with thee and with thy ‎children after thee, forever; and remember, also, the wonderful works of the Lord, and the ‎kindness he has shown to us, in delivering us from the hands of our enemies, and causing ‎them to fall into our hands.

And Isaac replied unto his father, saying: ‎Whatsoever my Lord hath commanded I will do, nor shall I turn away from any one of His ‎commandments, but I shall observe all that He ordered me to do. And Abraham blessed Isaac ‎and his children; and Abraham instructed Jacob in all the ways of the Lord.

            <summary>The patriarchs exemplify the concept of blessing, with Abraham being the first to receive this power from God, passing it on to Isaac, who then passed it on to Jacob. This power to bless was a point of contention between Esau and Jacob, with Jacob ultimately becoming the heir. The commandment to walk in God's paths includes imitating God's virtues of providing for the needy, visiting the sick, comforting mourners, and burying the dead, as exemplified throughout the Torah, emphasizing the importance of kindness, justice, and charity in one's actions.</summary>

              <p>We therefore see that the patriarchs by their very lifestyles reveal the mystical aspects of Creation through their lifestyles as reported in the Torah. Bereshit Rabbah 1,10, commenting on why the Torah commences with the letter ב instead of the letter א, mentions several reasons. The Torah wishes to indicate that there are two worlds, the עולם הזה, and the עולם הבא. The letter ב symbolises ברכה, blessing. The letter א would have been inappropriate, because it is the first letter of the word ארור, cursed. Had the Torah started with א, many would have thought that this was proof that the whole enterprise of Creation was doomed to failure, i.e. cursed. As a result of such considerations, G–d decided to create the universe by using the letter ב first, hoping that the universe would endure. We see that both the Creation and (the lives of) the patriarchs express the concept of ברכה, blessing. It is fitting then that the source of, or better key to, blessings should have been placed in the hands of the patriarchs. G–d first told Abraham about this in Genesis 12,2 when He literally commanded him to become a source of blessing by telling him that he had become the repository of blessings. Isaac inherited this gift from his father as we see from Genesis 25,11 where G–d passed on Abraham's blessing to Isaac after Abraham's death. The competition between Esau and Jacob was about which of the two would be the heir to this power to bless with which G–d had invested Abraham and subsequently Isaac. Jacob became the heir to this power to bless, and he in turn bequeathed it to his children. Abraham did not personally bequeath these blessings to his son Isaac but waited for G–d Himself to do so. The reason for this will be explained when we deal with the blessing that Isaac bestowed on Jacob. We will also quote the comments of Bereshit Rabbah on that subject. </p>

              <p>This is the way the סמ&quot;ג describes the commandment as number seven in his list of positive commandments. &quot;One must walk in His good straightforward paths, seeing that the Torah says והלכת בדרכיו, as well as אחרי ה' אלוקיכם תלכו (Deut 13,5), which is interpreted in the Talmud Sotah 14a as a reference to G–d's virtues. Just as G–d provides clothing for the naked, since the Torah says: 'G–d made leather aprons for Adam and his wife and He clothed them,' G–d also visits the sick, as we know from the beginning of this פרשה. G–d comforts the mourners as we know from Genesis 25,11: 'After the death of Abraham G–d blessed Isaac.' G–d also buries the dead, as we know from Deut. 34,6: 'He buried him (Moses) in the valley in the land of Moab.' This is the way I explained the contents of this paragraph to the scholars of Spain. You should know the G–d of your fathers, and serve Him, for just as He is gracious and merciful, so you should be gracious and merciful. Just as He performs acts of kindness, justice and charity on earth, so should you. You have two examples. In Jeremiah 22,15 it is reported of King Josiah that 'he ate, drank and performed justice and righteousness, whereupon all was well with him. Then he judged the poor and the needy, and all was well with him. That is truly heeding Me, says the Lord.' We have another verse in Jeremiah 9,22: 'Thus said the Lord: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom; let not the strong man glory in his strength…but only in this should one glory; in his earnest devotion to Me, For I the Lord act with kindness, justice and equity in the world; for in these I delight, says the Lord.&quot; Thus far the סמ&quot;ג.</p>

            <summary>Rashi explains that each tribe is considered a &quot;people&quot; because Benjamin had not yet been born when Jacob was promised a nation and a congregation of nations. Rabbeinu Bahya suggests that Jacob grieved over the death of his mother, Rebekah, and that G-d consoled him with a blessing. Solomon's wisdom in Kohelet emphasizes the importance of visiting mourners. Rabbi Chiyah offers various interpretations of the priestly blessing, including material wealth, protection, and the promise of prophets. Radak connects the phrase &quot;from between his knees&quot; to other instances in the Bible. Ramban discusses Esau's despising of his birthright and the implications of Isaac's poverty and Rebekah's death. Gevia Kesef and Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim explore the concept of blessings given by G-d. The Midrash suggests that Isaac lived near Hagar after Abraham's death, showing respect for her. Da'at Zekenim discusses the transfer of the power to bless from Abraham to Isaac.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>והיה ברכה, “your blessing will precede My blessing,” i.e. when referring to you, in their daily prayers, people will first describe Me as מגן אברהם, “the Shield of Avraham,” before they will refer to Me as מחיה מתים,”the G–d who revives the dead.” An alternate interpretation: of the words: והיה ברכה “and be a blessing;” up until now, for the last two thousand years, I have been the only source of blessing for mankind; from now on the power to bless has been transferred to you, and you can bless whosoever you see fit to provide with a blessing. This is the reason why, when wanting to transfer this power to bless to his son Yitzchok, when he foresaw prophetically that Yitzchok would sire an Esau, Avraham could not bring himself to transfer this power to Yitzchok before he died, and he left it to G–d to decide if that power were to be transferred to him. This is why we read in Genesis 25,11, that after Avraham had died G–d bestowed this power on his son Yitzchok. The matter can be illustrated by a parable. A king owned a valuable orchard which he entrusted to one of his intimate friends to look after, and to irrigate properly. The friend began to undertake his task and found that there were two trees, one of which laden with a fruit containing a deadly poison, the other with an elixir of life. Both trees needed to be irrigated, but he found that the two trees were positioned in such a way that it was impossible to irrigate the one without at the same time also irrigating the other. He said to himself that if he irrigated the beneficial tree, he would simultaneously also prolong the existence of the poisonous tree. How was he to resolve this dilemma? He therefore resolved to leave well enough alone until the next time the owner of the orchard would visit it, when he could consult with him. At that time, he would follow the owner’s instructions. Another interpretation of the words: והיה ברכה. This is not so much to be understood as a blessing itself, but as a command to become the source of blessings. Wherever his journeys would take him, he was to make it his concern to spread the knowledge about his Creator and to bless the person with whom he came into contact. This is also what Avraham did, as we know from Genesis 12,8; ויקרא בשם ה', “He proclaimed the Name of the Lord,” (praising Him). Seeing that the people did not respond to his sermons positively, G–d resorted to bringing on a famine in the land.

              </summary>
              <p>The text itself is significant: “Isaac had come from Be’er Lahai Roi.” What was this place? We have encountered it only once before. It is where the angel appeared to Hagar when, pregnant, she fled from Sarah who was treating her harshly (Gen. 16:14). An ingenious midrash says that when Isaac heard that Abraham had sent his servant to find a wife for him, he said to himself, “Can I live with a wife while my father lives alone? I will go and return Hagar to him.” (Midrash HaGadol to Gen. 24:62.)  A later text tells us that “after Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi” (Gen. 25:11). On this, the Midrash says that even after his father’s death, Isaac lived near Hagar and treated her with respect. (Midrash Aggada and Bereshit Rabbati ad loc.)  What does all this mean? We can only speculate. But if the silences mean something, they suggest that even an arrested sacrifice still has a victim. Isaac may not have died physically, but the text seems to make him disappear, literarily, through three scenes in which his presence was central. He should have been there to greet and be greeted by the two servants on his safe return from Mount Moriah. He should have been there to mourn his departed mother Sarah. He should have been there to at least discuss, with his father and his father’s servant, his future wife. Isaac did not die on the mountain, but it seems as if something in him did die, only to be revived when he married. The text tells us that Rebecca “became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>A Midrashic approach: The word יברכך implies being blessed with material wealth; the word וישמרך implies that the recipient is preserved so that he can perform G’d’s commandments as a result of the material wealth G’d has blessed him with. The words יאר ה' פניו אליך , mean that G’d may grant you the kind of children who are full of Torah knowledge. The Midrash bases this insight on Proverbs 6,25 כי נר מצוה ותורה אור, “for like a single candle lighting a narrow area is the performance of a single commandment, whereas the performance of the Torah in all its aspects provides great light.” Furthermore, the same words include the blessing that “from you will stem priests who in turn will illuminate the Altar in the Temple,” as it is written in Maleachi 1,10 ולא תאירו מזבחי חנם, “you will not light up My Altar without recompense.” We have another verse supporting this point in Leviticus 6,5 where the Torah writes: “and the fire on the Altar will never be extinguished.”   Concerning the precise meaning here of the word ויחונך, Rabbi Chiyah the great taught that it means that the Lord will make His camp near you (from the root חנה). Another approach holds that the word promises that G’d will make prophets descend from your loins; that school of thought bases itself on the verse in Zecharyah 12,10 ושפכתי על בית דוד ועל יושבי ירושלים רוח חן ותחנונים, “I will pour out over the house of David and over the people of Jerusalem a spirit of pity and compassion.” These are the ingredients which we think of when we think of prophets. Still another approach sees in the word ויחונך a reference to grace in the sense of being held in esteem, being appreciated. The word appears in that meaning in Esther 2,17 where we are told that all who saw Esther, including the king, immediately formed this positive opinion of her.  On the final verse, ישא ה' פניו אליך וישם לך שלום, “may the Lord raise His countenance toward you and grant you peace,” we must compare the meaning of this expression to Deut. 10,17 אשר לא ישא פנים ולא יקח שוחד, “Who does not play favourites nor accept bribes.” How can we reconcile these two apparently contradictory concepts of asking the very same G’d whom we applaud for not playing favorites in Deut. 10,17 to play favourites with the entire Jewish people in the priestly blessing formulated by the same G’d? [The word ישא has to be translated then as “will forgive.” Ed.] If the victim of an unfavorable decree has repented before the decree has been sealed his repentance is effective. If not, such as in Deut. 17,10 it is not.   A second approach to the first verse. The word יברכך implies being blessed with sons, the word וישמרך implies being blessed with daughters who require additional protection and safeguarding on the part of their parents. This is reflected in the promise in Psalms 121,5 ה' שומרך, ה' צלך על יד ימינך, ”the Lord is your guardian; the Lord is your protection, at your right hand.”  The verse יאר ה' פניך אליך describes the element life which is associated with light, such as in באור פני מלך חיים, “in the light of the king’s face there is life” (Proverbs 16,15). The word appears in a similar connotation in Psalms 67,2 אל-הים יחננו ויברכנו יאר פניו אתנו סלה, ”May G’d be gracious to us and bless us; may He illuminate us with His face, Selah.”  Concerning the last verse of the blessing(s)ישא ה' פניו אליך , this means that “in every direction you turn may G’d arrange for you to find peace and harmony and be protected from all unpleasant happenings.” This is a form of G’d’s personal benevolent supervision of our fates generally referred to as השגחה פרטית. We find the reverse of this threatened by G’d as part of threats of the prophet Isaiah when he quoted G’d as saying: “I am going to turn My watchful eye away from you (G’d refusing to hear our prayers)” (Isaiah 1,15).  In Berachot 20, the sages derive from the wording ישא ה' פניו אליך that although when you look at this verse superficially you get the impression that it contradicts the verse where G’d says that He does not play favorites, using the word לא אשא פנים this way is misleading. All that is meant is that G’d will lift our countenances, i.e. respond to our first having raised our face to Him in prayer and supplication. This is not what is called “playing favorites,” i.e. using double standards. This idea is even reflected in the text of the Torah. We read in Deut. 8,10: “you will eat and be satisfied and you will bless the Lord your G’d.” Assume that father, mother, and children assemble around the family table to consume their daily meal and they find that there is not enough to sate even one of them, never mind all of them. They will turn their faces to G’d, and each one will hold back and help himself to a minimum making sure there will be enough to go around. When G’d observes such conduct, He will most certainly be affected by it and make sure that in the future this family will not be lacking for anything. This is also the deeper meaning behind the famous line in Song of Songs 3,7 that Solomon’s bed was watched over by 60 guards. Did then Solomon need these guards? Was he in danger of attacks by assassins, by terrorists? What is meant by these words is that the priestly blessing which comprises 60 letters was engraved on the edge of Solomon’s bed.  Another explanation of this line in Song of Songs: the bed mentioned in Song of Songs is not that of King Solomon at all. It is the “bed” of He who owns peace, i.e. G’d. The “bed” is the Holy Temple; The reason the Temple is compared to a bed is that just as the function of the bed is for those on it to practice the commandment of increasing the human population of the world, so it was a propensity of all the furnishings in the Temple to increase and multiply. We have a glimmer of this in Kings I 8,8: “the staves (attached to the Holy Ark) were growing longer so that they would wind up being visible in the Sanctuary in front of the Shrine. A verse indicating something similar is found in Chronicles II 3,6 where Ezra describes the gold of the Temple as זהב פרוים, understood to mean “gold which had the capacity to multiply, which produced fruit.” A third scriptural verse which at least alludes to this phenomenon as far as the materials used for the Temple is concerned is found in Kings I 7,2 where the entire Temple is described as בית יער הלבנון, &quot;The Lebanon Forest House,” suggesting that just as a forest and its trees keep growing, so the Temple would keep expanding. The next words in that verse in Song of Songs, i.e. כלם אחוזי חרב, “all of them trained in warfare, i.e. “swordsmen,” refer to names of the Lord. The words following i.e. איש חרבו על ירכו, “each one with his sword on his loins”, beg the question what the ירך, the seat of a man's semen has to do in this verse. The answer is that these words describe that even if Solomon (symbol of the Jewish people) had frightening dreams at night, dreams during which he (they) felt in immediate danger, thanks to the encouragement derived by the proximity of all these names of G’d the people would rouse themselves in the morning, go to the Synagogue, and shake off any fear experienced during the night in a nightmare. They would find the effects of the dream dissolve without any further ado. In order to provide the Jewish people in the desert with this remedy, G’d instructed Aaron and his sons to bless the people in the way the Torah specified. G’d said: “in the past when I needed to extend a blessing to My creatures I would bless Adam and Chavah, as we know from Genesis 1,28 ‘G’d blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply etc.’” G’d blessed Noach when the latter was in need of such as blessing as we know from Genesis 9,1: “G’d blessed Noach and his sons.” He blessed Avraham as we know from Genesis 25,1: “G’d had blessed Avraham with everything.” From Avraham’s time on, G’d changed His mode of administering blessings directly and assigned the task to Avraham saying to him: “become a source of blessing” (Genesis 12,2). Avraham responded by siring two sons, Ishmael and Yitzchak. Avraham failed to bless either of them. In order to understand Avraham’s failure to bless either one of his sons, let us illustrate this by means of a parable. A king who owned an orchard entrusted it to a profit-sharing farmer to look after it. The orchard in question contained within it right in the center two trees, one of which contained the elixir of life whereas the second one contained a poison which would kill. The farmer was in a quandary, saying to himself that if he watered both trees he would further the growth of the deadly tree. If, on the other hand, he did not water either tree he would cause the elixir of life to die out. He decided to serve out his contract and to leave the decision of what to do to the king, the owner, after he himself had bowed out of the picture. The “king” in the parable is G’d. The “orchard” is earth. The “farmer” is Avraham, and the two trees, the elixir of life and the poisonous one, are Yitzchak and Ishmael respectively. Avraham said to himself: “if I bless Yitzchak, Ishmael will demand to be blessed also. Seeing that he is wicked, I cannot do that. I prefer to pass and not exercise my discretion. After all, I am only flesh and blood, not all-knowing like the Lord.” What happened? After Avraham had died we find that the Torah records that G’d bestowed the blessing He had first given to Avraham on his son Yitzchak after his father had died (Genesis 25,11). Yitzchak in turn blessed Yaakov. Yaakov blessed all his twelve sons as we read in Genesis 49,28 “all these (aforementioned ones) are the twelve tribes of Israel and this is what he had said to them when he blessed them.” From that point on, G’d said to Moses: “the blessings are at your (Israel collectively) disposal. The priests shall be the ones to administer them (Based on Tanchuma Nasso 9).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ותמת דבורה מינקת רבקה, “Devorah, Rivkah’s nursemaid died.” This verse has been inserted between the report of two appearances by G’d which Yaakov enjoyed. This fact serves to prove the words of our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 81,5 on this verse who see in it a hint to Yaakov that his mother Rivkah had died. This justified the fact that Yaakov named the oak beneath which Devorah was buried “the oak of weeping.” This is the opinion of Nachmanides. He writes that it would not have been appropriate for the Torah to describe Yaakov as grieving thus merely about the death of his mother’s nursemaid, a woman who must have been very old, that the site would be called after her for all future time. Yaakov grieved over the fact that his mother who had promised to send him word when it was safe to return and face Esau was no longer able to do what she had intended to do and that therefore there would not be a reunion between him and Rivkah. According to Nachmanides, the Devorah mentioned here was one who had never accompanied Rivkah when she left her brother’s house to marry Yitzchak. Her death in Yaakov’s presence triggered his awareness that his mother must have died. G’d’s next appearance to Yaakov was intended to console him over this loss of his mother.  Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 82,4, explain that the words “G’d blessed him” in our verse represent the blessing given to mourners. We find a similar blessing being bestowed by G’d on Avraham in Genesis 25,11. The Talmud in Sotah 14 reports something similar concerning Genesis 25,11 where G’d is reported as blessing Yitzchak. This occurred immediately after the death of Avraham, Yitzchak’s father. G’d’s blessing is understood as a blessing bestowed on mourners. We find support for this interpretation of the words “G’d blessed Yaakov” in verse 27 in our chapter where the Torah reports Yaakov as returning “to his father Yitzchak in Mamre the city of Arba.” We all knew of the city of Arba and Mamre, so why tell us where Yitzchak lived at that time? The implication of the verse is that Rivkah had died. Had she been alive, surely the Torah would have described Yaakov as returning to both his parents, i.e. Yitzchak and Rivkah, especially so since it had been Rivkah who had promised to call Yaakov back to come home as soon as she thought it was safe for him to do so. Seeing she had died, the Torah did not consider it appropriate, i.e. as in her honor, to mention this fact outright. The Torah concealed the time of her death.</p>

              <p>Such considerations prompted Solomon to write in Kohelet 7:2: “it is better to go to the house of a mourner than to go to the house where a feast is in progress.” According to Midrash Kohelet, what Solomon meant is that it is preferable to be in the company of people who are concerned both with the living and the dead than to keep the company of people who are only concerned with the living. [By visiting the mourners one pays his respects both to the departed and to those surviving him. Ed.] G’d conveyed the thought that we are to learn from Him, Who had temporarily interrupted sharing the joy of His children on the occasion of the inauguration of the Tabernacle and had comforted Aaron instead, displaying His sorrow that Nadav and Avihu had had to die. Our sages (Sotah 14) find yet another source proving that G’d comforts the mourners, quoting Genesis 25,11 “It was after the death of Avraham that G’d blessed his son Yitzchak.” According to the understanding of the Talmud the “blessing” described there was the comfort expressed to the bereaved over their loss, in that instance over Yitzchak having lost his father.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>SO ESAU DESPISED HIS BIRTHRIGHT. Who so despiseth the word shall suffer thereby. (Proverbs 13:13. Ramban’s intent in quoting this verse is to explain why it was necessary for the verse before us to say, So Esau ‘despised,’ since, as is clearly indicated in Scripture later on, Esau regretted his action and complained that he [Jacob] took my birthright. (Further, 28:36.) Scripture therefore justifies what befell Esau later on by saying here, So Esau ‘despised’ the birthright, and he who despises the word shall suffer thereby.)  But, indeed, Scripture has already explained the reason that Esau consented to the sale. This was because he was in mortal danger from his hunting animals, and it was likely that he would die while his father was alive, and the birthright carried with it no distinction except after the passing of the father. So of what benefit was the birthright to him? This then is what Scripture says: And he did eat and drink, and he rose and went, and he despised, for, after having eaten and drunk, he returned to his hunt in the field which was the cause of the despising of the birthright. For there is no desire in fools (Ecclesiastes 5:3.)  except to eat and drink and to fulfill their momentary desire, not giving a care for tomorrow. Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has erred here exceedingly by saying that Esau despised the birthright because he saw his father destitute of wealth. Now, [continues Ibn Ezra,] many wonder about Isaac’s poverty since Abraham left him with great wealth. But have they never seen a person who was wealthy in his younger years and became poor in his old age? An indication that Isaac was indeed poor is the fact that Isaac loved Esau because of his venison. Furthermore, had there been abundant food in his father’s house and he [Esau] “the honorable one in his sight,” (See Isaiah 43:4.)  he would not have sold his birthright for pottage. Also, if his father ate savory meat every day, what reason was there for him to say to Esau, “Bring me some venison?” (See further, 27:3-4.)  Why did Jacob not have costly garments as Esau had? (See ibid., Verse 15.)  Why did his mother not give Jacob some silver and gold for his journey when he fled to Haran so that he had to say, And He will give me bread to eat, and a garment to put on? (Ibid., 28:20.)  Why did she not send him some money — since she loved him — so that he was required to tend Laban’s flock? (All these questions indicate that Isaac was indeed poor.)  The verse which states, Thus the man grew (Further, 26:13.)  [in wealth], must refer to the period before he became old. Now ignorant people think that wealth is a great distinction for the righteous. Let Elijah prove the contrary. (See I Kings 17:6, where Elijah’s poverty is depicted.)  These ignorant people further ask, “Why did G-d cause Isaac to lack wealth?” Perhaps they could also inform us why He caused Isaac’s vision to be diminished? And let them not dismiss me with a reply based upon a d’rash (The D’rash (Aggadic) answer is that Isaac’s eyes became dim as a result of Esau’s wives offering incense to the idols. See Rashi further, 27:1, where this is one of several reasons mentioned.)  for there is indeed a secret (Interpreters of Ibn Ezra suggest that “the secret” referred to here is the fact that Isaac was a son of Abraham’s old age, and it was for this reason that his eyesight was weak.)  in the matter, and we must not probe since the thoughts of G-d are deep and no man has the power to understand them. All these are Abraham ibn Ezra’s words. Now I wonder who has blinded Abraham ibn Ezra’s reasoning in this matter, causing him to say that Abraham left Isaac great wealth, and he lost it just prior to this event, [that is, the sale of the birthright], and for this reason, Esau despised the birthright, for this matter of the sale of the birthright took place when Jacob and Esau were still young, before Esau married, as Scripture tells, (And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife. (26:34).)  and after the sale of the birthright, Isaac again became wealthy in the land of the Philistines until he became very great… and the Philistines were jealous of him. (Further, 26:13-14.)  Following that, [according to Ibn Ezra, we must say that Isaac] again became poor, and he desired the venison of his son Esau and the savory meats. All this is laughable. Furthermore, the verse says, And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that G-d blessed his son Isaac. (Above, 25:11.)  Now the blessing refers to increase of wealth, possessions and honor, but where was His blessing if he lost the wealth of his father and became impoverished? Afterwards it says, And I will be with Thee, and I will bless thee, (Further, 26:3.)  [but according to Ibn Ezra you will have to say that Isaac] became rich and then poor! And if it be true that in matters of wealth, There are righteous men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked, (Ecclesiastes 8:14.)  this does not apply to those righteous men who have been expressly blessed by the Holy One, blessed be He, since the blessing of the Eternal maketh rich, and no sorrow is added thereto. (Proverbs 10:22.)  Rather, the patriarchs all were as kings before whom kings of the nations came and with whom they made covenants. Now it is written concerning Isaac and Abimelech, And they swore one to another. (Further, 26:31.)  But if Isaac had suffered bad fortune and lost his father’s wealth, how did [Abimelech, King of the Philistines, and Phichol, the head of his army], say, we saw plainly that the Eternal was with thee, (Ibid., Verse 28.)  when he was already in financial difficulty? Rather, Esau’s disdain of the birthright was due to his brutal nature. It is possible that the law of double portion to which the firstborn is entitled according to the statutes of the Torah (Deuteronomy 21:17.)  was not in effect in ancient times. (That is, in the time of the patriarchs.)  [At that time the birthright] was only a matter of inheriting the pre-eminence of the father and his authority so that he [the firstborn] would receive honor and distinction in relation to his younger brother. It is for this reason that Esau said to Isaac, I am thy son, thy firstborn, (Further, 27:32.)  meaning to say that he is the firstborn who deserves to be blessed. Similarly, [Joseph said to his father, Jacob], For this is the firstborn; put thy hand upon his head, (Ibid., 48:18.)  thereby meaning that Jacob should give him precedence in the blessing. Perhaps the firstborn also took slightly more of the inheritance since the law of double portion is an innovation of the statutes of the Torah. (Thus even in ancient times it was customary that the firstborn inherit more than one share. However, the Torah established his portion to be two shares. This interpretation differs from Ramban’s original thesis that the firstborn originally had no preference whatever in inheritance, and that the Torah instituted this law.)  And as for the venison in his mouth which Isaac desired so strongly, this is in keeping with the custom of princes and kings. They prefer venison above all food, and out of fear, all nations bring them gifts of venison. Esau flattered his father by bringing him all the venison so that he may always eat of it to his heart’s content, (Ramban thus explains Isaac’s desire for venison without postulating Isaac’s poverty as Ibn Ezra did.)  and the love of a father for his firstborn is easily understood. As for Isaac’s saying that he would bless Esau after he had prepared the savory meats for him, that was not a reward or a recompense for the food. Instead, he wanted to derive some benefit from him so that his very soul would be bound up in his at the time that he brought him the food so that he would then bless him with a complete desire and a perfect will. Perhaps Isaac discerned in himself that following the meal his soul would be delighted and joyous, and then the Ruach Hakodesh (“The holy spirit.” The expression refers to a degree of prophecy. See Moreh Nebuchim, II, 45 (2).)  would come upon him, [as was the case with Elisha the prophet, who said], ‘But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the Eternal came upon him. (II Kings 3:15.)  And as for not giving wealth to Jacob, that was [not due to Isaac’s poverty but rather] because Jacob was fleeing for his life. He left the country alone without his brother’s knowledge, and had he been given along wealth, servants and camels, they would have increased his enemies’ jealousy and resulted in their ambushing him and killing him. Our Rabbis do indeed say that Jacob was robbed [at the outset of his journey (Bereshith Rabbah 68:2. Thus another difficulty tending to favor Ibn Ezra’s thesis that Isaac was poverty stricken is resolved.)  of whatever possessions he had]. And who has told Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra that Jacob had no costly garments, fine linen and silk and embroidered robes? (Ezekiel 16:13.)  Rather, Scripture states that when going to the field to hunt, Esau would change his garments for his hunting clothes, and due to the fact that [because of his dim eyesight], Isaac always touched his son and his clothes with his hands, Rebekah clothed Jacob with them lest he recognize him by his clothes. You see that this is precisely what Isaac did: And he smelled the odor of his garments (Further, 27:27.)  because he had put them among calamus and cinnamon, even as it is written, Myrrh and aloes, and cassia are all thy garments. (Psalms 45:9.)  The spices grew in the Land of Israel, and it is for this reason that Isaac said, The odor of my son is as the odor of a field. (Further, 27:27.)  Because he was a man of the field (See above, Verse 27.)  his garments had the odor of the field or that of the blossoms of the trees, just as our Rabbis explained it: As the odor of a field (Further, 27:27.)  of apples. (Taanith 29b.)  And as for the question raised above concerning the quality of Isaac’s lack of vision, it is a question raised by the ignorant, for if (Further in the text Ramban suggests that Isaac’s dim vision was a natural result of his old age. Hence he writes here: “If it was brought about.”)  it was brought about especially by G-d, it was in order that Isaac bless Jacob, this being the purport of the verse, And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, he called Esau. (Further, 27:1.)  And in line with the natural meaning of Scripture, this was but a manifestation of old age, the explanation of the verse being as follows: And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim in his old age, he called Esau. Now of Jacob himself it is said later on, Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. (Ibid., 48:10.)  Of Achiyah the Shilonite it is also written, Now Achiyah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age, (I Kings 14:4.)  and concerning Moses our teacher it is related with wonder that his eye was not dim. (Deuteronomy 34:7.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND DEBORAH REBEKAH’s NURSE DIED. I do not know why this verse has been placed between the verse, And he called the place El-beth-el (Verse 7 here.)  and the following verse, And G-d appeared to Jacob again. (Verse 9 here.)  Scripture thus interrupts one subject which occurred at one time and in one place for when Jacob came to Luz, that is Beth-el, (Verse 6 here.)  he built an altar there and he called the place El-beth-el, (Verse 7 here.)  and G-d appeared to him there and He blessed him. (Verse 9 here.)  Why then was this verse concerning Deborah’s death placed in the midst of one subject? A feasible answer is that which our Rabbis have said, (Bereshith Rabbah 81:8.)  namely that the verse alludes to the death of Rebekah, and therefore Jacob called the name of that place, Alon-bachut (the oak of weeping), for the weeping and anguish could not have been such for the passing of the old nurse that the place would have been named on account of it. Instead, Jacob wept and mourned for his righteous mother who had loved him and sent him to Paddan-aram and who was not privileged to see him when he returned. Therefore G-d appeared to him and blessed him, in order to comfort him, just as He had done to his father Isaac following the death of Abraham. (Above, 25:11.)  With reference to both of them the Sages have said (Sotah 14 a; Bereshith Rabbah 82:4.)  that He gave them the blessing of consolation addressed to mourners. Proof for this is that which is said below, And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, (Verse 27 here.)  for had Rebekah been there, Scripture would have mentioned “unto his father and unto his mother” for it was she who sent him. to Paddan-aram and caused him all the good, for Isaac commanded him to go there at her advice. Now Rashi commented: “Because the time of her death was kept secret in order that people might not curse her — the mother who gave birth to Esau — Scripture also does not make mention of her death.” This is a Midrash of the Sages. (Tanchuma Ki Theitzei 4.)  But neither does Scripture mention the death of Leah! Instead, we must say that the intent of the Sages was to explain why Scripture mentions Rebekah’s death by allusion, connecting the matter with her nurse. Since Scripture did refer to it, they wondered why the matter was hidden and not revealed. And the justification for the curse stated by Rashi is not clear since Scripture mentioned Esau at the death of Isaac, And Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. (Verse 29 here.)  It is, however, possible to say that Rebekah’s death lacked honor, for Jacob was not there, and Esau hated her and would not attend; Isaac’s eyes were too dim to see, (Above, 27:1.)  and he did not leave his house. Therefore, Scripture did not want to mention that she was buried by the Hittites. I found a similar explanation in Eileh Hadvarim Rabbah, (I found this not in Midrash Rabbah but in Tanchuma Ki Theitzei, 4.)  in the section of Ki Theitzei Lamilchamah, (Deuteronomy 21:10.)  where the Sages say: “You find that when Rebekah died, people said, ‘Who shall go before her? Abraham is dead. Isaac is confined to the house and his eyes are dim. Jacob is gone to Paddan-aram. If wicked Esau shall go before her, people will say, “Cursed be the breast that gave suck to this one.’” What did they do? They took out her bier at night. Rabbi Yosei bar Chaninah said, ‘Due to the fact that they took out her bier at night the Scriptures mentioned her death only indirectly. It is this which Scripture says, And he called its name Alon-bachut, two weepings, [one for Deborah and one for Rebekah]. Thus Scripture says, And G-d appeared unto Jacob… and blessed him. (Verse 9 here.)  What blessing did He give him? He gave him the blessing of consolation addressed to mourners.’” Thus far the Midrash. Now because Esau was the only one present at her burial, they feared the curse, and they did not view the burial as an honor to her, this being the significance of the Scriptural hint. Deborah was in Jacob’s company because after accompanying Rebekah to the land of Canaan, she had returned to her country, and now she was coming with Jacob in order to see her mistress. It may be that she was engaged in raising Jacob’s children out of respect for Rebekah and due to her love for her, and thus she resided with him. Now it is possible that she is not “the nurse” of whom it is said, And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, (Above 24: 59.)  but that she was another nurse who remained in the house of Laban and Bethuel, and now Jacob brought her with him to support her in her old age out of respect to his mother, for it was the custom among the notables to have many nurses. It is improbable that the old woman would be the messenger whom his mother had dispatched to Jacob [to have him return to the Land of Israel], as Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan would have it. (Mentioned by Rashi in this verse. A preacher in the city of Narbonne, Provence, France, who lived in the second half of the eleventh century, Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan, compiled a collection of Agadic material on the book of Genesis. The book itself, which had a great influence upon Rashi and other writers, has been lost except for the quotations made by other scholars.) </p>

                <h4>Beit Yaakov on Torah, Chayei Sara 37:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>And these are the generations of Yishmael son of Avraham, etc.: The matter of Yishmael being called the son of Avraham more than the other nations that he fathered afterwards is because at the time of Yishmael's birth, his mother Hagar was still the maidservant of Sarah.  As our father Avraham, peace be upon him, was not yet perfected with all types of perfection. That is why there was a little holiness in [Yishmael]. For before a man is perfected, he enters into all sorts of questionable things, since he might gain from them [spiritually]. But with the children that he fathered after Sarah's death when he was perfected with all types of perfection, so that he had no need for any spiritual work at all - given that there was no remaining lack that he needed to perfect - he no longer desired to lower himself and enter into questionable things [from which] he might gain. And because of that, there was no holiness at all or internal power in these children. (As explained above in this Parsha, Section 33.) And that is why Yishmaelite converts have a greater status than converts from other nations, (See below, Parshat Toladot, Section 7, staring  with the words, &quot;Vezehu.&quot;) as it is found in the holy Zohar (Parshat Yitro 87a); and he is also more choice than his brothers who were born after the perfection of our father Avraham, as it is found in the holy Zohar. (See the Kometz Mincha, Section 47, by our Master, Rabbi Tzadok HaKohen.) But the main holiness of our father Avraham, peace be upon him, was in his son Yitzchak, who was born to him in his hundredth year, at the time that he switched time periods, before he had all of the perfections. But afterwards, he had all the perfections in him; so the main greatness of the [various] levels was then in him. And this is [the meaning] of that which they said in the Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah, Lech Lecha 47), &quot;There is an a fortiori argument about the son of the lady: If they (the Yishmaelites) have courtyards and strongholds, all the more so will every righteous person have a world for himself.&quot; For God, may He be blessed, shows 'garments' here in this world. For God forbid that he should have perfection in this world; rather Israel perfects that which is lacking. And it is as it is written (Psalms 135:4), &quot;For the Lord (the diminutive two-letter version of God's name is used here) has chosen Yaakov for Himself.&quot; And that is because the name of God is only complete (perfected) through Yaakov and Israel, who complete (perfect) the name. And it is, as it were, that God is obligated to lower Himself to save Israel and to destroy all the opponents and accusers from before Israel. And from the son of the maidservant, we learn an a fortiori argument about the son of the lady: If the son of the maidservant, the entire life of whom only came from the statement of Avraham before God, may He be blessed Genesis 17:18), &quot;If only Yishmael might live before you,&quot; and God, may He be blessed, answered him (Genesis 17:20), &quot;And as for Yishmael, I have heard you&quot;; all the more so with the son of the lady, about whom God, may He be blessed, said from His angle and from His will (Genesis 17:21), &quot;But I will establish My covenant with Yitzchak,&quot; will this last forever and ever. However it is [like this] because God, may He be blessed, does not want to use this in this world, but only in the world that is truly long. </p>

              <p>“And these are the generations of Yishmael son of Avraham, who Hagar the Egyptian bore, the maidservant of Sarah, to Avraham.” (Bereshit, 25:12) It is written (Tehilim, 111:6), “He told the power of His works to His people in giving them the inheritance of the nations.” That is to say, from the side of Israel, there is almost no need to know the sciences of the natural world, for they act according to the Torah of God and the conduct of God, with no need of the conduct of the natural world at all. Only, “He who said to the oil, “ignite!” can say to vinegar, “ignite!” (God could make anything He wants light, so the point is to be connected to the source rather than the effect.)” Out of His great love for them, God also wants them to know the sciences of nature, and this is also found in the Torah. We find an example in the Gemara (Mishna, Pesachim, 39b), “a man may not chew wheat and place it on his wound, because it turns into leaven,” and from this it is clear that chewed wheat is good for a wound, as we find in several places. And to this, “the power of His works,” meaning the Torah, “He told to His people in giving them inheritance of the nations,” and this inheritance is nature (and its wisdom), and this is also found in the power of His works that He told to His people. This itself is, “these are the generations of Yishmael (son of Avraham, which Hagar the Egyptian) the handmaid of Sarah, bore to Avraham,” for his primary relation to her was that she was Sarah’s handmaid, and owing to this there are sages among them. Their names teach of their wisdom. Neviot teaches that a man must see that his body is clean, as it is related to the word navov, meaning empty, hence empty of impurity. Kedar is the heated body (such as k’dera, a cooking pot). Ad’bael meaning not to eat to become satisfied. Mivsham meaning wines and perfumes that make one wise (connected to bosem, perfume; see Yoma, 76b, “Rava said, wine and fragrant spices made me wise”). This concerns their wisdom in the realm of physical health. Concerning their wisdom in social relations are, “Mishma’, and Duma, and Massa,” mishma’, meaning the power of listening (shema); Duma, virtually the same word for silence; and Massa, meaning a load that is carried, meaning to be patient. Concerning their wisdom in production, “Chadad” means if you want to bring something into the world (Chadad means to be sharp or fierce, essential to creativity), “Teima,” all the world will find it wondrous (Temiha, wonder or astonishment), “Y’toor,” so make sure that it is well-organized (Toor is a row). “Nafish” means to take time with the creation to make sure that it is beautiful (Nafash, to rest, to take the proper amount of time). “Kidma,” or, if you see it is proper to do it, then do it soon lest someone else does it before you (Lehakdim, to precede). Their wisdom is only in the realm of nature, and in this they place their trust. Therefore of Yishmael it is written (Bereshit, 25:18), “and he fell [died] in the presence of his brethren.” However, with Israel, who knows that all comes from Heaven, it is written (Bereshit, 16:12), “and he shall dwell in the presence of his brethren.” (Meaning, when Yishmael is in the presence of Israel, he dwells in the presence, Shechina, of God.) ,  (This is as it is said in the Gemara [Berachot, 58a], “If you see a sage of Israel you pronounce the blessing, ‘Blessed is He who divides His wisdom among those who fear Him.’ For a sage of the Gentiles, say, ‘Blessed is He who gives His wisdom to flesh and blood.’” It is similarly so with the difference between kings of Israel and kings of the Gentiles. This is because Israel is a veritable portion of God, and the wisdom of the Gentiles is the wisdom of nature and not connected to Kedusha [holiness]. For the wisdom of Israel and their conduct is according to the Torah of God. Tashlum Mei HaShiloach.) </p>

              <p>The repetition of the fact that אשר ילדה הגר, was to emphasise that although Ishmael had been the son of a slave-woman, he rose to such eminence. Avraham loved him because he was his firstborn son, and G’d blessed him on account of Avraham, and this was  why He made him so successful. (compare 21,20)

              <p>אשר ילדה הגר המצרית, the point of the whole verse is to tell us that the name and significance of Ishmael is not associated with Avraham who fathered him, but with Hagar who had mothered him. When the Torah speaks of Yitzchok, it does not describe him as the son of Sarah, his mother, but as the son of Avraham, his father. (compare verse 19) We find something similar in Ruth 4,18 concerning Peretz who fathered Chetzron.</p>

              <p>Nur zweimal steht das Wort תולדות ganz voll geschrieben, מלא דמלא, sowohl mit dem Waw der Wurzel als dem Waw des Plurals: אלה תולדות שמים וארץ (Bereschit 2, 4) und אלה תולדות פרץ bei Esau fehlt das Waw, (Ruth 4, 18) der Wurzel, sonst überall das Waw des Plurals, hier bei Ismael fehlen beide. Es dürfte dies gewiß nicht absichtslos sein. Vielleicht weist das fehlende Wurzelwaw auf eine Mangelhaftigkeit in der Erzeugung, somit auf eine innere, das fehlende Plural- waw auf eine Mangelhaftigkeit in der Ausdehnung, der Vermehrung und Verbreitung hin. Die der göttlichen Naturordnung folgenden Erzeugnisse des Himmels und der Erde sind intensiv und extensiv vollkommen. Ebenso die Erzeugnisse des Perez, an welche sich die jüdische Heileshoffnung der Menschheit knüpft. Esaus zahlreiche Nachkommen haben eine extensive Größe, aber ihre innere, geistig sittliche, ist noch mangelhaft. Einmal kommt das Wort auch von Jakobs Nachkommen vor (Kap. 37, 12) und da steht es ebenfalls mit mangelndem Wurzelwaw, das ist aber eben da, wo mit dem Vergehen gehen Josef die noch fehlende sittliche Vollkommenheit der Söhne Jakobs zu Tage tritt und die damit beginnende Läuterung eingeleitet wird. Ismaels Nachkommen hatten weder die extensive Größe Edoms, noch die intensvbe Isaaks.</p>

Then it is written, &quot;And these are the generations of Isaac&quot; (Ibid. 19). Is it possible that because it is written that Ishmael sired twelve princes and Isaac sired two, he (Ishmael) is more righteous? It is therefore written, &quot;Who can utter the mighty (Heb. גְּבוּרוֹת) acts of Hashem.&quot; This refers to Isaac for Isaac sired Jacob, who alone is more important than all of them, for he fathered the twelve tribes, and sustained the upper and the lower, while Isaac supported the higher in supernal holiness and Ishmael only below. Therefore the verse, &quot;Who can utter the mighty acts of Hashem,&quot; refers to Isaac, as explained above. The words, &quot;declare all His praises,&quot; refers to Jacob. When the sun connects with the moon, many stars shine from them.</p>

              <p>[4] Another interpretation: These are the generations of Isaac. But haven't we already heard &quot;These are the generations of Ishmael&quot; (Genesis 25:12)? Here we have &quot;These are the generations of Isaac, son of Abraham&quot;. One might think that they are similar, God forbid, but &quot;the Lord knows the way of the righteous&quot; (Psalm 1:6). This can be compared to a donkey's foal that fell into a rose oil, and although its smell became pleasant from the rose oil, in the end it returns to its previous state. So too with the donkey's foal, which is the Egyptian handmaid, as it is written &quot;Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys&quot; (Ezekiel 23:20), she cleaved to Abraham and bore Ishmael, and it is written &quot;These are the generations of Ishmael, son of Abraham.&quot; But in the end, she returned to her previous state, as it is written &quot;And his mother took for him a wife from the land of Egypt&quot; (Genesis 21:21), who was the Egyptian handmaid. However, look at what Abraham commanded for him, that his servant Eliezer should not take a wife for him from the daughters of Canaan, but rather from Abraham's family (Genesis 24:38). Therefore, &quot;These are the generations of Isaac&quot; and so on, but &quot;Ishmael, these are the generations of Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's maidservant, bore to Abraham&quot; (Genesis 25:12).</p>

              <p>And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses on the day that God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai (Numbers 3:1).  Anyone with whom the Omnipresent engages to establish a nation or a family tree from him, the Omnipresent would also engage with him  to write generations in his regard, as you find twelve instances of generations in the verses. The first: “These are the generations of the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 2:4); “this is the book of the generations of Adam” (Genesis 5:1); “these are the generations of Noah” (Genesis 6:9); “these are the generations of the sons of Noah” (Genesis 10:1): “these are the generations of Shem” (Genesis 11:10); “these are the generations of Teraḥ” (Genesis 11:27); “these are the generations of Ishmael” (Genesis 25:12); “Isaac” (Genesis 25:19); “Esau” (Genesis 36:1); “Jacob” (Genesis 37:2). These are ten generations with which the Holy One blessed be He engaged to create the world and to establish nations. And there are two people that the Omnipresent wrote their generationst, one for the royal dynasty and one for the priestly dynasty: “These are the generations of Peretz” (Ruth 4:18), to establish the royal dynasty from him, and “these are the generations of Aaron and Moses&quot;(Numbers 3:1), for the priestly dynasty.</p>

              <p>“These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham” (Genesis 25:12).  “These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham” – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva and the Rabbis were sitting and finding difficulty [with this passage]: ‘Why did the verse see fit to describe the lineage of the wicked man [Ishmael] here, [as well as his age at death]?’ [Just then] Rabbi Levi passed by. They said: ‘Here comes the master of halakha, let us ask him.’ Rabbi Levi said: ‘It is in order to tell you at what age your ancestor [Jacob] was blessed.’ (From knowing the age of Ishmael when he died (see the next verse), it can be derived that Jacob was sixty-three years old when he received his father’s blessing. See Megilla 17a.)  “These are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years, and he expired and died and he was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:17).  “These are the years of the life of Ishmael” – why did the verse see fit to recount the years of the wicked one here? It is because he came from the far reaches of the desert to perform kindness for his father [in attending his funeral].  “They dwelled from Ḥavila to Shur, that is adjacent to Egypt, all the way to Assyria: he settled among all his brethren” (Genesis 25:18).  “They dwelled from Ḥavila…” – here it says: “he settled [among all his brethren]” [nafal, literally, fell down], but elsewhere it says [of Ishmael]: “He will dwell [yishkon] [among all his brethren]” (Genesis 16:12). The explanation is that all the days our patriarch Abraham was alive – yishkon. When our patriarch Abraham died – nafal. (He fell in stature.)  Before he extended his hand against the Temple – yishkon; once he extended his hand against it (See Psalms 83:3–19.)  – nafal. In this world – yishkon; but in the future – nafal.</p>

              <p>It happened again that the Egyptians summoned Israel before Alexander of Macedonia, saving to them: &quot;The passage reads (Ex. 12, 36) And the Lord hath given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they gave unto them what they required; and they emptied out Egypt.&quot; And G'bihah b.

He said to them: &quot;Whence is your evidence? And they answered: &quot;From your Torah.&quot; Then said he: &quot;I, in defence, will also bring my evidence from the Torah. It is said (Ib. ib. 40) Now the time of the residence of the children of Israel, which they dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. Hence I demand of you the wages for the labor of six hundred thousand men whom your parents compelled to work for them during all the time they were in Egypt.&quot; King Alexander said to them: &quot;State your argument against him.&quot; Whereupon they requested three days' time, which was granted them. But they could find nothing in reply, so they fled, leaving their sown fields and their planted vineyards. And that year also was a Sabbatical one. And it happened again that the descendants of Ishmael and the descendants of Keturah summoned Israel before Alexander, saying: &quot;The land of Canaan belongs to us and to you, as it is said (Gen. 25, 12) These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, and it is written (Ib.)

              </summary>
              <p>(Gen. 25:19:) THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISAAC BEN ABRAHAM. (Except for most of the last section (# 24), Toledot is not found in Buber’s Oxford MS. Buber has filled in the gap mostly from Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34.)  This text is related (to Prov. 17:6): GRANDCHILDREN ARE A CROWN FOR ELDERS, AND THE GLORY OF CHILDREN IS THEIR PARENTS. (Cf. Gen. R. 63:2; Tanh., Gen. 6:4.)  Who caused Abraham to be magnified? Jacob, as stated (in Is. 29:22): THUS SAYS THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF JACOB, WHICH REDEEMED ABRAHAM. Why? Because, if one is meritorious as a Torah scholar together with his son and his grandson, it will never again be cut off from him. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 4:9f.): AND MAKE THEM (the statutes and ordinances) KNOWN TO YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AS ON THE DAY THAT YOU STOOD &lt; BEFORE THE LORD YOUR GOD AT HOREB &gt;. Just as the gift of &lt; the &gt; Torah did not become cease on the day it was given; so for one who teaches his son and his grandson Torah, it shall never again depart from him. And so it was when the Holy One saw Abraham was busy with the Torah. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): BECAUSE ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE &lt; AND KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY LAWS &gt;. It is also written (above, in 18:19): FOR I HAVE KNOWN HIM. Then Jacob arose up and did not move from the Torah, as stated (in Gen. 25:27): BUT JACOB WAS A PERFECT MAN WHO SAT IN THE TENTS (i.e., in the academies). (For this interpretation, see Gen. R. 63:10; Targum Onqelos, Gen. 25:27; PRK 5:7.)  What stipulation did the Holy One make with them? (According to Josh. 1:8:) &lt; THIS &gt; BOOK OF THE LAW SHALL NOT DEPART &lt; FROM YOUR MOUTH &gt;…. It is also written (in Prov. 10:1): A WISE SON SHALL MAKE A FATHER GLAD. This is Isaac, since it is stated (in Gen. 21:12): FOR IN ISAAC SHALL YOUR SEED BE NAMED. (Prov. 10:1, cont.:) BUT A FOOLISH SON. This is Ishmael. Thus it is written (in Gen. 25:12): NOW THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISHMAEL BEN ABRAHAM. There are children who suffer disgrace through their parents. Josiah suffered disgrace through his father, as stated (in II Chron. 33:23): FOR AMON INCURRED A LOT OF GUILT. Hezekiah suffered disgrace through &lt; his father &gt; Ahaz, as stated (in Is. 8:16): BIND UP THE TESTIMONY. (According to Gen. R. 42:3; Lev. R. 11:7; Ruth R., proem 7; and Esther R., proem 11, this verse alludes to Ahaz, who had seized (ahaz) the synagogues and the academies.)  There are also parents who suffer disgrace through their children. Eli suffered disgrace through his sons, [as stated (in I Sam. 2:12): NOW ELI'S SONS WERE SCOUNDRELS. And Samuel also suffered disgrace through his sons], as stated (in I Sam. 8:3): BUT HIS SONS DID NOT WALK IN HIS WAYS. It did not, however, turn out in this way for Abraham. Instead he was magnified through Isaac, as stated (in Gen. 25:19, cont.): ABRAHAM SIRED ISAAC. Did he sire no one but Isaac? Now look, it is written {(in Gen. 25:19): THESE ARE THE GENERATIONS OF ISHMAEL.} [(in Gen. 16:15): SO HAGAR BORE A SON TO ABRAM.] And in addition &lt; there are &gt; the sons of Keturah: Zimran and Jokshan, &lt; etc. &gt; (cf. Gen. 25:2). But it does not say that Abraham sired anyone but Isaac, simply because Isaac was righteous. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 25:19): ABRAHAM SIRED ISAAC.</p>

              <p>Another matter, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances,” Rabbi Abahu said: Every place where ve’eleh is written, it adds to the previous matter, and every place that eleh is written it rejects the previous matter. How so? “This is [eleh] the legacy of the heavens and the earth on the day that they were created” (Genesis 2:4). What did it reject? He had been creating heavens and earth and examining them. They were not pleasing to Him, and He would restore them to emptiness and disorder. When He saw this heavens and earth, they were pleasing to Him. He said: “This is the legacy of the heavens and the earth,” but what came before was not a legacy.  Similarly, “this is [eleh] the legacy of Noah” (Genesis 6:9). What did it reject? It rejected the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and Keinan and his counterparts. Therefore it says: “The sons of Yefet, Gomer and Magog” (Genesis 10:2). (The Torah enters into great detail when enumerating the descendants of Noah, but not with the preceding generations.)   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:12), adds to the previous matter. Who are they? What is written beforehand, as it is stated: “She bore him (Ketura bore for Abraham.)  Zimran and Yokshan” (Genesis 25:2). Here, too, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham…the firstborn of Ishmael is Nevayot” (Genesis 25:12–13). They were wicked like them. (The sons of Ishmael were wicked like the sons of Ketura. )   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy [toledot] of Isaac son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:19) adds to the previous matter, to what was written beforehand: “The sons of Ishmael” (Genesis 25:16). Who was it? It was Esau and his sons, for he was a son of Isaac. If so, it may be said that since only “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy” is written, Jacob, too, who was part of the legacy of Isaac, is included with Esau? You find that every [time the word] toledot appears in the Bible it is written defectively, (It is written without a vav between the tav and lamed or without a vav between the dalet  and the tav.)  except for: “This is the legacy [toledot] of the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 2:4), and “this is the legacy [toledot] of Peretz” (Ruth 4:18). And there is a compelling reason why it says: “This is the legacy [toledot] of the heavens and the earth” in full. It is because the Holy One blessed be He created His world and there was no angel of death in the world. That is why it is complete. When Adam and Eve sinned, the Holy One blessed be He minimized all the toledot in the Bible. When Peretz arose, his toledot became full, because the Messiah will emerge from him, in whose days the Holy One blessed be He will eliminate death, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8). That is the reason that toledot of the heavens and earth and toledot of Peretz are full. This is the reason that toledot of Isaac is defective, to exclude Jacob from the category of the wicked. (The Messiah can also be traced back to Jacob, and therefore the word toledot should have been written regarding Isaac with the vav. It is written without the vav as an indication that it is referring only to Esau and not to Jacob. )   Similarly, “this is [eleh] the legacy of Jacob” (Genesis 37:2), it rejected the chieftains of Esau.  Similarly, “these are [ve’eleh] the names of the children of Israel” (Exodus 1:1), adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: The children of Reuben and the children of Simeon. (This is a reference to the listing of the descendants of Jacob who came down to Egypt (see Genesis 46:8–27). )   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Aaron” (Numbers 3:1) adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: “These are the counted, that Moses and Aaron…counted” (Numbers 1:44). Just like those beforehand were righteous, so, too, these were righteous. (Although the verses regarding Aaron proceed to list Nadav and Avihu, who were killed due to the offering of a strange fire before God (see Numbers 3:2–4), on the whole they were still considered righteous. )   Here, too, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances” adds to the previous matter, that which was written beforehand: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances” (Exodus 15:25).  Another matter, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances.” What is written before this portion? “They shall judge the people at all times” (Exodus 18:22). And it says here: “These are the ordinances,” and the [Ten] Commandments are in the middle. This is analogous to a noblewoman who was walking, an armed guard on this side and an armed guard on that side, and she was in the middle. So, too, the [giving of the] Torah had justice before it and justice after it and it was in the middle. Likewise it says: “I walk on the path of righteousness” (Proverbs 8:20). The Torah says: In which path do I walk? I will walk in the path of those who perform righteousness. “In the midst of the paths of justice” (Proverbs 8:20), the Torah in the middle and justice before it and after it; before it, as it is stated: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances,” justice after it, as it is stated: “These are the ordinances.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ספר תולדות אדם, “the book relating the descendants of man.” According to Nachmanides this is an allusion to the entire Torah which is perceived as the ספר תולדות אדם. If it were not so, the Torah should not have used the expression ספר, “book,” but should simply have written אלה תולדות אדם, just as we find in Genesis 25,12 when the descendants of Ishmael are enumerated, or in Genesis 25,19 where the descendants of Yitzchak are listed.   Maybe the meaning of the word ספר in this instance is חכמה, “wisdom,” just as we find it in the ספר יצירה where the expression is ספר וספור as we already mentioned on a previous occasion. The “wisdom” referred to is not ordinary human wisdom but celestial wisdom, a wisdom which would have been man’s had he not sinned. The thrust of our verse then would be: “this book contains the wisdom which should have been an integral part of every human being.” The true descendants of man are not his biological children but his accomplishments in the field of Torah knowledge. The tasks that need to be performed on earth which require a human population could be carried out by someone other than man if need be. This is what Ben Azzai had in mind when he explained that he would not preoccupy himself with marrying and begetting children as his longing was concentrated solely on Torah (Yevamot 63). The complete verse therefore means: “for this book which represents the celestial wisdom, something that ought to belong to every human being seeing he had been created בדמות אלוקים עשה אותו, in the likeness of G’d He made him on the very day that G’d created man.” You will now understand why the Torah saw fit to mention the word אדם twice in this verse.</p>

              <p>THESE ARE ‘TOLDOTH’ NOAH. Commentators (Ibn Ezra and R’dak. These commentators felt the difficulty in explaining toldoth to mean “progeny” or “generations” since it further states, And Noah begot three sons.)  have explained the word toldoth to mean “his experiences” [or “his events”] much the same as the sense of: what a day ‘yeiled’ (may bring forth). (Proverbs 27:1.)  In this way the word toldoth refers to the entire section [since all the events of the flood are occurrences in the life of Noah]. But this does not appear to me to be correct since the external events in the life of a person, [over which he has no control], are not his toldoth. The correct interpretation is that the word toldoth here retains its literal meaning of “progeny,” just as, These are ‘toldoth’ (the progeny of) the sons of Noah; (Genesis 10:1.)  And these are ‘toldoth’ (the progeny of) Ishmael. (Ibid., 25:12.)  Thus Scripture is saying, “These are the progeny of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.” Scripture however repeats, And Noah begot three sons, (Verse 10.)  because [at the end of the first verse] it interrupted by saying, Noah was a righteous man, and whole-hearted, in order to inform us why He commanded him concerning the ark. And even though Scripture has already stated above, And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth, (Above, 5:32.)  it returns to mention them a second time in order to relate that Noah was unlike all his ancestors who begot daughters and sons. This is the meaning of the words, three sons; (Verse 10.)  Scripture mentions their number in order to say that these three alone were his progeny, and they were saved by his merit, and by them was the whole earth overspread. (Genesis 9:19.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>Genesis ‎24,1. “and Avraham had become old, while G’d had ‎blessed him in everything.” According to the Talmud Baba ‎Metzia 87 the concept of ”old age,” was unknown to mankind ‎until Avraham’s being described here in such terms. [According ‎to the Talmud, the statement refers to external features of elderly ‎people stamping them as having lived for many years. This was ‎why up until then anyone looking at Avraham or Yitzchok could ‎not be sure whether he was looking at the father or the son. ‎Ed.] [If I understand the Talmud correctly, what is meant is ‎that when the Torah had described Adam as having begotten a ‎son in his own image (Genesis 5,3) as opposed to his first two ‎sons, the resemblance between fathers and sons continued ‎unabated until the time when Avraham was described as having ‎aged. Ed.] The point the Talmud makes is that beneficial ‎largesse provided from the celestial regions for the lower regions ‎of the universe manifests itself in one of two ways. It may be ‎measured in terms familiar to us in this part of the universe, or it ‎may be described in terms of concepts applicable in the celestial ‎regions, seeing that these two domains each have their own set of ‎rules. When this beneficial largesse originates directly in the ‎celestial spheres close to the Creator, it had not become subject to ‎limitations applicable in the parts of the world we live in. [As an ‎example, we may distinguish between nourishment provided by ‎G’d through the earth giving its yield, when such nourishment is ‎subject to limitations that apply on our planet, whereas when G’d ‎fed the Jewish people with manna, such limitations did not apply, ‎as the manna originated directly in one of the seven layers of ‎heaven. Ed.] This latter method of benefiting from G’d’s largesse is ‎reserved exclusively for the Jewish people. The Jewish people ‎have become privy to this (on occasion) due to their having clung ‎to their Creator with such devotion.‎ The other nations sharing this planet with us, receive ‎whatever largesse G’d provides for them only through “nature,” ‎which “processes” such gifts from G’d before it reaches its ‎recipients. This is what is meant when the Torah wrote in Genesis ‎‎25,12-15 ‎ואלה תולדות ישמעאל שנים עשר נשיאים לאומתם‎, “and this is ‎the line of Ishmael, son of Avraham……12 chieftains, etc.” The ‎word: ‎לאומתם‎ is derived from ‎אמה‎, “mother;” when a mother ‎measures her son she uses measuring devices used in our parts of ‎the universe. The Torah (Genesis 25,13, and again in verse 16) ‎adds: ‎בשמותם לתולדותם‎ and ‎בחצריהם ובטירותם‎, “by their names, in ‎the order of their births, and by their villages and their ‎encampments;” these words describe the parameters within ‎which they were privy to G’d’s benevolent largesse. The contrast ‎with which the Torah describes a similar description of the ‎development of the Jewish people can be seen in the words ‎למשפחותם לבית אבותם‎, “according to their family, their respective ‎father’s house”. The word ‎אבותם‎ in this instance is derived from ‎אבה‎, as in ‎לא אבה יבמי‎, “he did not want to perform levirate ‎marriage with me.” (Deuteronomy 25.7) The word ‎אבה‎ is a ‎synonym for ‎רצון‎, “will, desire.” The widow describes that her ‎brother-in-law does not wish to fulfill the will of heaven in ‎maintaining his deceased brother’s name alive. Let us ‎illustrate by an example more familiar to all of us. A potter ‎intends to create a vase of a certain shape and colour. Before ‎setting out to shape the clay he has a definite image of the ‎finished product in his mind’s eye. This image is known as ‎מחשבה‎, ‎or ‎אב הפעולה‎, “the father of the finished product.” The ‎רצון‎, the ‎will to create a vase, is called ‎אב‎, father, as it precedes even the ‎sculptor’s vision of the final shape and colour of the product is ‎about to embark on creating. The eventual product is known as ‎בני בנים‎, euphemism for “grandchildren.” [In relation to the ‎רצון‎ ‎the initial will to create something. Ed.] Israel’s drawing down ‎G’d’s largesse to itself is somewhat similar. The process begins ‎with this celestial largesse entering the domain of the physical ‎universe, ‎גבולין‎. [A domain defined by borders both dimensionally ‎and directionally. Ed.] The various shapes and forms this largesse ‎assumes once it has entered our part of the universe is known as ‎בני בנים‎, “grandchildren.” The original ‎רצון‎, G’d’s intention to ‎provide this largesse, is called ‎זקן‎, “an old man.” When ‎Solomon in Proverbs 17,6 speaks about ‎עטרת זקנים בני בנים‎, loosely ‎translated as “grandchildren are the crown of their elders,” the ‎meaning of this line on a deeper level, is: “the largesse that has ‎been received by Israelites as a result of G’d’s benevolence, is ‎rooted in the will of G’d,” i.e. from this ‎רצון‎ to the world known as ‎בני בנים‎. ‎</p>

The reason why Rashi emphasizes this is because ‎there are numerous occasions when the Torah does not list the ‎name of the children in this order, for instance: Genesis 9,18 ‎when the Torah lists the names of Noach’s sons as ‎שם, חם, ויפת‎, ‎naming ‎שם‎ first, although Yaphet was the firstborn. Similarly, in ‎Genesis 25,9 where Avraham’s burial is described, Yitzchok is ‎mentioned ahead of his older brother Yishmael as he was the ‎more righteous of the two.‎</p>

              <p>“He will be a wild man: His hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him and he will dwell among all his brethren” (Genesis 16:12).  “He will be a wild [pereh] man” – Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This means that everyone else would inhabit settlements, but he would inhabit the wilderness. (The word peleh is used in connection with the wilderness in Jeremiah 2:24: “A wild ass [pereh] accustomed to the wilderness.”)  Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “A wild man” – in its plain sense. Most people plunder wealth, but he plunders people.  “His hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him [kol bo].” Read it as “his dog [kalbo]” – he and a dog are equal; just as the dog eats carcasses, so, too, he eats carcasses.  Rabbi Elazar said: When will it be that “his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him”? It will be with the advent of that man (Nebuchadnezzar.)  in whose regard it is written: “And everywhere the sons of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens dwell, He has given into your hand and set your rule over all of them” (Daniel 2:38). That is what is written: “Concerning Kedar, (Kedar was one of Ishmael’s sons (see Genesis 25:13).)  and concerning the kingdoms of Ḥatzor that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote” (Jeremiah 49:28) – Nebuchadrezzar is written, (With an added vav, so that the last four letters spell atzur, gathered in.)  as he gathered them together in the wilderness and killed them.  “He will dwell among all his brethren” – here it says: “He will dwell [yishkon] [among all his brethren],” but elsewhere it is written “He settled [nafal] (Literally, fell.)  [among all his brethren] (Genesis 25:18). The explanation is that as long as Abraham our patriarch was alive – yishkon. When Abraham died – nafal. (He fell in stature.)  Before he extended his hand against the Temple – yishkon. Once he extended his hand against the Temple (See Psalms 83:7–13.)  – nafal. In this world – yishkon; but in the future – nafal.</p>

(Eccl. 11:6:) BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH WILL SUCCEED. From whom do you learn &lt; this fact &gt;? From Abraham, who in his youth only sired one &lt; child &gt; but in his old age sired twelve. R. Levi said: He is the one to whom the Holy One said: (in Gen. 12:3): AND IN YOU ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH SHALL BE BLESSED. Thus God arose in the generation of the dispersion and dispersed them into thirty families, as stated (in Gen. 11:8): SO THE LORD DISPERSED THEM…. R. Levi said: The Holy One said: I am producing them out of you. He is the one to whom the Holy One had said: AND IN YOU &lt; ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH &gt; SHALL BE BLESSED. So from him he produced thirty families; and they are the following: twelve princes which he produced from Ishmael (Gen. 25:13-16), the sixteen descendants of Keturah (Gen. 25:1-4), and (according to Gen. 25:23) TWO NATIONS ARE IN YOUR (Rebekah's) WOMB, for a total of thirty families. Ergo (in Gen. 25:1): THEN ABRAHAM TOOK ANOTHER WIFE.</p>

(A. V., Shall fall for thy sake.)  The verb נפל has here the same meaning as in אל הכשדים אתה נופל thou fallest away to the Chaldӕans (Jer. 37:13); and in על פני כל אחיו נפל he surrendered to all his brethren (Gen. 25:18); namely: to submit to the authority of.

              <p>את צדון בכורו, I have not been able to find a good reason for the Torah describing צדון as a firstborn, seeing that no other firstborn son of these people is described as such. Normally, the first named son is presumed to be the firstborn, so that there is no need for adding that attribute, unless we are to assume that the Torah, in naming someone as the first in a list of sons, does so because he possessed superior qualities to those of his brothers. One such example would be the mention of Shem ahead of his brothers, although he was not the oldest (5,32), according to those commentators who believe that Yaphet was Noach’s oldest son. It is possible that Tzidon did possess superior qualities when compared to his brothers, so that by describing him as the firstborn the Torah wanted to draw attention to both of these distinctions. We find something parallel in Genesis 25,13 where Nevayot is described as the firstborn son of Ishmael. We have reason to believe that he possessed outstanding qualities because his sister Machalat is not described only as the daughter of her father Ishmael, and her grandfather Avraham, but also as the sister of Nevayot, her brother. (Genesis 28,9) </p>

            <summary>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in Genesis 25:14. They are significant because they represent the various tribes that descended from Ishmael, who was the son of Abraham and Hagar. The names also hold symbolic meanings, such as Mishma meaning &quot;hearkening&quot; and Duma meaning &quot;silence&quot; [Steinsaltz on Genesis 25:14].</summary>

            <summary>R’ Eliezer haModa’i questions why God needs to be told what to do regarding his children, as they were prepared before Him from the six days of creation. Israel showed great faith by following Moshe into the barren wilderness without supplies, and for this faith, it was worth it to split the sea. When Israel entered the sea, Mount Moriah was uprooted, symbolizing the binding of Yitzchak on the altar. God urged Moshe to act quickly to save his children from distress, instructing him to raise his staff and stretch out his hand over the sea to give praise and glory to the one to whom all battles belong.</summary>

              <p>... R’ Eliezer haModa’i says: “Why do you cry out to Me?” (Exodus 14:15) Do I need to be told what to do regarding my children?! “…concerning My children and the work of My hands do you command Me?” (Isaiah 45:11) Were they not already prepared before Me from the six days of creation? As it says “If these laws depart from before Me, says the Lord, so will the seed of Israel cease being a nation before Me for all time.” (Jeremiah 31:35) Others say: Israel did a great thing. For the sake of the faith with which they believed in Me it is worth it to split the sea. For they did not say to Moshe ‘how can we go out into this barren wilderness without supplies for the journey?!’ Rather, they had faith and followed after Moshe, as it says in the prophets “Go and call out in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: so said the Lord: I remember to you the lovingkindness of your youth, the love of your nuptials, your following Me in the desert, in a land not sown.” (Jeremiah 2:2) What reward did they receive for this? “Israel is holy to the Lord, the first of His grain; all who eat him shall be guilty, evil shall befall them, says the Lord.” (Jeremiah 2:3) R’ Yosi haGalili says: when Israel entered the sea Mount Moriah was already uprooted from its place, together with the altar of Yitzchak which was built on it with the wood all laid out. It was as if Yitzchak was bound and placed on the altar and Avraham had stretched out his hand to take the knife and slaughter his son, as it says “And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife, to slaughter his son.” (Genesis 22:10) God (HaMakom) said to Moshe: Moshe, my children are in distress, the sea is closing, the enemy is pursuing and you stand there drawing out your prayer?! He said before Him: and what should I do? He replied: “And you raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea…” (Exodus 14:16) You should elevate, exalt, give song, exultation, thanksgiving, greatness, splendor, glory and praise to He to whom all battles belong.</p>

                <h4>Iggerot HaRambam, Iggeret Teiman 13</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>You mention that a certain man in one of the cities of Yemen pretends that he is the Messiah.17 As I live, I am not surprised at him or at his followers, for I have no doubt that he is mad and a sick person should not be rebuked or reproved for an illness brought on by no fault of his own. Neither am I surprised at his votaries, for they were persuaded by him because of their sorry plight, their ignorance of the importance and high rank of the Messiah, and their mistaken comparison of the Messiah with the son of the Mahdi [the belief in] whose rise they are witnessing. But I am astonished that you, a scholar who has studied carefully the doctrines of the rabbis, are inclined to repose faith in him. Do you not know, my brother, that the Messiah is a very eminent prophet, more illustrious than all the prophets after Moses? Do you not know that a false pretender to prophecy is liable to capital punishment, for having arrogated to himself unwarranted distinction, just as the person who prophesies in the name of idols is put to death, as we read in Scripture &quot;But the prophet that shall speak a word presumptuously in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.&quot; (Deuteronomy 18:20). What better evidence is there of his mendacity, than his very pretensions to be the Messiah. How odd is your remark about this man, that he is renowned for his meekness and a little wisdom, as if these were indeed the attributes of the Messiah. Do these characteristics make him a Messiah? You were beguiled by him because you have not considered the pre-eminence of the Messiah, the manner and place of his appearance, and the marks whereby he is to be identified. The Messiah, indeed, ranks after Moses in eminence and distinction, and God has bestowed some gifts upon him which he did not bestow upon Moses, as may be gathered from the following verses: &quot;His delight shall be in the fear of the Lord.&quot; (Isaiah 11:3). &quot;The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.&quot; (11:2). &quot;And Righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins.&quot; (11:5). Six appellations were divinely conferred upon him as the following passage indicates: &quot;For a child is born unto us, and a son is given unto us, and the government is upon his shoulder, and he is called Pele, Yoetz, el, Gibbor, Abiad, Sar-Shalom.&quot; (Isaiah 9:5). And another verse alluding to the Messiah culminates in the following manner &quot;Thou art my son, this day have I begotten thee.&quot; (Psalms 2:7). All these statements demonstrate the pre-eminence of the Messiah. Transcendent wisdom is a sine qua non for inspiration. It is an article of our faith that the gift of prophecy is vouchsafed only to the wise, the strong, and the rich. Strong is defined as the ability to control one's passions. Rich signifies wealthy in knowledge. Now if we dare not put trust in a man's pretensions to prophecy, if he does not excel in wisdom, how much less must we take seriously the claims of an ignoramus to be the Messiah. That the man in question is a sciolist is evident from the order he issued, as you state, to the people to give away all their possessions for eleemosynary purposes. They did right in disobeying him, and he was wrong inasmuch as he disregarded the Jewish law concerning alms-giving. For Scripture says, &quot;If a man will devote anything of all that he has&quot; and the rabbis explain in their comment on this verse, &quot;part of all that he has, but not all that he has,&quot; (Sifra ad locum). The sages accordingly set bounds to the bounty of the beneficent in an explicit statement which reads &quot;He who is inclined to be liberal with the poor, may not part with more than a fifth of his possessions. (Ketubot 50a). There is no doubt that the process of reasoning which led him to claim that he is the Messiah, induced him to issue a command to his fellow-men to give away their property and distribute it to the poor. But then the affluent would become destitute and vice-versa. According to this ordinance, it would be necessary for the nouveaux riches to return their recently-acquired property to the newly impoverished. Such a regulation, which would keep property moving in a circle, is the acme of folly. As to the place where the Messiah will make his first appearance, Scripture intimates that he will first present himself only in the Land of Israel, as we read, &quot;He will suddenly appear in His Temple&quot; (Malachi 3:1). As for the advent of the Messiah, nothing at all will be known about it before it occurs. The Messiah is not a person concerning whom it may be predicted that he will be the son of so and so, or of the family of so and so. On the contrary he will be unknown before his coming, but he will prove by means of miracles and wonders that he is the true Messiah. Scripture in allusion to his mysterious lineage says, &quot;His name is the Shoot, and he will shoot up out of his place&quot; (Zechariah 6:12). Similarly, Isaiah referring to the arrival of the Messiah implies that neither his father nor mother, nor his kith nor kin will be known, &quot;For he will shoot up right forth as a sapling, and as a root out of the dry ground.&quot; (53:2). After his manifestation in Palestine, Israel will be gathered in Jerusalem and the other cities of Palestine. Then will the tidings spread to the East and the West until it will reach you in Yemen and those beyond you in India as we learn from Isaiah. &quot;That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters, go, ye swift messengers, to a nation that has been pulled and plucked to a people that suffered terribly from their beginning onward.&quot; (18:2). The process of the final redemption will not be reversed so that it will first appear in distant lands, and ultimately reach Palestine. What the great powers are, which all the prophets from Moses to Malachi ascribe to the Messiah, may be inferred from various statements in the twenty-four books of Scripture. The most significant of them all is the fact that the mere report of his advent will strike terror into the hearts of all the kings of the earth, and their kingdoms will fall, neither will they be able to war or revolt against him. They will neither defame nor calumniate him, for the miracles he will perform will frighten them into complete silence. Isaiah refers to the submission of the kings to the Messiah in the verse, &quot;Kings shall shut their mouth because of him.&quot; (52:15). He will slay whom he will, none will escape or be saved, as it is written, &quot;And he shall smite the land with the rod of his mouth.&quot; (Isaiah 11:4). Revolution and war in the entire world, from East to West, will not cease at the beginning of the Messianic era, but only after the wars of Gog and Magog, as was indicated by Ezekiel. I do not believe that this man who has appeared among you possesses these powers. You know that the Christians falsely ascribe marvelous powers to Jesus the Nazarene,18 may his bones be ground to dust, such as the resurrection of the dead and other miracles. Even if we would grant them for the sake of argument, we should not be convinced by their reasoning that Jesus is the Messiah. For we can bring a thousand proofs or so from the Scripture that it is not so even from their point of view. Indeed, will anyone arrogate this rank to himself unless he wishes to make himself a laughing stock? In sum, had this man acted presumptuously or disdainfully, I would deem him worthy of death. The truth seems to be that he became melancholy and lost his mind. In my opinion, it is most advisable, both for your good and for his that you put him in iron chains for a while, until Gentiles learn that he is demented. After you have blazoned and bruited abroad the intelligence concerning this man among them, you may release him without endangering his safety. If the Gentiles gain knowledge about him after he has been locked up by you, they will taunt him, and pronounce him irrational and you will remain unmolested by them. If you procrastinate until they learn of this affair of their own accord, then you will most likely incur their wrath. Remember, my co-religionists, that on account of the vast number of our sins, God has hurled us in the midst of this people, the Arabs, who have persecuted us severely, and passed baneful and discriminatory legislation against us, as Scripture has forewarned us, &quot;Our enemies themselves shall judge us&quot; (Deuteronomy 32:31). Never did a nation molest, degrade, debase and hate us as much as they. Therefore when David, of blessed memory, inspired by the holy spirit, envisaged the future tribulations of Israel, he bewailed and lamented their lot only in the Kingdom of Ishmael, and prayed in their behalf, for their deliverance, as is implied in the verse, &quot;Woe is me, that I sojourn with Meschech, that I dwell beside the tents of Kedar.&quot; (Psalms 120:5). Note the distinction between Kedar and the children of Ishmael, for the Madman and imbecile is of the lineage of the children of Kedar as they readily admit. Daniel alludes only to our humiliation and degradation &quot;like the dust in threshing&quot; suffered at the hands of the Arabs, may they speedily be vanquished, when he says, &quot;And some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled upon them.&quot; (8:10). Although we were dishonored by them beyond human endurance, and had to put with their fabrications, yet we behaved like him who is depicted by the inspired writer, &quot;But I am as a deaf man, I hear not, and I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.&quot; (Psalms 38:14). Similarly our sages instructed us to bear the prevarications and preposterousness of Ishmael in silence. They found a cryptic allusion for this attitude in the names of his sons &quot;Mishma, Dumah, and Massa&quot; (Genesis 25:14), which was interpreted to mean, &quot;Listen, be silent, and endure.&quot; (Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, ad locum). We have acquiesced, both old and young, to inure ourselves to humiliation, as Isaiah instructed us &quot;I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair.&quot; (50:6). All this notwithstanding, we do not escape this continued maltreatment which well nigh crushes us. No matter how much we suffer and elect to remain at peace with them, they stir up strife and sedition, as David predicted, &quot;I am all peace, but when I speak, they are for war.&quot; (Psalms 120:7). If, therefore, we start trouble and claim power from them absurdly and preposterously we certainly give ourselves up to destruction. I shall now narrate to you succinctly several episodes subsequent to the rise of the Arabic kingdom from which you will derive some benefit.19 One of these refers to the Exodus of a multitude of Jews, numbering hundred of thousands, from the East beyond Ispahan, led by an individual who pretended to be the Messiah. They were accoutered with military equipment, and drawn swords, and slew all those that encountered them. They reached, according to the information I received, the vicinity of Baghdad. This happened in the beginning of the reign of the Umayyads. The king then said to all the Jews of his kingdom: &quot;Let your scholars go out to meet this multitude and ascertain whether their pretension is true and he is unmistakably your Expected One. If so, we shall conclude peace with you under any conditions you may prefer. But if it is dissimulation, then I shall wage war against them.&quot; When the sages met these Jews, the latter declared: &quot;We belong to the children of the district beyond the River.&quot; Then they asked them: &quot;Who instigated you to make this uprising?&quot; Whereupon they replied: &quot;This man here, one of the descendants of David, whom we know to be pious and virtuous. This man, whom we knew to be a leper at night, arose the following morning healthy and sound.&quot; They believed that leprosy was one of the characteristics of the Messiah, for which they found an allusion to the verse: &quot;stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted,&quot; (Isaiah 53:4), that is by leprosy. Whereupon the sages explained to them that this interpretation was incorrect, and that he lacked even one of the characteristics of the Messiah, let alone all of them. Furthermore they advised them as follows: &quot;O, brethren, you are still near your native country and have the possibility of returning thither. If you remain in this land you will not only perish, but also undermine the teachings of Moses, by misleading people to believe that the Messiah has appeared and has been vanquished, whereas you have neither a prophet in your midst, nor an omen betokening his oncoming.&quot; Thereupon they were persuaded by these arguments. The Sultan turned over to them so and so many thousand of dinars by way of hospitality in order that they should leave his country. But after they had returned home, he had a change of heart with respect to the Jews upon whom he imposed a fine for his expenditures. He ordered them to make a special mark on their garments, the writing of the word &quot;cursed,&quot; and to attach one iron bar in the back and one in the front. Ever since then the communities of Khorasan and Ispahan experienced the tribulations of the Diaspora. This episode we have learned from oral reports. The following incident we have verified and know to be true because it occurred in recent times. About fifty years ago or less, a pious and virtuous man and scholar by the name of Moses Al-Dar'i came from Dar'a to the province of Andalusia to study under Rabbi Joseph ha-Levi, of blessed memory, ibn Migash, of whom you very likely have heard. Later he left for Fez, the center of Maghreb. People flocked to him because of his piety, virtue and learning. He informed them that the Messiah had come, as was divinely revealed to him in a dream. Yet he did not pretend on the basis of a divine communication, as did the former lunatic, that he was the Messiah. He merely affirmed that the Messiah had appeared. Many people became his adherents and reposed faith in him. My father and master, of blessed memory, endeavored to dissuade and discourage people from following him. However only a few were influenced by my father, while most, nay nearly all clung to R. Moses, of blessed memory. Finally he predicted events which came true no matter what was going to occur. He would say: &quot;I was informed yesterday--this and this would happen,&quot; and it did happen exactly as he foretold. Once he forecast a vehement rain for the coming Friday and that the falling drops will be blood. This was considered a sign of the approaching advent of the Messiah,20 as was inferred from the verse, &quot;And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.&quot; (Joel 3:3). This episode took place in the month of Marheshvan. A very heavy rain fell that Friday and the fluid that descended was red and viscous as if it were mixed with clay. This miracle convinced all the people that he was undoubtedly a prophet. In itself this occurrence is not inconsistent with the tenets of the Torah, for prophecy will return to Israel before the messianic advent, as I have previously explained. When the majority of the people put their trust in him, he predicted that the Messiah would come that very year on Passover eve. He advised the people to sell their property and contract debts to the Muslims with the promise to pay back ten dinars for one, in order to observe the precepts of the Torah in connection with the Passover festival, for they will never see them again, and so they did. When Passover came and nothing transpired, the people were ruined as most of them had disposed of their property for a trifling sum, and were overwhelmed with debt. When the Gentiles in the vicinity and their serfs learned of this hoax they were minded to do away with him, had they located him. As this Muslim country no longer offered him protection he left for Palestine where he died, may his memory be blessed. When he left he made predictions, as I was informed by those who saw him, concerning events both great and little in Maghreb which were later fulfilled. My father of blessed memory, told me that about fifteen or twenty years before that episode, there lived respectable folks in Cordova, the center of Andalusia, some of whom were given to the cult of astrology. They were all of one mind that the Messiah would appear that year. They sought a revelation in a dream night after night, and ascertained that the Messiah was a man of that city. They picked a pious and virtuous person by the name of Ibn Aryeh who had been instructing the people. They wrought miracles and made predictions just as Al-Dar'i did until they won over the hearts of all the people. When the influential and learned men of our community heard of this, they assembled in the synagogue and had Ibn Aryeh brought there and had him flogged in public. Furthermore they imposed a fine upon him, and put him into the ban, because he gave assent by his silence to the professions of his adherents, instead of restraining them and pointing out to them that they contradict our religion. They did the same thing to the persons who assembled about him. The Jews escaped the wrath of the Gentiles only with the greatest difficulty. About forty years preceding the affair of Ibn Aryeh in Andalusia, there appeared a man in Linon,21 a large center in the heart of France, which numbered more than ten thousand Jewish families. He pretended that he was the Messiah. He was supposed to have performed the following miracles: On moonlit nights he would go out and climb to the top of high trees in the field and glide from tree to tree like a bird. He cited a verse from Daniel to prove that such a miracle was within the power of the Messiah: &quot;And behold, there came with the clouds of heaven One like unto a son of man ... And there was given him dominion.&quot; (7:13-14). Many who witnessed the miracle became his votaries. The French discovered this, pillaged and put many of his followers to death, together with the pretender. Some of them maintain however, that he is still hiding until this very day. The prophets have predicted and instructed us, as I have told you, that pretenders and simulators will appear in great numbers at the time when the advent of the true Messiah will draw nigh, but they will not be able to make good their claim. They will perish with many of their partisans. Solomon, of blessed memory, inspired by the holy spirit, foresaw that the prolonged duration of the exile would incite some of our people to seek to terminate it before the appointed time, and as a consequence they would perish or meet with disaster. Therefore he admonished and adjured them in metaphorical language to desist, as we read, &quot;I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please.&quot; (Song of Songs 2:7, 8:4). Now, brethren and friends, abide by the oath, and stir not up love until it please (Ketubot 111a). May God, Who created the world with the attributes of mercy grant us the privilege to behold the return of the exiles, to the portion of His inheritance, to contemplate the graciousness of the Lord, and to visit early in His Temple. May He take us out from the Valley of the Shadow of Death wherein He put us. May He remove darkness from our eyes, and gloom from our hearts. May he fulfill in our days as well as yours the prophecy contained in the verse, &quot;The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light.&quot; (Isaiah 9:1). May He darken our opponents in His anger and wrath, may He illuminate our obscurity, as it is written, &quot;For behold darkness shall cover the earth ... but upon the Lord will shine.&quot; (Isaiah 60:2). Greetings unto you, my dear friend, master of the sciences, and paragon of learning, and unto our erudite colleagues, and unto all the rest of the people. Peace, peace, as the light that shines, and much peach until the moon be no more. Amen. I beg you to send a copy of this missive to every community in the cities and hamlets, in order to strengthen the people in their faith and to put them on their feet. Read it at public gatherings and in private, and you will thus become a public benefactor. Take adequate precautions lest its contents be divulged to the Gentiles by an evil person and mishap overtake us (God spare us therefrom).22 When I began writing this letter I had some misgivings about it, but they were overruled by my conviction that the public welfare takes precedence over one's personal safety. Moreover, I am sending it to a personage such as you, &quot;and the secret of the Lord may be entrusted to those who fear Him.&quot; Our sages, the successors of the prophets, assured us that persons engaged in a religious mission will meet with no disaster (Pesahim 8b). What more important religious mission is there than this. Peace be unto all Israel. Amen. </p>

              <p>“He had scarcely finished speaking” [25:15]. Before he finished speaking, Rebecca, the daughter of Bethuel, came and was carrying a jug on her shoulder. Bahya asks a question. Why does the verse have to say, “it was he” [24:15]? Rather, say, “before he could finish” [24:15]. The explanation is, the word “he” points to the Holy One, who is called, “He made us and we are His” [Psalms 100:3]. That is to say, the Holy One sent his angel with Eliezer to make sure that Rebecca would come to the well soon. As soon as Eliezer saw Rebecca and that the water was rising toward her, Eliezer immediately went to the maiden and said, give me a little water to drink. Our sages learn from here that it is written, “she filled her jug and came up” [24:16]. She filled her jug, and it is not written, and she drew. That is, she did not need to draw up the water, since the water came up to meet her, and she filled her jug. (Bahya, Genesis, 24:16.)  Toldot Yizhak writes. The verse teaches us, “she filled her jug and came up” [24:16]. She filled her jug and went. It is customary that the girls would chat and joke with each other at the well. However, Rebecca was very modest and left immediately. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 24:16.) </p>

            <summary>The descendants of Ishmael were called &quot;sons of Cain&quot; because they dwelt in the territory belonging to Cain, and they would cause the kingdom of Assyria to cease. The tribes of Reuben and Gad left their families to aid in conquering the land, encountering three wicked families descended from Ishmael. The men and children of Reuben and Gad grew their hair as a sign of anguish until they could be reunited, and the Ishmaelites also grew their hair, making it difficult to distinguish between them.

              <p>“Gad, a troop will slash his enemies, and he will slash their heel” (Genesis 49:19).  “Gad, a troop will slash his enemies” – when Israel was conquering and distributing the land, the tribes of Reuben and Gad were with them, and they had left their children when they were young. (These tribes asked for portions of land on the eastern side of the Jordan. Moses agreed, on the condition that they would cross the Jordan and aid the rest of the tribes in conquering the land from the Canaanite nations (see Numbers 32:20–27). The men of these tribes settled their families on the eastern side of the Jordan, aided the rest of the tribes during the fourteen years of conquest and distribution of the land, and only then returned to their families, at the behest of Joshua (see Joshua 22:1–9). )  One whom they left at the age of ten, they found him twenty-four years old. One whom they left at the age of twenty they found him thirty-four years old. Three wicked families confronted them: Yetur, Nafish, and Kedma; that is what is written: “In the days of Saul, they waged war with the Hagrites, [who fell into their hand, and they dwelled in their tents across all the east of the Gilad]” (I Chronicles 5:10). (The families of Yetur, Nafish, and Kedma descended from Ishmael (see Genesis 25:13–15). They are called Hagrites after Hagar, Ishmael’s mother. )  Rabbi Yehoshua bar Neḥemya said: “In the days of Saul” – this is Joshua. Why does it call him Saul [Sha’ul]? Because the kingship was borrowed [she’ula] in his hand. (Joshua, the Judges, and King Saul were caretakers of the kingdom until the true king, a descendant of the tribe of Judah, would assume the throne.)  These would grow their hair, and those would grow their hair; these would grow their hair until they would see their children, and these would grow their hair until they would see their fathers. (The men and children of Reuben and Gad would grow their hair as a sign of anguish until they could be reunited. )  And the Ishmaelites would grow their hair. (Consequently, when they returned, the fathers had difficulty distinguishing between their children and the Ishmaelites.)  The Holy One blessed be He placed into the heart of the children, and they would say: ‘Answer us, Lord, answer us, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Israel, answer us.’ That is what is written: “They were aided against them, and the Hagrites…were delivered into their hand, [for they cried out to God in the battle, and He acceded to their entreaty]” (I Chronicles 5:20).   Due to what merit? Rabbi Levi and the Rabbis: The Rabbis said: Due to the blessing of Jacob, who said: “Gad, a troop will slash his enemies,” a troop will come to slash them and they will slash the troop. Rabbi Levi said: Due to the blessing of Joshua. That is what is written: “He said to them, stating: [Return to your tents] with much wealth…[divide the spoils of your enemies with your brethren]” (Joshua 22:8).</p>

              <p>ACCORDING TO THEIR NATIONS. We find Scripture employing ummot (nations) and ummim (nations), (Num. 25:15 (ummot); Ps. 117:1 (ummim). The former has a feminine ending, the latter, a masculine ending. Our verse (le’ummatam) employs the former.)  both of which are vocalized with a shuruk. (Actually a kubbutz. I.E. refers to both a kubbutz and a shuruk by one term, shuruk. Cf. L. Prijs, Die Grammatikalische Terminologie Des Ibn Ezra, Basel, 1950, p. 136.)  The lamed of le-ummatam (according to their nations) is a preposition, (It is not a root letter. It means according to.)  similar to the lamed of le-goyehem (after their nations). It is not the same as the lamed of ba-le’ummim (upon the peoples) (Ps. 149:7) which is a root letter like the lamed of le’om (people) in And the one people (u-le’om) shall be stronger than the other people (mi-le’om) (v. 23). Whether spelled with a lamed or not, it has the same meaning. However, they come from different roots. (That is, both om and le’om mean the same, but come from different roots. The root of om is alef, vav, mem and that of le’om, lamed, alef, mem (Cherez, Krinsky).) </p>

Was die Wolke ist, das hat sie von der Erde, und alles, was sie von der Erde empfängt, empfängt sie, um es, in Segen verwandelt, der Erde wieder zu spenden. Das ist der jüdische Fürst, den Kohelet 2, 12 als den bezeichnet, את אשר כבר עשוהו, den das Volk gemacht, d. i. der aus einer Vereinigung des Edelsten und Besten aus dem Volke bereits hervorgegangen ist. Es ist ein Glück, wenn der Fürst eine Wolke, ein נשיא ist. Ein solcher נשיא-Sinn ist notwendig, ohne ihn kann keine Gesamtheit blühen, und durch ihn werden die Gesamtkräfte des Volkes auf ein Ziel geleitet, dieses Ziel ist aber beim נשיא nicht die Wohlfahrt des Fürsten, sondern die Wohlfahrt des Volkes. Wie bei der Wolke der Erde, kommt durch den rechten Fürsten alle auf ihn vom Volke übertragene Macht und Fülle segnend dem Volke wieder zurück.</p>

They were not pleasing to Him, and He would restore them to emptiness and disorder. When He saw this heavens and earth, they were pleasing to Him.

It rejected the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and Keinan and his counterparts. Therefore it says: “The sons of Yefet, Gomer and Magog” (Genesis 10:2). (The Torah enters into great detail when enumerating the descendants of Noah, but not with the preceding generations.)   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:12), adds to the previous matter. Who are they? What is written beforehand, as it is stated: “She bore him (Ketura bore for Abraham.)  Zimran and Yokshan” (Genesis 25:2). Here, too, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham…the firstborn of Ishmael is Nevayot” (Genesis 25:12–13). They were wicked like them. (The sons of Ishmael were wicked like the sons of Ketura. )   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy [toledot] of Isaac son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:19) adds to the previous matter, to what was written beforehand: “The sons of Ishmael” (Genesis 25:16). Who was it? It was Esau and his sons, for he was a son of Isaac. If so, it may be said that since only “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy” is written, Jacob, too, who was part of the legacy of Isaac, is included with Esau? You find that every [time the word] toledot appears in the Bible it is written defectively, (It is written without a vav between the tav and lamed or without a vav between the dalet  and the tav.)  except for: “This is the legacy [toledot] of the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 2:4), and “this is the legacy [toledot] of Peretz” (Ruth 4:18). And there is a compelling reason why it says: “This is the legacy [toledot] of the heavens and the earth” in full. It is because the Holy One blessed be He created His world and there was no angel of death in the world. That is why it is complete. When Adam and Eve sinned, the Holy One blessed be He minimized all the toledot in the Bible. When Peretz arose, his toledot became full, because the Messiah will emerge from him, in whose days the Holy One blessed be He will eliminate death, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8). That is the reason that toledot of the heavens and earth and toledot of Peretz are full. This is the reason that toledot of Isaac is defective, to exclude Jacob from the category of the wicked. (The Messiah can also be traced back to Jacob, and therefore the word toledot should have been written regarding Isaac with the vav. It is written without the vav as an indication that it is referring only to Esau and not to Jacob. )   Similarly, “this is [eleh] the legacy of Jacob” (Genesis 37:2), it rejected the chieftains of Esau.  Similarly, “these are [ve’eleh] the names of the children of Israel” (Exodus 1:1), adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: The children of Reuben and the children of Simeon. (This is a reference to the listing of the descendants of Jacob who came down to Egypt (see Genesis 46:8–27). )   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Aaron” (Numbers 3:1) adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: “These are the counted, that Moses and Aaron…counted” (Numbers 1:44). Just like those beforehand were righteous, so, too, these were righteous. (Although the verses regarding Aaron proceed to list Nadav and Avihu, who were killed due to the offering of a strange fire before God (see Numbers 3:2–4), on the whole they were still considered righteous. )   Here, too, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances” adds to the previous matter, that which was written beforehand: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances” (Exodus 15:25).  Another matter, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances.” What is written before this portion? “They shall judge the people at all times” (Exodus 18:22). And it says here: “These are the ordinances,” and the [Ten] Commandments are in the middle. This is analogous to a noblewoman who was walking, an armed guard on this side and an armed guard on that side, and she was in the middle. So, too, the [giving of the] Torah had justice before it and justice after it and it was in the middle. Likewise it says: “I walk on the path of righteousness” (Proverbs 8:20). The Torah says: In which path do I walk? I will walk in the path of those who perform righteousness. “In the midst of the paths of justice” (Proverbs 8:20), the Torah in the middle and justice before it and after it; before it, as it is stated: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances,” justice after it, as it is stated: “These are the ordinances.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ספר תולדות אדם, “the book relating the descendants of man.” According to Nachmanides this is an allusion to the entire Torah which is perceived as the ספר תולדות אדם. If it were not so, the Torah should not have used the expression ספר, “book,” but should simply have written אלה תולדות אדם, just as we find in Genesis 25,12 when the descendants of Ishmael are enumerated, or in Genesis 25,19 where the descendants of Yitzchak are listed.   Maybe the meaning of the word ספר in this instance is חכמה, “wisdom,” just as we find it in the ספר יצירה where the expression is ספר וספור as we already mentioned on a previous occasion. The “wisdom” referred to is not ordinary human wisdom but celestial wisdom, a wisdom which would have been man’s had he not sinned. The thrust of our verse then would be: “this book contains the wisdom which should have been an integral part of every human being.” The true descendants of man are not his biological children but his accomplishments in the field of Torah knowledge. The tasks that need to be performed on earth which require a human population could be carried out by someone other than man if need be. This is what Ben Azzai had in mind when he explained that he would not preoccupy himself with marrying and begetting children as his longing was concentrated solely on Torah (Yevamot 63). The complete verse therefore means: “for this book which represents the celestial wisdom, something that ought to belong to every human being seeing he had been created בדמות אלוקים עשה אותו, in the likeness of G’d He made him on the very day that G’d created man.” You will now understand why the Torah saw fit to mention the word אדם twice in this verse.</p>

When a tzaddik loses this ability, he may have to go into hiding to avoid G’d’s wrath against the wicked. This is exemplified by Yaakov hiding in the academy of Shem and Ever, Elijah hiding during a famine, and Yaakov’s partial success in spiritually elevating Esau. Yishmael’s lifespan is mentioned to show that he lived as long as he did due to Yaakov’s merit, indicating that if Yaakov had been able to spiritually awaken him, he would not have needed to hide.</summary>

              <p>‎Genesis 25,17. Concerning Rashi’s comment based on Rabbi ‎Chiya that the reason that the lifetime of Yishmael was listed in ‎the Torah is to show that Yaakov spent 14 years hiding in the ‎academy founded by Shem and subsequently headed by his great-‎grandson Ever; surely it is strange that this piece of information ‎was of such significance that the Torah had to write about it, ‎albeit as an allusion! Why did the Torah not simply write that ‎Yaakov hid there instead of adding a paragraph of seven verses ‎detailing Yishmael’s descendants?! The intention of the Torah ‎was to illustrate the influence of a tzaddik in elevating ‎people in his immediate proximity to a spiritually higher level. It ‎also demonstrates that when a tzaddik loses this ability to ‎elevate his environment spiritually he has to go into hiding ‎instead, as through his failure he arouses G’d’s wrath at the ‎wicked and his remaining in their environment would expose him ‎to the judgment G’d has in store for them. Isaiah 26,20 makes this ‎point when he writes: ‎חבי כמעט רגע וגו'‏‎, “hide for a brief moment ‎and lock the doors behind you!” (Compare the Zohar’s I ‎‎182, comment on this verse) This was also the reason why Elijah ‎hid during the years of famine that he had decreed (Kings I 17,2) ‎so that the ravens had to bring him food. At that time it was ‎beyond Elijah’s powers to spiritually elevate the people of his ‎generation. Eventually, as described in the same Book, Elijah was ‎commanded by G’d to come out of hiding, as by that time the ‎ground had been prepared for his message to resonate among ‎some of the people. His success is recorded in King’s I 18,39, ‎although, alas it was short-lived. It is a fact that for a while at ‎least, Yaakov’s encounter with Esau resulted in a spiritual ‎elevation of his brother Esau, who even wanted to share the world ‎with him. The reason why Yaakov succeeded partially with Esau ‎though failing with Yishmael, was that Esau was his twin brother, ‎as opposed to Yishmael who was only his uncle. [Esau voluntarily ‎vacated the land of Israel (Canaan) in order not to compete with ‎his brother. (Genesis 36,6-8) Ed.] When the Torah lists the years ‎Yishmael lived, it was to inform us that he lived that many years ‎only on account of his nephew Yaakov’s merit. If Yaakov had ‎been able to bring about a spiritual reawakening of his uncle, he ‎would not have had to hide.‎</p>

The term &quot;expiring&quot; is only used in connection with righteous individuals, indicating death without prolonged sickness, while the phrase &quot;gathered to his people&quot; signifies the soul joining the forefathers.

              <p>AND THESE ARE THE YEARS OF THE LIFE OF ISHMAEL. It appears plausible in line with the simple explanation that Scripture relates, in the case of the sons of the righteous, their generations and the number of their years in order to inform us that the seed of the righteous shall be blessed. (See Psalms 112:2.)  However, it did not relate the number of Esau’s years for he outlived Jacob, (See my Hebrew commentary, p. 42, Note 90.)  and the narrative was concluded with the death of Jacob. Hence, Scripture did not want to return to the life of Esau since it had already mentioned his generations in their appropriate place. (Further, Chapter 36.)  In the Midrash of our Rabbis (Megillah 17 a; Bereshith Rabbah 62:8.)  there are many reasons for the Scriptural account of Ishmael’s years. The correct one among them is that he was righteous, a man of repentance, and Scripture tells of him as it does with all righteous people.</p>

              <p>AND HE EXPIRED (‘VAYIGVA’). Rashi comments: “This expression — ‘expiring’ — is only mentioned in the case of righteous people.” But in the Gemara (Baba Bathra 16b. The Gemara (teaching) constitutes the collected discussions of the Amoraim, centering around the Mishnah. The Mishnah and Gemara combined are known as the Talmud.)  the Rabbis objected, “But it says ‘expiring’ with reference to the generation of the flood: And all flesh expired that moved upon the earth, etc., and every man; (Above, 7:21.)  Every thing that is in the earth shall expire.” (Ibid., 6:17.)  And the Gemara answers: “We were referring to [those places where it mentions both] ‘expiring’ and ‘gathering,’” [as it says in the case of Abraham and in the present verse concerning Ishmael]. The intent of the Rabbis is that the expression “expiring” indicates death without prolonged sickness and without pains. This death is merited only by the righteous people, [and concerning their death both “expiring” and “gathering” are mentioned]. But the men of the generation of the flood, who were overthrown as in a moment, and no hands fell upon them, (Lamentations 4:6.)  as also those who died in the desert — with them Scripture therefore mentions only “expiring”: when our brethren expired. (Numbers 20:3.)  And so is the sense of the verse, And that man expired not alone in his iniquity, (Joshua 22:20.)  meaning that his iniquity did not cause him instant death. But when Scripture so mentions the term “expiring” in reference to death together with the word vayei’aseph (and he was gathered [unto his people]) or vayamoth (and he died), it hints to the death of the righteous ones. In the words of Bereshith Rabbah, (62:2.)  “And Abraham expired, and died, (Verse 8 here.)  Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Ilai said, ‘The early pious men used to suffer with intestinal disease for about ten or twenty days before death, thus establishing the principle that illness cleanses from sin.’ Rabbi Yehudah said, ‘All who are said to have expired died of intestinal disease.’” There in Bereshith Rabbah the Rabbis also said, (31:15.)  “Everything that is in the earth ‘yigva’ (Ibid., 6:17.)  — will shrivel.” It would appear that to the Rabbis, the word gviyah (expiring) was analogous to Their flesh shall consume while they stand upon their feet. (Zechariah 14:12.)  So also is the opinion of Onkelos who translated here ve’isnagid, meaning “fainting,” similar to the expressions: “isnagid (he became faint) and sighed”; (Sanhedrin 39a.)  “You might think he may pay as a fine five negidim (emaciated) oxen.” (Baba Kamma 67b. In case of a thief who makes restitution for stolen oxen. See Exodus 21:37. Now “you might think that if he stole an ox worth one hundred (weights in gold or silver) he may pay as a fine five oxen emaciated (‘and in near-dying condition’ - Rashi). It is for this reason that Scripture says (he shall pay five oxen) ‘tachtav’ “ — in its place. In other words each one of the five oxen must be equal in value to the stolen ox, “for otherwise he might pay him back five emaciated oxen which together will not equal even the value of the one stolen” (Meiri, Baba Kamma ibid.).)  It is so said in the case of the flood, as Scripture states, And He blotted out every being. (Above 7:23. Ramban’s intent here is to be understood in the light of what he has written above on that verse: “And He blotted out every living substance…” After having said, And all flesh perished (‘vayigva’), and having said, whatever was in the dry land, died, Scripture continues to say, “And He blotted out, meaning etc.”(see above p. 112). Here in discussing the meaning of the word gviyah. Ramban brings proof to his theory that gviyah in itself does not mean death but fainting, emaciation, etc. For it is on this basis that we can understand why after having said ‘vayigva’ all flesh Scripture continued to inform us further that it died and was blotted out, since these facts are not included in the term of gviyah.)  And in the case of Ishmael it is stated in the verse before us: And he expired and died, as a man who is powerless and dies, and this is the measure (“A measure.” In the Lisbon edition of Ramban: “the death.”)  meted out to righteous people. (For since in the present verse concerning Ishmael it says both “expired” and “died” the reference must be to the death of a righteous person, as explained in the text above. “It is based upon this (double expression) that the Sages of blessed memory have said that Ishmael repented of his evil ways” (Bachya, p. 219 in my edition).)

              <p>ואלה שני חיי ישמעאל, our sages, both in Megillah 17 and Yevamot 64 deal with the reason why the Torah thought it necessary to inform us of Ishmael’s age at his death. According to the plain meaning of the text, the Torah wrote this out of respect for Avraham. Seeing that the Torah had told us of Avraham’s age being 86 when he fathered Ishmael, and it also told us of Ishmael being 13 years of age when he underwent circumcision, it now concludes by telling us Ishmael’s age at his death.

In order to trace through them the years of Jacob (i. e. the years in which the various incidents of his life happened). Calculating from the age of Ishmael (when he died) we may learn that Jacob attended at the School of Eber for fourteen years after he left his father and before he arrived at Laban’s house, for just when Jacob left his father Ishmael died, for it is said, (28:9) ‘‘So Esau went to Ishmael etc.”, as is explained in the Chapter Megilla Nikraath (Megillah 17a) (cf.

    According to the plain meaning of the text the Torah details much about the lives of the righteous, their offspring, etc.; whereas it is sparse with information about the wicked, so that he have no data about how old Esau was when he died, although it is clear that he survived his twin Yaakov. The story of the patriarchs is considered closed with the death of Yaakov, so that no further reference is made to his brother.

              <p>ויגוע, “he died.” Our sages have said that the formula combining ויגוע ויאסף is used only in connection with the righteous. When the term ויגוע is used without the word ויאסף אל עמיו following, this is an indication that the person concerned did not die as a righteous person.
    Nachmanides writes that the reason why the word גויעה means “death” is that it describes death not preceded b terminal sickness. When the word is accompanied further by the word וימת or ויאסף, it means that the individual thus described was a righteous person and that he died suddenly. When death is described as גויעה alone, it means the person concerned was a wicked person. Examples are the death of the people during the generation of the flood, and the death of the Jews in the desert as a result of the sin with the spies.

              <p>ויאסף אל עמיו, “he was gathered in to his people.” Ibn Ezra writes that (according to some) this is a description of the honour being paid to the soul of the deceased. While the relatives are busy with interring the physical remains of the deceased, his soul meanwhile rises to the celestial regions, this being the first time that body and soul are each going their separate ways. Others claim that there is no ulterior meaning to this formulation but that it described the deceased now starting the journey to join his forebears, having already followed in their footsteps while still here on earth. This is what G’d promised Avraham when He said to him: “ואתה תבוא אל אבותיך בשלום, “but you will join your fathers in peace.”(prior to the commencement of the 400 years of being strangers or enslaved, Genesis 15,15)

              <p>“These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham” (Genesis 25:12).  “These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham” – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva and the Rabbis were sitting and finding difficulty [with this passage]: ‘Why did the verse see fit to describe the lineage of the wicked man [Ishmael] here, [as well as his age at death]?’ [Just then] Rabbi Levi passed by. They said: ‘Here comes the master of halakha, let us ask him.’ Rabbi Levi said: ‘It is in order to tell you at what age your ancestor [Jacob] was blessed.’ (From knowing the age of Ishmael when he died (see the next verse), it can be derived that Jacob was sixty-three years old when he received his father’s blessing. See Megilla 17a.)  “These are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years, and he expired and died and he was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:17).  “These are the years of the life of Ishmael” – why did the verse see fit to recount the years of the wicked one here? It is because he came from the far reaches of the desert to perform kindness for his father [in attending his funeral].  “They dwelled from Ḥavila to Shur, that is adjacent to Egypt, all the way to Assyria: he settled among all his brethren” (Genesis 25:18).  “They dwelled from Ḥavila…” – here it says: “he settled [among all his brethren]” [nafal, literally, fell down], but elsewhere it says [of Ishmael]: “He will dwell [yishkon] [among all his brethren]” (Genesis 16:12). The explanation is that all the days our patriarch Abraham was alive – yishkon. When our patriarch Abraham died – nafal. (He fell in stature.)  Before he extended his hand against the Temple – yishkon; once he extended his hand against it (See Psalms 83:3–19.)  – nafal. In this world – yishkon; but in the future – nafal.</p>

Radak also explains the use of different terms to describe death for the wicked and the righteous, with examples from Proverbs and Genesis. Rabbeinu Bahya discusses six different forms of death in the Bible, three for the wicked and three for the righteous, with specific examples from Genesis and Leviticus. Da'at Zekenim suggests that the Torah's wording in Genesis 23:1 and 25:17 regarding the lives of Sarah and Yishmael may hold deeper meaning, possibly indicating their righteousness or penitence.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>חיי שרה, “the lives of Sarah;” according to Rashi all the years that Sarah lived on this earth were equal in the sense that she was a good person during all these years. When we look at the way the Torah describes the years of Yishmael after his death, (Genesis 25,17) the Torah describes them in the same terms, i.e. ואלה שני חיי ישמעאל מאת שנה ושלושים שנה ושבע שנים; does Rashi imply that the Torah compliments Yishmael in the same manner as it complimented Sarah? When we accept that the word ואלה, “and these,” are a hint that he had become a penitent, as Rashi derives from the manner in which his burial is described in the Torah in same verse from the fact that he is described as having been gathered into his forefathers, and we know that a proselyte is considered as if newly born from the day of his conversion, i.e. free from sin, it follows that the years he had lived prior to this have now been converted as a prelude to his conversion, i.e. as part of that conversion process. Another way of explaining the Torah’s wording of the death and burial of Yishmael: the Torah did not preface his death with the unusual words: “and the lives of Sarah were,“ words which alert us that they must have more meaning than the plain text suggests. When Sarah’s death is reported the word חיי, “lives of,” is mentioned twice, not only once. This calls for closer examination. Rashi, therefore was quite correct in alerting his readers to this.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Death is described in six different forms throughout the Bible, three of which are applicable to the wicked and three to the righteous. The three terms applied to a wicked person dying are: מחייה, אבדן, כרת. Death described as מחייה is the worst of the three deaths. It is applied to the deaths of the kind of wicked people who have neither Torah knowledge nor ordinary wisdom to their credit and remained unaware of the Creator and His wonderful deeds. Such people’s death is no different than the death of animals. Their souls perish as absolutely as do their bodies. Proverbs 13,9 ונר רשעים ידעך, “and the lamp of the wicked will be extinguished,” compares the soul of the wicked person to a lamp, explaining that this soul is dependent on the body it inhabits much as the light of a lamp is dependent on its oil supply. When that supply fails the light is extinguished. This group of wicked people has neither reward nor punishment to look forward to ever. [I suppose the reference is to the time of resurrection. Ed.] Examples of such people were the people of the generation who perished during the deluge of whom the sages have said that just as they have been wiped out on earth their life expectancy in the hereafter has also been wiped out (compare Sanhedrin 108). The sages there concentrated on the words וימח את כל היקום, “He erased all creatures” (Genesis 7,23). This line refers to their destruction in this life, whereas the subsequent words וימחו מן הארץ in verse 24 in the same chapter refer to their becoming extinct in any form of life in the future.  The expression אבדן when applied to the death of the wicked refers to such Israelite sinners as died without benefit of having repented their sins prior to their deaths. They are being judged after their physical death in Gehinom; this is the meaning of Leviticus 23,30 והאבדתי את הנפש ההיא. Such a death is worse than the death described by the Torah as כרת. The people guilty of the penalty called כרת are judged and after they have completed whatever length of punishment has been decreed for them, their souls are admitted to the hereafter.   The three types of deaths mentioned in connection with the righteous are:  1) גויעה, אסיפה, ביאה — All three of these types of death are mentioned in connection with Avraham. This means that these three are all of the same category [as Avraham certainly died only once. Ed.] We read in 25,8 ויגוע ויאסף; we also have the Torah telling Avraham about his death in the future where G’d said to him in Genesis 15,15 ואתה תבא אל אבותיך בשלום, “as far as you are concerned you will come to join your fathers in peace.” Expressions of death involving either of the three words mentioned in connection with Avraham apply to the kind of righteous people who transfer to Gan Eden immediately upon the death of their bodies, not having to face any punishment at all. Such a death was the lot of Ishmael, of whom the Torah writes ויגוע וימת ויאסף אל עמיו. Clearly, he had become a penitent.  2) The second type of death involving the righteous is described in the Torah by the word לקיחה, “being taken away.” Such an expression is applied to people who enter Gan Eden while physically alive such as Chanoch (Genesis 5, 24) of whom the Torah wrote: “he was no longer, as G’d had taken him.” The prophet Elijah experienced a similar “death,” as he had told his disciple Elisha (Kings II 2,10) אם תראה אותי לוקח מאתך, “if you will see me taken from you, etc.”   3) The third type of death applicable to the righteous is described as “rest.” This is an expression promising the righteous participation in the resurrection, a time which our sages have described with the words מנוחה or שבת. This promise was applied to Daniel who had been told (Daniel 12,13) ואתה לך לקץ ותנוח ותעמוד לגורלך לקץ הימין, “But you, go on to the end; you shall rest and arise to your destiny at the end of the days.”</p>

              <p>ויהיו חיי שרה מאה שנה ועשרים שנה ושבע שנים .The Torah repeats the word “year” or “years” three times, even though this verse could have been written using the word שנה only once. We encounter a similar “waste” of the word “year” and “years” in Genesis 6,9 in connection with Noach, as well as in connection with בני ישראל, “the Children of Israel” in Numbers 8,19 where that word occurs no fewer than five times We also find such a repetitive use of the word “year” when we are told about Avraham’s death in Genesis 25,7. Even when reporting the death of Ishmael in Genesis 25,17 the word שנה is repeated three times. Some commentators claim that this is a feature of the Holy Tongue, which endeavours to be clear and unambiguous. When a large number of years (unit) is mentioned the word שנה, “year” appears in the singular mode, whereas when less than ten years are mentioned the years appear in the plural mode, i.e. שנים. There is an aggadic approach to these seemingly superfluous words, especially in our verse here (mentioned by Rashi) which sees in the wording an allusion to the fact that Sarah at her death was as pure and beautiful as at 7 or at 20 years respectively. Seeing that the word שנה did not occur at the beginning of the verse, the verse concludes with the summary שני חיי שרה.</p>

Or, compare the standard expression used by the Torah when people die and they join their ancestors in the grave or hereafter, i.e. ויאסף אל עמיו “he was gathered in to his people” (Genesis 25,17 et al).</p>

              <p>HE DID SETTLE. (The verse literally reads: upon the face of his brethren he (or it) fell. I.E. points out that fell must refer to Ishmael’s portion or to Ishmael himself. It may also mean settled.)  The meaning of nafal (fell) is that his portion or his lot fell among his brethren. Or it refers to the fact that most of the Ishmaelites journeyed from place to place. In this case nafal  (That is, it means passed over.)  is like nofel in Thou fallest away (nofel) to the Chaldeans (Jer. 37:13). However, this is a bit far-fetched in view of the fact that his brethren were in the east (v. 6), and Egypt and Asshur are west (This comment presents a problem in view of the fact that Assyria (Asshur) lies east of the land of Israel. Krinsky suggests that Asshur does not refer to the Assyrians but rather to the children of dedan who were Asshurim (v. 3).)  of the land of Israel. (It is hard to believe that they had so large an inheritance. I.E.’s comment applies to all the interpretations of nafal offered up to this point.)  It is possible that this verse deals with Ishmael’s death. He died during the lifetime of his brethren, after he fell. (He fell off a roof or out of a tree and died (Krinsky). This interpretation is possible because we do not know any of the causes of his death. Cohen, on the other hand, suggests that I.E. held that fell means fell dead.)  We do not know the cause of Ishmael’s death.</p>

              <p>Another meaning of the word is “the presence and existence of a person”; comp. “He died in the presence (pene) [i.e., in the lifetime] of all his brethren” (Gen. 25:18); “And in the presence (pene) of all the people I will be glorified” (Lev. 10:3); “He will surely curse thee in thy very presence” (paneka) (Job 1:11). In the same sense the word is used in the following passage, “And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face,” i.e., both being present, without any intervening medium between them. Comp. “Come, let us look one another in the face” (2 Kings 14:8); and also “The Lord talked with you face to face” (Deut. 5:4); instead of which we read more plainly in another place, “Ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude: only ye heard a voice” (ib. 4:12). The hearing of the voice without seeing any similitude is termed “face to face.” Similarly do the words, “And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face” correspond to “There he heard the voice of one speaking unto him” (Num. 7:89), in the description of God’s speaking to Moses. Thus it will be clear to you that the perception of the Divine voice without the intervention of an angel is expressed by “face to face.” In the same sense the word panim must be understood in “And my face (panai) shall not be seen” (Exod. 33:23); i.e., my true existence, as it is, cannot be comprehended.</p>

              <p>“He will be a wild man: His hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him and he will dwell among all his brethren” (Genesis 16:12).  “He will be a wild [pereh] man” – Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This means that everyone else would inhabit settlements, but he would inhabit the wilderness. (The word peleh is used in connection with the wilderness in Jeremiah 2:24: “A wild ass [pereh] accustomed to the wilderness.”)  Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “A wild man” – in its plain sense. Most people plunder wealth, but he plunders people.  “His hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him [kol bo].” Read it as “his dog [kalbo]” – he and a dog are equal; just as the dog eats carcasses, so, too, he eats carcasses.  Rabbi Elazar said: When will it be that “his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him”? It will be with the advent of that man (Nebuchadnezzar.)  in whose regard it is written: “And everywhere the sons of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens dwell, He has given into your hand and set your rule over all of them” (Daniel 2:38). That is what is written: “Concerning Kedar, (Kedar was one of Ishmael’s sons (see Genesis 25:13).)  and concerning the kingdoms of Ḥatzor that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote” (Jeremiah 49:28) – Nebuchadrezzar is written, (With an added vav, so that the last four letters spell atzur, gathered in.)  as he gathered them together in the wilderness and killed them.  “He will dwell among all his brethren” – here it says: “He will dwell [yishkon] [among all his brethren],” but elsewhere it is written “He settled [nafal] (Literally, fell.)  [among all his brethren] (Genesis 25:18). The explanation is that as long as Abraham our patriarch was alive – yishkon. When Abraham died – nafal. (He fell in stature.)  Before he extended his hand against the Temple – yishkon. Once he extended his hand against the Temple (See Psalms 83:7–13.)  – nafal. In this world – yishkon; but in the future – nafal.</p>

              <p>“These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham” (Genesis 25:12).  “These are the descendants of Ishmael son of Abraham” – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ukva and the Rabbis were sitting and finding difficulty [with this passage]: ‘Why did the verse see fit to describe the lineage of the wicked man [Ishmael] here, [as well as his age at death]?’ [Just then] Rabbi Levi passed by. They said: ‘Here comes the master of halakha, let us ask him.’ Rabbi Levi said: ‘It is in order to tell you at what age your ancestor [Jacob] was blessed.’ (From knowing the age of Ishmael when he died (see the next verse), it can be derived that Jacob was sixty-three years old when he received his father’s blessing. See Megilla 17a.)  “These are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred and thirty-seven years, and he expired and died and he was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:17).  “These are the years of the life of Ishmael” – why did the verse see fit to recount the years of the wicked one here? It is because he came from the far reaches of the desert to perform kindness for his father [in attending his funeral].  “They dwelled from Ḥavila to Shur, that is adjacent to Egypt, all the way to Assyria: he settled among all his brethren” (Genesis 25:18).  “They dwelled from Ḥavila…” – here it says: “he settled [among all his brethren]” [nafal, literally, fell down], but elsewhere it says [of Ishmael]: “He will dwell [yishkon] [among all his brethren]” (Genesis 16:12). The explanation is that all the days our patriarch Abraham was alive – yishkon. When our patriarch Abraham died – nafal. (He fell in stature.)  Before he extended his hand against the Temple – yishkon; once he extended his hand against it (See Psalms 83:3–19.)  – nafal. In this world – yishkon; but in the future – nafal.</p>

Concerning Esau it is written: Who eat up My people as they eat bread (Ps. 14:4), while of Jethro it is said: Call him that he may eat bread (Exod. 2:20). It is written about Esau: And he feared not God (Deut. 25:18), but about Jethro it is written: And thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear God (Exod. 18:21). It is stated about Esau that he abolished the sacrifices (when Rome destroyed the Second Temple), but of Jethro it is said: And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices (ibid., v. 12). Esau heard of their troubles and attacked them, as it is said: Because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tried the Lord (ibid. 17:7), and it is written elsewhere: And Amalek came.

This spirit of uncleanliness is compared to a bubbling spring, in contrast to the pure spirit of Torah study. The pleasure derived from idle speech and levity is greater than that from other sins because of the strength of this unclean spirit.

              <p>[It seems apt to explain &quot;fall&quot; instead of &quot;will fall&quot; according to what the GRA has written on Mishlei 1:23 in connection with men of levity: &quot;They have a great lust to speak idle talk and levity even though they have no bodily pleasure therefrom. For with every thing that a man does he is given a spirit from on high. And this spirit does not rest until it does other such things, wherefrom he has pleasure — both in an act of mitzvah or in an act of sin. And this is the intent of Avoth 4:2: 'A sin begets a sin and a mitzvah begets a mitzvah.' And the greater the sin, the greater the spirit that it begets, and the more it lusts for more sin. Correspondingly, with a great mitzvah. A spirit comes from a very holy place and lusts greatly for that mitzvah and has great pleasure in that mitzvah. And it is known that the greatest mitzvah of all is Torah study, and, conversely, [the greatest sin of all,] idle speech and levity, which is the opposite of Torah. Therefore, there is more pleasure in idle speech and levity than in all other sins, even though there is no worldly [i.e., bodily] pleasure in this. But [the pleasure arises from the fact that] the spirit of uncleanliness is extremely great, like a 'bubbling spring,' as opposed to the [pure spirit of] Torah, which is [also] a 'bubbling spring.'&quot; And it is known that the spirit of uncleanliness created by the sin, itself punishes the doer, after his death, in Gehinnom, wherefore Chazal have said &quot;fall into Gehinnom&quot; [rather than &quot;will fall&quot;]. For at the very utterance of the levity the great spirit of uncleanliness hovers above him. And he actually falls [that is, &quot;dwells,&quot; as in (Bereshith 25:18): 'In the presence of all his brothers, he fell' (i.e., dwelt)] in Gehinnom in his lifetime, G-d forbid, (as written in Nefesh Hachaim, Gate One, Chapter 12. And their second apothegm is also to be explained along these lines.)]</p>

The verb נפל has here the same meaning as in אל הכשדים אתה נופל thou fallest away to the Chaldӕans (Jer. 37:13); and in על פני כל אחיו נפל he surrendered to all his brethren (Gen. 25:18); namely: to submit to the authority of.

                <h4>Simchat HaRegel on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, First Fruits Declaration 6:10</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Zayin - Besides the reasons for Pesach offering and circumcision, there is yet another explanation for the order of the Passover and circumcision. I read it in a letter by Echad Kadosh. (Literally “the holy one.” Echad Kadosh refers to a scholar well known to Chida. I was not able to identify the scholar who is quoted here.)  It goes like this: In Shemot Rabbah the sages comment on the verse, ““I am Adonai your God;” (Ex. 20:2) on this condition, I took you out of Egypt.” (Exodus Rabbah 29:3)  This would appear to be the opposite of what the sages stated elsewhere where they said, “This is one major reservation to the fulfillment of the Torah…” (See BT Shabbat 88a The first statement suggests we are obligated because God redeemed us while the second statement suggests that because we were forced to accept the Torah at threat of life, then our obligation is questionable.)  The Rashba (Shlomo ben Avraham ibn Aderet (1235 – 1310) was a medieval rabbi, halakhist, and Talmudist. He is widely known by the Rashba acronym of his title and name: Rabbi Shlomo ben Avraham.)   writes, because of this the people of Israel were punished when they received the Torah that the land would be given on condition (that they observe it). (Possibly they were supposed to receive the Torah unconditionally but because they sinned (at the Golden Calf) they were given the land conditionally based on their allegiance to the Torah.)  Where is this condition found in the Torah? God swore to our ancestors that He would give the land to our offspring unconditionally. Rabbi Moshe Alsheikh (Moshe Alshich, (1508–1593), known as the Alshich Hakadosh (the Holy), was a prominent rabbi, preacher, and biblical commentator part of the sixteenth century.)  adds that God did not give the Torah to our ancestors as an inheritance but as a gift. Gifts can have an expiration date in which the giver says, “And afterwards it shall be bequeathed to another person…” This is not sufficient explanation: first, “a set period” is not found in connection with Israel living in the land; if it was only given to them for a defined period of time it would have been specified in the Torah. Furthermore in Parshat Lech Lecha we read, “I assign the land you and your offspring after you sojourn in...as an eternal possession...” (Gen. 17:8) However it is possible that the conditional nature of the land was hinted at in the last part of the verse, “...and I will be your God,” (Gen. 17:8) In other words: I will give them the land on the condition that I continue to be their God. In this connection it is stated, “And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them…” (Jos 5:4) But this is difficult because this is speaking about circumcision and Abraham had already acquired the land (before circumcision) as it states, “Rise up and travel throughout the land…” (Gen. 13:17) and later in the Covenant of the Pieces, it states, “On that day God made a covenant with Abram…” (Gen. 25:18) (The whole verse: On that day Adonai made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your offspring I assign this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:)  There is no mention there of any conditions for possession of the land nor is possession given to anyone else. Further, even if we say that in the Covenant of the Pieces, the land was given on condition, why was it necessary to mention it again in connection with circumcision, “I gave the land to you and your offspring afterwards ....” The sages give a reason why the Exodus is mentioned several different times; One reason appears in Ketubot 44a regarding contracts: Rav Naḥman said: When two documents that are produced one after the other, the second nullifies the first....if he added a palm tree to it, he wrote it as an addition.” If he wants to collect one of them he may do so; if he wants to collect the other, he may do so. Similarly, iIn the Covenant of the Pieces, God gave the land to the people on the condition that they be in exile 400 years, as stated, “Know well that Your offspring shall be strangers in a land…400 years.” (Gen. 15:13) However when the circumcision was performed God returned and gave the land to Abraham and did not mention the condition of exile. He then gave the land to them as an inheritance but God did mention a condition, “that I shall be your God.” The intention in these two promises was that if they wanted one they could collect one and if they wanted the other they could collect the other. (In other words - either they could inherit the land after 400 years or they could inherit through circumcision by making God their God.)  The reason, then, for the premature Exodus was in fulfillment of the statement, “And when you have freed the people from Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain.” (Ex. 3:12) Israel was “one nation living in another nation,” both nations being idolaters. Because they would have to suffer the pain of subjugation for 400 years and this was very difficult, they accepted the other condition, circumcision, in which God made a condition, “I will be to them a God,” without continuing subjugation.</p>

              <p>ALTHOUGH AVRAHAM IS THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER OF ISRAEL, THE DIVERSE TRADITIONS about him which have been collected and connected to form a cycle of stories give evidence of much more. The cycle portrays an active Homo religiosis who converses with God, sometimes with an air of doubt and questioning, who proclaims God’s name at various sacred sites, who is concerned about justice and the treatment of the oppressed, and who makes dramatic life decisions without flinching. The stories thus reveal struggle, despite the fact that Avraham often appears to be the “perfect” man, always obeying God’s bidding and prospering. Buber (1982), noting the unifying effect of the verb “see” throughout the cycle, understood Avraham as the father of the Prophets of Israel (formerly called “seers”). He also viewed the cycle as based around the series of tests that Avraham must undergo, tests quite different, we might add, from the labors of Hercules and other such ancient challenges. Other than “see,” a number of leading-words launch the major concerns of the Patriarchs: “bless,” “seed,” and “land.” At the same time the cycle contains previously encountered motifs, albeit with interesting refinements: punishment for sin (this time, with human questioning), intimacy with God (here through visions), and sibling rivalry (with more complex results than murder). Above all we note the singling out of one man to perform the will of God, a man very different from the rather passive Noah. Avraham stands at the core of the entire book of Genesis, as his experiences will in many ways be reflected in those who follow him. At the core of both the book and the cycle looms the disturbing Chapter 22, which brings together and resolves, for the moment, the major themes encountered so far.</p>
