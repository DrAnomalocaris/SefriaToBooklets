      "Rabbi Yehoshua validates offerings made by a priest later found to be disqualified due to flawed lineage, as God accepts the work of a priest's hands after the fact. The blessing of the tribe of Levi in Deuteronomy 33:11 is interpreted to include even the service of those deemed profane, and the priesthood is voided retroactively for those disqualified from Temple service. The work of a Levite is valid regardless of lineage, as all descendants of Levi are included. Bringing incense leads to wealth, as indicated by the blessing in Deuteronomy 33:11, and even those with physical limitations are encouraged to participate in Temple service.\n",

      "Benjamin, the tribe of Benjamin, was privileged to host the Divine Presence as the Temple was built in his territory, with the Holy of Holies located within his portion. This unique sanctity led Benjamin to desire to absorb the strip of land where the altar was built, causing a dispute with the tribe of Judah over ownership. The Divine Presence rested in the portion of Benjamin in various locations, including Shiloh, Nov, Gibeon, and the Eternal House. The Sages also noted that Benjamin, along with other select individuals, was exempt from the decay of worms after death. Benjamin's hosting of the Divine Presence was emphasized in various blessings and traditions, highlighting his special role in Jewish history and religious practice.\n",

Rabbi Yoḥanan cured his bulmos by eating ripe figs from the east side of a tree, as they ripen first there due to the sun. The Talmud also mentions that fruits grown in a place facing the sun are considered more precious.\n",
      "(33, 15)\n",
      "The Jerusalem Talmud discusses the location of sacred structures in the land of Benjamin, specifically mentioning the Tabernacle and Temple. It notes that although the Temple is associated with Judah, it was actually located in Benjamin, with the altar situated at the border between Benjamin and Joseph. The text also mentions the consumption of sacrificial meat in Joseph's part, emphasizing the importance of Joseph in the divine dwelling.\n",
      "(33, 16)\n",
      "Rabbi Yosei interprets Moses' blessing to Joseph as a reference to offerings of lesser sanctity being consumed among the haters near Shiloh, while the Jerusalem Talmud discusses the location of the Temple in Benjamin's territory and the consumption of sacral meat in Joseph's part. The text also mentions the altar being situated on the border between Benjamin and Joseph, with the Divine Presence dwelling in the greatness of Joseph.\n",

Bava Kamma 2b:4 explains the concept of goring using horns. Bava Kamma 17a:10 and 17a:11 discuss the rewards associated with Joseph and Issachar. Berakhot 56b:15 advises reciting a specific verse upon dreaming of an ox to prevent negative outcomes.\n",

      "Zebulun questioned why he received mountains and seas while his brothers received fields and vineyards, but God assured him that his territory would be valuable due to the ḥilazon and other resources found there. God promised that anyone who took these resources without permission would not prosper in their business.\n",

      "The Sages of the school of Rabbi Sheila emphasize that even someone who received the Torah directly from God like Moses will not be unpunished if they engage in sexual intercourse with an adulteress. It is considered disrespectful to God if one does not take three steps backward after prayer or recite \"Peace,\" with specific bowing gestures. The Torah scroll should be handled and rolled with specific care, with the right hand only, to show honor. The Torah was given with the right hand, and it is emphasized that studying the Torah for its own sake is crucial. The Torah was described as white fire engraved in black fire, a fiery law given by God. The Jewish people are compared to fire in their nature, and the Torah was given to them to humble and guide them. Rabbi Akiva avoided a mistake by interpreting a verse to understand God's uniqueness among angels. The Torah was given to the Jewish people, and the money of gentile nations appeared at that time. The nations cannot claim they were never offered the Torah, as references to its giving are found in different locations. The right hand is associated with the Torah, while the left hand is connected to phylacteries. Vengeance for good and evil is mentioned in verses, emphasizing divine justice. The right hand should not be used for certain actions due to its significance in Torah-related practices.\n",

      "Moses was buried in the portion of Gad, a distance of four miles from the portion of Reuben, and was carried by God Himself. The Torah study is not interrupted until the soul departs from a dying person, as seen when Rabbi Akiva continued teaching until his son's death, emphasizing the importance of honoring the dead. Moses is considered righteous for causing others to be righteous, while Jeroboam is blamed for causing others to sin. Moses is also associated with being the inscriber in the Torah.\n",

      "In the Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 10:2:17, it is explained that Moses was instructed to appoint judges to execute sinners among the Israelites, resulting in 157,200 people being killed. When a man brought a Midianite woman before Moses, Phineas took action by killing them both with a spear, leading to six miracles occurring, including the prevention of the bodies separating, the spear going into the woman's belly, and the plague being stopped when Phineas prayed.\n",

      "Rebbi Tanḥum states four conditions for collecting grasses and relieving oneself, while Rebbi Aqiba identifies lakes in the land of Naftali. The cup of Grace should be full, decorated, and washed according to Rebbi Aḥa, and Rabbi Yoḥanan states that reciting a blessing over a full cup leads to a boundless inheritance. The tribe of Naphtali received additional land near the Sea of Tiberias for fishing, as mentioned in various texts.\n",

      "The Gemara discusses the tribal portion of Asher where oil flows abundantly, as seen when a gentile messenger was sent to bring one million maneh worth of oil. The text also delves into the number of nails permissible on shoes, with different opinions ranging from five to thirteen, and the rules regarding scraping, anointing, and walking in new boots or sandals on the Sabbath. Additionally, a homily on Ecclesiastes 12:11 emphasizes the importance of clear and sweet words in Torah study.\n",
      "(33, 25)\n",
      "It is forbidden to wear nail-studded work-boots on the Sabbath, but shoes decorated with nails are permitted. Different opinions exist on the number of nails that constitute a decoration, with Rebbi Hanina suggesting seven, Rebbi Aha suggesting nine, and Rebbi putting thirteen on one shoe and eleven on the other. It is permitted to put all nails on one sandal or boot. Scuffing old boots or sandals is prohibited, but oiling or dipping them in water is allowed. Anointing one's foot in a boot or sandal is not permitted, but oiling the foot before putting on footwear is allowed.\n",
      "(33, 26)\n",
      "In the Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 4:2:12, three scrolls were found in the Temple courtyard, with discrepancies in the text that were resolved by confirming two versions and annulling one. The Chagigah 12b:14 commentary discusses the heavenly beings and God's dwelling in the Aravot, connecting it to the concept of \"heaven\" through a verbal analogy.\n",
      "(33, 27)\n",
      "In Tractate Soferim 6:4, three Torah scrolls were found in the Temple court with variations in text, leading to the adoption of readings from two scrolls and discarding the reading from one. In Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 4:2:12, similar variations were found in three scrolls, leading to the same outcome. In Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:1:3, Rebbi Abba discusses the creation of the world from water to land. Jerusalem Talmud Makkot 3:13:2 discusses the theological significance of God's omnipresence. In Chagigah 12b:2, Rabbi Yosei discusses the elements the world stands upon. In Chullin 89a:9, it is suggested that the world endures in the merit of those who restrain themselves during quarrels and render themselves as if they were non-existent.\n",

      "Rava explains that when Israel dwells in wealth and prominence, their solitude will be one of safety, but if they reject God's directive and learn from gentiles, their solitude will be one of sorrow. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina states that Moses issued decrees for the Jewish people to reach a spiritual level like Jacob, but these were later revoked by prophets like Amos who pointed out their shortcomings.\n",
      "(33, 29)\n",
      "Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said delighting in Shabbat rescues from exile, citing Isaiah 58:14 and Deuteronomy 33:29. Rav said God grants desires to those who delight in Shabbat, citing Psalms 37:4. Delighting in Shabbat can be with simple items like beets and fish. In Megillah, Mordecai refuses to ride a horse prepared by Haman due to fasting, kicking him instead, citing Proverbs 24:17 and Deuteronomy 33:29. In Berakhot, verses from Deuteronomy emphasize the greatness and closeness of Israel to God.\n",
      "(33, 4)\n",
      "The Torah is compared to the betrothed bride of the Jewish people until one studies it and consummates his marriage with it, as stated in Deuteronomy 33:4 (Pesachim 49b:10, Berakhot 57a:4). Torah is considered an inheritance for the Jewish people, with 613 mitzvot corresponding to the number of a person's limbs, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 33:4 (Sanhedrin 59a:2, Makkot 23b:18). Withholding halakha from being studied is likened to robbing someone of their ancestral inheritance (Sanhedrin 91b:18). Torah is seen as a source of wisdom, understanding, and a place in the World-to-Come in various dream interpretations (Berakhot 57a:4).\n",
      "(33, 5)\n",
      "The Gemara discusses the requirement of ten verses for the Remembrances and Shofarot prayers on Rosh Hashanah, noting that there are only three verses related to Kingship in the Torah. Rabbi Yosei suggests including four verses, including the three related to Kingship and a concluding one.\n",
      "(33, 6)\n",
      "The Talmud discusses the connection between the blessings of Reuben and Judah in Moses' blessing of the tribes, linking them to the concept of resurrection of the dead. Reuben's blessing is interpreted as living in this world and not dying in the World-to-Come, while Judah's blessing is connected to the idea of awakening at the end of days. The text also mentions examples of declarations that take effect even if stated conditionally, such as Judah's request to take Benjamin to Egypt. Additionally, it discusses prayers for those who descended alive into the pit, with Moses and Hannah being mentioned as having prayed for them.\n",
      "(33, 7)\n",
      "Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani explains that the connection between the blessings of Reuben and Judah lies in the prayers of Moses, as Judah's confession led to Reuben's confession, ultimately granting Judah access to the heavenly study hall. Moses' prayers for Judah's understanding of Torah matters and ability to contend with adversaries were also answered, allowing Judah to join the other righteous people in Heaven. This is exemplified by the verse in Deuteronomy 33:7 where Judah's hands contend for him.\n",
      "(33, 9)\n",
      "Ravina discussed the tribe of Levi, specifically mentioning that some members engaged in idol worship and were killed by their relatives, as indicated in Deuteronomy 33:9. (Yoma 66b:16)\n",
      "(34, 1)\n",
      "Moses was physically strong until his death, able to ascend Mount Nebo in one step, and died in the portion of Reuben. The boundaries of Eretz Yisrael include any area shown to Moses before his death, as described in Deuteronomy 34:1-3.\n",

      "(34, 12)\n",
      "In Menachot 30a:3, the discussion is about finishing a Torah scroll in the middle of a column, with different opinions on where certain words may be written. In Tractate Soferim 9:7, specific rules are given regarding the size of certain Hebrew letters in the Torah. The Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 4:5:2 discusses the timeline of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments and breaking the tablets. Avot DeRabbi Natan 2:3 explains how Moses added an extra day of purity for the Israelites before receiving the Torah, and the subsequent actions he took were in accordance with God's will. In Avot DeRabbi Natan 2:7, the Writings are said to warn against heresy and the dangers of associating with wicked individuals or prostitutes.\n",
      "(34, 4)\n",
      "Rabbi Simlai taught that there are 613 mitzvot in the Torah, with 365 prohibitions corresponding to days in the solar year and 248 positive mitzvot to a person's limbs. Rebbi Zeïra in the Jerusalem Talmud prohibits relieving oneself in a cemetery, citing Proverbs 17:5. Rabbi Yonatan in the Talmud discusses how the dead converse with each other based on Deuteronomy 34:4.\n",
      "(34, 5)\n",
      "Moses died and was born on the seventh of Adar, with his death being compared to a divine kiss, just like Miriam's. Moses' greatness is emphasized through his ability to forge compromises between God and the Jewish people. There is a dispute over whether Moses wrote the entire Torah or only part of it, with some attributing the last eight verses to Joshua. Moses, Aaron, and Miriam were spared the Angel of Death, dying instead by the mouth of the Lord. Moses' soul was taken by God with a kiss and stored under the Throne of Glory, along with the souls of all the righteous. The Angel of Death could not find Moses after his soul was taken, as he was stored away for the World to Come.\n",
      "(34, 6)\n",
      "Moses was the only one involved in transporting Joseph's bones, indicating his greatness, and God Himself buried Moses, as seen in Deuteronomy. The location of Moses' grave remains unknown, fulfilling the verse in Deuteronomy. The attributes of God, such as clothing the naked and visiting the sick, should be emulated by humans. The Torah begins and ends with acts of kindness, as shown in Genesis and Deuteronomy. Joseph and Moses were both praised for their actions, with God ultimately being the greatest.\n",
      "(34, 7)\n",
      "Moses was physically strong despite the statement that he could no longer go out and come in, as evidenced by his ability to ascend Mount Nebo in one step. A nest found on a person's head is considered as being on the ground for the mitzva of sending away the mother bird, as indicated by the verse \"earth upon his head.\" The existence of Moses before his birth is alluded to in the Torah through the word \"beshaggam,\" which has the same numerical value as the name Moshe, and he lived a total of 120 years.\n",
      "(34, 8)\n",
      "Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi instructed to reconvene study sessions after thirty days of mourning, following the example of the mourning for Moses. The mourning period is derived from various biblical references, such as the mourning for Samuel, the anointing oil, and the days of isolation for the dead. The mourning for Aaron for thirty days was due to his fair judgments and ability to bring peace, leading to many children being named after him. Aaron's mourning was more intense than Moses', as Aaron's actions were seen as more impactful.\n",
      "(33, 3)\n",
      "Moses asked God to exempt Torah scholars from paying taxes and to allow them to be exclusively under His authority, as indicated in Deuteronomy 33:3. Torah scholars are described as those who travel extensively to study and discuss God's teachings.\n",
      "(34, 3)\n",
      "Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi believed the Temple would be rebuilt between Judah and Benjamin and wanted to prepare the fields of Jericho for this. The Kenites, descendants of Moses' father-in-law, ate the produce there. The descendants of Jethro were supported through charity until they went to Jabez to study Torah and became a people of God under the guidance of a righteous man named Jabez.\n",
      "(34, 9)\n",
      "Rava asked Rabba bar Mari about the saying that gratitude for wine should go to the one who pours it, which is derived from God transferring authority from Moses to Joshua. Even though Moses was just a conduit for God's spirit to Joshua, he received credit for it.\n"

There is controversy over the vocalization of the name Yissokhor in Genesis 30:18, with some advocating for the reading of Yissoskhor. The blessings of the tribes highlight the unique roles of each tribe in the future of Israel. Issachar is symbolized as a strong-boned donkey bearing the Torah, supported by Zebulun in Torah study. Leah\\'s use of mandrakes led to the birth of Issachar and Zebulun, with Issachar becoming a Torah personality consulted on halakha. Radak notes that Issachar is spelled with two unpronounced letters, similar to other names like \"Maḥṣerim\" and \"Yir’iyyah.\" The birth of Judah and Issachar from Leah symbolize praise to the Lord and engaging in noble works, with Judah representing thankfulness and Issachar representing labor and reward for noble deeds.

Marital sexual union should be characterized by love and devotion to avoid flaws and imperfections in children, with the importance of achieving sexual union with complete love emphasized (Halakhah). Netzach and Hod correspond to the two lips and are represented by irrigation-troughs of water, irrigated by the Middle Pillar symbolizing the covenant (Kabbalah).

Jacob's vow to tithe all he would receive serves as support for the obligation to fulfill vows, even if not yet acted upon, as exemplified by a comparison to a nazirite vow made before death. God reminded Jacob of his unfulfilled vow, prompting him to go to Beth-El and build an altar to fulfill it. Jacob's dealings with Laban were not completely righteous, but what stood for him was the promise made to Abraham.

The Aramaic Targum and Gemara discuss the divine exchange of fetuses between Rachel and Leah, challenging the idea that giving birth confers motherhood status. In Kabbalah, Zevul symbolizes grouping and connection, with Dinah representing Kinghood. In Midrash, Leah's prayers for a female child were answered with Dinah's birth, fulfilling the matriarchs' desire for enough males.

       "  31.0): \"Jacob explained to Laban that he fled out of fear of losing his family and possessions, refuting Laban's accusation that he stole the idols to hide his whereabouts. Laban searched for the idols in Jacob's tents but found them in Rachel's tent, where they miraculously transformed into jugs to spare her embarrassment due to her menstrual cycle (Bereshit Rabbah 74:9). Jacob expressed his fear of being separated from his wives and children if he had informed Laban of his departure (Onkelos Genesis 31:31; Targum Jonathan on Genesis 31:31).\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  32.0): \"Jacob cursed the one who stole the teraphim, leading to Rachel's death on the way. Some commentators suggest Jacob meant the thief deserved the death penalty, while others emphasize his integrity in allowing Laban to search for the stolen items. Jacob did not know Rachel was the thief and would have handled the situation differently if he had known. Laban's accusations were seen as false by Jacob, who denied any wrongdoing. The law in the Torah opposes love and hate, with examples from Yaakov's preference for Rachel over Leah and Joseph over his other sons, causing family grief and long-term consequences. Yaakov tells Laban that whoever has his gods will not live, and instructs Laban to search for them, being unaware that Rachel had taken the gods.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  33.0): \"Laban searched the tents of Jacob, Leah, and the two maidservants, with Rachel's tent searched last due to suspicion of theft. Jacob had separate tents for each wife, reflecting the allowance for multiple wives as long as they are provided for. In the Midrash, Rachel hides Laban's idols in the camel's saddle, claiming menstruation as an excuse. Radak explains that married couples had separate living quarters in ancient times, as seen with Leah calling Jacob to her tent. The Second Temple commentary highlights the soul-dwelling of the Practiser being full of real things, not idols, and Rachel representing sense-perception sitting on idols. Targum notes that Laban found nothing in Rachel's tent after searching through the others.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  34.0): \"Rachel hid Laban's household idols in the cushion of the camel as she sat on them, leading Laban to search the tent in Genesis 31:32-34. In Mishnah Bava Metzia and Mishnah Kelim, it is discussed when setting prices for future delivery of produce is permissible, and in Targum, it is mentioned that Rachel hid the idols in the camel's saddle-pillow.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  35.0): \"Rachel's apology to Laban for not rising before him was likely due to the isolation and restrictions placed on menstruating women in ancient times, as they were considered ritually impure and harmful. Laban's silence in response to Rachel's explanation further indicates the avoidance of conversation with menstruating women. Rachel's reluctance to admit to stealing Laban's idols was likely due to the shame associated with such an act. The Torah provides remedies against the yetzer hara and discusses impurities in men and women, with circumcision symbolizing purification from impurities. Jacob gained wealth through successful breeding of sheep and Rachel stole Laban's idols to prevent him from finding Jacob. The Talmud and Nachmanides discuss the practice of quarantining menstruating women due to the belief that their breath was harmful, with Rabbi Yochanan forbidding certain interactions with them. In the Second Temple period, women were shown to follow customs more closely than men, as seen in Rachel's excuse for not rising before her father. Rav Ashi explains the Persian term for a menstruating woman is derived from the Hebrew phrase used by Rachel in Genesis 31:35. Rachel's explanation to Laban about her menstrual cycle is also found in the Targum [Onkelos Genesis 31:35; Targum Jonathan on Genesis 31:35].\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  36.0): \"Jacob allowed Laban to search for stolen gods, but became angry when nothing was found, accusing Laban of unjust pursuit and changing wages. The Divine quality of Dread of Yitzchak supported Jacob in the conflict, contrasting his anger with Laban to David's gentleness towards Saul in the Midrash. Rashi, Rashbam, Radak, and Ibn Ezra provide interpretations of terms used in various biblical passages, while the Targum depicts Jacob questioning Laban's pursuit in Genesis 31:36.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  37.0): \"Yaakov confronts Laban about accusations of theft, insisting on his innocence and demanding his own people be present to identify any stolen items, showing a combative nature. Rabbi Azarya contrasts this with David's descendants, known for their humility. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Laban's request for Jacob to search for stolen goods among his possessions to determine the truth.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  38.0): \"Jacob defends himself against Laban's accusations of theft by highlighting his honesty, integrity, and adherence to moral behavior and Torah principles, pointing out that he never ate the male sheep he tended, ensured no miscarriages in the flock, and did not steal anything over the twenty years he worked for Laban. Midrash texts praise Jacob's righteousness compared to Laban's deceitful actions, discussing the merit of the patriarchs in Jacob's dealings with Laban. Nachmanides suggests that Jacob took on Rachel's duties out of love for her, and the Talmud interprets Jacob's distinction between rams and younger lambs as defining a day-old ram as a ram. Targum texts reiterate Jacob's faithfulness in caring for Laban's flock without any wrongdoing.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  40.0): \"Jacob endured extreme weather conditions while tending Laban's flock, sacrificing sleep to protect the animals, likened to a consuming fire. Workers should be diligent like Jacob, and a prayer leader, chazan, safeguards congregations during prayers. Light was the first directive to remove darkness and establish coherent activity, dividing day and night naturally. The Liturgy conveys anguish and distress through imagery of crying and oppressive heat. Jacob blessed his sons after facing trials and sought God's sufficiency to end his troubles. Understanding Cleanliness leads to Watchfulness and Zeal, with knowledge of Mitzvot details essential. Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rashi, and Da'at Zekenim provide interpretations of various texts. Abaye challenges Rava about a paid bailee's obligation, citing Jacob's statement to Laban. Both Targums on Genesis 31:40 describe Jacob's harsh conditions.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  43.0): \"Laban expressed compassion towards his family, claiming ownership of everything, including Jacob's flocks, and hinting at his desire for Jacob not to take additional wives, while acknowledging he could not harm his own family. The Midrash and Musar discuss the concept of family relationships and spiritual levels, while the Commentary and Second Temple texts highlight Laban's possessiveness and pride. The Talmud questions the basis for considering grandchildren as children, potentially derived from Laban's statements, and the Tanakh and Targum emphasize Laban's claim of ownership over Jacob's family and possessions.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  44.0): 'Laban suggests establishing a covenant with Jacob as a witness, using a stone as a pillar to endure throughout their lifetime. The covenant is meant to prevent harm and establish God as a witness. In Kabbalah, fulfilling godly work is compared to a stable pillar, necessary to avoid evil. Midrash discusses how covenants made by ancestors protected their descendants, and the importance of resolving disputes. In the Tanakh, God establishes a covenant with Abraham requiring circumcision. Targums mention the making of a pact between two parties with God as a witness.',\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  45.0): \"Jacob set up a pillar as a lasting symbol to commemorate his agreement and friendship with Laban, using stones to create a monument as a witness against any harm towards each other. Laban claimed Jacob's daughters and sons as his own, leading to a discussion in the Midrash about the relationship between Jacob and his sons and the significance of the stones used in the monument. The Targum simply states that Jacob erected a monument by setting up a stone pillar.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  46.0): 'Laban\\'s brothers, likely his kinsmen, made a symbolic stone-heap with Jacob as a sign of their covenant, possibly due to idolatrous beliefs. Laban invoked Mercy and Justice in the agreement, referring to Jacob\\'s sons as his brothers to emphasize their companionship. The covenant was made to prevent the Israelites from taking possession of Edom, with Laban claiming all the boys and girls as his children. Esau was asked to sell his birthright immediately and then eat to confirm the sale, similar to Jacob and Laban\\'s non-aggression pact. Jacob used the \"Heap\" as a witness in his dispute with Laban, highlighting the importance of intentions and the mind as a witness.',\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  49.0): \"The stone set up by Jacob was called Mitzpah to symbolize divine supervision over their agreement, as seen in the Jewish Thought commentary using ellipsis to explain verses implying corporeality when referring to God. In the Midrash, Laban and Jacob gave different names to the pile of stones as a witness to their agreement, emphasizing the importance of the Persian language in the Torah. Quoting commentary highlights Jacob's recognition of the place conducive to prophecy and perception, while Targum translations also focus on the concept of divine supervision over their relationship.\",\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  50.0): 'Ibn Ezra interprets \"afflict my daughters\" as not doing anything evil to them or forcing them to do things against their will, while Sforno, Radak, and Chizkuni suggest different interpretations of the term \"afflict.\" In Halakhah, the term \"ona\" has three meanings, and a husband being a philanderer must divorce his wife if witnesses confirm the behavior. In Midrash, Jethro compelled Moses to take an oath, similar to Laban\\'s warning to Jacob, and Jacob\\'s refusal to be comforted after Joseph\\'s disappearance was due to his belief that the tribal covenant had been broken. In quoting Commentary, Rabbeinu Bahya explains the significance of the use of the words Hashem and Elohim in the Torah, while the Talmud discusses affliction in the context of marital relations based on Laban\\'s warning to Jacob. Finally, both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize that God will be the witness between Laban and Jacob if Laban mistreats or marries additional wives.',\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  51.0): 'In Genesis 31:51, Laban falsely takes credit for the pillar and pile of stones set up by Jacob, with the word \"yariti\" indicating the act of casting stones to form a heap. The Midrash discusses the covenant between Laban and Jacob, David\\'s actions against the Arameans, Edomites, and Moavites, and David\\'s humility before the Sanhedrin. Ibn Ezra and Ramban provide interpretations of the use of \"heap\" and \"shooter of arrows\" in different contexts. The Targum mentions Laban using the mound and monument as a boundary marker.',\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  53.0): 'The text discusses Jacob swearing by the God of his father Isaac, while Laban referred to the God of Nahor, indicating their different religious beliefs and the sacredness of the term \"God\" in reference to Jacob\\'s deity. The inheritance of the quality of terror by the children of Israel and the Divine quality of Dread of Yitzchak aided Jacob against Laban. In various commentaries and interpretations, the behavior and beliefs of Jacob, Laban, and their respective ancestors are analyzed, highlighting their different traits and influences. The Targum states that Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac, while Laban referred to the God of Abraham and the god of Nahor in their dispute.',\n",
       " ('31',\n",
       "  54.0): 'Jacob prepared a festive meal for Lavan and his companions symbolizing peace, with Rashi explaining he slaughtered animals and Siftei Chakhamim clarifying \"bread\" as food in general. A priest with a permanent blemish is prohibited from serving in the Temple, per Leviticus 21:17, while temporary blemishes are exempt. Midrash uses biblical figures to show success is not guaranteed, with Laban depicted as insincere. Representatives of the people eat and drink as part of a vision of God on Mount Sinai, following a customary practice. Jacob offered sacrifices and food to his kinsmen on the mountain.',\n",
       " ('32',\n",
       "  1.0): 'Laban\\'s departure after blessing his family shows his lack of sentimentality, leading to robbers vandalizing his house; Jacob encounters angels on his journey home. The term \"halak\" denotes various movements, including Jacob\\'s journey. Jacob takes an oath by the Fear of Isaac, distinguishing between different gods. Laban kisses and blesses Jacob\\'s family before leaving in the morning.',\n",
       " ('50',\n",
       "  26.0): \"The Patriarchal Narratives in Genesis focus on themes of God's promises and blessings, with God guiding the patriarchs and fulfilling his promises through symbolic numbers and foreshadowing the Exodus of the Israelites. The narratives also emphasize human fecundity and continuity, highlighting the tension and threats faced by characters while showcasing God's control over history and the importance of moral character development.\",\n",
       " ('36',\n",
       "  43.0): 'Yitzhak is depicted as a stabilizing force in Genesis, lacking a distinct personality and serving as a transmitter of traditions, while Yaakov emerges as the most dynamic and human personality in the book, embodying themes of physical struggle, deception, and confrontation. The Yaakov stories illustrate the interplay between divine and human realities, showcasing the biblical conception of fate, free will, destiny, and choice.',\n",
       " ('32',\n",
       "  24.0): 'Yaakov encounters messengers of God before returning home, indicating a significant event to come. The meeting with his brother Esav is seen as a conflict between the divine and human levels, with Yaakov needing to deal with God before resolving issues with Esav. Yaakov prepares a gift for Esav but is surprised by his seemingly hostile approach, leading him to take cautious measures to avoid conflict.'}"
