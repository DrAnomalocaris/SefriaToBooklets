## Genesis 47

|וַיְחִ֤י יַעֲקֹב֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם שְׁבַ֥ע עֶשְׂרֵ֖ה שָׁנָ֑ה וַיְהִ֤י יְמֵֽי־יַעֲקֹב֙ שְׁנֵ֣י חַיָּ֔יו שֶׁ֣בַע שָׁנִ֔ים וְאַרְבָּעִ֥ים וּמְאַ֖ת שָׁנָֽה׃|28 P|Jacob lived seventeen years in the land of Egypt, so that the span of Jacob’s life came to one hundred and forty-seven years.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of understanding and knowledge in Torah study, highlighting the idea that God is intimately involved in every detail. Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen peaceful years before his death, symbolizing the end of his life and the beginning of Israel's exile. Despite previous suffering, Jacob found peace during these years. Rabbeinu Bahya and Ramban provide interpretations of numbers in biblical verses, while the Talmud connects the 147 psalms in the Book of Psalms to Jacob's years. Rebbi's toothache was healed after showing mercy, reflecting Psalm 145:9. Both Targums confirm Jacob's seventeen years in Egypt and total lifespan of 147 years. 

|וַיִּקְרְב֣וּ יְמֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֮ לָמוּת֒ וַיִּקְרָ֣א ׀ לִבְנ֣וֹ לְיוֹסֵ֗ף וַיֹּ֤אמֶר לוֹ֙ אִם־נָ֨א מָצָ֤אתִי חֵן֙ בְּעֵינֶ֔יךָ שִֽׂים־נָ֥א יָדְךָ֖ תַּ֣חַת יְרֵכִ֑י וְעָשִׂ֤יתָ עִמָּדִי֙ חֶ֣סֶד וֶאֱמֶ֔ת אַל־נָ֥א תִקְבְּרֵ֖נִי בְּמִצְרָֽיִם׃|29 J|And when the time approached for Israel to die, he summoned his son Joseph and said to him, “Do me this favor, place your hand under my thigh as a pledge of your steadfast loyalty: please do not bury me in Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

True kindness is done without expecting reward, acquiring wise souls and engaging in mundane affairs with good intentions. Jacob's request to be buried in Canaan was made in advance with kindness and truth, ensuring an enduring commitment. In approaching death, individuals' days come before the Supernal King. The righteous pray not to be gathered with the wicked, and the lack of control over the day of death is discussed in various Midrash texts. Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov experienced a taste of the World to Come while alive, emphasizing the importance of performing acts of loving-kindness. Symbolic gestures in making oaths, such as placing one's hand under the control of a master, are significant in Jewish thought. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains that dwelling in a certain place in the Torah signifies impending calamity or pain. Abraham instructs his senior servant to place his hand under his thigh, and Yisrael asks Yoseif to promise to bury him in a different place than Egypt. 

|וְשָֽׁכַבְתִּי֙ עִם־אֲבֹתַ֔י וּנְשָׂאתַ֙נִי֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם וּקְבַרְתַּ֖נִי בִּקְבֻרָתָ֑ם וַיֹּאמַ֕ר אָנֹכִ֖י אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה כִדְבָרֶֽךָ׃|30 J|When I lie down with my ancestors,  take me up from Egypt and bury me in their burial-place.” He replied, “I will do as you have spoken.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph, a virtuous man, promised his father Jacob to bury him in the Land of Israel, which Jacob insisted on with an oath sworn in God's name. Jewish thought interprets Jacob's desire to be buried with his fathers as a symbol of resurrection and immortality of the soul, emphasizing the importance of burial in a righteous place for spiritual benefits. The Talmud explains that Jacob's wish to be buried in the Land of Israel was not for resurrection but for spiritual significance, while the Midrash discusses the significance of being buried in the land of Israel and the importance of honoring the wishes of the deceased. 

|וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הִשָּֽׁבְעָה֙ לִ֔י וַיִּשָּׁבַ֖ע ל֑וֹ וַיִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל עַל־רֹ֥אשׁ הַמִּטָּֽה׃|31 J|And he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. Then Israel bowed at the head of the bed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov asked Yosef to swear to bury him in Eretz Yisrael to transfer spiritual power and ensure Yaakov's legacy continued through him, causing the brothers to fear Yosef's newfound spiritual power. Joseph's oath was needed to fulfill Jacob's last wish, as Jacob was concerned his body would not be buried in Egypt as an idol. Bedtime prayers in the Siddur Sefard and Siddur Ashkenaz ask for peaceful rest and protection from evil, with a figurative reference to Jacob's offspring being pure. The Gemara questions calling Joseph a fox, suggesting it was a recognition of his greatness.

## Genesis 48

|וַיְהִ֗י אַחֲרֵי֙ הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה וַיֹּ֣אמֶר לְיוֹסֵ֔ף הִנֵּ֥ה אָבִ֖יךָ חֹלֶ֑ה וַיִּקַּ֞ח אֶת־שְׁנֵ֤י בָנָיו֙ עִמּ֔וֹ אֶת־מְנַשֶּׁ֖ה וְאֶת־אֶפְרָֽיִם׃|1 E|Some time afterward, Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses different perspectives on Joseph being informed of Jacob's illness, with some suggesting Ephraim was the messenger. Jacob's illness was significant, as sneezing was traditionally seen as a sign of imminent death until Jacob prayed for time. The Sages equate lack of respiration with death, based on the belief that the soul exits through the nostrils. Joseph did not want to be alone with Jacob to avoid questions about his brothers, and Judah takes responsibility for selling Joseph into slavery to avert divine punishment. Jacob ensures Joseph's merit by not promising him rewards. Ibn Ezra explains Deuteronomy 24:6 literally, while Targum mentions Joseph taking his sons to Jacob after hearing of his illness. 

|וַיַּגֵּ֣ד לְיַעֲקֹ֔ב וַיֹּ֕אמֶר הִנֵּ֛ה בִּנְךָ֥ יוֹסֵ֖ף בָּ֣א אֵלֶ֑יךָ וַיִּתְחַזֵּק֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וַיֵּ֖שֶׁב עַל־הַמִּטָּֽה׃|2 E|When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to see you,” Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, looking at tzitzit is a remedy for the ill, strengthening Israel corresponding to the number of strings, loops, and knots. In Kabbalah, the letters Aleph, Chet, Hei, Ayin on the throat have specific functions in three columns. The Midrash emphasizes respect for royalty, as seen in Moses and Jacob honoring Joseph. Mishnah discusses vows and their implications, while Musar highlights the importance of leaving behind righteous descendants. The Targum recounts Jacob sitting up in bed upon hearing Joseph had come to him. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף אֵ֥ל שַׁדַּ֛י נִרְאָֽה־אֵלַ֥י בְּל֖וּז בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וַיְבָ֖רֶךְ אֹתִֽי׃|3 P|And Jacob said to Joseph, “El Shaddai, who appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, blessed me—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashbam explains Jacob saw God in Luz upon returning from Padan Aram, Radak notes God introduced Himself to Jacob as Shaddai and blessed him, Rav Hirsch emphasizes the significance of Jacob's blessing to Joseph's sons, Steinsaltz mentions Jacob recounted God's appearance and blessing in Luz, Akeidat Yitzchak discusses blessings and insights imparted by individuals near the end of their lives, Rabbeinu Bahya suggests "hanir-eh" does not indicate a feminine attribute of God, Gevia Kesef explains the use of "God Almighty" in Genesis 17:1, and Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state Yaakov told Yoseif that Almighty Shaddai appeared to him in Luz and blessed him. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלַ֗י הִנְנִ֤י מַפְרְךָ֙ וְהִרְבִּיתִ֔ךָ וּנְתַתִּ֖יךָ לִקְהַ֣ל עַמִּ֑ים וְנָ֨תַתִּ֜י אֶת־הָאָ֧רֶץ הַזֹּ֛את לְזַרְעֲךָ֥ אַחֲרֶ֖יךָ אֲחֻזַּ֥ת עוֹלָֽם׃|4 P|and said to me, ‘I will make you fertile and numerous, making of you a community of peoples; and I will assign this land to your offspring to come for an everlasting possession.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob designates Ephraim and Manasseh as heads of tribes, ensuring Joseph and his sons receive their rightful inheritance in Canaan. Reuben did not sin with Bilhah but disturbed her bed to defend his mother's honor, and Benjamin's birth completed the twelve tribes. Mishnah outlines offerings for erroneous rulings by judges, with Rabbis differing on the specifics. Ramban explains the promise of nations to Abraham refers to Israel, while Talmud argues one tribe is a congregation based on Benjamin's birth in Jerusalem. God promises Jacob fruitfulness, leadership of tribes, and everlasting possession of the land for his descendants. 

|וְעַתָּ֡ה שְׁנֵֽי־בָנֶ֩יךָ֩ הַנּוֹלָדִ֨ים לְךָ֜ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֗יִם עַד־בֹּאִ֥י אֵלֶ֛יךָ מִצְרַ֖יְמָה לִי־הֵ֑ם אֶפְרַ֙יִם֙ וּמְנַשֶּׁ֔ה כִּרְאוּבֵ֥ן וְשִׁמְע֖וֹן יִֽהְיוּ־לִֽי׃|5 P|Now, your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, shall be mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine no less than Reuben and Simeon.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov elevated Ephrayim and Menashe to the status of his own sons, equal to Reuven and Shimon, based on Joseph's role in sustaining the family and his desire to honor Rachel's memory. The text discusses the unity of the tribes in Israel, with blessings given to each tribe based on their history and future roles. In the Midrash, the counting of the tribes and the importance of tithing are emphasized, while the Mishnah discusses vows regarding benefiting from those born or yet to be born. The Second Temple text compares Ephraim and Manasseh to Reuben and Simeon, and the Talmud states that Ephraim and Manasseh are counted as two tribes, with Abba Shaul equating cursing a husband's parents in front of his children to doing so in his presence. The Targum notes that Jacob considered Ephraim and Menashe as his own sons. 

|וּמוֹלַדְתְּךָ֛ אֲשֶׁר־הוֹלַ֥דְתָּ אַחֲרֵיהֶ֖ם לְךָ֣ יִהְי֑וּ עַ֣ל שֵׁ֧ם אֲחֵיהֶ֛ם יִקָּרְא֖וּ בְּנַחֲלָתָֽם׃|6 P|But progeny born to you after them shall be yours; they shall be recorded instead  of their brothers in their inheritance.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban interprets that Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Menashe, were considered part of the tribe of Joseph and not separate tribes, receiving a double portion of land. Halakhah details the customs and rituals of Simchat Torah, including taking out three Torah scrolls, a festive meal, and inviting others to a party. Midrash emphasizes the importance of unity among the tribes and the inheritance of Torah knowledge, with references to Joseph's blessings and the belief in resurrection. The Talmud discusses inheritance laws and the counting of tribes, with Ephraim and Manasseh counted as two tribes. The Targum commentary supports the idea that Joseph's future descendants would be part of his tribe. 

|וַאֲנִ֣י ׀ בְּבֹאִ֣י מִפַּדָּ֗ן מֵ֩תָה֩ עָלַ֨י רָחֵ֜ל בְּאֶ֤רֶץ כְּנַ֙עַן֙ בַּדֶּ֔רֶךְ בְּע֥וֹד כִּבְרַת־אֶ֖רֶץ לָבֹ֣א אֶפְרָ֑תָה וָאֶקְבְּרֶ֤הָ שָּׁם֙ בְּדֶ֣רֶךְ אֶפְרָ֔ת הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם׃|7 R|I [do this because], when I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died, to my sorrow, while I was journeying in the land of Canaan, when still some distance short of Ephrath; and I buried her there on the road to Ephrath”—now Bethlehem.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob buried Rachel on the way back from Padan Aram by God's command in Canaan to ensure her intercession for her descendants, while Joseph's righteousness is shown in avoiding being alone with his father. The souls of the deceased are influenced by their material experiences, and the Talmud teaches about mourning and remedies for physical ailments. God's promises to Israel in the Tanakh include restoration, forgiveness, and eternal love, while Jacob's burial request is mentioned in the Targum. 

|וַיַּ֥רְא יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל אֶת־בְּנֵ֣י יוֹסֵ֑ף וַיֹּ֖אמֶר מִי־אֵֽלֶּה׃|8 E|Noticing Joseph’s sons, Israel asked, “Who are these?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob's failing eyesight prevented him from recognizing Joseph's sons, prompting him to ask who they were and leading to a tense interaction with Joseph regarding the future descendants of Ephraim. Despite this, Ephraim is still beloved by God, as seen in his descendants like Joshua who would lead Israel to greatness. Yisrael asks Yoseif about his sons in Genesis 48:8, wondering who they are [Onkelos, Targum Jonathan]. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ אֶל־אָבִ֔יו בָּנַ֣י הֵ֔ם אֲשֶׁר־נָֽתַן־לִ֥י אֱלֹהִ֖ים בָּזֶ֑ה וַיֹּאמַ֕ר קָֽחֶם־נָ֥א אֵלַ֖י וַאֲבָרְכֵֽם׃|9 E|And Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” “Bring them up to me,” he said, “that I may bless them.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph informed Jacob that Ephraim and Manasseh were his sons, emphasizing God's favor in granting him children despite past mistakes. Jacob subsequently agreed to bless them, highlighting the importance of proximity in blessings and prayers. The Israelites' temptation in Shittim led to a plague stopped by Pinchas, with Ephraim's lineage posing challenges. The sanctification of the moon symbolizes Israel's sanctification, with the Jewish Court having authority to declare the start of each month, linked to betrothal and direct communication with God. In presenting his sons to Jacob, Joseph mentioned his marriage to Asenath, daughter of Dinah, for the blessing. 

|וְעֵינֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ כָּבְד֣וּ מִזֹּ֔קֶן לֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִרְא֑וֹת וַיַּגֵּ֤שׁ אֹתָם֙ אֵלָ֔יו וַיִּשַּׁ֥ק לָהֶ֖ם וַיְחַבֵּ֥ק לָהֶֽם׃|10 E|Now Israel’s eyes were dim with age; he could not see. So [Joseph] brought them close to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob's failing eyesight prevented him from blessing Joseph's children properly, and the physical contact of kissing and embracing the children was meant to make Jacob more attached to them so that his blessing would be more effective. Rabbi Elazar explains that Jacob's eyes became dim from the age of Isaac, who was completely blind. The Midrash texts emphasize the importance of old age and the virtues of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who each merited their sons through five qualities. Rabbeinu Bahya explains that Moses' vision at 120 was a miracle, while Ramban argues that Esau despised his birthright due to his brutal nature. The Talmud discusses the presence of yeshivas among the Israelites and explains why Jacob did not kiss Joseph until his death. In the Targum, Yisrael's failing eyesight led Yoseif to bring his sons near, kiss them, and hug them. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף רְאֹ֥ה פָנֶ֖יךָ לֹ֣א פִלָּ֑לְתִּי וְהִנֵּ֨ה הֶרְאָ֥ה אֹתִ֛י אֱלֹהִ֖ים גַּ֥ם אֶת־זַרְעֶֽךָ׃|11 E|And Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see you again, and here God has let me see your children as well.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators offer interpretations of the word פללתי in Genesis, with Rashbam explaining it as judgment, Sforno connecting it to a previous blessing from God, Radak relating it to independent judges, and Tur HaArokh translating it as "I had not dared to expect." Halakhah details the mitzvah of tefillin, emphasizing the importance of all letters being intact in the passages written on parchment. In Midrash, the Assembly of Israel acknowledges affliction by the evil inclination but believes in divine protection. The Targum expresses Israel's surprise at seeing Joseph's offspring, a sight he did not expect but was granted by God. 

|וַיּוֹצֵ֥א יוֹסֵ֛ף אֹתָ֖ם מֵעִ֣ם בִּרְכָּ֑יו וַיִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ לְאַפָּ֖יו אָֽרְצָה׃|12 E|Joseph then removed them from his knees, and bowed low with his face to the ground.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph positioned his sons Manasseh and Ephraim for blessings in the correct order, with Manasseh on the right and Ephraim on the left, showing respect for the intended sequence. The blessings of the tribes focus on their unique characteristics and roles, emphasizing unity and material wealth without jealousy. Despite Jacob's initial refusal to bless them due to future sins, Ephraim's descendants would be favored by God and become a multitude of nations. Joseph wept on Jacob's neck, leading to a heartfelt reunion and recognition despite initial confusion. 

|וַיִּקַּ֣ח יוֹסֵף֮ אֶת־שְׁנֵיהֶם֒ אֶת־אֶפְרַ֤יִם בִּֽימִינוֹ֙ מִשְּׂמֹ֣אל יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְאֶת־מְנַשֶּׁ֥ה בִשְׂמֹאל֖וֹ מִימִ֣ין יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וַיַּגֵּ֖שׁ אֵלָֽיו׃|13 E|Joseph took the two of them, Ephraim with his right hand—to Israel’s left—and Manasseh with his left hand—to Israel’s right—and brought them close to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Radak, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rashi, Steinsaltz, and Chizkuni offer various interpretations of the positioning of Joseph's sons before Jacob for the blessing, with disagreements on the correct order based on age and spiritual superiority. Midrash highlights Joseph's righteousness and the significance of the division of land by lot, while also emphasizing Ephraim's importance. The Israelites' memory of fish in Egypt is mentioned as a blessing for Joseph's children, and the Second Temple commentary discusses the symbolism of Joseph's blessing. Targum describes Yoseif positioning Ephraim on his right side and Menasheh on his left side before Yisrael. 

|וַיִּשְׁלַח֩ יִשְׂרָאֵ֨ל אֶת־יְמִינ֜וֹ וַיָּ֨שֶׁת עַל־רֹ֤אשׁ אֶפְרַ֙יִם֙ וְה֣וּא הַצָּעִ֔יר וְאֶת־שְׂמֹאל֖וֹ עַל־רֹ֣אשׁ מְנַשֶּׁ֑ה שִׂכֵּל֙ אֶת־יָדָ֔יו כִּ֥י מְנַשֶּׁ֖ה הַבְּכֽוֹר׃|14 E|But Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on Ephraim’s head, though he was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head—thus crossing his hands—although Manasseh was the first-born.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov crossed his hands to bless Ephraim over Menashe due to his prophetic insight that Ephraim would have a more significant future, aiming to draw the blessing of intellect and establish a sanctuary through their will. The right hand on Ephraim's head symbolizes the spiritual side of Mashiach ben Yosef receiving abundant Lovingkindness, highlighting the importance of blessings being bestowed on the deserving. Joseph's righteousness is shown through his humility and concern for others, reflecting the humility and worthiness of Ephraim and Menashe. Aaron raised his hands to bless the people, not as an affirmation gesture, and the word כי is interpreted as "although" in various verses. Rabbi Elazar faced objections from Reish Lakish regarding instances where the Torah mentions "his hands," remaining silent in response. Yisrael intentionally placed his right hand on Ephraim's head and his left hand on Menasheh's head in Genesis 48:14. 

|וַיְבָ֥רֶךְ אֶת־יוֹסֵ֖ף וַיֹּאמַ֑ר הָֽאֱלֹהִ֡ים אֲשֶׁר֩ הִתְהַלְּכ֨וּ אֲבֹתַ֤י לְפָנָיו֙ אַבְרָהָ֣ם וְיִצְחָ֔ק הָֽאֱלֹהִים֙ הָרֹעֶ֣ה אֹתִ֔י מֵעוֹדִ֖י עַד־הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|15 E|And he blessed Joseph, saying, “The God in whose ways my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, The God who has been my shepherd from my birth to this day— |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the different attributes of the Patriarchs in their relationship with God, with Noach embodying Justice, Avraham and Yitzchok showing Mercy, and Yaakov having constant guidance from God. Jewish Thought explores the significance of the names of God, the importance of striving for closeness to God, and the impact of the land of Israel on the perception of God's power. Midrash delves into walking with God and blessings given by Jacob to his sons. Musar emphasizes the covenant with God through Jacob blessing Joseph, and the importance of spiritual awakening. Quoting Commentary highlights the deep understanding of God by Chanoch and the sacrifices offered by Jacob before heading to Egypt. Second Temple discusses the importance of nourishment from God, while Talmud contrasts providing food with redemption, and Targum focuses on Jacob's blessing of Joseph and acknowledgment of God's sustenance. 

|הַמַּלְאָךְ֩ הַגֹּאֵ֨ל אֹתִ֜י מִכׇּל־רָ֗ע יְבָרֵךְ֮ אֶת־הַנְּעָרִים֒ וְיִקָּרֵ֤א בָהֶם֙ שְׁמִ֔י וְשֵׁ֥ם אֲבֹתַ֖י אַבְרָהָ֣ם וְיִצְחָ֑ק וְיִדְגּ֥וּ לָרֹ֖ב בְּקֶ֥רֶב הָאָֽרֶץ׃|16 E|The Messenger who has redeemed me from all harm— Bless the lads. In them may my name be recalled, And the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, And may they be teeming multitudes upon the earth.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the significance of the 12 constellations and gemstones representing holy attributes and the 12 tribes, linking the month of Adar to fish symbolizing fertility and protection from the evil eye. Commentary from various sources explains Jacob's blessings for his grandsons, emphasizing divine protection and spiritual values. Halakhah details the order of readings after Hakafos in the synagogue, while Jewish Thought connects the redeemer of Jacob to the Angel of Yosef. Kabbalah delves into protection from the evil eye and the symbolism of the Shekhinah as an angel. Liturgy includes prayers referencing the angel who redeemed Jacob, and Midrash discusses prayer direction and the protection of the patriarchs. Musar highlights the importance of man as the chief creation, with angels serving the righteous, and Responsa refutes allusions to Mohammed in Scripture. In Second Temple texts, punishment is described as indirect, and Talmud explains protection from evil and the evil eye, while Tanakh promises protection from harm and Targum discusses blessings upon Jacob's descendants. 

|וַיַּ֣רְא יוֹסֵ֗ף כִּי־יָשִׁ֨ית אָבִ֧יו יַד־יְמִינ֛וֹ עַל־רֹ֥אשׁ אֶפְרַ֖יִם וַיֵּ֣רַע בְּעֵינָ֑יו וַיִּתְמֹ֣ךְ יַד־אָבִ֗יו לְהָסִ֥יר אֹתָ֛הּ מֵעַ֥ל רֹאשׁ־אֶפְרַ֖יִם עַל־רֹ֥אשׁ מְנַשֶּֽׁה׃|17 E|When Joseph saw that his father was placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he thought it wrong; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob's decision to place his right hand on Ephraim's head instead of Manasseh's during the blessing symbolizes the spiritual aspect of Mashiach ben Yosef and the importance of Ephraim's descendants, despite Joseph's initial displeasure. The Talmud discusses the significance of the right hand in blessings, with Rabbi Yosei HaḤorem arguing that it is also called yad, while another tanna disagrees. Yoseif's attempt to move Jacob's hand to Manasseh's head in the Targum highlights the tension surrounding the blessing. Ibn Ezra and Rashi provide interpretations of relevant verses, emphasizing the importance of the right hand in guiding and supporting. 

|וַיֹּ֧אמֶר יוֹסֵ֛ף אֶל־אָבִ֖יו לֹא־כֵ֣ן אָבִ֑י כִּי־זֶ֣ה הַבְּכֹ֔ר שִׂ֥ים יְמִינְךָ֖ עַל־רֹאשֽׁוֹ׃|18 E|“Not so, Father,” Joseph said to his father, “for the other is the first-born; place your right hand on his head.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph corrected Jacob's assumption about the order of his sons, expressing doubts about his intentions and preferring the firstborn to be blessed. Midrash discusses Jacob blessing Ephraim over Manasseh, with offerings symbolizing family members and blessings. Ramban refutes the idea of Isaac being poor and losing his father's wealth, attributing his dim eyesight to old age and his blessing of Jacob to a desire for a spiritual experience. Targum emphasizes Ephraim as the firstborn deserving the blessing. 

|וַיְמָאֵ֣ן אָבִ֗יו וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ יָדַ֤עְתִּֽי בְנִי֙ יָדַ֔עְתִּי גַּם־ה֥וּא יִֽהְיֶה־לְּעָ֖ם וְגַם־ה֣וּא יִגְדָּ֑ל וְאוּלָ֗ם אָחִ֤יו הַקָּטֹן֙ יִגְדַּ֣ל מִמֶּ֔נּוּ וְזַרְע֖וֹ יִהְיֶ֥ה מְלֹֽא־הַגּוֹיִֽם׃|19 E|But his father objected, saying, “I know, my son, I know. He too shall become a people, and he too shall be great. Yet his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall be plentiful enough for nations.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob favored Ephraim over Manasseh, placing his right hand on Ephraim's head despite him being the younger brother, indicating Ephraim's future greatness and the fullness of his descendants. This blessing was fulfilled through leaders like Joshua, who achieved fame that filled the nations, showcasing Ephraim's importance. Despite this, both Ephraim and Manasseh are recognized for their greatness and significance in their own right, with the Gemara discussing how the sun stood still for Joshua as a sign of Ephraim's future as a multitude of nations. 

|וַיְבָ֨רְכֵ֜ם בַּיּ֣וֹם הַהוּא֮ לֵאמוֹר֒ בְּךָ֗ יְבָרֵ֤ךְ יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר יְשִֽׂמְךָ֣ אֱלֹהִ֔ים כְּאֶפְרַ֖יִם וְכִמְנַשֶּׁ֑ה וַיָּ֥שֶׂם אֶת־אֶפְרַ֖יִם לִפְנֵ֥י מְנַשֶּֽׁה׃|20 E|So he blessed them that day, saying, “By you shall Israel invoke blessings, saying: God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.” Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses God preparing for recovery before bringing troubles, illustrated by Yaakov blessing Ephrayim over Menashe to prepare individuals for God's kindness. Ephraim's superiority over Menashe is emphasized in blessings, with Ephraim placed first to reflect his importance. The beauty of the beard in Kabbalah symbolizes blessings from Atika Kadisha, extending to Israel Saba and Tevunah. Liturgy includes blessings for children based on Ephraim and Menashe's descendants and matriarchs, asking for divine protection and peace. Midrash discusses Joseph's righteousness, the lighting of the Chanukah menorah, Ephraim being placed before Manasseh, the ordeal of bitter waters, and the offerings of the chieftains of the tribes. Rabbi Emden blessed both sons and daughters, with Numbers 2:18 describing Ephraim's division in the west. Targum emphasizes Ephraim's superiority over Menasheh in blessings. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף הִנֵּ֥ה אָנֹכִ֖י מֵ֑ת וְהָיָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ עִמָּכֶ֔ם וְהֵשִׁ֣יב אֶתְכֶ֔ם אֶל־אֶ֖רֶץ אֲבֹתֵיכֶֽם׃|21 E|Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die; but God will be with you and bring you back to the land of your ancestors.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob, close to death, reassures Joseph that God will be with his descendants and will bring them back to the land of their fathers after 400 years, emphasizing the irrevocable promise and assigning an extra share to Joseph's descendants. Jacob prophetically assures Joseph of the future restoration to the land. The text advises scholars not to argue over traditions or interpretations, emphasizes the importance of listening and being careful with words, and highlights the faithful testimony of God. Jacob gave Joseph signs to identify the future redeemer of Israel and granted him Shekhem for not acting like his brothers. Ramban questions Moses asking for God's name as a sign, with the response indicating God's mercy and assurance of His presence with the Israelites. Israel dwells safely in a land of abundance under God's protection, while Targum highlights Jacob reassuring Joseph of God's support and promise to restore them to the land of their fathers. 

|וַאֲנִ֞י נָתַ֧תִּֽי לְךָ֛ שְׁכֶ֥ם אַחַ֖ד עַל־אַחֶ֑יךָ אֲשֶׁ֤ר לָקַ֙חְתִּי֙ מִיַּ֣ד הָֽאֱמֹרִ֔י בְּחַרְבִּ֖י וּבְקַשְׁתִּֽי׃|22 E|And now, I assign to you one portion  more than to your brothers, which I wrested from the Amorites with my sword and bow.”|

Prayer is a powerful weapon in Chasidut, as demonstrated in Genesis 48:22 and Psalms 44:7, 9, with Jacob blessing Joseph with the birthright and Shechem. Unity among the people of Israel is essential for serving God, as seen in Judges 20:11 and Proverbs 4:23. Jacob's blessing to Joseph's sons symbolizes prayer and intercession in Jewish Thought, while the synagogue and Torah-learning academies symbolize the presence of the Shechinah in Kabbalah. In Midrash, Judah's confrontation with Joseph leads to a reunion with his family in Egypt, where Joseph ensures their well-being. Musar emphasizes charity, struggle against evil, and prayer as weapons in battle, as seen in Psalms 85:14 and Exodus 30:12. Jacob's blessing of Joseph's sons in Second Temple times connects to the division of Canaan amongst the tribes, while Talmud explains that Jacob's bequest to Joseph was obtained through prayer, not physical weapons. Yaakov assigns Efrayim and Menashe two portions of land in Canaan in Tanakh, and Targum interprets Jacob's gift of Shekem to Joseph as prayer and plea.

## Genesis 49

|וַיִּקְרָ֥א יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶל־בָּנָ֑יו וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הֵאָֽסְפוּ֙ וְאַגִּ֣ידָה לָכֶ֔ם אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁר־יִקְרָ֥א אֶתְכֶ֖ם בְּאַחֲרִ֥ית הַיָּמִֽים׃|1 J|And Jacob called his sons and said, “Come together that I may tell you what is to befall you in days to come. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Yaakov's prayer focused on the letters, while his sons comforted him by pointing out Hashem's oneness in the future. Halakhah discusses signs of salvation's approach and the importance of confidentiality. In Jewish Thought, Torah guides from death to life, and Jacob desired to reveal the end of days. Kabbalah discusses drawing from wisdom to find good intellect. In Midrash, idolatry will bow down to God, and judgment in the future favors Jews. In Musar, Jacob emphasized unity for redemption. Ramban explains the festivals as days of offerings, and Jacob's attempt to predict the Messiah was unsuccessful. In Second Temple, Isaac and Jacob are seen as prophets, and in Talmud, Jacob tried to reveal complete redemption but was reassured by his sons. In Targum, Jacob revealed hidden mysteries to his sons, blessing each according to their deeds and emphasizing unity and worship of one God. 

|הִקָּבְצ֥וּ וְשִׁמְע֖וּ בְּנֵ֣י יַעֲקֹ֑ב וְשִׁמְע֖וּ אֶל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֥ל אֲבִיכֶֽם׃|2 J|Assemble and hearken, O sons of Jacob; Hearken to Israel your father: |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the unity and influence of Bnei Yisrael represented by Yosef and Binyamin, the importance of preserving Israel's teachings, Jacob's warning to his sons about future exile and idol worship, and the significance of righteousness as the foundation of the world. The declaration of G'd's Uniqueness in the Ten Commandments is emphasized as a daily affirmation of faith stemming from Jacob's confrontation with his sons about loyalty to G'd. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan highlight the importance of listening to and receiving instruction from father Yisrael. 

|רְאוּבֵן֙ בְּכֹ֣רִי אַ֔תָּה כֹּחִ֖י וְרֵאשִׁ֣ית אוֹנִ֑י יֶ֥תֶר שְׂאֵ֖ת וְיֶ֥תֶר עָֽז׃|3 J|Reuben, you are my first-born, My might and first fruit of my vigor, Exceeding in rank And exceeding in honor. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Moshe Rabeynu's healing of Reuven's blessing, highlighting the power of charity, repentance, and prayer to bring strength and renewal. Commentary from Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Kli Yakar, Sforno, Radak, Or HaChaim, and others explores Reuben's loss of privileges due to character flaws and actions. Midrash discusses Jacob's rebuke of Reuben and his lost birthright, while Musar delves into Jacob's purity and spiritual identity. Quoting Commentary from various sources elaborates on interpretations of biblical texts, emphasizing the importance of following commandments and spiritual concepts. Talmudic discussions question Jacob's purity, while Tanakh and Targum mention blessings and the transfer of privileges from Reuben to others. 

|פַּ֤חַז כַּמַּ֙יִם֙ אַל־תּוֹתַ֔ר כִּ֥י עָלִ֖יתָ מִשְׁכְּבֵ֣י אָבִ֑יךָ אָ֥ז חִלַּ֖לְתָּ יְצוּעִ֥י עָלָֽה׃|4 J|Unstable as water, you shall excel no longer; For when you mounted your father’s bed, You brought disgrace—my couch he mounted! |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov penalized Reuven for defiling his father's bed by not giving him the rights of the firstborn, transferring them to Yosef instead. Reuven's impulsive actions led to a loss of privileges, but through repentance, he was ultimately forgiven and blessed by Moses. The Aḥerim state that Reuben rearranged two beds, one of the Divine Presence and one of his father, symbolizing his innocence. The Torah justifies Yaakov's decision to transfer the birthright from Reuven to Yosef due to character deficiencies, as seen in Bereshit 49:3–4. 

|שִׁמְע֥וֹן וְלֵוִ֖י אַחִ֑ים כְּלֵ֥י חָמָ֖ס מְכֵרֹתֵיהֶֽם׃|5 J|Simeon and Levi are a pair; Their weapons are tools of lawlessness. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, bringing a weapon when moving into a new house is considered a segulah, related to the acronym in Proverbs 24:3. Jacob criticizes Simeon and Levi for their violent actions against the people of Shechem, which were not inherited but a result of their own choices. The rabbis in the Talmud interpret Jacob's words to Simeon and Levi, suggesting that the weapons used were stolen from Esau. In various Midrashim, Simeon and Levi are condemned for their violence, leading to their division and scattering. In the Second Temple period, Simeon and Levi are described as united in will and purpose, with Moses combining them symbolically. The Targum commentaries also highlight their propensity for violence and warfare. 

|בְּסֹדָם֙ אַל־תָּבֹ֣א נַפְשִׁ֔י בִּקְהָלָ֖ם אַל־תֵּחַ֣ד כְּבֹדִ֑י כִּ֤י בְאַפָּם֙ הָ֣רְגוּ אִ֔ישׁ וּבִרְצֹנָ֖ם עִקְּרוּ־שֽׁוֹר׃|6 J|Let not my person be included in their council, Let not my being be counted in their assembly. For when angry they slay a man,   And when pleased they maim an ox.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains Shimon and Levi's ability to elevate negative forces to holiness, influenced by Yaakov's blessings to the tribes. Commentary discusses Jacob's disapproval of their violent actions in Shechem and their role in the story of Joseph. Jewish Thought explores the Ḥayyot's animal forms, human creation in the image of G-d, and the importance of spiritual values over physical strength.

Quoting Commentary includes Ramban's view on Simeon and Levi's actions, Rashi's prayers, and the sudden deaths of the tribes. Talmud mentions alterations to biblical verses to avoid negative connotations, and Tanakh highlights the rebellion of Korah. Targum emphasizes the rejection of participating in violent actions. 

|אָר֤וּר אַפָּם֙ כִּ֣י עָ֔ז וְעֶבְרָתָ֖ם כִּ֣י קָשָׁ֑תָה אֲחַלְּקֵ֣ם בְּיַעֲקֹ֔ב וַאֲפִיצֵ֖ם בְּיִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|7 J|Cursed be their anger so fierce, And their wrath so relentless. I will divide them in Jacob, Scatter them in Israel. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the Shechinah is raised through acts of charity, linked to the coming of Shilo. Commentary discusses Jacob's division of Simeon and Levi within Israel to prevent future outbursts of anger. Halakhah debates Yaakov's criticism of Shimon and Levi's actions, with Ramban focusing on Yaakov's final words. Jewish Thought explores negative characteristics, blessings for the tribes, limitations of human perfection, and responsibility for sin. Midrash discusses Simeon and Levi's violent actions, curse on their anger, and scattering among tribes. Musar emphasizes caution when placing bans, Joseph's brothers' silence about selling him, and Jacob's admonishment of Shimon and Levi. Quoting Commentary highlights Jacob's disappointment in Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, their scattering among tribes, and potential for redemption. Talmud mentions alterations to the Torah, ambiguous verses, and interpretations of specific terms. Targum describes Jacob's curse on Shimeon and Levi's anger, dividing their inheritance to prevent excessive power. 

|יְהוּדָ֗ה אַתָּה֙ יוֹד֣וּךָ אַחֶ֔יךָ יָדְךָ֖ בְּעֹ֣רֶף אֹיְבֶ֑יךָ יִשְׁתַּחֲו֥וּ לְךָ֖ בְּנֵ֥י אָבִֽיךָ׃|8 J|You, O Judah, your brothers shall praise; Your hand shall be on the nape of your foes; Your father’s sons shall bow low to you. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the familiarity of addressing God in Genesis 49:8, while the commentary on Jacob's blessing of Judah highlights his leadership role and victory over enemies.

Kabbalah emphasizes the connection between the Shema, brotherhood, and the preservation of She through Judah. The Midrash explores the blessings and characteristics of Jacob's sons, with Judah praised for his strength and leadership. Musar reflects on Judah's saving of Joseph and the resulting pity on the kingdom of the house of Judah. Quoting various commentators, Second Temple texts, and Talmudic passages discuss different aspects of Judah's role and significance, including his skill with the bow. Finally, Targum predicts Judah's acknowledgment and praise by his brothers after his confession regarding Tamar. 

|גּ֤וּר אַרְיֵה֙ יְהוּדָ֔ה מִטֶּ֖רֶף בְּנִ֣י עָלִ֑יתָ כָּרַ֨ע רָבַ֧ץ כְּאַרְיֵ֛ה וּכְלָבִ֖יא מִ֥י יְקִימֶֽנּוּ׃|9 J|Judah is a lion’s whelp; On prey, my son, have you grown. He crouches, lies down like a lion, Like a lioness  —who dare rouse him? |
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Yehudah is compared to a lion symbolizing the Jewish people gathering sparks of holiness, with the Holy Temple reflecting God's relationships with gentile nations and the Jewish people. In Halakhah, the writing of second names is specified, and praying for suitable matches is encouraged. In Jewish Thought, Rashi and Ibn Ezra disagree on the significance of the flags of the tribes, which will be replaced by a single flag in messianic times. In Kabbalah, those who fear the Lord should strive for love, awe, fear, and humility. In Midrash, Judah and the Hebrew midwives are commended for their courage. In Musar, the connection between Yehudah and Dan is explained through future heroic deeds in the time of the Messiah.

|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Korach's rebellion against Moses, emphasizing generational spiritual differences and the need for action alongside prayer. Agra DeKala links the actions of Shifrah and Puah to future priests, the House of David monarchy, and the coming of the Messiah. Halakhah highlights the authority of exilarchs in Babylon over the Jewish people and the criticism of the Hasmoneans for not appointing a king from the tribe of Yehuda. Jewish Thought explains the existence of both Mashiach ben Yosef and Mashiach ben David in every generation. Kabbalah interprets the "plant of the field" as the first Messiah and the "herb of the field" as the second Messiah, with Moses' absence serving the Shechinah. Midrash emphasizes God's mercy and justice through biblical examples, while Musar discusses the preeminence of Yehudah in leadership and royalty until the Messiah. Quoting Commentary connects the creation of the world in six days to the preservation of the world over six thousand years, with different roles for the tribes of Yehudah and Levi in adjudication and legislation. Talmud discusses the anointing of kings and the authority of Jewish rulers, and Tanakh mentions tribute being brought to God from a distant people. Targum translations of Genesis 49:10 emphasize the continuation of kings from the house of Yehudah until the Messiah's arrival. 

|אֹסְרִ֤י לַגֶּ֙פֶן֙ עִירֹ֔ה וְלַשֹּׂרֵקָ֖ה בְּנִ֣י אֲתֹנ֑וֹ כִּבֵּ֤ס בַּיַּ֙יִן֙ לְבֻשׁ֔וֹ וּבְדַם־עֲנָבִ֖ים סוּתֹֽה׃|11 J|He tethers his ass to a vine, His ass’s foal to a choice vine; He washes his garment in wine, His robe in blood of grapes. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut: During Adar, the miracles of Purim were covert to prevent overwhelming fear. The Mei HaShiloach relates grapes in Yaakov's blessing to mistakes and clarification, Likutei Moharan connects grapes to the Community of Israel and holiness in speech, Sefat Emet discusses inner and outer aspects represented by Moshe and Yaakov, and Agra DeKala interprets Shifrah and Puah's actions as meriting the priesthood and monarchy.

|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Yaakov uses hyperbole to convey G'd's overwhelming desire to bestow blessings on His people, with Judah's portion in the Land of Israel symbolized by wine and milk. The Midrash explains the negative consequences of excessive wine consumption and praises Judah for saving lives. The Talmud discusses the effects of wine and Rabbi Yoḥanan's opinion on smiling. In Tanakh, Judah's hands are strengthened by God against his enemies. The Targums describe the king Meshiha's eyes as beautiful like wine and teeth as pure as milk, with abundant blessings in his land. 

|זְבוּלֻ֕ן לְח֥וֹף יַמִּ֖ים יִשְׁכֹּ֑ן וְהוּא֙ לְח֣וֹף אֳנִיֹּ֔ת וְיַרְכָת֖וֹ עַל־צִידֹֽן׃|13 J|Zebulun shall dwell by the seashore; He shall be a haven for ships, And his flank shall rest on Sidon. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov describes God's desire to bestow blessings on His people, surpassing even the joy of His children receiving them. The fear of God brings confidence and comfort, as seen with the midwives who were granted houses for fearing God. Zebulun's commercial activities will support Issachar's Torah studies, emphasized in various commentaries. The Hillazon emerges every seventy years in Zevulun's territory. Zebulun and Issachar had an agreement to support each other, with Zebulun's maritime activities benefiting Issachar's Torah study. The tribes were blessed according to their needs, with Moses sealing the blessings. The significance of the twelve standards for the tribes of Israel is explained, each corresponding to the gemstones of the High Priest's breastplate. Zebulun's love for items by the sea is linked to his lineage, and drawing water during a festivity is explained through examples from Asher and Zebulun. Jonah's story at the water-drawing festivity illustrates how the holy spirit rests on a happy heart. Zebulon's settlement by the sea and dominion over havens is described in the Targum. 

|יִשָּׂשכָ֖ר חֲמֹ֣ר גָּ֑רֶם רֹבֵ֖ץ בֵּ֥ין הַֽמִּשְׁפְּתָֽיִם׃|14 J|Issachar is a strong-boned ass, Crouching among the sheepfolds. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut focuses on Issachar's role in fulfilling commandments and the spiritual rewards, while the Baal Shem Tov sees Issachar as serving Hashem with physical substance.

|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of recognizing goodness and pleasantness in life, becoming an indentured servant to overcome obstacles, focusing on Torah study and serving the community like Issachar, eating only for sustenance and to strengthen the mind for Torah study, the traditional perception of donkeys and the story of Bileam and Balak, the Torah given after twenty-six generations, the importance of embracing the Torah and serving God, Zebulun and Issachar's roles and blessings, Psalm 133:1 expressing unity among brothers, and the Targum commentaries on Genesis 49:15 emphasizing rest, pleasantness, labor, and tribute. 

|דָּ֖ן יָדִ֣ין עַמּ֑וֹ כְּאַחַ֖ד שִׁבְטֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|16 J|Dan shall govern his people, As one of the tribes of Israel. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov's prayer for the coming of Moshiach caused the Shechina to depart from him as he spiritually elevated himself, connecting with the divine. The verse "Dan shall judge his people" is explained by various commentators, including Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Tur HaArokh, Or HaChaim, Radak, Steinsaltz, Tze'enah Ure'enah, and Derashot HaRan. The title Kingship-Malchut represents dominion through judgment, connected to the name Lord-Adona”y. Dan, like Judah and Samson, symbolizes vengeance and protection, with the twelve tribes named after their greatness in Israel. The camp in the text emphasizes kind deeds, charity, and tithing, reflecting the attributes of kindness, justice, and charity. The tribe of Dan contributed to the development of law in monetary matters, and a man from Dan was known for his precision in language. Rabbi Yoḥanan compares Samson to God for his protection of the Jewish people, and the Targum speaks of a man from the house of Dan who will judge with truth and deliver his people. 

|יְהִי־דָן֙ נָחָ֣שׁ עֲלֵי־דֶ֔רֶךְ שְׁפִיפֹ֖ן עֲלֵי־אֹ֑רַח הַנֹּשֵׁךְ֙ עִקְּבֵי־ס֔וּס וַיִּפֹּ֥ל רֹכְב֖וֹ אָחֽוֹר׃|17 J|Dan shall be a serpent by the road, A viper by the path, That bites the horse’s heels So that his rider is thrown backward. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries connect the tribe of Dan to a serpent on the road and a viper attacking a horse's heel, symbolizing Samson's solo battles and unconventional methods of warfare, as well as his vengeful nature and cunning use of unlikely weapons. The Midrash and Musar texts further explore Dan's role in future redemption and battles preceding the Messiah's coming, with descendants of Dan playing key roles in these events. The Talmud and Targum highlight Samson's fulfillment of Jacob's prophecy concerning the tribe of Dan, emphasizing his strength and ability to defeat enemies. 

|לִישׁוּעָֽתְךָ֖ קִוִּ֥יתִי יְהֹוָֽה׃|18 J|I wait for Your deliverance, O יהוה ! |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators offer insights into Jacob's prayer for salvation in Genesis 49:18, with interpretations ranging from a plea for divine help after Samson's death to a prayer for Dan's safety in battle. The prayer references Psalms, Isaiah, and Ezekiel, and is echoed in liturgical prayers expressing hope for deliverance from God. In Midrash, different tribes and figures are associated with specific characteristics and roles, while Musar texts mention future vengeance against enemies and the invocation of God's Holy Names in Jacob's prayer. In the Second Temple period, symbols of self-mastery and waiting for salvation are depicted through imagery related to Dan and the Song of Moses. 

|גָּ֖ד גְּד֣וּד יְגוּדֶ֑נּוּ וְה֖וּא יָגֻ֥ד עָקֵֽב׃|19 J|Gad shall be raided by raiders, But he shall raid at their heels. |

|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the stones on the Choshen Mishpat correspond to the tribes of Israel based on their attributes and actions, with Asher linked to olive oil representing wisdom and the importance of this resource. Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, and Kli Yakar highlight Asher's provision of oil for kings and the Temple, while Midrash explains Asher's favor due to his beautiful daughters and rich land. The gemstone for Asher, called תרשיש, reflects the richness of their land portion in Israel, providing luxurious and delicious food fit for kings according to Targum. 

|נַפְתָּלִ֖י אַיָּלָ֣ה שְׁלֻחָ֑ה הַנֹּתֵ֖ן אִמְרֵי־שָֽׁפֶר׃|21 J|Naphtali is a hind let loose, Which yields lovely fawns. |

Quoting commentary from Ramban, Rashi, and others, the text delves into various interpretations of biblical verses related to Joseph. Talmud references Rabbi Mallai's statement that Joseph behaved like a nazirite. Tanakh verses describe God's presence causing the earth to shake and Joseph being blessed with bounty. Targum discusses the blessings received by Joseph from the patriarchs and matriarchs. 

|בִּנְיָמִין֙ זְאֵ֣ב יִטְרָ֔ף בַּבֹּ֖קֶר יֹ֣אכַל עַ֑ד וְלָעֶ֖רֶב יְחַלֵּ֥ק שָׁלָֽל׃|27 J|Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; In the morning he consumes the foe,   And in the evening he divides the spoil.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the significance of gemstones representing the tribes of Israel, with each stone symbolizing specific attributes. Benjamin is compared to a wolf and his land is associated with the Temple. The Altar in the Temple had a ledge to ensure it was in Benjamin's inheritance. The complaint "Of what use is a candle in broad daylight?" is supported by Iyov 25:4-5. The meaning of "adei ad" is about unity and sustenance. Mishnah Eruvin 5:5 allows unreliable witnesses to testify about the Shabbat limit. Rabbeinu Bahya connects the ram caught in the thicket to G'd's presence in Benjamin's territory. The Talmud discusses the location of the Temple in Benjamin's land and Phineas' actions against sinners. Benjamin is compared to a wolf in Targum, with the Shekhina dwelling in his land. The King's palace can eat Shevi'it produce until it is no longer found in Beth El. 

|כׇּל־אֵ֛לֶּה שִׁבְטֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל שְׁנֵ֣ים עָשָׂ֑ר וְ֠זֹ֠את אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּ֨ר לָהֶ֤ם אֲבִיהֶם֙ וַיְבָ֣רֶךְ אוֹתָ֔ם אִ֛ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר כְּבִרְכָת֖וֹ בֵּרַ֥ךְ אֹתָֽם׃|28 R|All these were the tribes of Israel, twelve in number, and this is what their father said to them as he bade them farewell, addressing to each a parting word appropriate to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of intense love for Torah leading to closeness to God and subduing cravings, while Mei HaShiloach discusses the fear and service of God when coming to a Cohen, Likutei Moharan stresses speaking with holiness, and Sefat Emet connects Yaakov's blessings to his sons to divine sources and the essence of Torah. Moses' blessings are seen as a continuation of Jacob's, with each son receiving individualized blessings tailored to their attributes and destinies. Kabbalah explains that Yaakov blessed each tribe according to a specific blessing, ensuring they received the appropriate one, and Midrash discusses how Jacob and Moses blessed the tribes by likening them to animals. Musar highlights the importance of retaining individual customs based on the tribes, with Maimonides allowing for varying numbers of stitches in phylacteries, and David's blessings for the Jewish people are seen as comprehensive. The Talmud discusses answering multiple questions simultaneously, and Targum states that each of the twelve tribes of Israel received a unique blessing from their father. 

|וַיְצַ֣ו אוֹתָ֗ם וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ אֲנִי֙ נֶאֱסָ֣ף אֶל־עַמִּ֔י קִבְר֥וּ אֹתִ֖י אֶל־אֲבֹתָ֑י אֶ֨ל־הַמְּעָרָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר בִּשְׂדֵ֖ה עֶפְר֥וֹן הַֽחִתִּֽי׃|29 P|Then he instructed them, saying to them, “I am about to be gathered to my kin. Bury me with my ancestors  in the cave which is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob commanded all his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, emphasizing the importance of promptness in carrying out his wishes. The Rabbi discusses the intricacies of Hebrew grammar and pronunciation, highlighting the significance of accents and vowel signs. In the Midrash, Jacob's commands to his sons are related to their merit, his burial, and the carrying of his bier, with parallels drawn between Jacob and Joseph. Rashi explains the Festival of Ingathering, while Chizkuni discusses Yaakov's fear of Esau and acts of kindness beyond duty. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both mention Jacob's instructions to be buried in the cave in the field of Ephron the Chittite. 

|בַּמְּעָרָ֞ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר בִּשְׂדֵ֧ה הַמַּכְפֵּלָ֛ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר עַל־פְּנֵי־מַמְרֵ֖א בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן אֲשֶׁר֩ קָנָ֨ה אַבְרָהָ֜ם אֶת־הַשָּׂדֶ֗ה מֵאֵ֛ת עֶפְרֹ֥ן הַחִתִּ֖י לַאֲחֻזַּת־קָֽבֶר׃|30 P|the cave which is in the field of Machpelah, facing Mamre, in the land of Canaan, the field that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite for a burial site—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov asserts his right to be buried in the cave of Machpelah, which Avraham legally acquired and designated as an ancestral burial plot to secure his sons' ownership. The Targum mentions that Avraham bought the cave from Ephron the Hittite for a burial place, emphasizing its significance as an inheritance for burial purposes. 

|שָׁ֣מָּה קָֽבְר֞וּ אֶת־אַבְרָהָ֗ם וְאֵת֙ שָׂרָ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֔וֹ שָׁ֚מָּה קָבְר֣וּ אֶת־יִצְחָ֔ק וְאֵ֖ת רִבְקָ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֑וֹ וְשָׁ֥מָּה קָבַ֖רְתִּי אֶת־לֵאָֽה׃|31 P|there Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried; there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried; and there I buried Leah—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob emphasizes the importance of being buried in the cave of Machpelah, mentioning Leah's burial there and stating that only the three patriarchs and their wives should be buried there. Joseph brings an army to protect against Esau's interference in Jacob's burial. The Midrash suggests that Moses may not have actually died, but rather stands and serves near the patriarchs. The Talmud debates whether the generation of the desert will be granted eternal life. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, and Leah being buried in the same location. 

|מִקְנֵ֧ה הַשָּׂדֶ֛ה וְהַמְּעָרָ֥ה אֲשֶׁר־בּ֖וֹ מֵאֵ֥ת בְּנֵי־חֵֽת׃|32 P|the field and the cave in it, bought from the Hittites.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob clarified the purchase of the field and cave from the Hittites to avoid the law of בר מצרא, ensuring no claims could be made against the property. The repetition of the story of acquiring the cave of Machpelah underscored the importance of solidifying Abraham's ownership. Lea and Rachel had children with Jacob through their handmaids, resulting in the birth of several sons, including Joseph. The field and cave were purchased from the sons of Cheis and Hitah according to Targum commentary. 

|וַיְכַ֤ל יַעֲקֹב֙ לְצַוֺּ֣ת אֶת־בָּנָ֔יו וַיֶּאֱסֹ֥ף רַגְלָ֖יו אֶל־הַמִּטָּ֑ה וַיִּגְוַ֖ע וַיֵּאָ֥סֶף אֶל־עַמָּֽיו׃|33 P|When Jacob finished his instructions to his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and, breathing his last, he was gathered to his kin. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov Avinu did not die in the traditional sense, with his soul remaining connected to his body after death, supported by Rashi and other sages. The concept of a "second body" is mentioned, allowing for a continued connection between the physical and spiritual realms. Man can share his wealth and moral stature with others, with spiritual powers being enhanced in old age, as seen with Jacob, Elijah, and Moses. Jacob instructed his sons to carry his body to be buried in Canaan, assigning specific roles to each son based on direction, advising them to honor each other, serve the Lord, forgive each other's transgressions, and protect one another. Aaron is not allowed to enter the land assigned to the Israelites because he disobeyed God's command regarding the Waters of Meribah, and uncircumcised males who fail to circumcise themselves will be cut off from their kin for breaking God's covenant.

## Genesis 50

|וַיִּפֹּ֥ל יוֹסֵ֖ף עַל־פְּנֵ֣י אָבִ֑יו וַיֵּ֥בְךְּ עָלָ֖יו וַיִּשַּׁק־לֽוֹ׃|1 J|Joseph flung himself upon his father’s face and wept over him and kissed him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph showed emotion and kissed his father Jacob while he was still alive, not dead, as kissing a corpse is forbidden. Some authorities believe there is a mitzva for a couple to have sexual relations upon reuniting after a trip, seen as positive for their relationship. The angels disguised themselves as humans before entering Sodom, and Joseph's premature death was attributed to embalming his father and Judah referring to Jacob as Joseph's servant. Ramban discusses the High Priest's ability to perform Divine Service while in mourning, and Esau reconciles with Jacob after years of estrangement. Yoseif wept over his father, surrounded by chiefs and the Lion of Jehuda, suggesting raising a tall cedar symbolizing the twelve tribes. 

|וַיְצַ֨ו יוֹסֵ֤ף אֶת־עֲבָדָיו֙ אֶת־הָרֹ֣פְאִ֔ים לַחֲנֹ֖ט אֶת־אָבִ֑יו וַיַּחַנְט֥וּ הָרֹפְאִ֖ים אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|2 J|Then Joseph ordered the physicians in his service to embalm his father, and the physicians embalmed Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra suggests Jacob was embalmed to avoid desecration, Rashbam interprets embalming differently, Haamek Davar says Joseph embalmed Jacob to prevent decay, Radak explains embalming prevents putrefaction, Rabbeinu Bahya describes embalming with spices, Or HaChaim is concerned about decay, Rav Hirsch contrasts Egyptian embalming with Jewish beliefs, Rashi mentions aromatic spices, Steinsaltz explains the embalming process, Tze'enah Ure'enah says Jacob's children embalmed him, and Da'at Zekenim says embalming makes the body stench-proof. In Midrash, Moses and Aaron are seen as redeemers, Jacob and Joseph's similarities are highlighted, and Joseph's death before his brothers is attributed to his embalming of Jacob. Siftei Chakhamim explains that Jacob did not die conventionally, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi learns about sales in sea towns from Jacob's burial plot, and Joseph ordered his physician servants to embalm his father Israel. 

|וַיִּמְלְאוּ־לוֹ֙ אַרְבָּעִ֣ים י֔וֹם כִּ֛י כֵּ֥ן יִמְלְא֖וּ יְמֵ֣י הַחֲנֻטִ֑ים וַיִּבְכּ֥וּ אֹת֛וֹ מִצְרַ֖יִם שִׁבְעִ֥ים יֽוֹם׃|3 J|It required forty days, for such is the full period of embalming. The Egyptians bewailed him seventy days;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Egyptians mourned Joseph for seventy days, with forty days spent embalming his body and thirty days of official mourning, signifying respect for Joseph and the blessing he brought to Egypt by ending the famine. The Jews cried out to God in a turning point after a period of suffering, emphasizing the importance of seeking divine intervention. Rabbi Levi explains God's rescue of the Israelites from Egypt as reneging on their honor, similar to rescuing a son from a barbaric country. Rabbi Yochanan's interpretation of Jacob not dying highlights the spiritual powers associated with his names. The number seventy symbolizes peace and agreement in Second Temple practices, contrasting with Egypt's mourning period. In the Talmud, Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet and Rebbi Abbahu discuss the importance of bowing before those in power and the significance of the seventy days between Haman's and Mordechai's letters. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan elaborate on the embalming and mourning process for Joseph, attributing the end of a famine to Jacob's righteousness. 

|וַיַּֽעַבְרוּ֙ יְמֵ֣י בְכִית֔וֹ וַיְדַבֵּ֣ר יוֹסֵ֔ף אֶל־בֵּ֥ית פַּרְעֹ֖ה לֵאמֹ֑ר אִם־נָ֨א מָצָ֤אתִי חֵן֙ בְּעֵ֣ינֵיכֶ֔ם דַּבְּרוּ־נָ֕א בְּאׇזְנֵ֥י פַרְעֹ֖ה לֵאמֹֽר׃|4 J|and when the wailing period was over, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s court, saying, “Do me this favor, and lay this appeal before Pharaoh:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph used intermediaries to request Pharaoh's approval to bury Jacob in Canaan, following the Torah's limit of mourning for thirty days. The Midrash discusses the relationship between fathers and children, contrasting good and wicked children, and highlights Joseph's actions towards Pharaoh's household after Jacob's death. In the wilderness, the staff turned into a snake, avoiding being shown to Pharaoh to prevent being removed from his presence, similar to Joseph's situation. After mourning, Joseph asked Pharaoh's household to speak on his behalf before Pharaoh. 

|אָבִ֞י הִשְׁבִּיעַ֣נִי לֵאמֹ֗ר הִנֵּ֣ה אָנֹכִי֮ מֵת֒ בְּקִבְרִ֗י אֲשֶׁ֨ר כָּרִ֤יתִי לִי֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן שָׁ֖מָּה תִּקְבְּרֵ֑נִי וְעַתָּ֗ה אֶֽעֱלֶה־נָּ֛א וְאֶקְבְּרָ֥ה אֶת־אָבִ֖י וְאָשֽׁוּבָה׃|5 J|‘My father made me swear, saying, “I am about to die. Be sure to bury me in the grave which I made ready for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now, therefore, let me go up and bury my father; then I shall return.’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains "kariti" as "I have digged," Rashbam clarifies Joseph will return to Pharaoh's country after burying Jacob in Canaan, Or HaChaim notes Joseph used "lamor" to prevent Pharaoh from annulling his oath, Rabbeinu Bahya interprets "kariti" as Jacob legally acquiring his grave by paying money, Rashi offers Midrashic explanations, Musar discusses Jacob's behavior, and Talmud delves into the significance of burial sites and oaths. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Jacob's burial request as a solemn oath to Joseph. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֑ה עֲלֵ֛ה וּקְבֹ֥ר אֶת־אָבִ֖יךָ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר הִשְׁבִּיעֶֽךָ׃|6 J|And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you promise on oath.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yoseif was permitted to speak Hebrew to his brothers in private by Pharaoh, who allowed him to bury his father in Canaan after Yoseif reminded Pharaoh of the oath he had made to his father. The burial procession was accompanied by all of Egypt, with chariots and horsemen for protection, and the Divine Presence. Jacob had acquired his burial plot with money from Esau, and Pharaoh ultimately agreed to let Joseph go fulfill his promise to his father. 

|וַיַּ֥עַל יוֹסֵ֖ף לִקְבֹּ֣ר אֶת־אָבִ֑יו וַיַּֽעֲל֨וּ אִתּ֜וֹ כׇּל־עַבְדֵ֤י פַרְעֹה֙ זִקְנֵ֣י בֵית֔וֹ וְכֹ֖ל זִקְנֵ֥י אֶֽרֶץ־מִצְרָֽיִם׃|7 J|So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the officials of Pharaoh, the senior members of his court, and all of Egypt’s dignitaries,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that Pharaoh's servants referred to the Egyptians who accompanied Jacob's body for burial, not all servants in Egypt. Sforno notes Joseph's voluntary journey to bury his father. Rabbeinu Bahya identifies nine groups that traveled to Canaan for Jacob's burial, including Pharaoh's ministers and Joseph's household. The Midrash highlights the honor and rewards received by righteous individuals for their acts of kindness, such as Joseph's burial procession with dignitaries and divine presence. The Mishnah discusses the reciprocity in how one treats others, citing examples like Miriam waiting for Moses and Joseph's merit in burying his father. The Talmud emphasizes the importance of honoring one's father, with Joseph being considered greater than Moses for burying his father with honor. 

|וְכֹל֙ בֵּ֣ית יוֹסֵ֔ף וְאֶחָ֖יו וּבֵ֣ית אָבִ֑יו רַ֗ק טַפָּם֙ וְצֹאנָ֣ם וּבְקָרָ֔ם עָזְב֖וּ בְּאֶ֥רֶץ גֹּֽשֶׁן׃|8 J|together with all of Joseph’s household, his brothers, and his father’s household; only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the region of Goshen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's family and household, along with his brothers and father's household, left only their children, flocks, and cattle in the land of Goshen for the burial of Jacob. The Midrash describes Jacob offering Esau money or a burial plot, with Pharaoh allowing Joseph to fulfill his father's oath to bury him in Canaan. Rashi explains the changing order of mention of Joseph's brothers and the Egyptians in different contexts, reflecting the respect shown to Joseph and his family. The Talmud discusses the burial procession of Jacob, highlighting the honor Joseph showed to his father by leading the funeral procession. The Targum mentions that Joseph's household and his brothers went to bury Jacob, leaving behind their children, sheep, and cattle in Goshen. 

|וַיַּ֣עַל עִמּ֔וֹ גַּם־רֶ֖כֶב גַּם־פָּרָשִׁ֑ים וַיְהִ֥י הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֖ה כָּבֵ֥ד מְאֹֽד׃|9 J|Chariots, too, and horsemen went up with him; it was a very large troop.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph was accompanied by a military escort of chariots and horsemen to Canaan to bury his father Jacob, possibly sent by Pharaoh, with angels guarding them. Miriam and Moses were honored for waiting and burying their family members, and God is said to participate in the burial of righteous individuals. Jacob's burial plot was acquired through money, and Joseph's burial in Canaan was prevented to show respect for Pharaoh. The conflict with Esau's descendants over the burial place led to war, with Joseph ultimately prevailing. 

|וַיָּבֹ֜אוּ עַד־גֹּ֣רֶן הָאָטָ֗ד אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּעֵ֣בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן וַיִּ֨סְפְּדוּ־שָׁ֔ם מִסְפֵּ֛ד גָּד֥וֹל וְכָבֵ֖ד מְאֹ֑ד וַיַּ֧עַשׂ לְאָבִ֛יו אֵ֖בֶל שִׁבְעַ֥ת יָמִֽים׃|10 J|When they came to Goren  ha-Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they held there a very great and solemn lamentation; and he observed a mourning period of seven days for his father.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph observed a seven-day mourning period for Jacob, during which the Egyptians eulogized him greatly, and the location of the mourning, the threshing floor of Atad, was named after an incident where all the kings of Canaan and princes of Ishmael hung their crowns on Jacob's coffin. The obligation of mourning for close relatives is a positive commandment, with the first day being required by Scriptural Law and the following days being rabbinic, and the seven-day mourning period was instituted by Moses. The seven days of consecration for Aaron and his sons symbolize the entire life cycle and the preparation for their life's destiny. The Midrash discusses the mourning period observed by Joseph and his brothers for Jacob, as well as the origins of the seven-day mourning period and the customs and rituals associated with mourning. Rabbi Yitzḥak explains that maggots are painful to the deceased, and Rav Ḥisda says the soul mourns for seven days after death. Joseph and his brothers held a grand funeral and mourned their father for seven days at the threshing place of Atad. 

|וַיַּ֡רְא יוֹשֵׁב֩ הָאָ֨רֶץ הַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֜י אֶת־הָאֵ֗בֶל בְּגֹ֙רֶן֙ הָֽאָטָ֔ד וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ אֵֽבֶל־כָּבֵ֥ד זֶ֖ה לְמִצְרָ֑יִם עַל־כֵּ֞ן קָרָ֤א שְׁמָהּ֙ אָבֵ֣ל מִצְרַ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֖ר בְּעֵ֥בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּֽן׃|11 J|And when the Canaanite inhabitants of the land saw the mourning at Goren ha-Atad, they said, “This is a solemn mourning on the part of the Egyptians.” That is why it was named Abel-mizraim,  which is beyond the Jordan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that on Chanukah, Israel sees the good intellectually through lights, while Purim is celebrated through speaking and Pesach through deed. The Midrash recounts how Jacob's children embalmed him and brought him to the land of Israel, where the Canaanites mourned him, leading to a comparison with the kindness shown by the Egyptians towards Jacob. The Talmud emphasizes Joseph's merit in burying his father and the lesson that even those who do not show kindness can still receive rewards from God. The Tanakh highlights the importance the Egyptians placed on death, as seen in the embalming of Yosef and Yaakov, and their solemn mourning rituals. The Targum describes how the Canaanites mistook the mourning for Jacob as mourning for Egypt, leading to the naming of the place as Egypt's Mourning. 

|וַיַּעֲשׂ֥וּ בָנָ֖יו ל֑וֹ כֵּ֖ן כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוָּֽם׃|12 P|Thus his sons did for him as he had instructed them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob's sons followed his specific instructions for his burial, including who should carry his bier and how they should be positioned around it. Joseph and Levi were excluded from carrying the bier, with Ephraim and Menashe serving as substitutes. This organization was later reflected in the encampment of the tribes in the wilderness, with each tribe following their father's instructions for their placement. 

|וַיִּשְׂא֨וּ אֹת֤וֹ בָנָיו֙ אַ֣רְצָה כְּנַ֔עַן וַיִּקְבְּר֣וּ אֹת֔וֹ בִּמְעָרַ֖ת שְׂדֵ֣ה הַמַּכְפֵּלָ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר קָנָה֩ אַבְרָהָ֨ם אֶת־הַשָּׂדֶ֜ה לַאֲחֻזַּת־קֶ֗בֶר מֵאֵ֛ת עֶפְרֹ֥ן הַחִתִּ֖י עַל־פְּנֵ֥י מַמְרֵֽא׃|13 P|His sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, the field near Mamre, which Abraham had bought for a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob's sons, excluding Levi and Joseph, carried his body to be buried in Canaan as per his instructions, with Ephraim and Manasseh participating. Judah's wife was considered a Canaanite due to her father being a trader. The Talmud explains that Joseph was chosen to bury Jacob to honor him, while the Targum recounts how Esau tried to prevent Jacob's burial in the cave of Machpelah. 

|וַיָּ֨שׇׁב יוֹסֵ֤ף מִצְרַ֙יְמָה֙ ה֣וּא וְאֶחָ֔יו וְכׇל־הָעֹלִ֥ים אִתּ֖וֹ לִקְבֹּ֣ר אֶת־אָבִ֑יו אַחֲרֵ֖י קׇבְר֥וֹ אֶת־אָבִֽיו׃|14 J|After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

After burying Jacob, Joseph and his family returned safely to Egypt with a royal escort, emphasizing the respect shown to Jacob during the burial. Joseph did not invite his brothers to dine with him after Jacob's death, causing them to fear his revenge, but they fabricated Jacob's dying wish for Joseph to forgive them. The mishna discusses Joseph's honor in burying his father Jacob, questioning the order of importance between Joseph's brothers and the Egyptians who accompanied him to the burial. Joseph's return to Egypt after burying Jacob shows that none of those who accompanied him died on the way. 

|וַיִּרְא֤וּ אֲחֵֽי־יוֹסֵף֙ כִּי־מֵ֣ת אֲבִיהֶ֔ם וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ ל֥וּ יִשְׂטְמֵ֖נוּ יוֹסֵ֑ף וְהָשֵׁ֤ב יָשִׁיב֙ לָ֔נוּ אֵ֚ת כׇּל־הָ֣רָעָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר גָּמַ֖לְנוּ אֹתֽוֹ׃|15 J|When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph still bears a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrong that we did him!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

After Jacob's death, Joseph's brothers feared his resentment due to their past actions, but Joseph reassured them that their repentance had turned their sins into merits as intended by Hashem. The brothers believed Joseph's separate table was a sign of revenge and sought forgiveness, claiming their actions were commanded by God. Joseph's forgiveness was followed by a display of humility and reconciliation, emphasizing the importance of peace and preventing strict judgment. The phrase "we wish that we had died" is explained as not conditional, and the idea that Jacob did not truly die is discussed, referencing other righteous individuals believed to still be alive after physical death. 

|וַיְצַוּ֕וּ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֖ף לֵאמֹ֑ר אָבִ֣יךָ צִוָּ֔ה לִפְנֵ֥י מוֹת֖וֹ לֵאמֹֽר׃|16 J|So they sent this message to Joseph, “Before his death your father left this instruction:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers sent discreet messengers to Joseph, falsely claiming their father had commanded them to do so for the sake of peace, using the sons of Bilhah out of fear Joseph had not forgiven them. R. Simeon emphasized the importance of peace offerings and the power of peace in maintaining relationships. Peace is considered essential for fear of God and pursuing peace can lead to reconciliation and blessings, even with enemies. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel highlighted how the brothers lied about their father's command to maintain peace between Joseph and his brethren, as seen in Genesis 50:16-17 and reiterated in Yevamot 65b:7. The Targums specify that Yoseif was told his father had commanded before his death to speak to him, with Bilhah's descendants delivering the message. 

|כֹּֽה־תֹאמְר֣וּ לְיוֹסֵ֗ף אָ֣נָּ֡א שָׂ֣א נָ֠א פֶּ֣שַׁע אַחֶ֤יךָ וְחַטָּאתָם֙ כִּי־רָעָ֣ה גְמָל֔וּךָ וְעַתָּה֙ שָׂ֣א נָ֔א לְפֶ֥שַׁע עַבְדֵ֖י אֱלֹהֵ֣י אָבִ֑יךָ וַיֵּ֥בְךְּ יוֹסֵ֖ף בְּדַבְּרָ֥ם אֵלָֽיו׃|17 J|So shall you say to Joseph, ‘Forgive, I urge you, the offense and guilt of your brothers who treated you so harshly.’ Therefore, please forgive the offense of the servants of the God of your father’s [house].” And Joseph was in tears as they spoke to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's forgiveness is sought by his brothers on behalf of their father's God, emphasizing their shared faith and the importance of peace and forgiveness in Jewish tradition. The importance of seeking forgiveness and maintaining peace is highlighted in various commentaries, prayers, and teachings, with instances where altering the truth is permissible for good intentions. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina advises asking for forgiveness no more than three times, and Rabbi Ile’a states that deviating from the truth for the sake of peace is acceptable. Yoseif is asked to forgive his brothers for their transgression, showing the significance of seeking forgiveness and reconciliation in Jewish thought and teachings. 

|וַיֵּלְכוּ֙ גַּם־אֶחָ֔יו וַֽיִּפְּל֖וּ לְפָנָ֑יו וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ הִנֶּ֥נּֽוּ לְךָ֖ לַעֲבָדִֽים׃|18 J|His brothers went to him themselves, flung themselves before him, and said, “We are prepared to be your slaves.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Treating people with contempt is seen as unholy avodah in Chasidut, exemplified by Joseph's brothers who ended up falling into slavery after not believing he would become a ruler. The importance of submitting to divine will in difficult times is emphasized in Midrash, with examples from various biblical figures. Musar highlights Judah's redemption through self-sacrifice, contrasting with his brothers' sorrow for their role in Joseph's sale. In Talmud, it is stated that one must bow down and submit to the fox in its hour, as seen with Joseph's brothers bowing before him. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both state that Joseph's brothers declared themselves to be his servants in Genesis 50:18. 

|וַיֹּ֧אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֛ם יוֹסֵ֖ף אַל־תִּירָ֑אוּ כִּ֛י הֲתַ֥חַת אֱלֹהִ֖ים אָֽנִי׃|19 J|But Joseph said to them, “Have no fear! Am I a substitute for God?|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph reassures his brothers that he is not in the place of God to punish them, emphasizing that only God can grant atonement for their sins. He highlights his fear of God and understanding that revenge is not his role as a human, as seen in Genesis 50:19 and various commentaries. Abraham declares himself appointed by God, not by men, to control body and external things, positioning himself between body and soul. Yoseif, in the Targum, reassures his brothers that he will not harm them, acknowledging that all human thoughts are known to the Lord. 

|וְאַתֶּ֕ם חֲשַׁבְתֶּ֥ם עָלַ֖י רָעָ֑ה אֱלֹהִים֙ חֲשָׁבָ֣הּ לְטֹבָ֔ה לְמַ֗עַן עֲשֹׂ֛ה כַּיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּ֖ה לְהַחֲיֹ֥ת עַם־רָֽב׃|20 J|Besides, although you intended me harm, God intended it for good, so as to bring about the present result—the survival of many people.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of not judging others harshly and always praying for the ability to judge favorably, while the commentators on Genesis 50:20:1 discuss how the brothers' harmful actions were ultimately part of God's plan for good. Jewish Thought explores themes of sibling rivalry, reconciliation, and divine intervention in the Book of Genesis, highlighting the complex relationships between Joseph and his brothers, as well as Yehudah and Tamar. The Midrash illustrates how Joseph's actions align with the commandments given in the Torah, emphasizing compassion, forgiveness, and generosity towards his family. Quoting Commentary and Tanakh both focus on Joseph reassuring his brothers that God intended their actions for good, leading to the saving of many lives, while Targum interprets Genesis 50:20 as Joseph acknowledging that God's intentions prevailed over his brothers' evil actions. 

|וְעַתָּה֙ אַל־תִּירָ֔אוּ אָנֹכִ֛י אֲכַלְכֵּ֥ל אֶתְכֶ֖ם וְאֶֽת־טַפְּכֶ֑ם וַיְנַחֵ֣ם אוֹתָ֔ם וַיְדַבֵּ֖ר עַל־לִבָּֽם׃|21 J|And so, fear not. I will sustain you and your dependents.”  Thus he reassured them, speaking kindly to them.|

Joseph's words to his brothers came from his heart, comforting them and reassuring them of his forgiveness and support, using logic to demonstrate his sincerity and emphasizing the importance of reconciliation and forgiveness. Joseph's actions also exemplify the importance of guarding one's tongue and deeds, showcasing forgiveness as a foundational concept in Judaism and Christianity. Additionally, the Tosefta highlights the blessings bestowed upon individuals once they arrived at their respective locations, contrasting the prosperity during Joseph and his brothers' time with the challenges faced after their passing. 

|וַיֵּ֤שֶׁב יוֹסֵף֙ בְּמִצְרַ֔יִם ה֖וּא וּבֵ֣ית אָבִ֑יו וַיְחִ֣י יוֹסֵ֔ף מֵאָ֥ה וָעֶ֖שֶׂר שָׁנִֽים׃|22 J|So Joseph and his father’s household remained in Egypt. Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.|

Joseph lived a peaceful life in Egypt for 110 years, raising his grandchildren from Menashe and instilling righteousness in them through his teachings. The Midrash compares the lifespans of various pairs of individuals, highlighting distinct periods of dedication to different pursuits in the lives of Moses, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, and Rabbi Akiva. Jacob reassures his sons of their G-d-fearing nature and spiritual entitlement, acknowledging Joseph's achievements but assuring the others of intimacy with G-d. Rashi explains the Israelites' trust in Moses due to phrases from Jacob and Joseph, while Or HaChaim and Chizkuni offer insights into Isaac's life and the individual value of the Israelites to God. Targum notes that Joseph lived to be 110 years old in Egypt with his father's household. 

|וַיַּ֤רְא יוֹסֵף֙ לְאֶפְרַ֔יִם בְּנֵ֖י שִׁלֵּשִׁ֑ים גַּ֗ם בְּנֵ֤י מָכִיר֙ בֶּן־מְנַשֶּׁ֔ה יֻלְּד֖וּ עַל־בִּרְכֵּ֥י יוֹסֵֽף׃|23 J E|Joseph lived to see children of the third generation of Ephraim; the children of Machir son of Manasseh were likewise born upon Joseph’s knees.|

Chasidut explains that the messiah from the house of David will come after the messiah from the house of Joseph, with the process starting with Elijah and Joseph, and ending with David. The mention of a third generation of Ephrayim in Genesis 50:23 alludes to the messiah from the house of Joseph being a descendant of Ephrayim. Commentary from various sources discusses the role of Joseph in raising righteous descendants, with Rashi clarifying that he raised his descendants on his knees. Midrash highlights the offerings made by Jacob and Joseph, symbolizing blessings and wisdom. Quoting Commentary delves into interpretations of specific terms and actions related to Joseph's descendants. Targum mentions Joseph raising Machir's sons and circumcising Menasheh's sons. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ אֶל־אֶחָ֔יו אָנֹכִ֖י מֵ֑ת וֵֽאלֹהִ֞ים פָּקֹ֧ד יִפְקֹ֣ד אֶתְכֶ֗ם וְהֶעֱלָ֤ה אֶתְכֶם֙ מִן־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֔את אֶל־הָאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּ֛ע לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם לְיִצְחָ֖ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹֽב׃|24 E|At length, Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. God will surely take notice of you and bring you up from this land to the land promised on oath to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph instructed his brothers to take his remains to Canaan before his death, preparing them for future suffering and redemption. The double letters in the Torah symbolize different redemption stories, highlighting hope and resilience throughout the Hebrew Bible. The Midrash discusses the significance of prayer, true redeemers, and divine visitation, while Musar explores spiritual connections to the land of Israel and the restoration of G-d's Presence. The tradition of "pakod pakad'ti" signifies the true redeemer of the Jewish people, Moses' question about God's name, and the Jewish people's sense of exile. Additionally, Joseph believed in the preservation of the soul and bodily pleasures in Egypt, while God promises to bring the Israelites into the Promised Land in the Tanakh. Yoseif's message in the Targum emphasizes the fulfillment of the promise to the patriarchs. 

|וַיַּשְׁבַּ֣ע יוֹסֵ֔ף אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לֵאמֹ֑ר פָּקֹ֨ד יִפְקֹ֤ד אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶתְכֶ֔ם וְהַעֲלִתֶ֥ם אֶת־עַצְמֹתַ֖י מִזֶּֽה׃|25 E|So Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “When God has taken notice of you, you shall carry up my bones from here.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph made the Children of Israel swear to take his remains out of Egypt upon their redemption, which Moses fulfilled by bringing Joseph's bones to be buried in the land of Israel, ensuring they would not be worshipped. This act symbolizes the Jewish people's covenant with fate and their sense of isolation, with a deep connection to their community and alienation from the outside world. The repetition of "God will surely remember you" by Yaakov and Yoseif highlights the significance of suffering as a means of inspiring repentance and prayer, linking Yoseif's request to his Jewish identity and the eventual redemption of the Israelites. 

|וַיָּ֣מׇת יוֹסֵ֔ף בֶּן־מֵאָ֥ה וָעֶ֖שֶׂר שָׁנִ֑ים וַיַּחַנְט֣וּ אֹת֔וֹ וַיִּ֥ישֶׂם בָּאָר֖וֹן בְּמִצְרָֽיִם׃|26 E|Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years; and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.|

The text discusses the descent of Divine light into materiality to elevate Torah, highlighting Joseph's descent to Egypt as an example. Commentary delves into the significance of Joseph's preparation of his own coffin and Moses retrieving his remains. R. Nathan believed Joseph's grave was in royal tombs, emphasizing his righteousness. Musar emphasizes prioritizing spiritual service over bodily pleasures, citing the Zohar as an example. The Patriarchal Narratives in Genesis focus on God's promises and struggles of each generation. In Exodus 40:38, a cloud of יהוה rested over the Tabernacle by day, with fire appearing at night.
