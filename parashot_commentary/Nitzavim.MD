|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses ten levels of individuals in Israel, interconnected and representing different attributes, emphasizing the importance of Torah study and the interconnectedness of all individuals in their spiritual journey towards God. Some Canaanites converted during Moses' time were assigned as woodcutters and water drawers, with male slaves as woodcutters and female slaves as water drawers. The greater Sages of Israel, despite facing challenges, were dedicated to Torah study, passing down teachings from Moses. The text highlights the importance of rewarding those who bring children to learn Torah, emphasizing the significance of righteous individuals in protecting the community and the world. The Gemara discusses a decree against the Gibeonites, concluding that Moses decreed for that generation to remain separate while David decreed for all generations. The Gibeonites deceived the Israelites in Joshua 9:4, and God gave commandments to the Israelites through Moses near Jericho in Numbers 36:13. The Targums mention the inclusion of young children, wives, and foreigners in the camps of the Israelites, specifically mentioning woodcutters and water drawers. 

|לְעׇבְרְךָ֗ בִּבְרִ֛ית יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ וּבְאָלָת֑וֹ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ כֹּרֵ֥ת עִמְּךָ֖ הַיּֽוֹם׃|11|to enter into the covenant of your God יהוה, which your God יהוה is concluding with you this day, with its sanctions;  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that entering the Covenant of Hashem involves thoughts, not just actions, as thoughts are important for being close to God. The blessing for Eretz Yisrael should include thanks at the beginning and end, mentioning the land, sustenance, and qualities of Eretz Yisrael, as well as the covenant of circumcision and the Torah. Moses presents a threefold picture of the moral platform of the Jewish people, emphasizing the importance of leadership in guiding individuals towards closeness to G'd. Rabbi Pinḥas interpreted the significance of the covenant and oath made between God and the Israelites, highlighting the consequences of violating this covenant. Ramban explains the fear of the king of the Philistines towards Isaac due to the covenant made with Abraham, while Rashi discusses the importance of not violating the covenant made with God at Horeb. Rebbi Eleazar explains the significance of saying "Amen" for acceptance, an oath, and confirming words, as seen in various biblical verses. Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Targum Jerusalem all refer to entering into the covenant of the Lord your God and remembering the oath made to avoid transgressions. 

|לְמַ֣עַן הָקִֽים־אֹתְךָ֩ הַיּ֨וֹם ׀ ל֜וֹ לְעָ֗ם וְה֤וּא יִֽהְיֶה־לְּךָ֙ לֵֽאלֹהִ֔ים כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּר־לָ֑ךְ וְכַאֲשֶׁ֤ר נִשְׁבַּע֙ לַאֲבֹתֶ֔יךָ לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם לְיִצְחָ֖ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹֽב׃|12|in order to establish you this day as God’s people and in order to be your God, as promised you and as sworn to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Bnei Yisrael's partnership in creation and ability to reveal divine light, while the covenant between God and the Israelites ensures their eternal relationship and commitment. Jewish Thought highlights the covenant of mutual responsibility between Israel and God, requiring Israel to walk in God's ways. The Midrash discusses the brokenness of the soul and the consequences of breaking covenants with God, emphasizing the unique relationship between Israel and God. The Targum emphasizes God's sustenance and role as a God to the people of Israel, fulfilling promises to their forefathers. 

|וְלֹ֥א אִתְּכֶ֖ם לְבַדְּכֶ֑ם אָנֹכִ֗י כֹּרֵת֙ אֶת־הַבְּרִ֣ית הַזֹּ֔את וְאֶת־הָאָלָ֖ה הַזֹּֽאת׃|13|I make this covenant, with its sanctions, not with you alone,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The covenant made with the Israelites at that time included future generations, emphasizing the obligation to ensure offspring followed the Torah. God's choice of the Jewish people was not based on their deeds, but on a more encompassing choice. The covenant between God and Israel is eternal and compared to a father-child relationship, with consequences for breaking it. Ramban emphasizes the importance of transmitting the memory of miracles to future generations through commandments like phylacteries and the Sh'ma. Moses administered an oath to the Jewish people in the plains of Moab, emphasizing the divine nature of the covenant. The covenant and oath-curse are made with both the Israelites and future generations. 

|כִּי֩ אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֨ר יֶשְׁנ֜וֹ פֹּ֗ה עִמָּ֙נוּ֙ עֹמֵ֣ד הַיּ֔וֹם לִפְנֵ֖י יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֑ינוּ וְאֵ֨ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵינֶ֛נּוּ פֹּ֖ה עִמָּ֥נוּ הַיּֽוֹם׃|14|but both with those who are standing here with us this day before our God יהוה and with those who are not with us here this day.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The covenant made by Moses with the Israelites extends to future generations, ensuring continuity and inclusivity in the faith. The prophets received their prophecies at Mount Sinai, with all souls present at the giving of the Torah. The concept of the soul being punished for sins in a previous life or returning to different bodies is refuted, emphasizing reliance on spiritual opinions. Vows and oaths must be taken seriously, with mental reservations not valid for future generations. God's covenant is with all generations, past and future, standing before Him. 

|כִּֽי־אַתֶּ֣ם יְדַעְתֶּ֔ם אֵ֥ת אֲשֶׁר־יָשַׁ֖בְנוּ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם וְאֵ֧ת אֲשֶׁר־עָבַ֛רְנוּ בְּקֶ֥רֶב הַגּוֹיִ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר עֲבַרְתֶּֽם׃|15|Well you know that we dwelt in the land of Egypt and that we passed through the midst of various other nations;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites were warned against idolatry, having seen the abominations of Egypt and other nations, with the Torah serving as a guide to prevent them from being led astray. The survivors of the Exodus who had lived through the slavery in Egypt were still present, highlighting the importance of remaining loyal to God and the consequences of turning towards idolatry. The first commandment caused a great upheaval in nature and even the dead in Sheol to revive, while the Targum mentions the specific years the Israelites spent in Egypt and the miracles they experienced during their journey. 

|וַתִּרְאוּ֙ אֶת־שִׁקּ֣וּצֵיהֶ֔ם וְאֵ֖ת גִּלֻּלֵיהֶ֑ם עֵ֣ץ וָאֶ֔בֶן כֶּ֥סֶף וְזָהָ֖ב אֲשֶׁ֥ר עִמָּהֶֽם׃|16|and you have seen the detestable things and the fetishes of wood and stone, silver and gold, that they keep.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Idols are considered abominable because they are detestable like dung, easily replaced, unable to guard themselves, and lead to theft and promiscuity, emphasizing the importance of accepting the covenant. Halakhah states that objects found on the head of an idol in a deferential manner are forbidden, while Talmud discusses the prohibition of coveting silver and gold on idolatrous objects. The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 29:16 highlight the presence of abominable idols made of wood, stone, silver, and gold owned by the people. 

|פֶּן־יֵ֣שׁ בָּ֠כֶ֠ם אִ֣ישׁ אֽוֹ־אִשָּׁ֞ה א֧וֹ מִשְׁפָּחָ֣ה אוֹ־שֵׁ֗בֶט אֲשֶׁר֩ לְבָב֨וֹ פֹנֶ֤ה הַיּוֹם֙ מֵעִם֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֔ינוּ לָלֶ֣כֶת לַעֲבֹ֔ד אֶת־אֱלֹהֵ֖י הַגּוֹיִ֣ם הָהֵ֑ם פֶּן־יֵ֣שׁ בָּכֶ֗ם שֹׁ֛רֶשׁ פֹּרֶ֥ה רֹ֖אשׁ וְלַעֲנָֽה׃|17|Perchance there is among you some man or woman, or some clan or tribe, whose heart is even now turning away from our God יהוה to go and worship the gods of those nations—perchance there is among you a stock sprouting poison weed and wormwood.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes maintaining faith and rejecting evil thoughts, striving to bind the soul with simple faith to God. The Commentary discusses the introduction of an oath to prevent idol worship and warns against devious attempts to avoid punishment. Halakhah explains the tradition of saying "Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom forever" after the Shema. Kabbalah highlights belief in the Ruler of the world and consequences for denial. Midrash discusses Moses' request for a priest from a specific tribe and the importance of serving God. Musar warns against exploiting the community's merit for protection and describes the severity of evil speech. Quoting Commentary includes interpretations by Ramban, Tur HaArokh, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rashi, Or HaChaim, Simchat HaRegel, and Nachal Eshkol. Tanakh criticizes the perversion of justice and righteousness, urging people to seek God. Targum warns against turning away from serving God to worship idols. 

|וְהָיָ֡ה בְּשׇׁמְעוֹ֩ אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֨י הָאָלָ֜ה הַזֹּ֗את וְהִתְבָּרֵ֨ךְ בִּלְבָב֤וֹ לֵאמֹר֙ שָׁל֣וֹם יִֽהְיֶה־לִּ֔י כִּ֛י בִּשְׁרִר֥וּת לִבִּ֖י אֵלֵ֑ךְ לְמַ֛עַן סְפ֥וֹת הָרָוָ֖ה אֶת־הַצְּמֵאָֽה׃|18|When hearing the words of these sanctions, they may imagine a special immunity, thinking, “I shall be safe, though I follow my own willful heart”—to the utter ruin of moist and dry alike.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of belief in the power of prayers and Torah study, leading to mindful actions done for the sake of God.

Musar contrasts the righteous and the wicked in terms of reward and punishment, with the souls of the wicked compared to chaff. Quoting Commentary delves into interpretations of specific words in biblical texts, while the Talmud warns against actions that lead to sin. Targum warns against following one's own desires and unintentionally adding sins to intentional ones. 

|לֹא־יֹאבֶ֣ה יְהֹוָה֮ סְלֹ֣חַֽ לוֹ֒ כִּ֣י אָ֠ז יֶעְשַׁ֨ן אַף־יְהֹוָ֤ה וְקִנְאָתוֹ֙ בָּאִ֣ישׁ הַה֔וּא וְרָ֤בְצָה בּוֹ֙ כׇּל־הָ֣אָלָ֔ה הַכְּתוּבָ֖ה בַּסֵּ֣פֶר הַזֶּ֑ה וּמָחָ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־שְׁמ֔וֹ מִתַּ֖חַת הַשָּׁמָֽיִם׃|19|יהוה will never forgive that party.  Rather, יהוה’s anger and passion will rage against them, till every sanction recorded in this book comes down upon them, and יהוה blots out their name from under heaven.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses God's decision to give humans free will despite advice against it, Israel's livelihood being determined on the first day of Tishrey, consequences of violating the covenant with God including curses and erasure of names, Miriam's punishment for criticizing Moses, warning against exploiting community merit, the importance of personal Torah observance, the severity of punishments for forbidden relationships, and the consequences of sins following the individual throughout life. The Talmud warns against inappropriate marriages and performing favors without notification, while the Targum emphasizes that God will not forgive those who sin. 

|וְהִבְדִּיל֤וֹ יְהֹוָה֙ לְרָעָ֔ה מִכֹּ֖ל שִׁבְטֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל כְּכֹל֙ אָל֣וֹת הַבְּרִ֔ית הַכְּתוּבָ֕ה בְּסֵ֥פֶר הַתּוֹרָ֖ה הַזֶּֽה׃|20|[As for such a clan or tribe,] יהוה will single it out from all the tribes of Israel for misfortune, in accordance with all the sanctions of the covenant recorded in this book of Teaching.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses G'd singling out individuals or tribes for good or evil, with references to the origins of Jewish souls, potential separation of souls for punishment, and unique consequences for those who go against the Torah. Reuben's act of rearranging Bilhah's bed was seen as defending his mother's honor without sinning. Certain events not explicitly in the Torah, like Moses' death, are still considered part of it. Adonoy will separate individuals for harm or evil from all the tribes of Israel based on the covenant's oath-curses. 

|וְאָמַ֞ר הַדּ֣וֹר הָאַחֲר֗וֹן בְּנֵיכֶם֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר יָק֙וּמוּ֙ מֵאַ֣חֲרֵיכֶ֔ם וְהַ֨נׇּכְרִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָבֹ֖א מֵאֶ֣רֶץ רְחוֹקָ֑ה וְ֠רָא֠וּ אֶת־מַכּ֞וֹת הָאָ֤רֶץ הַהִוא֙ וְאֶת־תַּ֣חֲלֻאֶ֔יהָ אֲשֶׁר־חִלָּ֥ה יְהֹוָ֖ה בָּֽהּ׃|21|And later generations will ask—the children who succeed you, and foreigners who come from distant lands and see the plagues and diseases that יהוה has inflicted upon that land,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Future generations, including foreigners, will inquire about disasters in Israel as a result of breaching the covenant and idolatry, understanding them as punishments from Hashem. The term gentile-stranger refers to non-Jews outside of autonomous Jewish societies. Ibn Ezra explains that God pleased to chastise the suffering servant with exile, similar to the sicknesses laid upon Israel. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos mention that future generations and foreigners will witness the plagues and illnesses inflicted by the Lord on the land. 

|גׇּפְרִ֣ית וָמֶ֘לַח֮ שְׂרֵפָ֣ה כׇל־אַרְצָהּ֒ לֹ֤א תִזָּרַע֙ וְלֹ֣א תַצְמִ֔חַ וְלֹא־יַעֲלֶ֥ה בָ֖הּ כׇּל־עֵ֑שֶׂב כְּֽמַהְפֵּכַ֞ת סְדֹ֤ם וַעֲמֹרָה֙ אַדְמָ֣ה אֲשֶׁר֙ הָפַ֣ךְ יְהֹוָ֔ה בְּאַפּ֖וֹ וּבַחֲמָתֽוֹ׃|22|all its soil devastated by sulfur and salt, beyond sowing and producing, no grass growing in it, just like the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which יהוה overthrew in fierce anger—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text warns of the consequences of forsaking God and serving other gods, comparing the destruction of the land with brimstone and salt to that of Sodom and Gomorrah. Various commentaries and texts emphasize the severe punishment for disobedience and idol worship, with references to specific verses and historical events highlighting the importance of upholding moral values and avoiding immoral behavior. 

|וְאָֽמְרוּ֙ כׇּל־הַגּוֹיִ֔ם עַל־מֶ֨ה עָשָׂ֧ה יְהֹוָ֛ה כָּ֖כָה לָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֑את מֶ֥ה חֳרִ֛י הָאַ֥ף הַגָּד֖וֹל הַזֶּֽה׃|23|all nations will ask, “Why did יהוה do thus to this land? Wherefore that awful wrath?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbi Yitzchak explains that the Israelites refused to repent in Israel but did so after being exiled, leading to God's promise to never forget them. Rashbam emphasizes the importance of atonement before settling in the Holy Land, while Ramban stresses the commandment to remember the exodus and fundamental principles of faith. The Talmud discusses baking bread as thin cakes to save effort, and the importance of setting boundaries to prevent wrongdoing is highlighted in Avot DeRabbi Natan. The Targums emphasize that all nations will question why God has brought destruction upon the land. 

|וְאָ֣מְר֔וּ עַ֚ל אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָזְב֔וּ אֶת־בְּרִ֥ית יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתָ֑ם אֲשֶׁר֙ כָּרַ֣ת עִמָּ֔ם בְּהוֹצִיא֥וֹ אֹתָ֖ם מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|24|They will be told, “Because they forsook the covenant that יהוה, God of their ancestors, made with them upon freeing them from the land of Egypt;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The anger of God towards the Israelites in Deuteronomy 29:24 was due to their forsaking of the covenant made with Him, as explained by Rashbam, Steinsaltz, and Da'at Zekenim. The Talmud expresses a willingness to endure punishments in order to achieve redemption. Ramban interprets that blessings mentioned in the Torah are hidden miracles that will be evident when the whole nation is righteous, and discusses the role of physicians in relation to G’d's will. Rabbi Yosei believed that Eretz Yisrael was cursed with brimstone and salt for seven years as punishment for forsaking the covenant of the Lord, based on a verbal analogy between the duration of the curse and a covenant mentioned in the Bible. The people will explain that they were punished because they abandoned the covenant made with God when they were brought out of Egypt, as seen in Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 29:24. 

|וַיֵּלְכ֗וּ וַיַּֽעַבְדוּ֙ אֱלֹהִ֣ים אֲחֵרִ֔ים וַיִּֽשְׁתַּחֲו֖וּ לָהֶ֑ם אֱלֹהִים֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹֽא־יְדָע֔וּם וְלֹ֥א חָלַ֖ק לָהֶֽם׃|25|they turned to the service of other gods and worshiped them, gods whom they had not experienced  and whom [God] had not allotted  to them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites worshipped unfamiliar Canaanite gods not assigned to them by God, lacking knowledge of their divine powers and prostrating themselves before idols. The Talmud discusses the importance of making fences around the Torah and words, citing examples from Adam, Moses, Job, and the Prophets. The Targum highlights how the Israelites turned away from God to worship foreign gods not allotted to them. 

|וַיִּחַר־אַ֥ף יְהֹוָ֖ה בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֑וא לְהָבִ֤יא עָלֶ֙יהָ֙ אֶת־כׇּל־הַקְּלָלָ֔ה הַכְּתוּבָ֖ה בַּסֵּ֥פֶר הַזֶּֽה׃|26|So יהוה was incensed at that land and brought upon it all the curses recorded in this book.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Steinsaltz explains that Deuteronomy 29:26 discusses the punishment for turning away from God. The commentary also highlights the consequences of disobedience and lack of faith. The Halakhah mentions how the Israelites harm each other due to their sense of importance, emphasizing the need for righteousness to prevent further destruction. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that God's anger was aimed at the land, resulting in the fulfillment of all curses in Deuteronomy. 

|וַיִּתְּשֵׁ֤ם יְהֹוָה֙ מֵעַ֣ל אַדְמָתָ֔ם בְּאַ֥ף וּבְחֵמָ֖ה וּבְקֶ֣צֶף גָּד֑וֹל וַיַּשְׁלִכֵ֛ם אֶל־אֶ֥רֶץ אַחֶ֖רֶת כַּיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|27|יהוה uprooted them from their soil in anger, fury, and great wrath, and cast them into another land, as is still the case.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various Jewish texts discuss the exile of the Israelites as a punishment for their actions, with differing opinions on the fate of the ten tribes and the significance of settling in Erez Yisra'el. The Talmud and Mishnah mention that certain groups will not have a share in the World-to-Come, while the Tanakh and Targum emphasize the consequences of disobedience and the divine anger leading to exile. 

|הַנִּ֨סְתָּרֹ֔ת לַיהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֑ינוּ וְהַנִּגְלֹ֞ת לָ֤ׄנׄוּׄ וּׄלְׄבָׄנֵ֙ׄיׄנׄוּ֙ׄ עַׄד־עוֹלָ֔ם לַעֲשׂ֕וֹת אֶת־כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֖י הַתּוֹרָ֥ה הַזֹּֽאת׃|28|Concealed acts concern our God יהוה; but with overt acts, it is for us and our children ever to apply all the provisions of this Teaching.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes God's ongoing creative force in daily prayers, Torah and mitzvot connect physical and celestial realms, differing opinions in Torah interpretation are part of God's words, and separating chochma for Hashem elevates actions. Halakhah discusses the role of prophets, eternal Torah commandments, and the principle of suretyship.

## Deuteronomy 30

|וְהָיָה֩ כִֽי־יָבֹ֨אוּ עָלֶ֜יךָ כׇּל־הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֗לֶּה הַבְּרָכָה֙ וְהַקְּלָלָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לְפָנֶ֑יךָ וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ֙ אֶל־לְבָבֶ֔ךָ בְּכׇ֨ל־הַגּוֹיִ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֧ר הִדִּיחֲךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה׃|1|When all these things befall you—the blessing and the curse that I have set before you—and you take them to heart amidst the various nations to which your God יהוה has banished you,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the unity of God's aspects, the need for repentance, and the inner righteousness of sinners. Halakhah and Jewish Thought discuss repentance as crucial for Israel's redemption, with affliction leading to redemption. Kabbalah delves into the symbolism of the moon-Levanah and the consequences of Adam's actions on the Tree of Knowledge. Midrash connects exile to sin, highlighting the hope for repentance and redemption. Musar and the Quoting Commentary stress the transformative power of blessings and curses, the importance of repentance, and the promise of ultimate redemption for Israel. Targum mentions the return to God's fear in the face of blessings and curses. 

|וְשַׁבְתָּ֞ עַד־יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ וְשָׁמַעְתָּ֣ בְקֹל֔וֹ כְּכֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר־אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם אַתָּ֣ה וּבָנֶ֔יךָ בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ׃|2|and you return to your God יהוה, and you and your children heed God’s command with all your heart and soul, just as I enjoin upon you this day,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of repentance and returning to God with all one's heart and soul, serving Him and keeping His commandments to hasten redemption. Halakhah stresses the need for repentance for redemption, especially after the Holocaust, to fulfill the divine mission of the Jewish people. Jewish Thought highlights the connection between Israel and God through laws like circumcision and the Sabbath, comparing them to a sick person hoping for recovery. Musar discusses how God accepts repentance even from sinners, renewing a pure spirit within them, and emphasizes the importance of fulfilling all aspects of the Torah for spiritual well-being. Quoting Commentary references various interpretations of repentance and redemption in different biblical verses. Targum emphasizes the command to return to God and obey His word wholeheartedly for repentance to be favored for the upright, even after sinning. 

|וְשָׁ֨ב יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ אֶת־שְׁבוּתְךָ֖ וְרִחֲמֶ֑ךָ וְשָׁ֗ב וְקִבֶּצְךָ֙ מִכׇּל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֧ר הֱפִֽיצְךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ שָֽׁמָּה׃|3|then your God יהוה will restore your fortunes  and take you back in love.  [God] will bring you together again from all the peoples where your God יהוה has scattered you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of teshuvah for reuniting with God after a period of exile, while Halakhah discusses the restoration of Temple service and observance of statutes for Israel's redemption. Jewish Thought highlights the need for refinement through exile before a permanent home for G-d, and Kabbalah explains the titles of God and His Indwelling Presence with the returning people. Liturgy includes prayers for the gathering of dispersed congregations and blessings upon Israel, while Midrash emphasizes the Divine Presence with the Israelites in exile and their ultimate redemption through repentance. Musar stresses the importance of repentance for redemption, and Responsa caution against attempts to predict the exact date of the Messiah's arrival. Talmud and Tanakh both discuss the Divine Presence with the Jewish people in exile and upon their redemption, while Targum emphasizes God's mercy and favor upon the repentance of the exiles. 

|אִם־יִהְיֶ֥ה נִֽדַּחֲךָ֖ בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם מִשָּׁ֗ם יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ וּמִשָּׁ֖ם יִקָּחֶֽךָ׃|4|Even if your outcasts are at the ends of the world,  from there your God יהוה will gather you, from there [God] will fetch you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains the metaphorical nature of the "uttermost parts of heaven" in Deuteronomy 30:4, with the JPS 1985 Footnotes clarifying "sky" as the literal translation. The Messianic king will rebuild the Temple, gather the dispersed of Israel, and restore observance of Torah statutes. Jewish belief holds that exile was a result of sins but eventual repentance will lead to forgiveness and return to the land. The Liturgy and Midrash emphasize God's promise to gather the dispersed from all corners of the earth, as stated in Deuteronomy 30:4. The belief in the coming of Moshiach is a fundamental principle of faith, with the Torah testifying to his coming and the ultimate redemption of the Jewish people. 

|וֶהֱבִיאֲךָ֞ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ אֶל־הָאָ֛רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יָרְשׁ֥וּ אֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֑הּ וְהֵיטִֽבְךָ֥ וְהִרְבְּךָ֖ מֵאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ׃|5|And your God יהוה will bring you to the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and [God] will make you more prosperous and more numerous than your ancestors.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Jewish people sanctified the land of Israel twice, with the second sanctification being eternal and linked to a masculine song symbolizing a final redemption. The laws regarding the redemption of houses in walled cities, the coming of the Messiah, and the observance of Sabbatical and Jubilee years are discussed. Abraham's prayers for Ishmael's destiny, the covenant with Abraham and Isaac ensuring the future of Israel, and the importance of anticipating redemption and believing in Moshiach in Musar are highlighted. The Talmudic texts discuss the inheritance and sanctification of the land of Israel, the return of the Jewish people from exile, and biblical obligations regarding the land and Temple. God will bring the Israelites to the land of their forefathers, blessing them and multiplying them more than their ancestors. 

|וּמָ֨ל יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ אֶת־לְבָבְךָ֖ וְאֶת־לְבַ֣ב זַרְעֶ֑ךָ לְאַהֲבָ֞ה אֶת־יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁךָ֖ לְמַ֥עַן חַיֶּֽיךָ׃|6|Then your God יהוה will open up  your heart and the hearts of your offspring—to love your God יהוה with all your heart and soul, in order that you may live.|
|--:|:-:|:--|
