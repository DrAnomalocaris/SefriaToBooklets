## Deuteronomy 7

|וְהָיָ֣ה ׀ עֵ֣קֶב תִּשְׁמְע֗וּן אֵ֤ת הַמִּשְׁפָּטִים֙ הָאֵ֔לֶּה וּשְׁמַרְתֶּ֥ם וַעֲשִׂיתֶ֖ם אֹתָ֑ם וְשָׁמַר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ לְךָ֗ אֶֽת־הַבְּרִית֙ וְאֶת־הַחֶ֔סֶד אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּ֖ע לַאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ׃|12|And if you do obey these rules and observe them carefully, your God יהוה will maintain faithfully for you the covenant made on oath with your fathers:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of showing mercy and kindness to God's creatures, finding joy in performing commandments to please the Creator and understanding the depth of mitzvot for spiritual growth. Commentary highlights the significance of observing all commandments, regardless of perceived importance, to receive great rewards. Kabbalah advises against accepting gifts and emphasizes trust in God to avoid transgressions. Liturgy in Siddur Ashkenaz and Siddur Sefard invokes the covenant of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. Midrash discusses the observance of Shabbat, rewards for mitzvot, and the importance of repentance. Mishnah permits the use of mountains and hills worshipped by gentiles for planting, but forbids what is upon them. Musar stresses humility, resisting sin, and addressing minor sins promptly. Quoting commentary from Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Siftei Chakhamim, Zevach Pesach, Ramban, Da'at Zekenim emphasizes God's promises and consequences for disobedience. Talmud discusses the exclusion of dedicated ones by Joshua, David, Ezra, and God due to sins and refusal to accept offerings. Tanakh and Targum emphasize the importance of following God's laws to receive His covenant and kindness. 

|וַאֲהֵ֣בְךָ֔ וּבֵרַכְךָ֖ וְהִרְבֶּ֑ךָ וּבֵרַ֣ךְ פְּרִֽי־בִטְנְךָ֣ וּפְרִֽי־אַ֠דְמָתֶ֠ךָ דְּגָ֨נְךָ֜ וְתִירֹֽשְׁךָ֣ וְיִצְהָרֶ֗ךָ שְׁגַר־אֲלָפֶ֙יךָ֙ וְעַשְׁתְּרֹ֣ת צֹאנֶ֔ךָ עַ֚ל הָֽאֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־נִשְׁבַּ֥ע לַאֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ לָ֥תֶת לָֽךְ׃|13|[God] will favor you and bless you and multiply you—blessing your issue from the womb and your produce from the soil, your new grain and wine and oil, the calving of your herd and the lambing of your flock, in the land sworn to your fathers to be assigned to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the concept of "sheger," a positive action agreed upon by the Holy One, as a result of observing ordinances out of love for God, leading to blessings, protection, and material wealth. Repentance begins with Adam and Eve's sin, and G-d accepts their repentance by providing protection and the light of Torah. The Shabbat Siddur Sefard Linear discusses blessings for those who love God and follow His commandments. Devarim Rabbah 3:5 emphasizes adherence to laws of family purity, while Musar highlights the love of the Creator as the ultimate reward. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rav Ḥisda discuss blessings and wealth in relation to Deuteronomy 7:13. Ecclesiastes 3:8 highlights the inevitability of experiencing both positive and negative emotions in life, and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 7:13 mentions blessings for the people of Israel. 

|בָּר֥וּךְ תִּֽהְיֶ֖ה מִכׇּל־הָעַמִּ֑ים לֹא־יִהְיֶ֥ה בְךָ֛ עָקָ֥ר וַֽעֲקָרָ֖ה וּבִבְהֶמְתֶּֽךָ׃|14|You shall be blessed above all other peoples: there shall be no sterile male or female among you or among your livestock.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that "עקר" refers to a man who cannot procreate, while Or HaChaim states that the Jewish nation will enjoy blessings such as no genetic barrenness. Halakhah advises regular bowel movements for vitality, Jewish Thought discusses rewards for good deeds within the family and society, Midrash emphasizes blessings of fertility and protection for the Israelites, Musar connects barrenness to the interchanging of male and female souls, and Talmud discusses answering Amen to Gentile blessings. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan highlight the blessings of fertility for the Israelites in Deuteronomy 7:14. 

|וְהֵסִ֧יר יְהֹוָ֛ה מִמְּךָ֖ כׇּל־חֹ֑לִי וְכׇל־מַדְוֵי֩ מִצְרַ֨יִם הָרָעִ֜ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר יָדַ֗עְתָּ לֹ֤א יְשִׂימָם֙ בָּ֔ךְ וּנְתָנָ֖ם בְּכׇל־שֹׂנְאֶֽיךָ׃|15|יהוה will ward off from you all sickness; [God] will not bring upon you any of the dreadful diseases of Egypt, about which you know, but will inflict them upon all your enemies.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how God will reward the Israelites for observing ordinances by removing sickness, including those common in Egypt, from them while afflicting their enemies with these diseases. Halakhah addresses the prohibition of benefiting from idols, sight damage as a form of damage, and burden of proof in extracting possessions. Jewish Thought emphasizes seeking forgiveness for sins and recognizing God's protection, while Liturgy expresses gratitude and requests peace from God. The Midrash explores causes of illnesses and redemption events, and Musar emphasizes remembering God's kindness and seeking protection. Sforno, Ibn Ezra, and Rambam provide explanations on afflictions, while Talmud discusses sickness removal methods and causes. God promises to protect the Israelites from diseases if they obey His laws in the Tanakh, and Targum states that Adonoy will remove illnesses from the Israelites and send them to their enemies. 

|וְאָכַלְתָּ֣ אֶת־כׇּל־הָֽעַמִּ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ נֹתֵ֣ן לָ֔ךְ לֹא־תָח֥וֹס עֵֽינְךָ֖ עֲלֵיהֶ֑ם וְלֹ֤א תַעֲבֹד֙ אֶת־אֱלֹ֣הֵיהֶ֔ם כִּֽי־מוֹקֵ֥שׁ ה֖וּא לָֽךְ׃|16|You shall destroy all the peoples that your God יהוה delivers to you, showing them no pity. And you shall not worship their gods, for that would be a snare to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah commands the Jewish people to consume nations without pity to avoid being led into sin by their gods, warning against misplaced compassion leading to destruction. In Mishneh Torah, bathing with an idol for aesthetic purposes is permitted. Jewish Thought explores the concept of nourishment in relation to different levels of existence, suggesting that the Jewish people, having reached a high spiritual level, are permitted to consume nations that worship idols. The Midrash highlights the symbolism of Israel absorbing the property of other nations and emphasizes unity among the Israelites. In Musar, the promise of the land from the Lord is contingent on not rebelling against Him, with giants in the land to be consumed like bread. Rav Beivai bar Giddel states it is prohibited to rob a gentile, but permitted to retain his lost item without returning it. David spares Saul's life, showing mercy despite having the opportunity to kill him, emphasizing the importance of not showing pity to those whom God wants to destroy. 

|כִּ֤י תֹאמַר֙ בִּלְבָ֣בְךָ֔ רַבִּ֛ים הַגּוֹיִ֥ם הָאֵ֖לֶּה מִמֶּ֑נִּי אֵיכָ֥ה אוּכַ֖ל לְהוֹרִישָֽׁם׃|17|Should you say to yourselves, “These nations are more numerous than we; how can we dispossess them?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 7:17, fear is highlighted as the main obstacle to serving God wholeheartedly, with Rashi warning against being afraid of the nations due to their numbers, Sforno emphasizing that overcoming the Canaanites is possible with God's help, and Siftei Chakhamim clarifying the meaning of the word "כי." Akeidat Yitzchak discusses individual heresy, Moses is reminded not to fear overwhelming odds in battle, and Ma'asseh Hashem explains that relying on God brings fearlessness. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan stress the importance of faith and trust in God's power in facing challenges. 

|לֹ֥א תִירָ֖א מֵהֶ֑ם זָכֹ֣ר תִּזְכֹּ֗ר אֵ֤ת אֲשֶׁר־עָשָׂה֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ לְפַרְעֹ֖ה וּלְכׇל־מִצְרָֽיִם׃|18|You need have no fear of them. You have but to bear in mind what your God יהוה did to Pharaoh and all the Egyptians:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of not fearing enemies but remembering God's power in defeating Pharaoh and Egypt as a reminder of His protection. Memory is crucial in performing mitzvot, with every commandment having significance. Moses is reminded not to fear overwhelming odds in battle, and the message warns against attributing success to one's own strength rather than divine assistance. The text stresses the importance of placing trust in God rather than mortal men, as seen in the downfall of King Saul. 

|הַמַּסֹּ֨ת הַגְּדֹלֹ֜ת אֲשֶׁר־רָא֣וּ עֵינֶ֗יךָ וְהָאֹתֹ֤ת וְהַמֹּֽפְתִים֙ וְהַיָּ֤ד הַחֲזָקָה֙ וְהַזְּרֹ֣עַ הַנְּטוּיָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר הוֹצִֽאֲךָ֖ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ כֵּֽן־יַעֲשֶׂ֞ה יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ לְכׇל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה יָרֵ֖א מִפְּנֵיהֶֽם׃|19|the wondrous acts that you saw with your own eyes, the signs and the portents, the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm by which your God יהוה liberated you. Thus will your God יהוה do to all the peoples you now fear.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that המסות refers to trials, והאתת and והמפתים refer to signs and wonders, והיה החזקה refers to the pestilence, and והזרע הנטיה refers to the outstretched arm. Siftei Chakhamim states that המסות refers to the pestilence, while הזרע הנטיה refers to the sword for smiting the firstborn. Rav Hirsch interprets these terms as representing tests, signs, wonders, strong hand, and outstretched arm as demonstrations of God's power and might. Steinsaltz emphasizes that these events were witnessed by the Israelites and were a display of God's power and ability to protect them. Chizkuni compares "and with awesome power" to Deuteronomy 7:19. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the tests, signs, wonders, strong hand, and extended arm in relation to God's actions in Egypt and against the enemies of the Israelites. These events aim to ennoble one's character by promoting purity, humility, empathy, and love for all beings as children of God, based on principles demonstrated in God's actions and commandments. 

|וְגַם֙ אֶת־הַצִּרְעָ֔ה יְשַׁלַּ֛ח יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ בָּ֑ם עַד־אֲבֹ֗ד הַנִּשְׁאָרִ֛ים וְהַנִּסְתָּרִ֖ים מִפָּנֶֽיךָ׃|20|Your God יהוה will also send a plague  against them, until those who are left in hiding perish before you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators interpret the hornet mentioned in Deuteronomy 7:20 as a natural force that disabled enemies of the Israelites, either through injecting poison or causing illness. Midrash provides insights on different animals and events from scripture, including Solomon facing challenges from demons, the defeat of Sihon with the help of hornets, and David praising God for victory. Ramban discusses the use of hornets as a plague to drive out enemies, contrasting it with the use of an angel in the future world. The Talmud explains the anointing of kings at a spring and the permanent kingdom. Plagues were sent ahead to drive out enemies from the land without Israelites needing to use weapons, as seen in Exodus and Joshua. Targum elaborates on God sending hornets to plague enemies until they perish. Rabbi Yosei bar Rabbi Yehuda in Tosefta highlights the gifts given to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, and the hornet promised to help expel the Canaanites. 

|לֹ֥א תַעֲרֹ֖ץ מִפְּנֵיהֶ֑ם כִּֽי־יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ בְּקִרְבֶּ֔ךָ אֵ֥ל גָּד֖וֹל וְנוֹרָֽא׃|21|Do not stand in dread of them, for your God יהוה is in your midst, a great and awesome God.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of fearing the Lord, not enemies, soldiers are prohibited from fearing the enemy during war, memory joggers are crucial for reinforcing character traits and fulfilling commandments, Miriam and her seven sons remained steadfast in their faith despite persecution, and the Shechinah of the Lord is with believers to instill courage (Deuteronomy 7:21; Deuteronomy 3:22; Psalms; Midrash). 

|וְנָשַׁל֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ אֶת־הַגּוֹיִ֥ם הָאֵ֛ל מִפָּנֶ֖יךָ מְעַ֣ט מְעָ֑ט לֹ֤א תוּכַל֙ כַּלֹּתָ֣ם מַהֵ֔ר פֶּן־תִּרְבֶּ֥ה עָלֶ֖יךָ חַיַּ֥ת הַשָּׂדֶֽה׃|22|Your God יהוה will dislodge those peoples before you little by little; you will not be able to put an end to them at once, else the wild beasts would multiply to your hurt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God's plan to gradually drive out the nations in the land of Israel is to prevent the land from becoming desolate and overrun by wild beasts, ensuring the safety of the Israelites. This process of gradual expulsion is necessary to avoid creating a vacuum that could lead to chaos and danger. (Commentary, Talmud, Tanakh, Targum) 

|וּנְתָנָ֛ם יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לְפָנֶ֑יךָ וְהָמָם֙ מְהוּמָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֔ה עַ֖ד הִשָּׁמְדָֽם׃|23|Your God יהוה will deliver them up to you, throwing them into utter panic until they are wiped out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains the word "והמם" in Deuteronomy 7:23 is vowelled with Kametz because the final ם is not part of the root, while Rashbam interprets it as G'd causing noise to contribute to the destruction of the people. Tur HaArokh reassures that although the Canaanites will not be wiped out immediately, G'd will confuse them enough so that they will not pose a threat, allowing the Israelites to grow in numbers. Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Simon discuss instances of confusion in wars promised to Israel by the Lord, with the Holy One Blessed be He using clouds and pillars of fire to exile, gather, and confound nations. Rashbam explains the term "תורש" in Genesis 45:11 refers to being driven from the land due to famine, while the Talmud discusses how God used natural elements to defeat enemies of the Jewish people. Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Targum Jerusalem on Deuteronomy 7:23 all affirm that Adonoy will defeat and confuse the enemies of the Israelites until they are destroyed. 

|וְנָתַ֤ן מַלְכֵיהֶם֙ בְּיָדֶ֔ךָ וְהַאֲבַדְתָּ֣ אֶת־שְׁמָ֔ם מִתַּ֖חַת הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם לֹֽא־יִתְיַצֵּ֥ב אִישׁ֙ בְּפָנֶ֔יךָ עַ֥ד הִשְׁמִֽדְךָ֖ אֹתָֽם׃|24|[God] will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall obliterate their name from under the heavens; no one shall stand up to you, until you have wiped them out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators, including Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, Sforno, Tur HaArokh, Ramban, and Steinsaltz, emphasize the importance of completely destroying the Canaanites to prevent future opposition and eradicate idol worship. The Akeidat Yitzchak commentary raises questions about Jacob's blessings to his sons, while the Midrash explains that even powerful figures like Og cannot stand against the Israelites. Rabbeinu Bahya discusses God's sword symbolizing Justice, Rashbam compares expressions of risking one's life, and Onkelos and Targum Jonathan highlight God granting victory over enemies in Deuteronomy 7:24. 

|פְּסִילֵ֥י אֱלֹהֵיהֶ֖ם תִּשְׂרְפ֣וּן בָּאֵ֑שׁ לֹֽא־תַחְמֹד֩ כֶּ֨סֶף וְזָהָ֤ב עֲלֵיהֶם֙ וְלָקַחְתָּ֣ לָ֔ךְ פֶּ֚ן תִּוָּקֵ֣שׁ בּ֔וֹ כִּ֧י תוֹעֲבַ֛ת יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ הֽוּא׃|25|You shall consign the images of their gods to the fire; you shall not covet the silver and gold on them and keep it for yourselves, lest you be ensnared thereby; for that is abhorrent to your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The texts emphasize the prohibition of benefiting from idol worship, including not coveting or taking silver or gold from idols, burning idolatrous images, and the consequences of keeping such items. Destroying idols completely is crucial to avoid spiritual contamination. The Mishnah discusses the permissibility of benefiting from mountains and hills worshipped by gentiles, while the Talmud debates the immediate prohibition of a Jew's idol versus a Gentile's idol. The Zohar explains the ritual of acquiring and executing the Egyptian deity during the plagues, and the Targum warns against coveting silver and gold from idols. The Tosefta discusses nullifying idols in a Jew's domain and the prohibition of selling idols for worship. 

|וְלֹא־תָבִ֤יא תֽוֹעֵבָה֙ אֶל־בֵּיתֶ֔ךָ וְהָיִ֥יתָ חֵ֖רֶם כָּמֹ֑הוּ שַׁקֵּ֧ץ ׀ תְּשַׁקְּצֶ֛נּוּ וְתַעֵ֥ב ׀ תְּֽתַעֲבֶ֖נּוּ כִּי־חֵ֥רֶם הֽוּא׃|26|You must not bring an abhorrent thing into your house, or you will be proscribed like it; you must reject it as abominable and abhorrent, for it is proscribed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the prohibition of bringing idols or idolatrous items into one's home, renting to pagans, and benefiting from false gods, with punishments for transgressions including lashes. It also discusses the consequences of idol worship, the impurity associated with idols, and the importance of detesting idolatry. The comparison of arrogance to idol worship, the condemnation of pride, and the emphasis on avoiding idol worship and haughtiness are highlighted, with specific examples from biblical stories and commentary. The Torah is stricter with idolatry, with decrees by sages equivalent to core biblical commandments, and the commandments around chametz are guarded with meticulous observance. The Talmud delves into laws regarding idol worship, impurity, and the prohibition of idolatrous objects in one's home, emphasizing the severity of idol worship and the consequences of interacting with idolatrous items.

## Deuteronomy 8

|כׇּל־הַמִּצְוָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָנֹכִ֧י מְצַוְּךָ֛ הַיּ֖וֹם תִּשְׁמְר֣וּן לַעֲשׂ֑וֹת לְמַ֨עַן תִּֽחְי֜וּן וּרְבִיתֶ֗ם וּבָאתֶם֙ וִֽירִשְׁתֶּ֣ם אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־נִשְׁבַּ֥ע יְהֹוָ֖ה לַאֲבֹתֵיכֶֽם׃|1|You shall faithfully observe all the Instruction that I enjoin upon you today, that you may thrive and increase and be able to possess the land that יהוה promised on oath to your fathers.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of yearning to fulfill all Torah commandments to access their life force in the Holy Land. Halakhah details the blessings for Eretz Yisrael and weddings, stressing the need for specific elements to avoid repetition. Midrash and Musar highlight the significance of completing commandments once started, with consequences for not doing so. Talmud discusses anointing kings and consecrated property, while Targum emphasizes the importance of observing all commandments to inherit the land promised to the forefathers. 

|וְזָכַרְתָּ֣ אֶת־כׇּל־הַדֶּ֗רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֨ר הוֹלִֽיכְךָ֜ יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ זֶ֛ה אַרְבָּעִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר לְמַ֨עַן עַנֹּֽתְךָ֜ לְנַסֹּֽתְךָ֗ לָדַ֜עַת אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֧ר בִּֽלְבָבְךָ֛ הֲתִשְׁמֹ֥ר מִצְוֺתָ֖ו אִם־לֹֽא׃|2|Remember the long way that your God יהוה has made you travel in the wilderness these past forty years, in order to test you by hardships to learn what was in your hearts: whether you would keep the divine commandments or not.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Man's purpose in this world is to be tested by trials to determine if he will turn towards the passions of the body or towards living a true life from G-d. The Israelites were led through the wilderness by God to test their faith and obedience, with trials meant to strengthen their commitment to following His will. Torah study is essential, neglecting it is scornful, and dedication to learning is advised even at night. Trials in Scripture serve as tests of faith and devotion, such as the sacrifice of Isaac, and individuals are equal before God. Positive commandments hold virtues like free choice, Torah study, and fear of God, with man created for these virtues. The purpose of God's tests, such as the binding of Isaac, is to establish truth, prove capabilities, and demonstrate qualities to outsiders. The Israelites' time in Egypt, celebration of festivals, and history are highlighted as important for maintaining a relationship with God. 

|וַֽיְעַנְּךָ֮ וַיַּרְעִבֶ֒ךָ֒ וַיַּאֲכִֽלְךָ֤ אֶת־הַמָּן֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־יָדַ֔עְתָּ וְלֹ֥א יָדְע֖וּן אֲבֹתֶ֑יךָ לְמַ֣עַן הוֹדִֽיעֲךָ֗ כִּ֠י לֹ֣א עַל־הַלֶּ֤חֶם לְבַדּוֹ֙ יִחְיֶ֣ה הָֽאָדָ֔ם כִּ֛י עַל־כׇּל־מוֹצָ֥א פִֽי־יְהֹוָ֖ה יִחְיֶ֥ה הָאָדָֽם׃|3|[God] subjected you to the hardship of hunger and then gave you manna to eat, which neither you nor your ancestors had ever known, in order to teach you that a human being does not live on bread alone, but that one may live on anything that יהוה decrees.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of studying and contemplating the Torah deeply, connecting the spiritual and physical realms through commandments, and exploring the symbolic meaning of Tu BiShevat. Various commentators discuss the significance of manna as divine sustenance, the prohibition against eating on Yom Kippur, the principle of man's free will, and the rectification of the soul through blessings before eating in Kabbalah. The spiritual significance of food and offerings, the importance of spiritual nourishment, and the connection between body and soul are highlighted in Musar teachings. In Second Temple literature, manna symbolizes the importance of every word from God, while the Talmud discusses the concept of affliction on Yom Kippur. In Tanakh and Targum texts, manna is described as divine sustenance provided by God. 

|שִׂמְלָ֨תְךָ֜ לֹ֤א בָֽלְתָה֙ מֵֽעָלֶ֔יךָ וְרַגְלְךָ֖ לֹ֣א בָצֵ֑קָה זֶ֖ה אַרְבָּעִ֥ים שָׁנָֽה׃|4|The clothes upon you did not wear out, nor did your feet swell these forty years.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites were miraculously provided with durable and clean clothing by ministering angels in the wilderness, as well as fragrant herbs and water from a well, showcasing God's care for their needs. In Mishnah Yevamot 9:3, specific rules are outlined regarding the marriage of secondary relatives. The text discusses how the body will serve as distinguished clothing for the soul in the future, drawing parallels to Israel's experience in the desert where their clothing did not wear out. Both Targums agree that the Israelites' garments remained intact and their feet did not swell during their time in the desert, highlighting God's provision and protection. 

|וְיָדַעְתָּ֖ עִם־לְבָבֶ֑ךָ כִּ֗י כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר יְיַסֵּ֥ר אִישׁ֙ אֶת־בְּנ֔וֹ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ מְיַסְּרֶֽךָּ׃|5|Bear in mind that your God יהוה disciplines you just as a householder  disciplines his son.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text uses parables to illustrate God's discipline and guidance towards the Jewish people, akin to a father teaching his son for their benefit and moral improvement. Afflictions and suffering are seen as a form of divine rebuke to bring about repentance and purification, leading to redemption and blessings, with the ultimate goal of refining the righteous and bringing them closer to God (Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Or HaChaim, Tur HaArokh, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rav Hirsch, Steinsaltz, Mishnah Berakhot 6:4). God's providence is based on righteous law and justice, discipline stems from love, and mercy can go beyond the letter of the law, with kindness and judgment intertwined in divine conduct (Kabbalah, Talmud, Musar). 

|וְשָׁ֣מַרְתָּ֔ אֶת־מִצְוֺ֖ת יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ לָלֶ֥כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֖יו וּלְיִרְאָ֥ה אֹתֽוֹ׃|6|Therefore keep the commandments of your God יהוה: walk in God’s ways and show reverence.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Observing God's commandments and walking in His ways, while fearing Him, is key to moral perfection and shaping our destiny as intended by God. The Midrash highlights that God's ways are guided by mercy and truth, even if they may seem mysterious. The Musar commentary emphasizes the virtues of free choice, Torah study, and worship as the purpose for which man was created. Both Targums stress the importance of keeping God's commandments, walking in His ways, and fearing Him. 

|כִּ֚י יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ מְבִֽיאֲךָ֖ אֶל־אֶ֣רֶץ טוֹבָ֑ה אֶ֚רֶץ נַ֣חֲלֵי מָ֔יִם עֲיָנֹת֙ וּתְהֹמֹ֔ת יֹצְאִ֥ים בַּבִּקְעָ֖ה וּבָהָֽר׃|7|For your God יהוה is bringing you into a good land, a land with streams and springs and fountains issuing from plain and hill;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text describes the promised land as abundant in water sources, crops, and resources like iron and copper, ensuring that the people lack nothing and can eat and be satisfied. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing divine providence in achieving prosperity and warns against forgetting the source of wealth. The land is depicted as a place of rivers full of water, providing essential products fit for royalty and abundant resources, symbolizing God's provision for His people. Moses beseeches the Lord to acknowledge that everything appears equal before Him, as seen in the destruction of both the innocent and the wicked, emphasizing the importance of relying on God rather than man. The Jewish people received three gifts: Torah, the Land of Israel, and the World to Come, associated with both manifest and hidden aspects of good, given through suffering as a sign of God's love. 

|אֶ֤רֶץ חִטָּה֙ וּשְׂעֹרָ֔ה וְגֶ֥פֶן וּתְאֵנָ֖ה וְרִמּ֑וֹן אֶֽרֶץ־זֵ֥ית שֶׁ֖מֶן וּדְבָֽשׁ׃|8|a land of wheat and barley, of vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive trees and honey;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators provide insights into the types of food mentioned in Deuteronomy 8:8, with interpretations ranging from symbolic meanings to connections with mitzvot. The Sefer HaChinukh and Mishneh Torah detail the obligation to bless God after eating food, emphasizing specific foods and the order of blessings. Moses contrasts the Israelites' desire for root vegetables with the promise of lasting fruit in the Promised Land, highlighting the importance of stewardship and patience. Bikkurim are only brought from the seven species mentioned in the Torah, with specific rules outlined in the Mishnah. The Talmud discusses measures of food and the significance of different fruits in blessings based on Deuteronomy 8:8. The importance of fulfilling commandments related to the seven species and blessings in the context of entering and settling in the land of Israel is emphasized in various texts. 

|אֶ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹ֤א בְמִסְכֵּנֻת֙ תֹּֽאכַל־בָּ֣הּ לֶ֔חֶם לֹֽא־תֶחְסַ֥ר כֹּ֖ל בָּ֑הּ אֶ֚רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֲבָנֶ֣יהָ בַרְזֶ֔ל וּמֵהֲרָרֶ֖יהָ תַּחְצֹ֥ב נְחֹֽשֶׁת׃|9|a land where you may eat food without stint, where you will lack nothing; a land whose rocks are iron and from whose hills you can mine copper.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the Land of Israel's ability to eliminate desire for other foods through wealth from tefilin/Yaakov/truth, leading to eating only bread out of detachment from other delicacies. Commentary praises the land's abundance of resources, comparing Torah scholars to iron builders and emphasizing the air's enhancement of intelligence. Halakhah debates the obligation of blessings after eating nourishing foods versus other species, while Jewish Thought warns against neglecting Torah study for material wealth. Kabbalah discusses the connection between HaShem's qualities and the significance of Mount Zion and Mount Moriah. Midrash emphasizes growth in knowledge and Eretz Yisrael's completeness, while Musar stresses the importance of eating to sustain oneself. Quoting Commentary includes explanations from Sforno, Rabbeinu Bahya, Or HaChaim, Simchat HaRegel, Bartenura, and Derekh Chayyim. The Talmud debates suitable fruits for first fruits offerings and the significance of Eretz Yisrael's abundance. Targum describes the Land of Israel as a place lacking nothing with resources like iron and copper, where sages enact strong decrees and disciples ask weighty questions. 

|וְאָכַלְתָּ֖ וְשָׂבָ֑עְתָּ וּבֵֽרַכְתָּ֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ עַל־הָאָ֥רֶץ הַטֹּבָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָֽתַן־לָֽךְ׃|10|When you have eaten your fill, give thanks to your God יהוה for the good land given to you.|

The text highlights the importance of blessing God after eating, as commanded in Deuteronomy 8:10, with the obligation to bless God for sustenance being applicable everywhere. The act of blessing God is seen as a way to accumulate merit and ensure continued favor from Him, with the blessings after meals consisting of four parts. The Mishnah discusses the obligations of women, slaves, and minors in reciting Grace after Meals, while the Talmud explains the interpretations of verses regarding zimmun and eating satisfaction. The Lord provides abundant resources in the land, and the Targum emphasizes the act of blessing and giving thanks for all the fruit of the land. 

|הִשָּׁ֣מֶר לְךָ֔ פֶּן־תִּשְׁכַּ֖ח אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ לְבִלְתִּ֨י שְׁמֹ֤ר מִצְוֺתָיו֙ וּמִשְׁפָּטָ֣יו וְחֻקֹּתָ֔יו אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּֽוֹם׃|11|Take care lest you forget your God יהוה and fail to keep the divine commandments, rules, and laws which I enjoin upon you today.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The texts emphasize the importance of remembering God and following His commandments to receive blessings and avoid consequences such as arrogance and being cut off from the world to come. They highlight the need for humility, gratitude, and remembrance of God in all actions to maintain a connection with Him and receive goodness. The consequences of forgetting God are discussed in various commentaries, halakhic texts, and moral teachings, with a focus on the negative impact of pride and arrogance. The Talmud, Midrash, Mishnah, and Jewish thought all stress the significance of remembering God and following His laws to lead a righteous and fulfilling life. 

|פֶּן־תֹּאכַ֖ל וְשָׂבָ֑עְתָּ וּבָתִּ֥ים טֹבִ֛ים תִּבְנֶ֖ה וְיָשָֽׁבְתָּ׃|12|When you have eaten your fill, and have built fine houses to live in,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the transition from impurity to holiness through immersing vessels in a ritual bath and eating with sanctity to avoid attributing sustenance to one's own power. The Gate of Unity stresses the importance of genuine wisdom over falsehood and wickedness. Commentary highlights the danger of becoming complacent with economic success and the decline in intellect due to pursuing material pleasures. Musar emphasizes the necessity of humility for spiritual growth and warns against arrogance and pride. Quoting Commentary warns against rebelling against God out of satiety, and Targum emphasizes the importance of not becoming complacent after achieving material success. 

|וּבְקָֽרְךָ֤ וְצֹֽאנְךָ֙ יִרְבְּיֻ֔ן וְכֶ֥סֶף וְזָהָ֖ב יִרְבֶּה־לָּ֑ךְ וְכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־לְךָ֖ יִרְבֶּֽה׃|13|and your herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold have increased, and everything you own has prospered,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Rabbi Mosheh Ha-Kohen disagree on the interpretation of "yirbeyun," with Steinsaltz describing the increase in wealth that will come from settling the land. The Midrash warns against rebellion towards God due to prosperity leading to complacency and idolatry. Rashi explains redundancy in Biblical Hebrew, while Siftei Chakhamim links cedarwood in purification rituals to the sin of lashon hara. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Deuteronomy 8:13 as a promise of abundance and multiplication of possessions. 

|וְרָ֖ם לְבָבֶ֑ךָ וְשָֽׁכַחְתָּ֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ הַמּוֹצִיאֲךָ֛ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם מִבֵּ֥ית עֲבָדִֽים׃|14|beware lest  your heart grow haughty and you forget your God יהוה —who freed you from the land of Egypt, the house of bondage;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various Jewish commentaries, including Chasidut, Halakhah, and Musar, warn against the dangers of pride and haughtiness, linking them to forgetting God and leading to various transgressions. The importance of humility, remembering God, and avoiding arrogance is emphasized to maintain a spiritual connection and prevent negative consequences. These teachings are reflected in biblical verses, stories, and interpretations, highlighting the need for spiritual renewal, repentance, and alignment with divine will. 

|הַמּוֹלִ֨יכְךָ֜ בַּמִּדְבָּ֣ר ׀ הַגָּדֹ֣ל וְהַנּוֹרָ֗א נָחָ֤שׁ ׀ שָׂרָף֙ וְעַקְרָ֔ב וְצִמָּא֖וֹן אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֵֽין־מָ֑יִם הַמּוֹצִ֤יא לְךָ֙ מַ֔יִם מִצּ֖וּר הַֽחַלָּמִֽישׁ׃|15|who led you through the great and terrible wilderness with its seraph  serpents and scorpions, a parched land with no water in it, who brought forth water for you from the flinty rock;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses openly displayed versus concealed love in the relationship between the Jewish people and God, while emphasizing the need for clarification to overcome negative influences. Ibn Ezra, Sforno, and Steinsaltz highlight God's provision and guidance in the wilderness, including water from a rock. Jewish Thought emphasizes the importance of meaningful activities and moral imperatives for true happiness, contrasting with material pursuits. Liturgy describes the Israelites' journey through dangerous places, and Midrash connects the wilderness to various historical and symbolic elements. Musar delves into Divine Providence and the consequences of actions, while Quoting Commentary discusses Moses and Aaron's sin in striking the rock. Second Temple and Talmud texts explore the unchangeable nature of God and different interpretations of blessings over bread. Tanakh references instances of serpents, rocks providing water, and consequences of actions. Targum depicts God leading the Israelites through a dangerous wilderness and providing water from a rock. 

|הַמַּֽאֲכִ֨לְךָ֥ מָן֙ בַּמִּדְבָּ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־יָדְע֖וּן אֲבֹתֶ֑יךָ לְמַ֣עַן עַנֹּֽתְךָ֗ וּלְמַ֙עַן֙ נַסֹּתֶ֔ךָ לְהֵיטִֽבְךָ֖ בְּאַחֲרִיתֶֽךָ׃|16|who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your ancestors had never known, in order to test you by hardships only to benefit you in the end—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of satiation on Shabbat through enhancing vision, while the Commentary, Halakhah, Jewish Thought, Midrash, Musar, and Quoting Commentary all discuss how trials, afflictions, and tests were meant to instill faith, reliance on God, and ultimately benefit the Israelites. The Talmud debates whether the affliction of eating manna was due to lack of leftovers or inability to see the food, while the Tanakh recounts the Israelites' grumbling in the wilderness and God's provision of manna as a test of obedience. Targum texts also mention God feeding the Israelites with manna in the wilderness for their benefit. 

|וְאָמַרְתָּ֖ בִּלְבָבֶ֑ךָ כֹּחִי֙ וְעֹ֣צֶם יָדִ֔י עָ֥שָׂה לִ֖י אֶת־הַחַ֥יִל הַזֶּֽה׃|17|and you say to yourselves, “My own power and the might of my own hand have won this wealth for me.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of recognizing everything as part of G-d's providence, separating good from evil through G-d's role in creation, conducting actions in line with G-d's words, and recognizing G-d's role in creation even in times of exile. It also emphasizes the need for faith in God as the source of success in business, the danger of arrogance in attributing wealth to personal power alone, and the importance of humility over pride. The people in the desert rejected divinely provided manna due to dissatisfaction stemming from their attitude, and success is seen as achieved through partnership with God rather than individual effort alone. Abel's sacrifice was accepted because he believed in the power of God, not his own strength, and God's word is compared to rain in a dry land, emphasizing the importance of recognizing blessings as coming from God and not solely from personal power. 

|וְזָֽכַרְתָּ֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ כִּ֣י ה֗וּא הַנֹּתֵ֥ן לְךָ֛ כֹּ֖חַ לַעֲשׂ֣וֹת חָ֑יִל לְמַ֨עַן הָקִ֧ים אֶת־בְּרִית֛וֹ אֲשֶׁר־נִשְׁבַּ֥ע לַאֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ כַּיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|18|Remember that it is your God יהוה who gives you the power to get wealth, in fulfillment of the covenant made on oath with your fathers, as is still the case.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries and texts across Chasidut, Jewish Thought, Kabbalah, Musar, Second Temple, Tanakh, and Targum emphasize the importance of recognizing that success and wealth come from God, not individual efforts, and warn against forgetting this to avoid idolatry and destruction. They stress the need for humility, trust in God, and diligence in achieving prosperity, while also warning against pride and arrogance that lead to forgetting God's role in sustenance and success. Moses in Deuteronomy warns the Israelites not to forget God when prosperous, emphasizing that wealth comes from God and confirming the covenant with their forefathers. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה אִם־שָׁכֹ֤חַ תִּשְׁכַּח֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ וְהָֽלַכְתָּ֗ אַחֲרֵי֙ אֱלֹהִ֣ים אֲחֵרִ֔ים וַעֲבַדְתָּ֖ם וְהִשְׁתַּחֲוִ֣יתָ לָהֶ֑ם הַעִדֹ֤תִי בָכֶם֙ הַיּ֔וֹם כִּ֥י אָבֹ֖ד תֹּאבֵדֽוּן׃|19|If you do forget your God יהוה and follow other gods to serve them or bow down to them, I warn you this day that you shall certainly perish;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the spiritual significance of dates and olives, linking them to traits of the spirit and foundation and kingship, emphasizing the importance of measurements and cleanliness in accessing God (Chasidut). Sforno, Or HaChaim, and Rav Hirsch warn about the consequences of attributing success to personal efforts, failing to teach Torah and turning to idolatry, and forgetting God, respectively (Commentary). Halakhah emphasizes God's choice of Israel, their duty to uphold the Torah, and the divine in all areas of life. Jewish Thought warns against forgetting God, while Midrash highlights the importance of heeding God's commandments. Musar discusses the concept of blessings and curses related to performing or forgetting commandments, and quoting commentary explains the importance of studying and following the Torah.

|כַּגּוֹיִ֗ם אֲשֶׁ֤ר יְהֹוָה֙ מַאֲבִ֣יד מִפְּנֵיכֶ֔ם כֵּ֖ן תֹּאבֵד֑וּן עֵ֚קֶב לֹ֣א תִשְׁמְע֔וּן בְּק֖וֹל יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶֽם׃|20|like the nations that יהוה will cause to perish before you, so shall you perish—because you did not heed your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Moses ascending to receive a message from God, highlighting the awe felt by prophets. Commentary on Deuteronomy 8:20 emphasizes obedience leading to blessings and disobedience to destruction. Midrash compares the exile of Israel to the elimination of Canaanite nations, focusing on terror and destruction. Quoting Commentary emphasizes God's care for Israel in the wilderness and warns against attributing success to their own prowess. Targum warns that disobedience will lead to destruction like other nations.

## Deuteronomy 9

|שְׁמַ֣ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל אַתָּ֨ה עֹבֵ֤ר הַיּוֹם֙ אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן לָבֹא֙ לָרֶ֣שֶׁת גּוֹיִ֔ם גְּדֹלִ֥ים וַעֲצֻמִ֖ים מִמֶּ֑ךָּ עָרִ֛ים גְּדֹלֹ֥ת וּבְצֻרֹ֖ת בַּשָּׁמָֽיִם׃|1|Hear, O Israel! You are about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and more populous than you: great cities with walls sky-high;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the ability of the righteous to cancel Divine decrees before they are written down, with Moses exemplifying this by attempting to void a prophecy about his death. Halakhah explains the order of mentioning darkness before light in Hebrew language. Jewish Thought connects the dispersal of peoples to the division caused by defective beliefs, with the moon symbolizing the sacrifice of worldly success for spiritual success. Midrash highlights the miracles through water performed for Israel and Moses' pleas for mercy and warnings. Mishnah details the division of Eretz Yisrael for marriage purposes. Musar discusses the dispatching of spies to strengthen belief and the sin of causing fear. Quoting Commentary explains the spies' sin in discouraging the people from entering the Land. Talmud clarifies the use of exaggerated language in the Torah and Prophets. Targum emphasizes the strength of the nations and cities the Israelites are about to face. 

|עַֽם־גָּד֥וֹל וָרָ֖ם בְּנֵ֣י עֲנָקִ֑ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתָּ֤ה יָדַ֙עְתָּ֙ וְאַתָּ֣ה שָׁמַ֔עְתָּ מִ֣י יִתְיַצֵּ֔ב לִפְנֵ֖י בְּנֵ֥י עֲנָֽק׃|2|a people great and tall, the Anakites, of whom you have knowledge; for you have heard it said, “Who can stand up to the children of Anak?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses warned the Israelites about the formidable giants in Canaan, specifically the Anakites, who were described as tall and strong like Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai. The spies' negative report led to harsh consequences, with the Israelites condemned to wander in the wilderness for forty years before entering the promised land. Despite questioning the severity of the spies' sin, Nachmanides highlights the fear instilled by the giants in Canaan, emphasizing the challenge faced by the Israelites. 

|וְיָדַעְתָּ֣ הַיּ֗וֹם כִּי֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ הֽוּא־הָעֹבֵ֤ר לְפָנֶ֙יךָ֙ אֵ֣שׁ אֹֽכְלָ֔ה ה֧וּא יַשְׁמִידֵ֛ם וְה֥וּא יַכְנִיעֵ֖ם לְפָנֶ֑יךָ וְהֽוֹרַשְׁתָּ֤ם וְהַֽאֲבַדְתָּם֙ מַהֵ֔ר כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה לָֽךְ׃|3|Know then this day that none other than your God יהוה is crossing at your head, a devouring fire; it is [God] who will wipe them out—subduing them before you, that you may quickly dispossess and destroy them, as יהוה promised you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes God's swift destruction of Israel's enemies as a consuming fire, leading to rapid victories with the people warned not to drive out all inhabitants at once. Memory joggers are discussed as important for reinforcing character traits and fulfilling commandments, with the keriyat shema highlighted. HaShem is described as a Consuming Fire in Kabbalah, associated with the concept of terror. The tribe of Levi's hope for God's kindness and Moses' remedy to prevent conflict over bearing the Ark are highlighted in Midrash. The transformation of Chanoch into Metatron, the connection between the soul and body, and the fiery coin representing contributions to G-d are discussed in Musar. Ramban, Rashi, Rashbam, and Targum interpretations on various verses are also mentioned. 

|אַל־תֹּאמַ֣ר בִּלְבָבְךָ֗ בַּהֲדֹ֣ף יְהֹוָה֩ אֱלֹהֶ֨יךָ אֹתָ֥ם ׀ מִלְּפָנֶ֘יךָ֮ לֵאמֹר֒ בְּצִדְקָתִי֙ הֱבִיאַ֣נִי יְהֹוָ֔ה לָרֶ֖שֶׁת אֶת־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֑את וּבְרִשְׁעַת֙ הַגּוֹיִ֣ם הָאֵ֔לֶּה יְהֹוָ֖ה מוֹרִישָׁ֥ם מִפָּנֶֽיךָ׃|4|And when your God יהוה has thrust them from your path, say not to yourselves, “יהוה has enabled us to possess this land because of our virtues”; it is rather because of the wickedness of those nations that יהוה is dispossessing them before you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The possession of the land by Israel was not due to their righteousness but because of the wickedness of the nations and God's oath to their forefathers. God's actions are for His own glory, not based on the righteousness of the people. Success should be attributed to the kindness of God, not personal virtues. The Israelites were forbidden to dwell in the land opposite Beis-peor to avoid temptation to sin. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan caution against attributing the inheritance of the land to Israel's righteousness. 

|לֹ֣א בְצִדְקָתְךָ֗ וּבְיֹ֙שֶׁר֙ לְבָ֣בְךָ֔ אַתָּ֥ה בָ֖א לָרֶ֣שֶׁת אֶת־אַרְצָ֑ם כִּ֞י בְּרִשְׁעַ֣ת ׀ הַגּוֹיִ֣ם הָאֵ֗לֶּה יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ מוֹרִישָׁ֣ם מִפָּנֶ֔יךָ וּלְמַ֜עַן הָקִ֣ים אֶת־הַדָּבָ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֨ר נִשְׁבַּ֤ע יְהֹוָה֙ לַאֲבֹתֶ֔יךָ לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם לְיִצְחָ֖ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹֽב׃|5|It is not because of your virtues and your rectitude that you will be able to possess their country; but it is because of their wickedness that your God יהוה is dispossessing those nations before you, and in order to fulfill the oath that יהוה made to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that God chose Israel as His portion, regardless of their righteousness, reflecting His unwavering love for them. Jewish Thought contrasts s'daqah with wickedness, warning against attributing success to personal virtues and emphasizing the importance of ethical and moral goodness. The Midrash and Musar warn against pride and highlight that victory comes from God's goodness, not human righteousness. Quoting Commentary reinforces the idea that Israel's conquest of Canaan was not due to their righteousness but to God's promise and justice. Second Temple texts stress the importance of virtue in the eyes of God, while Targum explains that the Israelites will inherit the land to fulfill the promise to their forefathers, not because of their righteousness. 

|וְיָדַעְתָּ֗ כִּ֠י לֹ֤א בְצִדְקָֽתְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱ֠לֹהֶ֠יךָ נֹתֵ֨ן לְךָ֜ אֶת־הָאָ֧רֶץ הַטּוֹבָ֛ה הַזֹּ֖את לְרִשְׁתָּ֑הּ כִּ֥י עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹ֖רֶף אָֽתָּה׃|6|Know, then, that it is not for any virtue of yours that your God יהוה is giving you this good land to possess; for you are a stiffnecked people.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno explains that being stiff-necked and righteous are incompatible qualities, as a stiff-necked person follows their own opinions instead of God's commandments. Or HaChaim suggests that Moses warned the Israelites about their past rebelliousness to emphasize that their own righteousness, not just God's promise to the patriarchs, was necessary for inheriting the land. Rav Hirsch emphasizes the contrast between a stiff-necked character and righteousness. Steinsaltz reiterates that the Israelites are described as stiff-necked and stubborn, implying that their righteousness alone did not merit them the land. The Torah describes the people as ערב רב, suggesting that "sparks" of purity were mixed in their personalities, with the term ערב קטן referring to those with a lower spiritual point of departure. Moses teaches in Deuteronomy that it is not the people who are special, but the Torah they follow, with the laws given by God lifting them to greatness and inspiring others to seek freedom. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 9:6 emphasize that the Israelites are not receiving the land of Canaan due to their righteousness, but rather because of God's grace, despite their stubbornness and stiff-necked nature. 

|זְכֹר֙ אַל־תִּשְׁכַּ֔ח אֵ֧ת אֲשֶׁר־הִקְצַ֛פְתָּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר לְמִן־הַיּ֞וֹם אֲשֶׁר־יָצָ֣אתָ ׀ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֗יִם עַד־בֹּֽאֲכֶם֙ עַד־הַמָּק֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה מַמְרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם עִם־יְהֹוָֽה׃|7|Remember, never forget, how you provoked your God יהוה to anger in the wilderness: from the day that you left the land of Egypt until you reached this place, you have continued defiant toward יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the struggles against demonic forces that lead to sin, with settlement only coming after the formation of humanity. Commentary highlights the consequences of disobedience and the need for obedience to God's laws. Halakhah discusses actions that can impede repentance, emphasizing the importance of admonishment. Kabbalah outlines specific actions to demonstrate commitment to God and the Torah. Liturgy includes a verse about not forgetting Israel's provocations in the desert. Midrash stresses the importance of remembering key events and instructions. Musar discusses actions that impede repentance and the necessity of rebuke. Quoting Commentary explains the timing of Moses' prayers and clarifies certain commandments. Targum emphasizes the importance of remembering Israel's defiance towards God. 

|וּבְחֹרֵ֥ב הִקְצַפְתֶּ֖ם אֶת־יְהֹוָ֑ה וַיִּתְאַנַּ֧ף יְהֹוָ֛ה בָּכֶ֖ם לְהַשְׁמִ֥יד אֶתְכֶֽם׃|8|At Horeb you so provoked יהוה that יהוה was angry enough with you to have destroyed you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses reproved Israelites for their sins at Horeb, warning against idolatry and emphasizing the seriousness of disobedience. The Midrash discusses Israel's commitment to Torah study, sins at Horev and the sea, and the consequences of their actions. The Targum highlights how the Israelites angered the Lord at Horeb, leading to potential destruction. 

|בַּעֲלֹתִ֣י הָהָ֗רָה לָקַ֜חַת לוּחֹ֤ת הָֽאֲבָנִים֙ לוּחֹ֣ת הַבְּרִ֔ית אֲשֶׁר־כָּרַ֥ת יְהֹוָ֖ה עִמָּכֶ֑ם וָאֵשֵׁ֣ב בָּהָ֗ר אַרְבָּעִ֥ים יוֹם֙ וְאַרְבָּעִ֣ים לַ֔יְלָה לֶ֚חֶם לֹ֣א אָכַ֔לְתִּי וּמַ֖יִם לֹ֥א שָׁתִֽיתִי׃|9|I had ascended the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the Tablets of the Covenant that יהוה had made with you, and I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, eating no bread and drinking no water.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut criticizes Moses for making high-handed decisions without consulting God, based on his flawed logic and unique spiritual experiences. Halakhah discusses the practice of Nefillas Apayim and prostration in prayer, while Jewish Thought emphasizes the importance of Sabbath observance and the severity of the sin of the golden calf. Midrash highlights Moses's dedication to Torah and his actions to save Israel, and Musar stresses the sanctity of the sukkah and the concept of Moses standing between God and the people. The Talmud discusses Moses's actions on the mountain and the manna as a miraculous sustenance provided by God. 

|וַיִּתֵּ֨ן יְהֹוָ֜ה אֵלַ֗י אֶת־שְׁנֵי֙ לוּחֹ֣ת הָֽאֲבָנִ֔ים כְּתֻבִ֖ים בְּאֶצְבַּ֣ע אֱלֹהִ֑ים וַעֲלֵיהֶ֗ם כְּֽכׇל־הַדְּבָרִ֡ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר דִּבֶּר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה עִמָּכֶ֥ם בָּהָ֛ר מִתּ֥וֹךְ הָאֵ֖שׁ בְּי֥וֹם הַקָּהָֽל׃|10|And יהוה gave me the two tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God, with the exact words that יהוה had addressed to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the Assembly.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, Rashi, and Rav Hirsch offer interpretations of the phrase "written with the finger of God" in the Torah. Halakhah explains the use of anthropomorphic language to describe God and the significance of Yom Ha-kahal. Jewish Thought discusses the transmission of all Torah to Moses at Sinai, emphasizing the importance of consensus among sages. Midrash highlights the importance of charity, righteousness, Torah study, and adherence to God's laws. Quoting Commentary explains the unique transmission of Torah knowledge to Israel through Moses. Responsa provides measurements for halla and the establishment of measurements by sages. In Talmud, Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rebbi Ḥaggai, and Rebbi Joshua ben Levi discuss the revelation of inferences, oral traditions, and divisions of oral law to Moses on Sinai. Tanakh mentions Pharaoh's refusal to acknowledge God's power. Targum describes the giving of stone tablets to Moses inscribed by God's finger on the day of assembly. 

|וַיְהִ֗י מִקֵּץ֙ אַרְבָּעִ֣ים י֔וֹם וְאַרְבָּעִ֖ים לָ֑יְלָה נָתַ֨ן יְהֹוָ֜ה אֵלַ֗י אֶת־שְׁנֵ֛י לֻחֹ֥ת הָאֲבָנִ֖ים לֻח֥וֹת הַבְּרִֽית׃|11|At the end of those forty days and forty nights, יהוה gave me the two tablets of stone, the Tablets of the Covenant.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The golden calf was made on the same day Moses received the tablets from God, leading him to break them to lessen the severity of the Israelites' sin. Rabbi Shimon stresses the importance of reciting the Shema and prayer correctly, approaching prayer with genuine compassion, and maintaining a balanced perspective to motivate good deeds and positive self-image. Adonoy gave Moses two stone tablets at the end of forty days and nights, made of marble according to Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 9:11. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֵלַ֗י ק֣וּם רֵ֤ד מַהֵר֙ מִזֶּ֔ה כִּ֚י שִׁחֵ֣ת עַמְּךָ֔ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הוֹצֵ֖אתָ מִמִּצְרָ֑יִם סָ֣רוּ מַהֵ֗ר מִן־הַדֶּ֙רֶךְ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר צִוִּיתִ֔ם עָשׂ֥וּ לָהֶ֖ם מַסֵּכָֽה׃|12|And יהוה said to me, “Hurry, go down from here at once, for the people whom you brought out of Egypt have acted wickedly; they have been quick to stray from the path that I enjoined upon them; they have made themselves a molten image.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God instructs Moses to descend quickly from the mountain as the Israelites have turned to idolatry by making a cast figure, deviating from His commandments. Animals that have been involved in certain acts or worshipped are unacceptable for sacrifices on the altar, based on Leviticus 22:25, Genesis 6:12, and Exodus 32:7. The Midrash discusses Moses bringing the Torah to earth despite the Israelites' deviant behavior, emphasizing his sacrifices for the laws and Israel. Ramban explains that God wanted to emphasize His power in delivering the Israelites from Egypt and clarifies their sins of corruption and idol worship. Tur HaArokh suggests that God's reference to the people as "Moses' people" was a response to Moses leading them into the desert without consulting God. Adonoy tells Moses to descend quickly as the Israelites have turned away from the commandments given at Sinai and made a molten image despite warnings not to do so. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֵלַ֣י לֵאמֹ֑ר רָאִ֙יתִי֙ אֶת־הָעָ֣ם הַזֶּ֔ה וְהִנֵּ֥ה עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹ֖רֶף הֽוּא׃|13|יהוה further said to me, “I see that this is a stiffnecked people.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah was given to Moses on Sinai, including decisions made by consensus of sages (Derashot HaRan 3:25). The Midrash in Bamidbar Rabbah 9:45 interprets Israel's idolatry as straying from God, with Moses interceding on their behalf. Adonoy sees the stubbornness of the people in Deuteronomy 9:13 (Targum). 

|הֶ֤רֶף מִמֶּ֙נִּי֙ וְאַשְׁמִידֵ֔ם וְאֶמְחֶ֣ה אֶת־שְׁמָ֔ם מִתַּ֖חַת הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם וְאֶֽעֱשֶׂה֙ אֽוֹתְךָ֔ לְגוֹי־עָצ֥וּם וָרָ֖ב מִמֶּֽנּוּ׃|14|Let Me alone and I will destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven, and I will make you a nation far more numerous than they.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that God's promises are firm and will be kept, even when conditional. In Jewish Thought, the Scholars of Greece and Romans had different beliefs about the Israelites and their relationship with God. The Midrash discusses the Israelites defiling themselves with idol worship. In Musar, examples are given of how man can influence the world by doing God's will. Quoting various commentators, Moses' prayer saved the Israelites from destruction after the sin of the Golden Calf, emphasizing the importance of mercy over justice. The Talmud highlights how Moses' prayer nullified God's decree to destroy the Israelites, showing the fulfillment of God's promises. Targum interprets God telling Moses to leave Him alone to destroy the Israelites and make Moses into a more powerful nation. 

|וָאֵ֗פֶן וָֽאֵרֵד֙ מִן־הָהָ֔ר וְהָהָ֖ר בֹּעֵ֣ר בָּאֵ֑שׁ וּשְׁנֵי֙ לוּחֹ֣ת הַבְּרִ֔ית עַ֖ל שְׁתֵּ֥י יָדָֽי׃|15|I started down the mountain, a mountain ablaze with fire, the two Tablets of the Covenant in my two hands.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses hid the Tablets in the Holy Ark symbolizing space, time, and the spiritual dimension. Washing hands in the morning is crucial for banishing impurity and disorder, representing Torah and holiness. Moses prayed for the people after their sin with the golden calf, leading God to reconsider destroying them, descending with the second set of Tablets. Moses used the rays of glory from the tablets to show he was G-d's partner, veiling himself only during mundane tasks. Rabbeinu Chananel explains Moses descended facing the cloud, emphasizing always keeping Hashem in front. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe Moses descending the mountain holding the Tablets. 

|וָאֵ֗רֶא וְהִנֵּ֤ה חֲטָאתֶם֙ לַיהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֔ם עֲשִׂיתֶ֣ם לָכֶ֔ם עֵ֖גֶל מַסֵּכָ֑ה סַרְתֶּ֣ם מַהֵ֔ר מִן־הַדֶּ֕רֶךְ אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֥ה יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶתְכֶֽם׃|16|I saw how you had sinned against your God יהוה: you had made yourselves a molten calf; you had been quick to stray from the path that יהוה had enjoined upon you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses smashed the Tablets as a symbolic gesture to show alignment with the sinning Israelites and offer selfless empathy, emphasizing the severity of their transgression against God. The breaking of the tablets is explored in various Midrashim as a response to the people's sin, highlighting the connection between Moses and the fate of the Israelites. The Talmud discusses Moses adding an extra day of purification before receiving the Torah to ensure ritual purity, breaking the tablets when he saw the Israelites worshiping the Golden Calf. The Targumim mention the sin of the Israelites in making a molten calf and deviating from God's command. 

|וָאֶתְפֹּשׂ֙ בִּשְׁנֵ֣י הַלֻּחֹ֔ת וָֽאַשְׁלִכֵ֔ם מֵעַ֖ל שְׁתֵּ֣י יָדָ֑י וָאֲשַׁבְּרֵ֖ם לְעֵינֵיכֶֽם׃|17|Thereupon I gripped the two tablets and flung them away with both my hands, smashing them before your eyes.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses broke the Tablets in anger to prevent severe punishment for the people and maintain their status as not yet fully married to God, exemplifying the abrogation of the covenant. A prophet must possess wisdom, humility, strength, and wealth to be suitable for prophecy. Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael disagreed on whether Moses was right to break the tablets, with the breaking likened to a royal edict being destroyed. Moses was instructed to make a wooden ark for the second set of Tablets, emphasizing his ownership of them. The tablets were broken on the 17th of Tammuz because of the people's worship of the Golden Calf, with Moses staying apart from his wife and outside the Tent of Meeting. 

|וָֽאֶתְנַפַּל֩ לִפְנֵ֨י יְהֹוָ֜ה כָּרִאשֹׁנָ֗ה אַרְבָּעִ֥ים יוֹם֙ וְאַרְבָּעִ֣ים לַ֔יְלָה לֶ֚חֶם לֹ֣א אָכַ֔לְתִּי וּמַ֖יִם לֹ֣א שָׁתִ֑יתִי עַ֤ל כׇּל־חַטַּאתְכֶם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר חֲטָאתֶ֔ם לַעֲשׂ֥וֹת הָרַ֛ע בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה לְהַכְעִיסֽוֹ׃|18|I threw myself down before יהוה —eating no bread and drinking no water forty days and forty nights, as before—because of the great wrong you had committed, doing what displeased and vexed יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses prayed for forty days and nights twice, seeking forgiveness and reconciliation with God after the sin of the golden calf and before receiving the second tablets, ultimately leading to complete reconciliation with Israel on Yom Kippur. On the Eve of Yom Kippur, certain prayers are omitted, such as taḥanun, Psalm 19, and Psalm 100, with disagreements on reciting the "Avinu Malkenu" prayer. The worshipper recites Tachanun in a sitting position, symbolizing submission to God, with specific exceptions. Prayer is emphasized as powerful and more important than good deeds or sacrifices, exemplified by Moses and other righteous individuals in the Midrash texts. Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Rashi, Da'at Zekenim, Chizkuni, Onkelos, and Targum Jonathan provide insights into Moses's actions, forgiveness, the significance of Yom Kippur, and Moses's prayers for reconciliation with God. 

|כִּ֣י יָגֹ֗רְתִּי מִפְּנֵ֤י הָאַף֙ וְהַ֣חֵמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר קָצַ֧ף יְהֹוָ֛ה עֲלֵיכֶ֖ם לְהַשְׁמִ֣יד אֶתְכֶ֑ם וַיִּשְׁמַ֤ע יְהֹוָה֙ אֵלַ֔י גַּ֖ם בַּפַּ֥עַם הַהִֽוא׃|19|For I was in dread of the fierce anger against you which moved יהוה to wipe you out. And that time, too, יהוה gave heed to me.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses prayed fervently for Israel after the golden calf incident, preventing their destruction through his prayers for forty days and nights, even though God had repented of destroying them. Giving charity in secret is deemed greater than Moses' actions by R. Eleazar, as it subdues anger. Moses was nearly punished for delaying his son's circumcision, emphasizing the importance of the practice. The commentary on Vayikra 16:1:7 highlights how Moses' prayers saved two of Aaron's sons from death. In Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 9:19, Moses calls upon the names of the patriarchs to restrain and bury the destroying angels sent to punish Israel. 

|וּֽבְאַהֲרֹ֗ן הִתְאַנַּ֧ף יְהֹוָ֛ה מְאֹ֖ד לְהַשְׁמִיד֑וֹ וָֽאֶתְפַּלֵּ֛ל גַּם־בְּעַ֥ד אַהֲרֹ֖ן בָּעֵ֥ת הַהִֽוא׃|20|Moreover, יהוה was angry enough with Aaron to have destroyed him; so I also interceded for Aaron at that time.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Aaron's involvement in the making of the Golden Calf led to the death of two of his sons, but Moses' prayer spared the other two, highlighting Aaron's failure in responsibility and the severity of his punishment. Despite his good intentions, Aaron's actions resulted in a public desecration of God's name, emphasizing the high standards expected of righteous individuals. Moses pleads for forgiveness for Aaron after the incident, showing mercy and pursuit of peace, contrasting with his more critical nature. The Midrash discusses instances of repentance and prayer reversing harsh decrees, such as Cain's repentance and Hezekiah's prayer, highlighting the concept of chosen individuals brought near by God like Aaron and Levi. Aaron's punishment for the Golden Calf incident is also mentioned, with two of his sons dying while two are saved through Moses' prayer. 

|וְֽאֶת־חַטַּאתְכֶ֞ם אֲשֶׁר־עֲשִׂיתֶ֣ם אֶת־הָעֵ֗גֶל לָקַ֘חְתִּי֮ וָאֶשְׂרֹ֣ף אֹת֣וֹ ׀ בָּאֵשׁ֒ וָאֶכֹּ֨ת אֹת֤וֹ טָחוֹן֙ הֵיטֵ֔ב עַ֥ד אֲשֶׁר־דַּ֖ק לְעָפָ֑ר וָֽאַשְׁלִךְ֙ אֶת־עֲפָר֔וֹ אֶל־הַנַּ֖חַל הַיֹּרֵ֥ד מִן־הָהָֽר׃|21|As for that sinful thing you had made, the calf, I took it and put it to the fire; I broke it to bits and ground it thoroughly until it was fine as dust, and I threw its dust into the brook that comes down from the mountain.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses intercedes for forgiveness after the golden calf incident, demonstrating his commitment to the Jewish people despite God's initial anger. He destroyed the calf completely and purified the Israelites with gold dust. The ritual of burning the red heifer symbolizes purification and humility before God. The Mishnah details how to revoke the idolatrous status of an ashera, while the Talmud debates disposal methods for idols. Moses' actions are interpreted in various commentaries and texts, emphasizing the consequences of idolatry and the necessity of purification rituals. 

|וּבְתַבְעֵרָה֙ וּבְמַסָּ֔ה וּבְקִבְרֹ֖ת הַֽתַּאֲוָ֑ה מַקְצִפִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם אֶת־יְהֹוָֽה׃|22|Again you provoked יהוה at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Sforno explain that Taberah and Massah represent Israel testing God through complaints and challenges, with Tur HaArokh adding dissatisfaction and doubt. Rav Hirsch notes internal spiritual failings at both locations, with Da'at Zekenim and Chizkuni highlighting sins of grumbling, testing God, and lusting for meat. The Midrash emphasizes repentance for transgressions, while Ramban discusses Abraham's origins and the challenge of interpreting biblical omissions. The Talmud lists ten trials faced by the Israelites, including Tav’erah, Masah, and Kivrot HaTa’avah, with Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya'akov underscoring the severity of punishment. In Tanakh, the Israelites complain about meat, leading to quail and a plague, while Eldad and Medad prophesy outside the Tent of Meeting. The Targum mentions the Israelites angering God at Tav’eiroh, Massoh, Kivros Hata’voh, and the Graves of Desire. 

|וּבִשְׁלֹ֨חַ יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶתְכֶ֗ם מִקָּדֵ֤שׁ בַּרְנֵ֙עַ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר עֲלוּ֙ וּרְשׁ֣וּ אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לָכֶ֑ם וַתַּמְר֗וּ אֶת־פִּ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹ֣הֵיכֶ֔ם וְלֹ֤א הֶֽאֱמַנְתֶּם֙ ל֔וֹ וְלֹ֥א שְׁמַעְתֶּ֖ם בְּקֹלֽוֹ׃|23|And when יהוה sent you on from Kadesh-barnea, saying, “Go up and take possession of the land that I am giving you,” you flouted the command of your God יהוה —whom you did not put your trust in nor obey.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites did not believe or listen to God when they were sent to spy out the land, leading to disobedience and a lack of trust and obedience that ultimately prevented them from entering the promised land despite God's instructions (Targum). 

|מַמְרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם עִם־יְהֹוָ֑ה מִיּ֖וֹם דַּעְתִּ֥י אֶתְכֶֽם׃|24|As long as I have known you, you have been defiant toward יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rav Hirsch and Steinsaltz comment on the Israelites' past defiance of the Lord. Halakhah states that five deeds can hinder repentance, including hating admonishment. Ramban, Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, Tur HaArokh, Ibn Ezra, and Rashi discuss Moses' actions and character in various situations. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan convey the people's disobedience towards God. 

|וָֽאֶתְנַפַּ֞ל לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֗ה אֵ֣ת אַרְבָּעִ֥ים הַיּ֛וֹם וְאֶת־אַרְבָּעִ֥ים הַלַּ֖יְלָה אֲשֶׁ֣ר הִתְנַפָּ֑לְתִּי כִּֽי־אָמַ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה לְהַשְׁמִ֥יד אֶתְכֶֽם׃|25|When I lay prostrate before יהוה those forty days and forty nights,  because יהוה was determined to destroy you,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses prayed for forty days and nights after the sin of the Golden Calf to prevent God from destroying the people, emphasizing the importance of upholding the covenant and the consequences of disobedience. Prostration is a proper form of repentance and confession before God, as exemplified by Moses and the Kohen Gadol during Yom Kippur. The value of prayer is revealed through both lengthy and brief prayers in Jewish thought, while praying quickly is akin to Moshe's prayer in Kabbalah. The Midrash discusses the importance of moderation in prayer, citing examples of Moses praying both long and short prayers, with Ramban, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Chizkuni providing additional insights on Moses' prayer. The Talmud teaches that there is no set limit to the duration of a prayer, as exemplified by Moses praying for forty days and nights without limit. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Moses prostrating himself before the Lord for forty days and nights to prevent the destruction of the people. 

|וָאֶתְפַּלֵּ֣ל אֶל־יְהֹוָה֮ וָאֹמַר֒ אֲדֹנָ֣י יֱהֹוִ֗ה אַל־תַּשְׁחֵ֤ת עַמְּךָ֙ וְנַחֲלָ֣תְךָ֔ אֲשֶׁ֥ר פָּדִ֖יתָ בְּגׇדְלֶ֑ךָ אֲשֶׁר־הוֹצֵ֥אתָ מִמִּצְרַ֖יִם בְּיָ֥ד חֲזָקָֽה׃|26|I prayed to יהוה and said, “O Lord יהוה, do not annihilate Your very own people, whom You redeemed in Your majesty and whom You freed from Egypt with a mighty hand.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses prayed for God's mercy on the Israelites, emphasizing their unique relationship and redemption from Egypt. Prolonged prayer without intellectual analysis is powerful, like Moshe's prayer preceded by Torah study. The name Adona”y HaShem signifies the ascent of the Sefirot. The liturgy on Yom Kippur draws on biblical examples to show God's responsiveness to prayer. Moses and Jacob's prayers in the Midrash demonstrate the power of prayer to change God's decree. Nachmanides explains Moses' plea for mercy over justice in praying for the Israelites. Rabbi Ḥanin and Rabbi Ḥanina teach that prolonged prayer is accepted, as seen in Moses' forty-day prayer. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also mention a prayer for mercy on the Israelites. 

|זְכֹר֙ לַעֲבָדֶ֔יךָ לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם לְיִצְחָ֖ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹ֑ב אַל־תֵּ֗פֶן אֶל־קְשִׁי֙ הָעָ֣ם הַזֶּ֔ה וְאֶל־רִשְׁע֖וֹ וְאֶל־חַטָּאתֽוֹ׃|27|Give thought to Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and pay no heed to the stubbornness of this people, its wickedness, and its sinfulness.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Haamek Davar commentary explains that the generation involved in the Golden Calf incident were punished for intentional idol worship and unintentional sin. Liturgy prayers ask for God's mercy and protection, emphasizing repentance and submission. In the Midrash, Moses pleads with God to spare the Israelites by reminding Him of His mercy. In Musar, performing a mitzvah brings goodness, and repentance removes sins from God's sight. The Talmud states that prolonged prayer is accepted, using Moses' example. The Targums on Deuteronomy 9:27 mention pleading for God to remember the patriarchs and overlook the people's stubbornness and sin. 

|פֶּן־יֹאמְר֗וּ הָאָ֘רֶץ֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הוֹצֵאתָ֣נוּ מִשָּׁם֒ מִבְּלִי֙ יְכֹ֣לֶת יְהֹוָ֔ה לַהֲבִיאָ֕ם אֶל־הָאָ֖רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּ֣ר לָהֶ֑ם וּמִשִּׂנְאָת֣וֹ אוֹתָ֔ם הוֹצִיאָ֖ם לַהֲמִתָ֥ם בַּמִּדְבָּֽר׃|28|Else the country from which You freed us will say, ‘It was because יהוה was powerless to bring them into the land promised to them, and because of having rejected them, that [their god] brought them out to have them die in the wilderness.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses prayed to God to prevent the nations from thinking He was unable to bring the Israelites to the Promised Land and had brought them out of Egypt to kill them in the wilderness. The concern was that the Egyptians would doubt God's power and intentions if the Israelites perished quickly after leaving Egypt. Rashbam explains God's anger towards the Israelites in Deuteronomy 29:24, Ramban discusses Korach's rebellion in Numbers 16, Rashi explains Job 13:7, and Chizkuni emphasizes maintaining a good relationship with God in Deuteronomy 10:10. Tanakh highlights Moses pleading with God not to destroy the Israelites, reminding Him of His presence with the people. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also emphasize the fear of the inhabitants of the land thinking God brought the Israelites out of Egypt to kill them. 

|וְהֵ֥ם עַמְּךָ֖ וְנַחֲלָתֶ֑ךָ אֲשֶׁ֤ר הוֹצֵ֙אתָ֙ בְּכֹחֲךָ֣ הַגָּדֹ֔ל וּבִֽזְרֹעֲךָ֖ הַנְּטוּיָֽה׃|29|Yet they are Your very own people, whom You freed with Your great might and Your outstretched arm.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses pleads for God's mercy on the Jewish people, emphasizing their status as His chosen people and inheritance. Liturgy during Sukkot includes prayers for salvation and protection, invoking righteous individuals and emphasizing faithfulness and humility. In the Midrash, Moses prays for the people of Israel and their relationship with God, highlighting their status as His people and inheritance. Ramban and Ibn Ezra provide insights into Moses' prayers and the meaning of certain phrases in Scripture. Targum interpretations emphasize the Israelites as God's people and territory, brought out with His great power.

## Deuteronomy 10

|בָּעֵ֨ת הַהִ֜וא אָמַ֧ר יְהֹוָ֣ה אֵלַ֗י פְּסׇל־לְךָ֞ שְׁנֵֽי־לוּחֹ֤ת אֲבָנִים֙ כָּרִ֣אשֹׁנִ֔ים וַעֲלֵ֥ה אֵלַ֖י הָהָ֑רָה וְעָשִׂ֥יתָ לְּךָ֖ אֲר֥וֹן עֵֽץ׃|1|Thereupon יהוה said to me, “Carve out two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain; and make an ark of wood.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

G-d instructed Moses to carve two sets of stone tablets, with the first set being the work of G-d and the second set made by Moses, housed in two separate arks. The blowing of the shofar on Rosh Chodesh Elul serves as a call to repentance, drawing parallels to Moses being called up the mountain after the sin of the Golden Calf. Moses's partnership with God in creating the tablets highlights the interrelationship between man and God, with divine influence seen in the radiance on Moses's face. The breaking and renewal of the tablets symbolized forgiveness and restoration of the covenant. The Talmud discusses the construction of the Ark of the Covenant and the placement of the broken tablets, with differing opinions on its construction and significance for future generations. 

|וְאֶכְתֹּב֙ עַל־הַלֻּחֹ֔ת אֶ֨ת־הַדְּבָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָי֛וּ עַל־הַלֻּחֹ֥ת הָרִאשֹׁנִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר שִׁבַּ֑רְתָּ וְשַׂמְתָּ֖ם בָּאָרֽוֹן׃|2|I will inscribe on the tablets the commandments that were on the first tablets that you smashed, and you shall deposit them in the ark.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God does not change His law for human errors, only offering the choice to abandon or return to it, with the new tablets containing the same law. The broken and restored tablets in the ark serve as a reminder of the consequences of straying from the law and the importance of returning to it. The Tablets of the Covenant were placed in the Ark, emphasizing the importance of the Oral Torah in expounding upon the written Torah. The Talmud discusses the sanctity of Torah scholars and the measurements of the Ark, with differing opinions on the size and placement of the tablets within it. Moses smashing the Tablets was later praised by G’d for breaking the spell of idol worship. 

|וָאַ֤עַשׂ אֲרוֹן֙ עֲצֵ֣י שִׁטִּ֔ים וָאֶפְסֹ֛ל שְׁנֵי־לֻחֹ֥ת אֲבָנִ֖ים כָּרִאשֹׁנִ֑ים וָאַ֣עַל הָהָ֔רָה וּשְׁנֵ֥י הַלֻּחֹ֖ת בְּיָדִֽי׃|3|I made an ark of acacia wood and carved out two tablets of stone like the first; I took the two tablets with me and went up the mountain.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra interprets a perfect as a pluperfect to explain Moses assembling the people to make the ark, which is identified as the same one made by Bezalel, not contradicting Rabbinic tradition. Tur HaArokh and Steinsaltz describe Moses constructing the ark of acacia wood and carving two stone tablets, with Chizkuni specifying that Moses ascended the mountain on a Thursday. Kabbalah emphasizes the connection between the written Torah and the Oral Torah by placing the Tablets of the Covenant in the Ark. Ramban clarifies that G-d, not Moses, wrote on the Tablets, while Or HaChaim discusses the distinction between the temporary ark Moses made and the permanent one by Betzalel. Chizkuni explains the timeline of the Tablets being placed in the ark Moses made before being transferred to the Holy Ark. Tanakh describes Moses carving two stone tablets and going up Mount Sinai in the morning, as commanded by יהוה. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe Moses making a case and an ark of shittim wood and carrying two stone tablets up the mountain. 

|וַיִּכְתֹּ֨ב עַֽל־הַלֻּחֹ֜ת כַּמִּכְתָּ֣ב הָרִאשׁ֗וֹן אֵ֚ת עֲשֶׂ֣רֶת הַדְּבָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר דִּבֶּר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֲלֵיכֶ֥ם בָּהָ֛ר מִתּ֥וֹךְ הָאֵ֖שׁ בְּי֣וֹם הַקָּהָ֑ל וַיִּתְּנֵ֥ם יְהֹוָ֖ה אֵלָֽי׃|4|After inscribing on the tablets the same text as on the first—the Ten Commandments that יהוה addressed to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the Assembly— יהוה gave them to me.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbi Berekhya explained that the prince of Gad's offerings symbolized significant events related to the exodus from Egypt and the leaders of Israel, while the Targum and Onkelos state that Moses wrote the Ten Commandments on the tablets according to God's original words, which were then given to Moses. G'd Himself inscribed the Tablets with the same words as the first set, as confirmed by Moses in Deuteronomy 10:4, with Hashem addressing the Israelites differently regarding the first and second sets in Deuteronomy 4:12. Chizkuni also confirms that G'd wrote on the Tablets. 

|וָאֵ֗פֶן וָֽאֵרֵד֙ מִן־הָהָ֔ר וָֽאָשִׂם֙ אֶת־הַלֻּחֹ֔ת בָּאָר֖וֹן אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשִׂ֑יתִי וַיִּ֣הְיוּ שָׁ֔ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוַּ֖נִי יְהֹוָֽה׃|5|Then I left and went down from the mountain, and I deposited the tablets in the ark that I had made, where they still are, as יהוה had commanded me.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses placed the Tablets in the ark after descending from Mount Sinai, following God's command for His glory to be among the Children of Israel. The Talmud discusses Moses adding a day of purity before giving the Torah, breaking the tablets to prevent death, and staying apart based on his own reasoning and God's will. The Targum confirms Moses placing the tablets in the ark he made, as commanded by the Lord. 

|וּבְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל נָ֥סְע֛וּ מִבְּאֵרֹ֥ת בְּנֵי־יַעֲקָ֖ן מוֹסֵרָ֑ה שָׁ֣ם מֵ֤ת אַהֲרֹן֙ וַיִּקָּבֵ֣ר שָׁ֔ם וַיְכַהֵ֛ן אֶלְעָזָ֥ר בְּנ֖וֹ תַּחְתָּֽיו׃|6|From Beeroth-bene-jaakan  the Israelites marched to Moserah. Aaron died there and was buried there; and his son Eleazar became priest in his stead.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses rebukes Israelites for fearing war and appointing a leader to return to Egypt, while various commentaries discuss Aaron's death, the Israelites' movements, mourning, and the significance of his passing. The Talmud and Tanakh mention the consequences of Aaron's death, including attacks by Canaanites and Amalek, while the Targum describes the mourning period and Elazar's succession. The importance of emulating God's virtues, acts of kindness, and justice are emphasized in the Musar commentary. 

|מִשָּׁ֥ם נָסְע֖וּ הַגֻּדְגֹּ֑דָה וּמִן־הַגֻּדְגֹּ֣דָה יׇטְבָ֔תָה אֶ֖רֶץ נַ֥חֲלֵי מָֽיִם׃|7|From there they marched to Gudgod,  and from Gudgod to Jotbath, a region of running brooks.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains the Israelites mourned Aaron's death at Mosera, emphasizing the death of the righteous. Ibn Ezra clarifies Gudgod is a general term for Zalmonah, Punon, and Oboth, not Hor-haggidgad, and discusses Eleazar's ministry in Gudgod and Jotbah. Midrash mentions conflicts with Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Tzin, Aaron's death at 123 causing the clouds of glory to disappear, and battles with Sihon. In Tanakh, Aaron dies on Mount Hor, leading to mourning and battles with the Canaanites. Targum mentions the Israelites traveling from Goodgode to Yotvos with abundant water sources. 

|בָּעֵ֣ת הַהִ֗וא הִבְדִּ֤יל יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־שֵׁ֣בֶט הַלֵּוִ֔י לָשֵׂ֖את אֶת־אֲר֣וֹן בְּרִית־יְהֹוָ֑ה לַעֲמֹד֩ לִפְנֵ֨י יְהֹוָ֤ה לְשָֽׁרְתוֹ֙ וּלְבָרֵ֣ךְ בִּשְׁמ֔וֹ עַ֖ד הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|8|At that time יהוה set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark of יהוה’s Covenant, to stand in attendance upon יהוה, and to bless in God’s name, as is still the case.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The tribe of Levi was separated by God to serve as priests and Levites, with the priests being permitted to carry the Ark. Levites are designated for service in the Sanctuary, priests must recite blessings standing, and the Priestly Benediction is recited in specific services. The hierarchy within the Jewish community places priests above Levites, Levites above Israelites, and so on based on genealogy and societal status. In terms of precedence, a Torah scholar mamzer takes precedence over an ignorant High Priest. Serving God is seen as a privilege that surpasses all worldly pleasures, with the honor of being chosen for service far surpassing earthly recognition. The distinction between priests, Levites, and Israelites is based on the separation of Levites to bear the Ark and priests for sanctification, with the Priestly Benediction performed standing and with lifted hands. 

|עַל־כֵּ֞ן לֹֽא־הָיָ֧ה לְלֵוִ֛י חֵ֥לֶק וְנַחֲלָ֖ה עִם־אֶחָ֑יו יְהֹוָה֙ ה֣וּא נַחֲלָת֔וֹ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֶּ֛ר יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לֽוֹ׃|9|That is why Levi has received no hereditary portion along with its kin: יהוה is its portion, as your God יהוה spoke concerning it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Levites did not receive a portion of land because they were dedicated to serving at the altar and receiving sustenance from the Temple, as explained by various commentators. The Negative Mitzvah 114 prohibits shearing consecrated animals and the tribe of Levi is commanded against receiving an inheritance in the land of Canaan. The land of Israel was divided amongst the twelve tribes, with Levi not receiving land and Joseph being counted as two separate tribes. The Levites were set apart by the Lord and did not receive land as their portion, with God being their inheritance. 

|וְאָנֹכִ֞י עָמַ֣דְתִּי בָהָ֗ר כַּיָּמִים֙ הָרִ֣אשֹׁנִ֔ים אַרְבָּעִ֣ים י֔וֹם וְאַרְבָּעִ֖ים לָ֑יְלָה וַיִּשְׁמַ֨ע יְהֹוָ֜ה אֵלַ֗י גַּ֚ם בַּפַּ֣עַם הַהִ֔וא לֹא־אָבָ֥ה יְהֹוָ֖ה הַשְׁחִיתֶֽךָ׃|10|I had stayed on the mountain, as I did the first time, forty days and forty nights; and יהוה heeded me once again: יהוה agreed not to destroy you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses spent a total of 120 days on the mountain, with the last forty days focused on seeking forgiveness for the people's sins, which was granted on Yom Kippur. Prostration in prayer, based on Moses's actions, symbolizes returning one's soul to God. Prolonged prayer rooted in deep spiritual feeling, exemplified by Moses, is powerful and effective, while mixing intellectual functions into prayer can lead to disappointment. Moses dissolved God's vow regarding Israel's sin by referencing nullification of vows and restrained angels from harming Israel. The Gemara discusses Moses sitting and standing on the mount, with resolutions provided by different rabbis, and cites Moses's forty days of prayer as evidence of the acceptance of prolonged prayer. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֵלַ֔י ק֛וּם לֵ֥ךְ לְמַסַּ֖ע לִפְנֵ֣י הָעָ֑ם וְיָבֹ֙אוּ֙ וְיִֽירְשׁ֣וּ אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־נִשְׁבַּ֥עְתִּי לַאֲבֹתָ֖ם לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶֽם׃|11|And יהוה said to me, “Up, resume the march at the head of the people, that they may go in and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Chasidut text discusses the recital of a specific verse following the Shema based on biblical references. The Commentary emphasizes God's instruction to Moses despite the Israelites' sin. The Midrash highlights the importance of Torah, consequences of sin, and the relationship between justice and mercy in relation to entering the Land. The Tanakh mentions God's instructions to Moses to lead the people to the promised land, with accountability for their sins.

|כִּ֚י יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֔ם ה֚וּא אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽאֱלֹהִ֔ים וַאֲדֹנֵ֖י הָאֲדֹנִ֑ים הָאֵ֨ל הַגָּדֹ֤ל הַגִּבֹּר֙ וְהַנּוֹרָ֔א אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹא־יִשָּׂ֣א פָנִ֔ים וְלֹ֥א יִקַּ֖ח שֹֽׁחַד׃|17|For your God יהוה is God supreme and Lord supreme,  the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who shows no favor and takes no bribe,|

Jacob's vow in Genesis 28:20 asks for protection, sustenance, and clothing during his journey, reflecting the importance of providing for the vulnerable in society as emphasized by Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 10:18. 

|וַאֲהַבְתֶּ֖ם אֶת־הַגֵּ֑ר כִּֽי־גֵרִ֥ים הֱיִיתֶ֖ם בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|19|You too must befriend the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of loving and showing kindness to strangers is emphasized in various commentaries, halakhic texts, Jewish thought, Midrashim, and Tanakh passages, highlighting the shared experience of being strangers in Egypt and the command to treat converts with love and compassion. The duty to love strangers is rooted in the belief that God upholds justice and compassion for the vulnerable, and reflects the values of justice and compassion central to Judaism. The Targum commentary on Deuteronomy 10:19 also stresses the importance of showing compassion to strangers based on the Israelites' own history as strangers in Egypt. 

|אֶת־יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ תִּירָ֖א אֹת֣וֹ תַעֲבֹ֑ד וּב֣וֹ תִדְבָּ֔ק וּבִשְׁמ֖וֹ תִּשָּׁבֵֽעַ׃|20|You must revere יהוה: only your God shall you worship, to [God] shall you hold fast, and by God’s name shall you swear.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the power of tzaddikim to settle God's anger and sweeten judgments, contrasting them with the wicked who distance themselves from God despite the world being created for their benefit. The Torah commands individuals to fear, serve, and cleave to the Lord, allowing them to swear by His Name once these attributes are acquired. Halakhah outlines the commandments to cling to God, fear Him, pray to Him, and swear in His name truthfully, with additional emphasis on associating with Torah scholars, praying daily, and avoiding negative speech.

|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the spread of prophecy comes from the root souls of Israel symbolized by the seventy souls descending to Egypt, emphasizing the essential role of glory.

|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut focuses on instilling love for God through understanding and meditation on commandments, contrasting with Korach's self-serving intentions. Halakhah emphasizes the positive commandment to love God and love for converts. Kabbalah discusses the importance of loving others and fulfilling mitzvot. Liturgy highlights the requirements of fearing, loving, and serving God. Midrash explains the uniqueness of Moses' blessings. Musar emphasizes embracing wisdom and service with love and devotion. Quoting Commentary discusses Job's questioning of suffering and the interpretation of "halacha le-Moshe mi-Sinai." Targum stresses the importance of loving and observing God's word consistently. 

|וִֽידַעְתֶּם֮ הַיּוֹם֒ כִּ֣י ׀ לֹ֣א אֶת־בְּנֵיכֶ֗ם אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יָדְעוּ֙ וַאֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־רָא֔וּ אֶת־מוּסַ֖ר יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֑ם אֶת־גׇּדְל֕וֹ אֶת־יָדוֹ֙ הַחֲזָקָ֔ה וּזְרֹע֖וֹ הַנְּטוּיָֽה׃|2|Take thought this day that it was not your children, who neither experienced nor witnessed the lesson of your God יהוה —God’s majesty, mighty hand, and outstretched arm;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Or HaChaim, Rashbam, Da'at Zekenim, and various commentaries emphasize different aspects of God's greatness, miracles, discipline, and punishment in the Exodus story. Jewish thought highlights the importance of self-accounting, fulfilling commandments on behalf of the public, and serving God with wisdom and wholeheartedness. The liturgy in Deuteronomy emphasizes fearing and loving God, keeping His commandments, and caring for strangers. Resh Laqish compares Moses carrying out God's orders to a wife obeying her husband, while Musar discusses Moses' doubt in his prophecy leading to opposition from Korach. Sforno and Rabbeinu Bahya provide insights on the tetragrammaton sequences in the Torah, indicating justice and mercy. Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Tafsir Rasag stress the importance of knowing and recognizing God's teachings and actions. 

|וְאֶת־אֹֽתֹתָיו֙ וְאֶֽת־מַעֲשָׂ֔יו אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה בְּת֣וֹךְ מִצְרָ֑יִם לְפַרְעֹ֥ה מֶֽלֶךְ־מִצְרַ֖יִם וּלְכׇל־אַרְצֽוֹ׃|3|the signs and the deeds that [God] performed in Egypt against Pharaoh king of Egypt and all his land;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains Pharaoh's significance in Deuteronomy 11:3:1, while Rav Hirsch interprets "His signs and His works" as miracles in Egypt. Destroying a holy name of God violates a Torah prohibition, subjecting one to lashes. In Midrash, Moses blesses Israel before the Angel of Death, God measures the earth before giving the Torah, and certain things are permitted for gentiles but not for Israel. The brothers thought the caravan was Ishmaelites but were merchants who bought Joseph from the Midianites. Targum references God's signs and deeds in Egypt towards Pharaoh. 

|וַאֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂה֩ לְחֵ֨יל מִצְרַ֜יִם לְסוּסָ֣יו וּלְרִכְבּ֗וֹ אֲשֶׁ֨ר הֵצִ֜יף אֶת־מֵ֤י יַם־סוּף֙ עַל־פְּנֵיהֶ֔ם בְּרׇדְפָ֖ם אַחֲרֵיכֶ֑ם וַיְאַבְּדֵ֣ם יְהֹוָ֔ה עַ֖ד הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|4|what [God] did to Egypt’s army, its horses and chariots; how יהוה rolled back upon them the waters of the Sea of Reeds when they were pursuing you, thus destroying them once and for all;  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The phrase "unto this day" in Deuteronomy 11:4 likely refers to the lasting impact of the defeat of the Egyptian army at the Red Sea, symbolizing the downfall of Egypt as a powerful kingdom. The text explains that the Holy One offered the Torah to all nations, but only Israel accepted it, with the nations being punished for rejecting it. Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rashi, and Chizkuni provide interpretations of different biblical verses related to speaking, walking, and the actions of the Egyptians. The Targum recounts God's destruction of the Egyptian army at the Red Sea, which is remembered as a punishment for their pursuit of the Israelites. 

|וַאֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֛ה לָכֶ֖ם בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר עַד־בֹּאֲכֶ֖ם עַד־הַמָּק֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|5|what [God] did for you in the wilderness before you arrived in this place;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text from Deuteronomy 11:5 mentions the manna in the wilderness as something God did for the Israelites, connecting various experiences in the desert to God's guidance. In times of ease, it is important to remember punishments and chastisements witnessed in the desert to prevent being enticed by worldly pleasures. The Midrash emphasizes the greatness of God and praises those engaged with the Torah for being delivered from enslavement. Rabbeinu Bahya and Ramban interpret different aspects of Moses being commanded tasks and the punishments inflicted on the Israelites. The Targums discuss how God helped the Israelites in the wilderness until they reached their destination. 

|וַאֲשֶׁ֨ר עָשָׂ֜ה לְדָתָ֣ן וְלַאֲבִירָ֗ם בְּנֵ֣י אֱלִיאָב֮ בֶּן־רְאוּבֵן֒ אֲשֶׁ֨ר פָּצְתָ֤ה הָאָ֙רֶץ֙ אֶת־פִּ֔יהָ וַתִּבְלָעֵ֥ם וְאֶת־בָּתֵּיהֶ֖ם וְאֶת־אׇהֳלֵיהֶ֑ם וְאֵ֤ת כׇּל־הַיְקוּם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּרַגְלֵיהֶ֔ם בְּקֶ֖רֶב כׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|6|and what [God] did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab son of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them, along with their households, their tents, and every living thing in their train, from amidst all Israel—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the connection between money, truth, and breaking greed, with wealth symbolizing judgment and the ability to raise a person up. In the commentary, various interpretations are provided on the punishment of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with explanations on the significance of their actions and the miraculous events that occurred. The Midrash discusses hidden treasures, the consequences of quarreling with authority figures, and the fate of those involved in the rebellion. The Talmud delves into Korah's wealth leading to his downfall, and the Tanakh recounts the rebellion and punishment of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. The Targum describes the earth swallowing them as a punishment for their rebellion against God. 

|כִּ֤י עֵֽינֵיכֶם֙ הָֽרֹאֹ֔ת אֶת־כׇּל־מַעֲשֵׂ֥ה יְהֹוָ֖ה הַגָּדֹ֑ל אֲשֶׁ֖ר עָשָֽׂה׃|7|but that it was you who saw with your own eyes all the marvelous deeds that יהוה performed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites are responsible for passing on their firsthand knowledge of God's miracles to future generations. The righteous are considered alive even in death, while the wicked are considered dead even in life. Ramban explains the sale of Joseph involving the Ishmaelites and Midianites, and Rabbeinu Bahya discusses the significance of greatness in various contexts related to Hashem's name. The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 11:7 highlight the Israelites' personal witness to God's great works. 

|וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם֙ אֶת־כׇּל־הַמִּצְוָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם לְמַ֣עַן תֶּחֶזְק֗וּ וּבָאתֶם֙ וִֽירִשְׁתֶּ֣ם אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר אַתֶּ֛ם עֹבְרִ֥ים שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|8|Keep, therefore, all the Instruction that I enjoin upon you today, so that you may have the strength to enter and take possession of the land that you are about to cross into and possess,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra points out a vocalization error in Deuteronomy 11:8, Sforno stresses inscribing Torah on stones, Or HaChaim highlights Torah study's strengthening power for war, Rav Hirsch connects commandment observance with Israel's strength and endurance, Steinsaltz emphasizes the importance of observing commandments to possess the land, Da'at Zekenim stresses strength to fulfill commandments out of love for God, Abarbanel links mitzvot performance to blessing or curse, and Chizkuni explains that observing commandments ensures Israel's endurance in their land. Liturgy emphasizes fearing God, walking in His ways, loving Him, serving Him with heart and soul, keeping commandments, and circumcising hearts, while Targum sources stress the importance of keeping commandments to be strengthened and inherit the land. Ibn Ezra interprets טפוף in Isaiah 3:16 as speaking, swimming slowly, or walking like a child. 

|וּלְמַ֨עַן תַּאֲרִ֤יכוּ יָמִים֙ עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁבַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה לַאֲבֹתֵיכֶ֛ם לָתֵ֥ת לָהֶ֖ם וּלְזַרְעָ֑ם אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּדְבָֽשׁ׃|9|and that you may long endure upon the soil that יהוה swore to your fathers to assign to them and to their heirs, a land flowing with milk and honey.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Failure to observe God's commandments will result in exile from the land, while observing them will lead to a long life in the promised land of milk and honey. The liturgy stresses the importance of fearing and serving Adonoy, loving Him, keeping His commandments, and passing on teachings to future generations. Moses rebuked Israel and found favor with God, contrasting with Balaam's flattery. Women, slaves, and minors are exempt from certain religious practices, but still required to pray and have a mezuzah. The reason the Israelites were taken out of Egypt and not given the land is due to the different means of fertility in Egypt and Israel. The Targums emphasize the promise of a land abundant in milk and honey for the forefathers and their descendants. 

|כִּ֣י הָאָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתָּ֤ה בָא־שָׁ֙מָּה֙ לְרִשְׁתָּ֔הּ לֹ֣א כְאֶ֤רֶץ מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ הִ֔וא אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְצָאתֶ֖ם מִשָּׁ֑ם אֲשֶׁ֤ר תִּזְרַע֙ אֶֽת־זַרְעֲךָ֔ וְהִשְׁקִ֥יתָ בְרַגְלְךָ֖ כְּגַ֥ן הַיָּרָֽק׃|10|For the land that you are about to enter and possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come. There the grain you sowed had to be watered by your own labors,  like a vegetable garden;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text contrasts the Land of Israel's reliance on rainfall for irrigation with Egypt's dependence on the Nile River, highlighting the importance of observing God's commandments to ensure rain and sustenance. The Midrash discusses the Israelites' lack of belief in the land's superiority despite God's praise, leading to the spying mission and their subsequent prohibition from entering the land. The Talmud delves into the measurement of a garden bed's internal area based on Deuteronomy 11:10, while the Tanakh and Targum reference the provision of water in the land and the settlement of Joseph's family in Egypt. 

|וְהָאָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתֶּ֜ם עֹבְרִ֥ים שָׁ֙מָּה֙ לְרִשְׁתָּ֔הּ אֶ֥רֶץ הָרִ֖ים וּבְקָעֹ֑ת לִמְטַ֥ר הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם תִּשְׁתֶּה־מָּֽיִם׃|11|but the land you are about to cross into and possess, a land of hills and valleys, soaks up its water from the rains of heaven.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The land of Canaan has hills and valleys, dependent on rain for water, and is under God's constant care (Deuteronomy 11:11-12). Priests cannot add to the priestly blessing and must recite prayers before and after blessing the community (Halakhah). All phenomena in the world have matter, form, and previous existence, with humans given the Torah to overcome metamorphosis and become part of the world of pure spirits through good deeds (Jewish Thought). God's will is carried out on His creations, including angels who can take different forms, and rain is received in various ways in Eretz Yisrael (Midrash). The Mishnah Eruvin 5:4 describes how to measure a Shabbat limit, while Rabbi Yehoshua explains the world's water source and the unique nature of preparing the ground in Eretz Yisrael (Talmud). Genesis 2:6 suggests a natural irrigation system before rain existed, and Targum describes the land of Israel as having mountains, valleys, and rainwater (Tanakh, Targum). 

|אֶ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ דֹּרֵ֣שׁ אֹתָ֑הּ תָּמִ֗יד עֵינֵ֨י יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ בָּ֔הּ מֵֽרֵשִׁית֙ הַשָּׁנָ֔ה וְעַ֖ד אַחֲרִ֥ית שָׁנָֽה׃|12|It is a land which your God יהוה looks after, on which your God יהוה always keeps an eye, from year’s beginning to year’s end.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Abraham's revelation of God's providence and the connection between seeking God's presence and charity for the Land of Israel. The purification of vessels symbolizes moving from impurity to holiness, while sin causes a distance between a person and God. The removal of the foreskin reveals the divine life force, and the Jewish people are spiritually first, with the Land of Israel connected to divine providence. The Babylonian Talmud discusses different criteria for multiple New Years, and the blowing of the shofar on Rosh Ha-shana is a mitzvah to express humility. The Kabbalah emphasizes the importance of Torah study and connecting it to prayer, while the Targum highlights God's constant care for the land of Israel throughout the year. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה אִם־שָׁמֹ֤עַ תִּשְׁמְעוּ֙ אֶל־מִצְוֺתַ֔י אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י מְצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם הַיּ֑וֹם לְאַהֲבָ֞ה אֶת־יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶם֙ וּלְעׇבְד֔וֹ בְּכׇל־לְבַבְכֶ֖ם וּבְכׇל־נַפְשְׁכֶֽם׃|13|If, then, you obey the commandments that I enjoin upon you this day, loving your God יהוה and serving [God] with all your heart and soul,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that the acceptance of the Torah is equal for all, but the reward depends on the impression it makes in one's heart, with prayer being the service of the heart. Halakhah discusses the specifics of prayer, the Shema, Tefillin, and Mezuzah, highlighting the importance of Torah study and the connection between miracles and nature. Jewish Thought focuses on key principles of faith, love and service to God, and the purpose of prayer in strengthening the relationship with the Creator. Kabbalah discusses the significance of Tefilin and Mezuzah in representing divine lights and unity. Liturgy emphasizes obeying God's commandments for blessings, while Midrash discusses the importance of mitzvot for the Jewish people. Mishnah details the breaks in the Shema prayer and the recitation of blessings by priests. Musar emphasizes the importance of prayer with intention and the higher level of service that comes from love and devotion.

|--:|:-:|:--|

Parents are instructed to teach their children the Torah from a young age, ensuring it becomes a central aspect of their thoughts, speech, and actions throughout their lives. Women, slaves, and minors are not obligated to study Torah, but fathers have the obligation to teach their sons Torah from a young age.

|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the intention one should have when wearing tefillin, focusing on the absorption of attributes of wisdom and understanding into the En Sof, using one's wisdom and understanding only for God, nullifying the attribute of daat in the soul, studying Torah daily, the connection between length of days and conducting business matters faithfully, and the light of life coming from the Light of the Face as a sign of life. Fulfilling commandments leads to increased lifespan and blessings, with connections to the resurrection of the dead, eternal nature of the land of Israel for the Jewish people, and following God's laws for a prosperous life.

The Talmud emphasizes the importance of fulfilling the mitzvot related to the mezuzah, phylacteries, and the passages of the Shema for the well-being and longevity of one's children. Keeping the covenant brings blessings, both material and spiritual, but success should not lead to forgetfulness of God's kindness. The longevity of the Israelites and their children on the land promised by God is emphasized in Targum texts. 

|כִּי֩ אִם־שָׁמֹ֨ר תִּשְׁמְר֜וּן אֶת־כׇּל־הַמִּצְוָ֣ה הַזֹּ֗את אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י מְצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם לַעֲשֹׂתָ֑הּ לְאַהֲבָ֞ה אֶת־יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֛ם לָלֶ֥כֶת בְּכׇל־דְּרָכָ֖יו וּלְדׇבְקָה־בֽוֹ׃|22|If, then, you faithfully keep all this Instruction that I command you, loving your God יהוה, walking in all God’s ways, and holding fast to [God],|

|--:|:-:|:--|

God promises to drive out nations before the Israelites if they fulfill their obligations, allowing them to easily earn a livelihood and serve God. The conquest of Canaan must follow a specific order, with individual conquests not having the same legal status. By studying haggadah, one can recognize and cleave to God's ways. Ramban explains that the Israelites can conquer any land they desire with Divine assurance. The letter refutes claims of verses alluding to Mohammed and emphasizes the importance of preserving the laws of Moses and dealing cautiously with heretics. 

|כׇּל־הַמָּק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁ֨ר תִּדְרֹ֧ךְ כַּֽף־רַגְלְכֶ֛ם בּ֖וֹ לָכֶ֣ם יִהְיֶ֑ה מִן־הַמִּדְבָּ֨ר וְהַלְּבָנ֜וֹן מִן־הַנָּהָ֣ר נְהַר־פְּרָ֗ת וְעַד֙ הַיָּ֣ם הָאַֽחֲר֔וֹן יִהְיֶ֖ה גְּבֻלְכֶֽם׃|24|Every spot on which your foot treads shall be yours; your territory shall extend from the wilderness to the Lebanon and from the River—the Euphrates—to the Western  Sea.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the promise of the Land of Israel to the Israelites, detailing the boundaries from the wilderness and Lebanon to the Euphrates River and the Mediterranean Sea, with specific borders outlined in Numbers and Joshua. Territories not conquered or settled can become sanctified as part of Israel, with the obligation to conquer as far as the Euphrates River, and the ultimate destiny of Israel as promised by God is emphasized. The conquest of lands outside of Eretz Yisrael was permitted only after conquering Eretz Yisrael proper, with mitzvoth applying in those conquered lands, and territories conquered with the instruction of the Sanhedrin are considered part of Israel. 

|לֹא־יִתְיַצֵּ֥ב אִ֖ישׁ בִּפְנֵיכֶ֑ם פַּחְדְּכֶ֨ם וּמוֹרַֽאֲכֶ֜ם יִתֵּ֣ן ׀ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֗ם עַל־פְּנֵ֤י כׇל־הָאָ֙רֶץ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּדְרְכוּ־בָ֔הּ כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר לָכֶֽם׃|25|No one shall stand up to you: your God יהוה will put the dread and the fear of you over the whole land in which you set foot, as promised.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of reciting the Shema twice daily to acknowledge the Kingdom of Heaven with self-sacrifice.
