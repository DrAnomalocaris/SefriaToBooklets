## Genesis 37

|וַיֵּ֣שֶׁב יַעֲקֹ֔ב בְּאֶ֖רֶץ מְגוּרֵ֣י אָבִ֑יו בְּאֶ֖רֶץ כְּנָֽעַן׃|1 P|Now Jacob was settled in the land where his father had sojourned, the land of Canaan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how Yaakov's settling in Canaan signifies fear and humility, representing his transition to embodying fear and overcoming challenges to maintain divine judgment. It contrasts Yaakov's choice to dwell in the Chosen Land with Esau's permanent possession of Mount Seir, emphasizing Jacob's acknowledgment of his goodness and decision not to inherit land like Esau. The importance of rebuking children to prevent depravity, the imperfection preceding perfection in the world, and the significance of not taking entitlement to the Holy Land for granted are also highlighted. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains that whenever it says "And he dwelt" in the Torah, it signifies impending calamity. 

|אֵ֣לֶּה ׀ תֹּלְד֣וֹת יַעֲקֹ֗ב יוֹסֵ֞ף בֶּן־שְׁבַֽע־עֶשְׂרֵ֤ה שָׁנָה֙ הָיָ֨ה רֹעֶ֤ה אֶת־אֶחָיו֙ בַּצֹּ֔אן וְה֣וּא נַ֗עַר אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י בִלְהָ֛ה וְאֶת־בְּנֵ֥י זִלְפָּ֖ה נְשֵׁ֣י אָבִ֑יו וַיָּבֵ֥א יוֹסֵ֛ף אֶת־דִּבָּתָ֥ם רָעָ֖ה אֶל־אֲבִיהֶֽם׃|2 J R|This, then, is the line of Jacob: At seventeen years of age, Joseph tended the flocks with his brothers, as a helper to the sons of his father’s wives Bilhah and Zilpah. And Joseph brought bad reports of them to their father.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut: Yosef embodied the essence of Yaakov and blessed him with charity and pleasantness, symbolizing the integration of spiritual and physical worlds. Commentary: Various interpretations of "These are the generations of Jacob" are discussed, with insights from Rashbam, Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, and others. Halakhah: Joseph's descent into Egypt was caused by lashon hara. Jewish Thought: The text explores the appellation 'youth' given to Yosef and others, the prohibition of marrying two sisters, Joseph as a stereotype of a Jew, and the distinction between derash and peshat in interpretation. Kabbalah: Jacob, Moses, and Joseph are interconnected, with Joseph mediating between the qualities of Avraham and Yitzchak. Midrash: Joseph was beloved to his father and knew seventy languages. Musar: The importance of refraining from lashon hara and the humility of Joseph are emphasized. Quoting Commentary: Joseph's flaws led to redemption, highlighting character development. Second Temple: Joseph is consistently referred to as young. Talmud: Joseph's semen was emitted between his fingernails, leading to Benjamin's descendants. Targum: Joseph reported his brothers' bad behavior to his father. 

|וְיִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל אָהַ֤ב אֶת־יוֹסֵף֙ מִכׇּל־בָּנָ֔יו כִּֽי־בֶן־זְקֻנִ֥ים ה֖וּא ל֑וֹ וְעָ֥שָׂה ל֖וֹ כְּתֹ֥נֶת פַּסִּֽים׃|3 J E|Now Israel loved Joseph best of all his sons—he was his “child of old age”;  and he had made him an ornamented tunic. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yosef HaTzaddik is known for bringing people closer to Hashem and showing compassion, receiving the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy from Yaakov. Yosef's wisdom and knowledge possibly came from Shem and Eber, and his coat of many colors symbolized his future leadership but also led to jealousy among his brothers. The Midrash draws parallels between Joseph and Zion, emphasizing divine plans and consequences. Jacob's love for Joseph led to his brothers' jealousy and ultimately their exile in Egypt. The Talmud warns against favoritism among children, citing Joseph's colored coat as an example. The High Priest's garments symbolize royalty and honor, reflecting his lofty assignment. Joseph's journey to Egypt was influenced by his complex beliefs and the robe of statecraft, leading to deceptive practices. Tamar wore an ornamented tunic as a maiden princess, similar to the colorful cloak given to Joseph by Yaakov. 

|וַיִּרְא֣וּ אֶחָ֗יו כִּֽי־אֹת֞וֹ אָהַ֤ב אֲבִיהֶם֙ מִכׇּל־אֶחָ֔יו וַֽיִּשְׂנְא֖וּ אֹת֑וֹ וְלֹ֥א יָכְל֖וּ דַּבְּר֥וֹ לְשָׁלֹֽם׃|4 E|And when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of his brothers, they hated him so that they could not speak a friendly word to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text explores the lack of peaceful communication among Joseph and his brothers due to their jealousy stemming from Jacob's favoritism towards Joseph, leading to strife within the family. Various commentaries emphasize the importance of open communication and honesty in expressing feelings, contrasting negative behavior like Naval's ill-will towards others. The Midrash draws parallels between Joseph's experiences and divine decrees, highlighting themes of brotherly love and the fulfillment of divine plans. Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Radak, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Rashi offer insights into the brothers' inability to speak peacefully with Joseph, emphasizing their righteousness and the consequences of their negative feelings. Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz suggests that communication and reconciliation could have prevented the conflict arising from Jacob's favoritism. 

|וַיַּחֲלֹ֤ם יוֹסֵף֙ חֲל֔וֹם וַיַּגֵּ֖ד לְאֶחָ֑יו וַיּוֹסִ֥פוּ ע֖וֹד שְׂנֹ֥א אֹתֽוֹ׃|5 J|Once Joseph had a dream which he told to his brothers; and they hated him even more.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's decision to share his dream with his brothers led to increased hatred towards him, as they interpreted the dream as a sign of his ambition to rule over them. The Midrash and Targum commentaries draw parallels between the experiences of Joseph and Zion, highlighting similarities in love, hatred, dreams, jealousy, stripping, casting into pits, and being raised up. The dream itself was not revealed in the text, leading some commentators to believe it did not come true, and Joseph's insistence on sharing it may have been a factor in the tragic events that followed. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אֲלֵיהֶ֑ם שִׁמְעוּ־נָ֕א הַחֲל֥וֹם הַזֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר חָלָֽמְתִּי׃|6 J|He said to them, “Hear this dream which I have dreamed:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's invitation to his brothers to listen to his dream intensified their hostility towards him, as he insisted they hear him out immediately to prevent any delay in its fulfillment and prove his sincerity. The use of the definitive article "ה" in front of the word "חלום" indicated he had already mentioned having a dream without revealing details, showing his destined greatness was not due to favoritism but a destiny decreed by heaven. The dream of his sheaf standing upright and his brothers' sheaves bowing down foreshadowed their future bowing down to him, with their negative reaction leading to the rise of wicked kings from Joseph's descendants. Nachmanides explains that the brothers' bowing down to the ruler of Egypt fulfilled the first dream, while the second dream of eleven stars bowing down could only come true once Binyamin and Yaakov arrived in Egypt. Onkelos translates Joseph's words as "Listen [now] to this dream that I dreamt," while Targum Jonathan renders it as "And he said to them, Hear now this dream which I have dreamed." 

|וְ֠הִנֵּ֠ה אֲנַ֜חְנוּ מְאַלְּמִ֤ים אֲלֻמִּים֙ בְּת֣וֹךְ הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה וְהִנֵּ֛ה קָ֥מָה אֲלֻמָּתִ֖י וְגַם־נִצָּ֑בָה וְהִנֵּ֤ה תְסֻבֶּ֙ינָה֙ אֲלֻמֹּ֣תֵיכֶ֔ם וַתִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֖יןָ לַאֲלֻמָּתִֽי׃|7 J|There we were binding sheaves in the field, when suddenly my sheaf stood up and remained upright; then your sheaves gathered around and bowed low to my sheaf.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Joseph's behavior towards his brothers to avoid hostility after his dream was fulfilled, Likutei Moharan connects Joseph's rise to a Holy Name for appointing a king, Likutei Halakhot links Joseph's ability to perceive Godliness to his dream, and Tanya explains the Shechinah rising when evil forces disperse. The Midrash compares Joseph's experiences to Zion, emphasizing love, hatred, dreams, and actions. The Second Temple commentary analyzes Joseph's dreams about sheaves and celestial bodies, highlighting his character traits. The Targum translation of Genesis 37:7 depicts Joseph's sheaf standing upright while his brothers' sheaves bow to him. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמְרוּ לוֹ֙ אֶחָ֔יו הֲמָלֹ֤ךְ תִּמְלֹךְ֙ עָלֵ֔ינוּ אִם־מָשׁ֥וֹל תִּמְשֹׁ֖ל בָּ֑נוּ וַיּוֹסִ֤פוּ עוֹד֙ שְׂנֹ֣א אֹת֔וֹ עַל־חֲלֹמֹתָ֖יו וְעַל־דְּבָרָֽיו׃|8 J|His brothers answered, “Do you mean to reign over us? Do you mean to rule over us?” And they hated him even more for his talk about his dreams.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's brothers questioned his dreams of ruling over them, intensifying their hatred towards him, with Onkelos' interpretation preferred. The text discusses the special merit of dwelling in the Land of Israel, attributing Esau's power to residing there. Yehudah offered to serve his brother's sentence in Egypt to spare his father's anguish, leading to Joseph revealing his identity in private and ensuring his family's comfortable relocation to Egypt. The Midrash draws parallels between Joseph and Zion, emphasizing similarities in experiences and spiritual themes. The extreme hatred of Joseph's brothers was rationalized by their fear of his desire to reign over them. Shadal explains the phrase "to rule over the day and the night" in Genesis 1:18, supporting Ramban's interpretation. The text praises those who resist vainglory, recognizing its fleeting nature. The Targum highlights Joseph's brothers' hatred towards him for his dreams of ruling over them. 

|וַיַּחֲלֹ֥ם עוֹד֙ חֲל֣וֹם אַחֵ֔ר וַיְסַפֵּ֥ר אֹת֖וֹ לְאֶחָ֑יו וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הִנֵּ֨ה חָלַ֤מְתִּֽי חֲלוֹם֙ ע֔וֹד וְהִנֵּ֧ה הַשֶּׁ֣מֶשׁ וְהַיָּרֵ֗חַ וְאַחַ֤ד עָשָׂר֙ כּֽוֹכָבִ֔ים מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֖ים לִֽי׃|9 J|He dreamed another dream and told it to his brothers, saying, “Look, I have had another dream: And this time, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Reb Noson explains that Yosef's second dream symbolizes his role as a tzaddik guiding others towards righteousness. In Commentary, Joseph's dream challenges interpreting symbols into reality, with the sun complying with Joshua's command due to his descent from Joseph. In Halakhah, Moses promises rewards in the world to come for Israel, symbolizing God's protection and victory over enemies. In Jewish Thought, the Yalkut Shimoni recounts Joshua's conversation with the sun, emphasizing praising God as a testimony to an absolute Master. In Kabbalah, Joseph reaches the level of 'the Righteous-One' and the 'life-force of the worlds' through worship. In Midrash, praise of the Lord is discussed from angels, righteous individuals, and heavenly bodies, highlighting the significance of dreams and humility. In Musar, Jacob's name as "sun" is interpreted in relation to Joseph's dream, and in Quoting Commentary, Rashi and Rabbeinu Bahya discuss speech forms and the mystical aspects of Torah knowledge. In Second Temple, the Signs in Job 38:32 are connected to the Mazzaroth and the twelve tribes, while in Talmud, Joseph's dream symbolizes his family members bowing down to him, with Rabbi Berekhya noting not all dreams are fully realized. In Targum, Joseph's dream of the sun, moon, and stars bowing down is recounted. 

|וַיְסַפֵּ֣ר אֶל־אָבִיו֮ וְאֶל־אֶחָיו֒ וַיִּגְעַר־בּ֣וֹ אָבִ֔יו וַיֹּ֣אמֶר ל֔וֹ מָ֛ה הַחֲל֥וֹם הַזֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר חָלָ֑מְתָּ הֲב֣וֹא נָב֗וֹא אֲנִי֙ וְאִמְּךָ֣ וְאַחֶ֔יךָ לְהִשְׁתַּחֲוֺ֥ת לְךָ֖ אָֽרְצָה׃|10 J|And when he told it to his father and brothers, his father berated him. “What,” he said to him, “is this dream you have dreamed? Are we to come, I and your mother and your brothers, and bow low to you to the ground?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph shared his dream with his family twice, leading to his father rebuking him to prevent envy and hatred from his brothers. Prostration after Shemoneh Esreh allows for prayer in all three positions of Moses, with no fixed text for supplications. Jacob doubted the prophetic nature of Joseph's dreams, questioning how his deceased wife could be included, indicating a belief in the resurrection of the dead. The Talmud discusses different forms of bowing, including kidda, keria, and hishtaḥava’a, as exemplified in biblical verses. In Genesis 37:10, Joseph's dream leads to his father's rebuke and disbelief in the idea of his family bowing down to him. 

|וַיְקַנְאוּ־ב֖וֹ אֶחָ֑יו וְאָבִ֖יו שָׁמַ֥ר אֶת־הַדָּבָֽר׃|11 J|So his brothers were wrought up at him, and his father kept the matter in mind.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of spiritual preparation before prayer and commandments, with good intentions leading to spiritual growth and fulfillment of commandments. Kabbalah discusses envy as a cause of punishment, seen in figures like Cain, the ten tribes of Israel, and Yeravam. Midrash highlights Joseph's prophetic dreams causing tension and foreshadowing future events, leading to his betrayal and descent into Egypt. Musar focuses on studying Torah for its own sake, connecting Esau's jealousy to the punishment of Jewish scholars, and questioning interpretations of biblical verses. Quoting Commentary examines the active anticipation implied in observing the Sabbath, the need for vigilance and caution in making covenants, and the sanctity of thoughts and intentions. Second Temple discusses Joseph's dream of the sun, moon, and stars bowing to him, reflecting on the power of God. Tanakh and Targum both mention Joseph's dream causing jealousy among his brothers, with his father keeping the matter in mind. 

|וַיֵּלְכ֖וּ אֶחָ֑יו לִרְע֛וֹת אֶׄתׄ־צֹ֥אן אֲבִיהֶ֖ם בִּשְׁכֶֽם׃|12 E|One time, when his brothers had gone to pasture their father’s flock at Shechem,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teaches that the melody helps the shepherd maintain a spiritual mindset while surrounded by animals, referencing Joseph's brothers grazing themselves in Genesis 37:12. The dots above "את" in the same verse suggest a disconnection between tending themselves and their father's flock, leading to evil actions against Joseph. The Yosef narrative in Midrash includes the Yehuda/Tamar episode and chronological issues. Rashi explains the role of Bilhah's sons, and dots over Aharon's name in Numbers 3:39 indicate his exclusion from Levite counting. The Talmud discusses dots in the Torah, while Targum Jonathan and Onkelos mention Joseph's brothers tending their father's sheep in Shechem in Genesis 37:12. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל אֶל־יוֹסֵ֗ף הֲל֤וֹא אַחֶ֙יךָ֙ רֹעִ֣ים בִּשְׁכֶ֔ם לְכָ֖ה וְאֶשְׁלָחֲךָ֣ אֲלֵיהֶ֑ם וַיֹּ֥אמֶר ל֖וֹ הִנֵּֽנִי׃|13 E|Israel said to Joseph, “Your brothers are pasturing at Shechem. Come, I will send you to them.” He answered, “I am ready.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the protective role of tzitzit against immorality, relating to Yosef in SheKheM. Commentary highlights Yosef's obedience to Jacob's command to check on his brothers in Shechem, fulfilling a prophecy about the patriarchs' descendants going to Egypt. Jewish Thought discusses the events in Shechem, the resistance of Dinah, the negotiation with Chamor, the massacre, Jacob's realization of idolatry, and Reuben's actions affecting his status. Midrash focuses on God's desires for love and honor among the people, Joseph's adherence to commandments, Judah's consequences for failing a mitzva, and the benefits of Torah study. Second Temple teachings emphasize the importance of inner beauty and resistance to bodily pleasures. Targum relates Yisrael sending Yosef to Shechem out of concern for the Hivaee attacking his brothers. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר ל֗וֹ לֶךְ־נָ֨א רְאֵ֜ה אֶת־שְׁל֤וֹם אַחֶ֙יךָ֙ וְאֶת־שְׁל֣וֹם הַצֹּ֔אן וַהֲשִׁבֵ֖נִי דָּבָ֑ר וַיִּשְׁלָחֵ֙הוּ֙ מֵעֵ֣מֶק חֶבְר֔וֹן וַיָּבֹ֖א שְׁכֶֽמָה׃|14 E|And he said to him, “Go and see how your brothers are and how the flocks are faring, and bring me back word.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron. When he reached Shechem,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph was sent by Jacob from Hebron to Shechem to check on his brothers, beginning a cycle of events fulfilling the covenant with Abraham. Peace is crucial for the community's well-being, unity is important for holiness, and Torah completes harmony. Jacob's blessing to Joseph before his death is seen as a prophecy of the future of the tribes of Israel. Joseph accepted his father's mission despite danger, showing obedience to parents unless conflicting with God's commandments. Scripture hints at deeper meanings, such as the body coupling with the soul. The descent of the Jewish people to Egypt began with Joseph's journey to his brothers, and it is advised that a Torah scholar should not go out alone at night. 

|וַיִּמְצָאֵ֣הוּ אִ֔ישׁ וְהִנֵּ֥ה תֹעֶ֖ה בַּשָּׂדֶ֑ה וַיִּשְׁאָלֵ֧הוּ הָאִ֛ישׁ לֵאמֹ֖ר מַה־תְּבַקֵּֽשׁ׃|15 E|a man came upon him  wandering in the fields. The man asked him, “What are you looking for?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries and texts discuss the significance of spiritual beings appearing in human form, such as angels guiding Joseph to his brothers and Eliezer's mission to find a wife for Isaac. The Midrash Tanchuma notes the theme of punishment in Shechem, while the Second Temple text emphasizes the importance of being open to better teaching and avoiding negative traits. The distinction between earthly servants and angels is highlighted in the Musar commentary on Eliezer and Mattatron, with references to specific terms indicating their roles. Additionally, the Targum texts mention a man or possibly Gabriel finding Joseph in the field and inquiring about his intentions. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר אֶת־אַחַ֖י אָנֹכִ֣י מְבַקֵּ֑שׁ הַגִּֽידָה־נָּ֣א לִ֔י אֵיפֹ֖ה הֵ֥ם רֹעִֽים׃|16 E|He answered, “I am looking for my brothers. Could you tell me where they are pasturing?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yosef represents severities and benevolences, seeking Divine inspiration in the Diaspora where help is available despite the Shechina not dwelling there. Strengthening oneself and showing kindness to the Shechina can make one a throne for the attribute of Loving-Kindness, similar to Abraham's time. Joseph, seeking his brothers, asks a stranger for their location, Gabriel led Joseph to his brothers, who planned to kill him but sold him instead to Ishmaelites to hide their actions from Jacob. Sforno explains the use of איפוא and איה in Genesis, while the Gemara suggests Job may have lived in the time of Isaac, Jacob, or Joseph based on the word "eifo" in the respective verses. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan convey that Joseph is looking for his brothers and asks where they are pasturing. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר הָאִישׁ֙ נָסְע֣וּ מִזֶּ֔ה כִּ֤י שָׁמַ֙עְתִּי֙ אֹֽמְרִ֔ים נֵלְכָ֖ה דֹּתָ֑יְנָה וַיֵּ֤לֶךְ יוֹסֵף֙ אַחַ֣ר אֶחָ֔יו וַיִּמְצָאֵ֖ם בְּדֹתָֽן׃|17 E|The man said, “They have gone from here, for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothan.” So Joseph followed his brothers and found them at Dothan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The angel warned Joseph that his brothers had departed from brotherhood and were seeking legal pretexts to harm him in Dothan, leading Joseph to ultimately find them there. The mention of Dothan symbolizes the brothers' abandonment of brotherliness and their plot to kill Joseph through legal means. Quoting Rashi's commentary on Genesis 37:17, Joseph's journey to Dothan is a pivotal moment in the narrative of his betrayal by his brothers, as indicated in various Midrashim and Targums. 

|וַיִּרְא֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ מֵרָחֹ֑ק וּבְטֶ֙רֶם֙ יִקְרַ֣ב אֲלֵיהֶ֔ם וַיִּֽתְנַכְּל֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ לַהֲמִיתֽוֹ׃|18 E|They saw him from afar, and before he came close to them they conspired to kill him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's brothers conspired to kill him, filled with devious thoughts and intense hatred towards him, ultimately deciding to take his life themselves. Rabbi Yehudah highlights the importance of exhausting all means for success in encounters, while the Midrash draws parallels between Joseph's experiences and those of Zion. The Kabbalists believe that the Heavenly objective was to wipe out the brothers' residual guilt for selling Joseph, with allusions to the Ten Martyrs' deaths. Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and Targum provide interpretations linking conspiracy, evil thoughts, and wiles to the actions taken against Joseph. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֖וּ אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־אָחִ֑יו הִנֵּ֗ה בַּ֛עַל הַחֲלֹמ֥וֹת הַלָּזֶ֖ה בָּֽא׃|19 J|They said to one another, “Here comes that dreamer!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers' deep animosity towards Joseph was fueled by his dreams, viewing him as a hostile stranger rather than their brother. Simeon and Levi were the main instigators of the plot to kill Joseph, highlighting the motif of youth and beauty being dangerous. In Targum Jonathan on Genesis 37:19, Shimeon and Levi refer to Joseph as the master of dreams. 

|וְעַתָּ֣ה ׀ לְכ֣וּ וְנַֽהַרְגֵ֗הוּ וְנַשְׁלִכֵ֙הוּ֙ בְּאַחַ֣ד הַבֹּר֔וֹת וְאָמַ֕רְנוּ חַיָּ֥ה רָעָ֖ה אֲכָלָ֑תְהוּ וְנִרְאֶ֕ה מַה־יִּהְי֖וּ חֲלֹמֹתָֽיו׃|20 J|Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; and we can say, ‘A savage beast devoured him.’ We shall see what comes of his dreams!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's brothers planned to kill him out of jealousy, but the Holy Spirit indicated his dreams of greatness would come true. Yosef favored Shimeon to avoid conflict among the tribes. Midrash discusses Joseph's trials due to speaking evil of his brothers and the consequences of seeking to nullify the Torah. Musar highlights how Joseph's sin of lashon hara led to his brothers' unforgiving behavior towards him. The gemstones on the High Priest's breastplate symbolize the tribes' characteristics and actions, such as Reuven's admission of guilt, Levi's spiritual illumination, and Yehudah's bravery in battle. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan translate the brothers' plot to kill Joseph and cover it up with a wild animal attack in Genesis 37:20. 

|וַיִּשְׁמַ֣ע רְאוּבֵ֔ן וַיַּצִּלֵ֖הוּ מִיָּדָ֑ם וַיֹּ֕אמֶר לֹ֥א נַכֶּ֖נּוּ נָֽפֶשׁ׃|21 E|But when Reuben heard it, he tried to save him from them. He said, “Let us not take his life.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reuven's true intent to perform a mitzvah saved Yosef from being killed by his brothers, recorded in the Torah and connected to the future merits of their descendants, guiding them to righteousness and helping them resist wrongdoing. Reuben's repentance for his sins and good deeds, without ulterior motives, are highlighted in various Midrashim and the Midrash Hagadol, emphasizing the importance of sincere actions. Reuben's actions towards Joseph and Bilhah are contrasted, with him being praised for saving Joseph and seeking atonement for his act with Bilhah. Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai explains that Reuben was listed first in the rescue because he was the first to try to save Joseph, despite losing his birthright to him. Reuben heard his brothers' plan to kill Joseph and rescued him, saying they should not kill him or be responsible for his death, as mentioned in Onkelos Genesis 37:21 and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 37:21. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֣ם ׀ רְאוּבֵן֮ אַל־תִּשְׁפְּכוּ־דָם֒ הַשְׁלִ֣יכוּ אֹת֗וֹ אֶל־הַבּ֤וֹר הַזֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּמִּדְבָּ֔ר וְיָ֖ד אַל־תִּשְׁלְחוּ־ב֑וֹ לְמַ֗עַן הַצִּ֤יל אֹתוֹ֙ מִיָּדָ֔ם לַהֲשִׁיב֖וֹ אֶל־אָבִֽיו׃|22 E|And Reuben went on, “Shed no blood! Cast him into that pit out in the wilderness, but do not touch him yourselves”—intending to save him from them and restore him to his father.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reuben's attempt to save Joseph's life by suggesting he be thrown into a pit instead of killed is praised in various commentaries and Midrash texts, highlighting his good intentions and desire to return Joseph safely to their father. Despite his good intentions, Reuben's actions ultimately led to negative consequences for his descendants, as seen in the Midrash criticizing him for referring to his sons as his own rather than as Yaakov's. 

|וַֽיְהִ֕י כַּֽאֲשֶׁר־בָּ֥א יוֹסֵ֖ף אֶל־אֶחָ֑יו וַיַּפְשִׁ֤יטוּ אֶת־יוֹסֵף֙ אֶת־כֻּתׇּנְתּ֔וֹ אֶת־כְּתֹ֥נֶת הַפַּסִּ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָלָֽיו׃|23 J|When Joseph came up to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the ornamented tunic that he was wearing,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Rashbam explain the stripping of Joseph by his brothers, with Or HaChaim and Tur HaArokh providing additional details. Siftei Chakhamim and Chizkuni highlight the striped coat as the main cause of jealousy. The Midrash Tanchuma and Bereshit Rabbah draw parallels between Joseph and Zion, while Aggadat Bereshit emphasizes similarities in their experiences. Ramban discusses the word "asher" in Leviticus 4:22, Yosef's struggle over his tunic in Genesis 37:23, and Rashi on Ecclesiastes 8:16. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos describe how Joseph's brothers stripped him of his colorful coat upon his arrival. 

|וַיִּ֨קָּחֻ֔הוּ וַיַּשְׁלִ֥כוּ אֹת֖וֹ הַבֹּ֑רָה וְהַבּ֣וֹר רֵ֔ק אֵ֥ין בּ֖וֹ מָֽיִם׃|24 E|and took him and cast him into the pit. The pit was empty; there was no water in it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Mishnah in Avot emphasizes man's ability to choose to serve God and achieve righteousness, contrasting with those who choose a path away from God. The rejection of Yosef's leadership by his brothers led to his descent for future elevation. The pit Joseph was thrown into lacked water, protecting him from drowning and highlighting potential dangers. Those who do not involve themselves with Torah will face punishment in Gehinnom. The pit symbolizes fear and emptiness in Kabbalah, representing the lack of fear of God and the fourth exile. Joseph's story parallels Zion's hardships, symbolizing the lack of Torah. Abraham's kindness allowed him to enter the domain of love, contrasting with Adam's sin of consuming grapes. The word "הרקות" in Genesis 41:27:2 refers to the pit lacking water. Psalms 30:4 expresses gratitude for being saved from Sheol and the Pit. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe Joseph being thrown into an empty pit with no water, potentially containing dangerous creatures. 

|וַיֵּשְׁבוּ֮ לֶֽאֱכׇל־לֶ֒חֶם֒ וַיִּשְׂא֤וּ עֵֽינֵיהֶם֙ וַיִּרְא֔וּ וְהִנֵּה֙ אֹרְחַ֣ת יִשְׁמְעֵאלִ֔ים בָּאָ֖ה מִגִּלְעָ֑ד וּגְמַלֵּיהֶ֣ם נֹֽשְׂאִ֗ים נְכֹאת֙ וּצְרִ֣י וָלֹ֔ט הוֹלְכִ֖ים לְהוֹרִ֥יד מִצְרָֽיְמָה׃|25 J E|Then they sat down to a meal. Looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, their camels bearing gum, balm, and ladanum to be taken to Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Ishmaelites, recognized by the brothers as a caravan carrying spices and balms from Gilead, sold Joseph to Egypt after being bought by the Midianites. Eating should be for sustenance and to keep the body healthy, with Joseph's example of eating only to break hunger serving as a lesson in reverence and fear of God. The story of Joseph parallels Zion, highlighting the consequences of actions and the importance of forgiveness. Ramban, Onkelos, Rashi, Chizkuni, and Bartenura provide interpretations of various terms related to spices and balms in different biblical texts. The Targums of Onkelos, Jonathan, and Jerusalem describe traders from different regions carrying spices and products to Egypt. Rebbi Tarfon used the story of Joseph's sale into slavery as an example of God's mercy towards the righteous. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהוּדָ֖ה אֶל־אֶחָ֑יו מַה־בֶּ֗צַע כִּ֤י נַהֲרֹג֙ אֶת־אָחִ֔ינוּ וְכִסִּ֖ינוּ אֶת־דָּמֽוֹ׃|26 J|Then Judah said to his brothers, “What do we gain by killing our brother and covering up his blood?|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Yehuda's wisdom in advising against killing Yosef based on the lack of benefit and potential consequences, while the Midrash highlights his leadership role. Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda ben Korha interpret texts from Genesis, with Rabbi Meir connecting Judah's actions to the kingship of Israel. Various commentators discuss the implications of Judah's actions, including the importance of completing commandments and the consequences of not forgiving lashon hara. The Talmud and Tosefta also delve into Judah's actions and their significance in Jewish thought and law. 

|לְכ֞וּ וְנִמְכְּרֶ֣נּוּ לַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִ֗ים וְיָדֵ֙נוּ֙ אַל־תְּהִי־ב֔וֹ כִּֽי־אָחִ֥ינוּ בְשָׂרֵ֖נוּ ה֑וּא וַֽיִּשְׁמְע֖וּ אֶחָֽיו׃|27 J|Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, but let us not do away with him ourselves. After all, he is our brother, our own flesh.” His brothers agreed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers initially wanted to kill Yosef for speaking ill of them to their father, but Yehuda's wisdom led to them selling him instead, as seen in various commentaries such as Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Radak, Rashi, Tze'enah Ure'enah, and Chizkuni. The Midrash discusses instances of individuals being ostracized or rebuked, praising Judah for his leadership and self-sacrifice. In Tanakh, Moses pleads for Miriam after she is struck with leprosy. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the brothers deciding to sell Joseph to the Yishmaelites. Rebbi Tarfon discusses why the tribe of Yehudah merited the kingship of Israel, highlighting humility as a key factor. 

|וַיַּֽעַבְרוּ֩ אֲנָשִׁ֨ים מִדְיָנִ֜ים סֹֽחֲרִ֗ים וַֽיִּמְשְׁכוּ֙ וַיַּֽעֲל֤וּ אֶת־יוֹסֵף֙ מִן־הַבּ֔וֹר וַיִּמְכְּר֧וּ אֶת־יוֹסֵ֛ף לַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִ֖ים בְּעֶשְׂרִ֣ים כָּ֑סֶף וַיָּבִ֥יאוּ אֶת־יוֹסֵ֖ף מִצְרָֽיְמָה׃|28 J E|When Midianite traders passed by, they pulled Joseph up out of the pit. They sold Joseph for twenty pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who brought Joseph to Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators offer explanations for the sale of Joseph, with Ibn Ezra suggesting a close relationship between the Midianites and Ishmaelites, Rashbam proposing that the Midianites sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites without the brothers' knowledge, and Sforno explaining the Midianites' role as merchants and agents in the sale. Halakhic texts stress the importance of eating with intention and self-control, using Joseph as an example of reverent eating. Midrashic interpretations connect Joseph's sale to the story of Yehuda and Tamar, highlighting consequences and emphasizing treating children equally. In the Talmud, Rab reprimands R. Kahana for not studying Torah constantly, emphasizing Torah's priority over personal needs. Gideon's request for golden earrings from the defeated Midianites is noted in the Tanakh, while the Targum describes the involvement of various parties in Joseph's sale, including the Midianites and Ishmaelites. 

|וַיָּ֤שׇׁב רְאוּבֵן֙ אֶל־הַבּ֔וֹר וְהִנֵּ֥ה אֵין־יוֹסֵ֖ף בַּבּ֑וֹר וַיִּקְרַ֖ע אֶת־בְּגָדָֽיו׃|29 E|When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reuben attempted to rescue Joseph from the pit, either to return him to his father or cover up his death, influenced by Yehudah's confession. The brothers faked Joseph's death by dipping his tunic in goat's blood. In the Midrash, Reuben's repentance and efforts to save Joseph are highlighted. Reuben's city of refuge was in his territory for his attempt to save Joseph, and he later fled to Betzer after thinking he caused Joseph's death accidentally. The Targum mentions Reuben's grief at finding Joseph missing from the pit, as he had been fasting for his actions with Bilhah. 

|וַיָּ֥שׇׁב אֶל־אֶחָ֖יו וַיֹּאמַ֑ר הַיֶּ֣לֶד אֵינֶ֔נּוּ וַאֲנִ֖י אָ֥נָה אֲנִי־בָֽא׃|30 E|Returning to his brothers, he said, “The boy is gone! Now, what am I to do?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reuben felt guilt and fear over Joseph's disappearance, worried about being blamed as the eldest brother, and expressed concern for his father's grief. The Ten Martyrs were executed for selling Joseph, with Reuben's involvement in a different sin hinted at. Reuben's relationship with his brothers was puzzling, and the redundancy in his words emphasized the matter at hand. In Targum Jonathan, Joseph returns to his brothers and expresses concern about facing his father without Joseph. 

|וַיִּקְח֖וּ אֶת־כְּתֹ֣נֶת יוֹסֵ֑ף וַֽיִּשְׁחֲטוּ֙ שְׂעִ֣יר עִזִּ֔ים וַיִּטְבְּל֥וּ אֶת־הַכֻּתֹּ֖נֶת בַּדָּֽם׃|31 J|Then they took Joseph’s tunic, slaughtered a kid, and dipped the tunic in the blood.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers in Genesis 37:31 used a goat's blood to deceive their father about Joseph's disappearance, as it resembled human blood (Chizkuni). The priestly garments symbolize atonement for various sins, such as the tunic for bloodshed and the belt for licentious behavior (Jewish Thought). Moses advised Aaron to offer a sin-offering before entering the sanctuary to avoid condemnation from Satan, with the offerings of the princes of the tribes corresponding to significant figures and events in Jewish history (Midrash). Jacob's punishment for his brothers' actions included being sold as a servant and suspected of illicit relations, reflecting a measure-for-measure response (Musar). Ramban explains that the priestly garments atone for specific sins, such as the tunic for bloodshed and the pants for sexual prohibitions (Quoting Commentary). The tunic in Genesis 37:31 symbolizes the struggles faced by statesmen in their lives (Second Temple). The tunic atones for bloodshed, the trousers for forbidden sexual relations, and the turban for haughtiness, among other sins (Talmud). The Targum mentions that Joseph's coat was dipped in the blood of a male goat, as its blood resembles that of a man (Targum). 

|וַֽיְשַׁלְּח֞וּ אֶת־כְּתֹ֣נֶת הַפַּסִּ֗ים וַיָּבִ֙יאוּ֙ אֶל־אֲבִיהֶ֔ם וַיֹּאמְר֖וּ זֹ֣את מָצָ֑אנוּ הַכֶּר־נָ֗א הַכְּתֹ֧נֶת בִּנְךָ֛ הִ֖וא אִם־לֹֽא׃|32 J|They had the ornamented tunic taken to their father, and they said, “We found this. Please examine it; is it your son’s tunic or not?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses overcoming negative forces through serving the Lord and removing earthly aspirations. Commentary delves into the brothers sending Joseph's coat to Jacob, emphasizing the significance of the word "hapasim." Jewish Thought highlights the importance of memory joggers in reinforcing character traits and fulfilling commandments. Kabbalah connects Jacob's trembling to Joseph's punishment, while Midrash focuses on parallels between Judah and Tamar. Musar discusses Judah's punishment for the sale of Joseph. Quoting Commentary links the stories of Joseph's brothers and Tamar showing Judah evidence. Talmud explains Judah's use of the word "discern" in informing Jacob and when Tamar presented evidence. Targum mentions the brothers sending Joseph's coat to Jacob for identification. 

|וַיַּכִּירָ֤הּ וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ כְּתֹ֣נֶת בְּנִ֔י חַיָּ֥ה רָעָ֖ה אֲכָלָ֑תְהוּ טָרֹ֥ף טֹרַ֖ף יוֹסֵֽף׃|33 J|He recognized it, and said, “My son’s tunic! A savage beast devoured him! Joseph was torn by a beast!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob identified Joseph's torn coat, believing he had been devoured by a wild beast, as his sons had deceived him to prevent a curse and fulfill a divine decree. Deception and manipulation are seen in biblical leaders and followers, such as the snake lying to Eve and Jacob's sons presenting a false confirmation of Joseph's death. The distress of the speaker in the liturgy is described, seeking salvation in the month of Tevet. Midrash discusses the punishment of Joseph's brothers and the symbolism of the olive leaf. Various commentaries provide interpretations of different aspects of the story, including the identity of Asher's daughter Serach and the symbolism of gemstones on the High Priest's breastplate. In the Second Temple text, Joseph's pursuit of artificiality is likened to being devoured by an evil beast. Rabbi Shimon teaches in the Talmud about the punishment for liars, illustrated by Jacob's sons deceiving him. In Tanakh, it is stated that a guardian is not required to replace an animal torn by beasts. The Targum suggests that Jacob believed Joseph was still alive, with an evil woman possibly involved. 

|וַיִּקְרַ֤ע יַעֲקֹב֙ שִׂמְלֹתָ֔יו וַיָּ֥שֶׂם שַׂ֖ק בְּמׇתְנָ֑יו וַיִּתְאַבֵּ֥ל עַל־בְּנ֖וֹ יָמִ֥ים רַבִּֽים׃|34 J|Jacob rent his clothes, put sackcloth on his loins, and observed mourning for his son many days.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob mourned Joseph for twenty-two years, tearing his garments and wearing sackcloth as a sign of deep grief, despite protests from his family. Tearing clothes is a traditional expression of sorrow in Jewish mourning customs, with biblical examples including Jacob and the Israelites. The Midrash draws parallels between Joseph and Zion, highlighting similarities in experiences and consequences faced by different biblical figures. Jacob's punishment for not honoring his parents during his time with Laban was seen as a sin, lasting the same amount of time as Joseph's separation from him. In Targum, Jacob mourned for his son for many days, demonstrating his enduring sorrow. 

|וַיָּקֻ֩מוּ֩ כׇל־בָּנָ֨יו וְכׇל־בְּנֹתָ֜יו לְנַחֲמ֗וֹ וַיְמָאֵן֙ לְהִתְנַחֵ֔ם וַיֹּ֕אמֶר כִּֽי־אֵרֵ֧ד אֶל־בְּנִ֛י אָבֵ֖ל שְׁאֹ֑לָה וַיֵּ֥בְךְּ אֹת֖וֹ אָבִֽיו׃|35 J|All his sons and daughters sought to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, saying, “No, I will go down mourning to my son in Sheol.” Thus his father bewailed him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph instructed his brothers not to engage in halachic discussions while on their journey to Egypt, contradicting the Talmudic recommendation to study halachah daily, as he knew they were all alive and well. Yaakov's refusal to be consoled after Joseph's disappearance stemmed from his belief that as long as none of his children died during his lifetime, he would not face gehinom. Jacob mourned Joseph's assumed death for many years until realizing he was alive, showing events can serve a greater purpose in God's plan. Joseph's compassion towards Benjamin was due to their shared parentage, and the tradition of the deceased's soul "commuting" between Heaven and earth for the first twelve months after death led Jacob to realize Joseph was alive. 

|וְהַ֨מְּדָנִ֔ים מָכְר֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ אֶל־מִצְרָ֑יִם לְפֽוֹטִיפַר֙ סְרִ֣יס פַּרְעֹ֔ה שַׂ֖ר הַטַּבָּחִֽים׃|36 E|The Midianites,  meanwhile, sold him in Egypt to Potiphar, a courtier of Pharaoh and his prefect. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The term "hatabachim" in Genesis 37:36 refers to the slaughterers or executioners of the king, with Potiphar identified as the chief executioner by various commentators. Joseph's brothers sold him to the Midianites, who then sold him to the Ishmaelites, leading to his mistreatment along the way. Yosef's downfall is attributed to his behavior in bearing tales about his brothers and insisting on telling them his dreams, which leads to his eventual sale into slavery. Pinehas went to war with Midian to exact judgment on behalf of his grandfather Joseph, and Nebuchadnezzar besieged Jerusalem, leading to its destruction and the exile of the people. Joseph was sold by the Midianites in Egypt to Potiphar, who was an officer and captain of the guards for Pharaoh. 

## Genesis 38

|וַֽיְהִי֙ בָּעֵ֣ת הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֥רֶד יְהוּדָ֖ה מֵאֵ֣ת אֶחָ֑יו וַיֵּ֛ט עַד־אִ֥ישׁ עֲדֻלָּמִ֖י וּשְׁמ֥וֹ חִירָֽה׃|1 J|About that time Judah left his brothers and camped near a certain Adullamite whose name was Hirah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut: Yehuda married in despair, seeking hope for the future but later realizing his mistake in seeking temporary solutions. His son Shela's name reflected this error, leading to the deaths of his first two sons [Chasidut].

Commentary: Genesis 38 contrasts Judah's behavior with Joseph's, showing Judah's lineage leading to Perez. The early generations may have had children at a younger age, allowing events to unfold within 22 years. Judah's actions are significant in family dynamics and divine providence [Commentary].

Midrash: Judah's descent is seen as punishment for selling Joseph, with the narrative highlighting themes of punishment, divine justice, and the importance of completing righteous deeds. The coat of many colors in Joseph's story and Israel's actions leading to exile in Egypt are also explored [Midrash].

Musar: G-d's intentions are always for the good of the Jewish people, as seen in the sale of Joseph. Despite apparent chaos, G-d was working to pave the way for the arrival of the Messiah [Musar].

Quoting Commentary: Judah's esteem was lowered by his brothers after Joseph's sale. Joseph was the first Israelite enslaved in Egypt, but Peretz, ancestor of the Messiah, was born before this event. Different interpretations of "תולדות" are critiqued [Quoting Commentary].

Talmud: Starting a mitzva but not finishing it leads to demotion from greatness, as seen in Judah's case. Certain phrases indicate ordained times for calamity or good [Talmud].

Tanakh: David fled to the cave of Adullam, where his brothers and father's household joined him [Tanakh].

Targum: Judah separated from his brothers and went to a man named Chirah, an Adullamite [Targum]. 

|וַיַּרְא־שָׁ֧ם יְהוּדָ֛ה בַּת־אִ֥ישׁ כְּנַעֲנִ֖י וּשְׁמ֣וֹ שׁ֑וּעַ וַיִּקָּחֶ֖הָ וַיָּבֹ֥א אֵלֶֽיהָ׃|2 J|There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he took her [into his household as wife] and cohabited with her.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban explains that "Canaanite" in Genesis 38:2 refers to a merchant, not an actual Canaanite, to clarify Judah did not marry a Canaanitish woman. Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Or HaChaim, Radak, Tur HaArokh, and Rabbeinu Bahya support this interpretation, with Siftei Chakhamim adding that Jacob's sons would not marry Canaanites. Tamar was not a Canaanite, and Ibn Ezra believes Judah's sons were evil due to marrying Canaanites. The Talmud discusses whether a merchant can be referred to as a Canaanite, citing examples from Genesis 38:2 and other verses. In the Second Temple period, Tamar's story is idealized and allegorized, with Rabbinical comments showing little admiration for her, but recognizing her role in the lineage of David and the Messiah. 

|וַתַּ֖הַר וַתֵּ֣לֶד בֵּ֑ן וַיִּקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ עֵֽר׃|3 J|She conceived and bore a son, and he named him Er.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah named his first son Er and his wife named their second son Onan, with the Rabbis suggesting that Er's name indicated his fate of being thrown off from the world. The Midrash draws parallels between Joseph and Zion, while the Targum states that Tamar named her son Er because he was destined to die childless. 

|וַתַּ֥הַר ע֖וֹד וַתֵּ֣לֶד בֵּ֑ן וַתִּקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ אוֹנָֽן׃|4 J|She conceived again and bore a son, and named him Onan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Tamar conceives and names her son Onan in Genesis 38:4, with interpretations suggesting the name may mean might or vitality [Steinsaltz]. The Midrash discusses Judah's sons, Er, Onan, and Shela, with Er being considered wicked for avoiding impregnating his wife during intercourse. Targum explains that Onan was named as such because his father would have to mourn for him [Onkelos, Targum Jonathan]. 

|וַתֹּ֤סֶף עוֹד֙ וַתֵּ֣לֶד בֵּ֔ן וַתִּקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ שֵׁלָ֑ה וְהָיָ֥ה בִכְזִ֖יב בְּלִדְתָּ֥הּ אֹתֽוֹ׃|5 J|Once again she bore a son, and named him Shelah; he was at Chezib when she bore him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The name Chezib may have been given to the place where Shelah was born because it was there that Bat Shua ceased bearing children, and some scholars suggest that Yehudah was not present at Shelah's birth. The name Shelah itself may be related to the concept of error or deception, possibly indicating that Yehudah made a mistake by not being present at the birth. In the Midrash, there is a debate on whether Ḥiram was the same person as the Ḥira in the time of Judah, and it is discussed how Ketura was perfumed with mitzvot and good deeds. Radak explains that the names Jokim, Cozeba, Joash, Saraph, and Yashuvi in I Chronicles 4:22 have various midrashic interpretations, with some suggesting they are descendants of Shelah and possibly from Bethlehem in Judah. According to Targum Jonathan, the son was named Shela because Judah had forgotten about his wife and was not present when she gave birth. Targum Jerusalem simply states that she ceased giving birth after this son. 

|וַיִּקַּ֧ח יְהוּדָ֛ה אִשָּׁ֖ה לְעֵ֣ר בְּכוֹר֑וֹ וּשְׁמָ֖הּ תָּמָֽר׃|6 J|Judah got a wife for Er his first-born; her name was Tamar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Tamar, the wife of Er, is believed to be of unknown origins and possibly descended from Shem or Aram Naharayim. In the Second Temple interpretation, Tamar symbolizes victory and Er's immediate death after marrying her represents the mind achieving victory over the body. The Targum suggests that Tamar was a daughter of Shem. 

|וַיְהִ֗י עֵ֚ר בְּכ֣וֹר יְהוּדָ֔ה רַ֖ע בְּעֵינֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה וַיְמִתֵ֖הוּ יְהֹוָֽה׃|7 J|But Er, Judah’s first-born, was displeasing to יהוה, and יהוה took his life.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Er's sin of seeking honor from his fellow man led to his downfall, as did Onan's similar error. The birth of Peretz and Zerach rectified their souls by embodying different aspects of seeking honor. Masturbation is forbidden in Halakhah as it goes against the mitzva of procreation, with the severity of the sin emphasized in Kabbalah and Musar teachings. The deaths of Er and Onan are linked to the destruction of the Temples in Or HaChaim's commentary, while Talmudic references warn of consequences for neglecting vows and Torah study. Judah's actions and the birth of his sons are explained in the Midrash, with the birth of Perez and Zerah seen as a way for the Messiah to come. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהוּדָה֙ לְאוֹנָ֔ן בֹּ֛א אֶל־אֵ֥שֶׁת אָחִ֖יךָ וְיַבֵּ֣ם אֹתָ֑הּ וְהָקֵ֥ם זֶ֖רַע לְאָחִֽיךָ׃|8 J|Then Judah said to Onan, “Join with your brother’s wife and do your duty  by her as a brother-in-law, and provide offspring for your brother.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Levirate marriage is a practice commanded in the Torah to perpetuate the deceased brother's memory and lineage by marrying his childless widow, with exceptions outlined in Deuteronomy 25:5. Various righteous figures, such as Judah, fulfilled this commandment even before the Torah was given, symbolizing the deceased brother as the father of the child. The Talmud discusses the concept of reincarnation through levirate marriage, with the duty of ensuring reincarnation hinted at in the lighting of one light for the family during Chanukah. Additionally, the Targum and Tanakh both emphasize the importance of the levirate marriage custom in preserving the deceased brother's lineage and inheritance. 

|וַיֵּ֣דַע אוֹנָ֔ן כִּ֛י לֹּ֥א ל֖וֹ יִהְיֶ֣ה הַזָּ֑רַע וְהָיָ֞ה אִם־בָּ֨א אֶל־אֵ֤שֶׁת אָחִיו֙ וְשִׁחֵ֣ת אַ֔רְצָה לְבִלְתִּ֥י נְתׇן־זֶ֖רַע לְאָחִֽיו׃|9 J|But Onan, knowing that the offspring would not count as his, let [the semen] go to waste  whenever he joined with his brother’s wife, so as not to provide offspring for his brother.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Onan's refusal to impregnate his brother's wife was due to not wanting to share the child's merit with his deceased brother, as seen in Halakhah interpretations. The daughters of Zelophehad stood against their husbands and were honored for their wisdom and righteousness, highlighting the importance of marrying wisely. The severe sin of wasting seed is emphasized in Musar, with Rabbi Eliezer and the Zohar stressing the grave consequences of such actions. Oved, a descendant of Elimelech, became a leader of Am Yisrael, symbolizing a tikkun for his ancestors' self-centered behavior. The Talmud discusses Onan's actions, including engaging in anal intercourse to avoid impregnating his brother's widow and the consequences of masturbation. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain that Onan's actions were to avoid giving offspring to his brother. 

|וַיֵּ֛רַע בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה וַיָּ֖מֶת גַּם־אֹתֽוֹ׃|10 J|What he did was displeasing to יהוה, who took his life also.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Mussar literature describes fasts and mortifications for excision and capital sins like wasteful emissions of semen, with Er and Onan dying for this sin, considered evil in the eyes of the Lord, leading to their deaths at a young age. Masturbation is against the mitzva of procreation, with coitus interruptus forbidden, as seen in the story of Er and Onan in the Torah. Wasteful seminal emissions are equated to murder, idol worship, and deserving of death in Kabbalah, with repentance difficult and severe consequences. Judah's actions were considered evil by the Lord in the Tanakh, leading to his death, and Rabbi Eliezer emphasized the gravity of wasting seed, likening it to shedding blood and worshiping idols. The Talmud discusses Onan's punishment for spilling semen, emphasizing that emitting semen for no purpose is a serious offense. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוּדָה֩ לְתָמָ֨ר כַּלָּת֜וֹ שְׁבִ֧י אַלְמָנָ֣ה בֵית־אָבִ֗יךְ עַד־יִגְדַּל֙ שֵׁלָ֣ה בְנִ֔י כִּ֣י אָמַ֔ר פֶּן־יָמ֥וּת גַּם־ה֖וּא כְּאֶחָ֑יו וַתֵּ֣לֶךְ תָּמָ֔ר וַתֵּ֖שֶׁב בֵּ֥ית אָבִֽיהָ׃|11 J|Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Stay as a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up”—for he thought, “He too might die like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s house.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah did not intend for Tamar to marry his son Shelah due to fear of him dying like his brothers, leading Tamar to take matters into her own hands to secure offspring from the family of Yaakov/Yehudah. In the Talmud, the verse prohibits a High Priest from marrying any widow, clarified to include widows from both betrothal and marriage. Targum mentions Judah instructing Tamar to remain a widow until Shelah was grown up, following his directive to live in her father's house as instructed. 

|וַיִּרְבּוּ֙ הַיָּמִ֔ים וַתָּ֖מׇת בַּת־שׁ֣וּעַ אֵֽשֶׁת־יְהוּדָ֑ה וַיִּנָּ֣חֶם יְהוּדָ֗ה וַיַּ֜עַל עַל־גֹּֽזְזֵ֤י צֹאנוֹ֙ ה֗וּא וְחִירָ֛ה רֵעֵ֥הוּ הָעֲדֻלָּמִ֖י תִּמְנָֽתָה׃|12 J|A long time afterward, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. When his period of mourning was over,  Judah went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, together with his friend Hirah the Adullamite.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah failed to provide Tamar with a place in his house, causing her despair, leading her to approach Judah during the festive shearing event for yibum. Various commentaries discuss the significance of Judah's actions, including his relationship with Hirah, the lineage of Perez and Zerah, and the punishment meted out to Judah and his brothers. The Talmud suggests that Judah's failure to complete a mitzva resulted in the deaths of his wife and children. Yehudah's wife, the daughter of Shu'a, died, and he sought consolation by going to Timnah for sheep-shearing with his friend Chirah. 

|וַיֻּגַּ֥ד לְתָמָ֖ר לֵאמֹ֑ר הִנֵּ֥ה חָמִ֛יךְ עֹלֶ֥ה תִמְנָ֖תָה לָגֹ֥ז צֹאנֽוֹ׃|13 J|And Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is coming up to Timnah for the sheepshearing.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi connects "going up" to Timnah in Genesis 38:13 to the mountainous terrain, while Chizkuni sees Yehudah's journey as spiritually uplifting. The Midrash discusses the similarities between Rebekah and Tamar, and the Talmud explores the contradiction in the direction of travel to Timnah. Targum Jonathan mentions Tamar being informed of her father-in-law coming to Timnah to shear his sheep. 

|וַתָּ֩סַר֩ בִּגְדֵ֨י אַלְמְנוּתָ֜הּ מֵֽעָלֶ֗יהָ וַתְּכַ֤ס בַּצָּעִיף֙ וַתִּתְעַלָּ֔ף וַתֵּ֙שֶׁב֙ בְּפֶ֣תַח עֵינַ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־דֶּ֣רֶךְ תִּמְנָ֑תָה כִּ֤י רָאֲתָה֙ כִּֽי־גָדַ֣ל שֵׁלָ֔ה וְהִ֕וא לֹֽא־נִתְּנָ֥ה ל֖וֹ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|14 J|So she took off her widow’s garb, covered her face with a veil, and, wrapping herself up, sat down at the entrance to Enaim,  which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, yet she had not been given to him as wife.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Tamar disguised herself to conceive a child with Judah in Genesis 38:14, using clothing to hide her identity and attract him. The Torah mentions covering hair with a scarf and the unbinding of hair in cases of suspected adultery. The Divine quality "Thus-Koh" can transform judgment into mercy, and Tamar's righteousness is highlighted in the Midrash. In the Talmud, Tamar's actions are compared to Zimri ben Salu, and the Second Temple text describes Wisdom testing scholars by veiling her face. Additionally, Targum states that Tamar took off her widow's clothing, covered herself with a veil, and sat at a crossroads to conceive a child with Judah. 

|וַיִּרְאֶ֣הָ יְהוּדָ֔ה וַֽיַּחְשְׁבֶ֖הָ לְזוֹנָ֑ה כִּ֥י כִסְּתָ֖ה פָּנֶֽיהָ׃|15 J|When Judah saw her, he took her for a harlot; for she had covered her face.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Baal Shem Tov explains that food and drink contain sparks of Adam that long to become attached to holiness, and when a person eats and drinks, they are repairing their own sparks. Yehudah mistook Tamar for a harlot because she covered her face, a common practice among harlots sitting at crossroads, veiling part of the face while leaving the throat and neck exposed. Judah saw Tamar and mistook her for a harlot because she covered her face, but she was actually his daughter-in-law. The kingdom of David, despite its seemingly unholy origins, was part of God's plan to eventually purify and restore all people and forces outside the realm of holiness to their sacred roots. Tamar bore divine seed without seeing the sower, veiled her face, and recognized the symbols as gifts from a divine source. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan said a modest bride in her father-in-law's house will have kings and prophets emerge from her, as seen with Tamar who covered her face, contrary to a prostitute. The Tosefta discusses instances where multiple individuals make different statements in a sequence, emphasizing that each statement is distinct and not interchangeable. 

|וַיֵּ֨ט אֵלֶ֜יהָ אֶל־הַדֶּ֗רֶךְ וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ הָֽבָה־נָּא֙ אָב֣וֹא אֵלַ֔יִךְ כִּ֚י לֹ֣א יָדַ֔ע כִּ֥י כַלָּת֖וֹ הִ֑וא וַתֹּ֙אמֶר֙ מַה־תִּתֶּן־לִ֔י כִּ֥י תָב֖וֹא אֵלָֽי׃|16 J|So he turned aside to her by the road and said, “Here, let me sleep with you”—for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. “What,” she asked, “will you pay for sleeping with me?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah did not recognize Tamar when he approached her, leading to a marriage-like arrangement instead of prostitution. Tamar covered her face as a sign of modesty, and divine intervention guided Judah to fulfill his destiny. Rashbam explains phrases like "לכו ונהרגהו" as invitations for participation in planned undertakings. Second Temple texts depict Judah as a seeker of knowledge with reverence for hidden virtues, while Targum versions differ on whether Judah propositioned Tamar knowingly or unknowingly. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר אָנֹכִ֛י אֲשַׁלַּ֥ח גְּדִֽי־עִזִּ֖ים מִן־הַצֹּ֑אן וַתֹּ֕אמֶר אִם־תִּתֵּ֥ן עֵרָב֖וֹן עַ֥ד שׇׁלְחֶֽךָ׃|17 J|He replied, “I will send a kid from my flock.” But she said, “You must leave a pledge until you have sent it.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehudah sent a kid to Tamar as a gift, giving her his signet ring as collateral. The prohibition of cooking a kid in its mother's milk only applies to kosher domesticated animals. In Kabbalah, the mouth with a tongue represents the central column uniting the lights in the two columns. The term "גדי" refers to any young tender animal, and the prohibition against cooking a kid is mentioned three times in the Torah. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both mention Yehudah promising to send a kid to Tamar, with her requesting security until he sent it. 

|וַיֹּ֗אמֶר מָ֣ה הָעֵֽרָבוֹן֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶתֶּן־לָךְ֒ וַתֹּ֗אמֶר חֹתָֽמְךָ֙ וּפְתִילֶ֔ךָ וּמַטְּךָ֖ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּיָדֶ֑ךָ וַיִּתֶּן־לָ֛הּ וַיָּבֹ֥א אֵלֶ֖יהָ וַתַּ֥הַר לֽוֹ׃|18 J|And he said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She replied, “Your seal and cord, and the staff which you carry.” So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she conceived by him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah gave Tamar his signet ring, outer garment, and staff as collateral, symbolizing his status and authority, leading to Tamar conceiving righteous children. Tamar's actions with Judah are seen as righteous, leading to the salvation of her descendants. The Talmud explains that Tamar's pregnancy signs were moved apart by Samael but brought back together by Gabriel to ensure her survival and the birth of King David. Judah gave Tamar his signet ring, wrap, and staff as a pledge, leading to her becoming pregnant. 

|וַתָּ֣קׇם וַתֵּ֔לֶךְ וַתָּ֥סַר צְעִיפָ֖הּ מֵעָלֶ֑יהָ וַתִּלְבַּ֖שׁ בִּגְדֵ֥י אַלְמְנוּתָֽהּ׃|19 J|Then she went on her way. She took off her veil and again put on her widow’s garb.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Tamar's choice to dress as a widow in Genesis 38:19 symbolized her refusal to marry and her success in becoming pregnant by Judah, changing her status from barren widow to married mother. The detailed descriptions of her changing garments highlight the importance of clothing in the story, with Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan specifically mentioning her actions of taking off her veil and putting on her widow's garb. 

|וַיִּשְׁלַ֨ח יְהוּדָ֜ה אֶת־גְּדִ֣י הָֽעִזִּ֗ים בְּיַד֙ רֵעֵ֣הוּ הָֽעֲדֻלָּמִ֔י לָקַ֥חַת הָעֵרָב֖וֹן מִיַּ֣ד הָאִשָּׁ֑ה וְלֹ֖א מְצָאָֽהּ׃|20 J|Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite, to redeem the pledge from the woman; but he could not find her.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah sent a kid to Tamar through his friend Hira as collateral, but Hira did not find Tamar. Tamar asks for collateral from Judah before consorting with him, symbolizing kingship and the Torah's ability to mock those who seek to avoid judgment. Rashi explains that the term "גדי" includes calves and lambs, with Ibn Ezra discussing the offering of first-fruits and Bartenura clarifying excluded animals. Rabbi Elazar derives kashrut laws from Judah sending a kid of the goats, and Targum states that Judah sent a goat-kid with his friend to retrieve security from a woman but could not find her. 

|וַיִּשְׁאַ֞ל אֶת־אַנְשֵׁ֤י מְקֹמָהּ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר אַיֵּ֧ה הַקְּדֵשָׁ֛ה הִ֥וא בָעֵינַ֖יִם עַל־הַדָּ֑רֶךְ וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ לֹא־הָיְתָ֥ה בָזֶ֖ה קְדֵשָֽׁה׃|21 J|He inquired of the council of that locale,  “Where is the prostitute,  the one at Enaim, by the road?” But they said, “There has been no prostitute here.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The term "הקדשה" refers to a woman always ready for sexual relations, with a male equivalent mentioned in Deuteronomy 23:18 and 1 Kings 14:24. Yehudah asked for the location of the harlot, but the men denied knowledge of her. Rashi explains it as a woman devoted to illicit intercourse, while Bekhor Shor compares it to being prepared for sex as in Numbers 11:18. Ibn Ezra explains "kedeshah" as a woman known for offering herself to all, and "kadesh" as the passive partner in male homosexual intercourse, connecting it to Egyptian practices. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention a man asking about a harlot at a junction, with the men denying her presence in Genesis 38:21. 

|וַיָּ֙שׇׁב֙ אֶל־יְהוּדָ֔ה וַיֹּ֖אמֶר לֹ֣א מְצָאתִ֑יהָ וְגַ֨ם אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַמָּקוֹם֙ אָֽמְר֔וּ לֹא־הָיְתָ֥ה בָזֶ֖ה קְדֵשָֽׁה׃|22 J|So he returned to Judah and said, “I could not find her; moreover, the local council  said: There has been no prostitute here.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The men of the place told Judah they did not find the woman he was seeking, warning him of potential damage to his reputation. Midrash Tanchuma compares Jacob and Joseph's experiences, both born circumcised, exiled, exalted through dreams, and Joseph rewarded for not kissing in sin. Rabbeinu Bahya explains Reuven disarranging his father's bed as dishonoring both his father and God, highlighting the partnership in creating a person. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that the men of Tamar's place confirmed there was no harlot there. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהוּדָה֙ תִּֽקַּֽח־לָ֔הּ פֶּ֖ן נִהְיֶ֣ה לָב֑וּז הִנֵּ֤ה שָׁלַ֙חְתִּי֙ הַגְּדִ֣י הַזֶּ֔ה וְאַתָּ֖ה לֹ֥א מְצָאתָֽהּ׃|23 J|Judah said, “Let her keep them, lest we become a laughingstock. I did send her this kid, but you did not find her.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah decides to let Tamar keep the pledge to avoid public embarrassment and uphold his promises, showing noble conduct and fulfilling obligations. Selichot prayers focus on Reuben and Judah's repentance for their sins involving Tamar. Targum highlights Judah's concern about humiliation if Tamar took the pledge. Virtue, represented by Tamar, is not found, leading to embarrassment for Judah. 

|וַיְהִ֣י ׀ כְּמִשְׁלֹ֣שׁ חֳדָשִׁ֗ים וַיֻּגַּ֨ד לִֽיהוּדָ֤ה לֵֽאמֹר֙ זָֽנְתָה֙ תָּמָ֣ר כַּלָּתֶ֔ךָ וְגַ֛ם הִנֵּ֥ה הָרָ֖ה לִזְנוּנִ֑ים וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוּדָ֔ה הוֹצִיא֖וּהָ וְתִשָּׂרֵֽף׃|24 J|About three months later, Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has played the harlot; in fact, she is pregnant from harlotry.” “Bring her out,”  said Judah. “She should be burned!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah ordered Tamar to be burned for harlotry based on her pregnancy and the moral depravity of the generation, with the tribunal sentencing her to death as a deterrent. Non-Jewish courts can use circumstantial evidence to administer justice, and the Talmud emphasizes the importance of maintaining dignity and the severity of adultery. In Kabbalah, the repair of BaN occurs when Nukva receives completion from Yesod, reflecting the mystery of male and female. Judah, Isaac, and Jacob judged Tamar, but she was saved from burning, with Judah's lineage connected to important figures. Rabbeinu Bahya criticizes Malki Tzedek for blessing Avram before God, and Rav Hirsch discusses the concept of Yibbum. The Gemara discusses avoiding public embarrassment and recognizes pregnancy after three months, with an objection raised about licentious intercourse with a gentile. Leviticus 21:9 states the punishment for a priest's daughter defiling herself, and Targum recounts Judah ordering Tamar to be burned for her pregnancy. In Tosefta, a virgin for niddah purposes is defined, and criteria for recognizing pregnancy are outlined. 

|הִ֣וא מוּצֵ֗את וְהִ֨יא שָׁלְחָ֤ה אֶל־חָמִ֙יהָ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר לְאִישׁ֙ אֲשֶׁר־אֵ֣לֶּה לּ֔וֹ אָנֹכִ֖י הָרָ֑ה וַתֹּ֙אמֶר֙ הַכֶּר־נָ֔א לְמִ֞י הַחֹתֶ֧מֶת וְהַפְּתִילִ֛ים וְהַמַּטֶּ֖ה הָאֵֽלֶּה׃|25 J|As she was being brought out, she sent this message to her father-in-law, “It’s by the man  to whom these belong that I’m pregnant.” And she added, “Examine these: whose seal and cord and staff are these?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Tamar chose to avoid publicly embarrassing Judah by privately appealing to him when facing execution, demonstrating the importance of avoiding humiliation in public. This ethical principle is derived from Tamar's actions in the Torah, where she did not reveal that she was pregnant with Judah's child to spare him public embarrassment. This concept is also reflected in other instances in the Torah where individuals chose to avoid humiliation in public, even at great personal cost, emphasizing the importance of memory in performing mitzvot and reinforcing trust in God. 

|וַיַּכֵּ֣ר יְהוּדָ֗ה וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ צָֽדְקָ֣ה מִמֶּ֔נִּי כִּֽי־עַל־כֵּ֥ן לֹא־נְתַתִּ֖יהָ לְשֵׁלָ֣ה בְנִ֑י וְלֹֽא־יָסַ֥ף ע֖וֹד לְדַעְתָּֽהּ׃|26 J|Judah recognized them, and said, “She is more in the right than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he was not intimate with her again.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehudah acknowledges Tamar's righteousness and fulfills the levirate marriage obligation, leading to blessings and favor from God. This humility and acceptance of responsibility are emphasized in various commentaries, highlighting the importance of admitting wrongdoing and seeking forgiveness. The text also explores the significance of Judah's confession in relation to other biblical figures and events, showcasing his growth and maturity. Additionally, Moses prays for Judah's strength against his enemies in Deuteronomy 33:7. 

|וַיְהִ֖י בְּעֵ֣ת לִדְתָּ֑הּ וְהִנֵּ֥ה תְאוֹמִ֖ים בְּבִטְנָֽהּ׃|27 J|When the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The birth of twins Peretz and Zerach symbolizes the duality of life on earth and the potential for spiritual growth and closeness to God, with the firstborn being identified by a red thread. Tamar and Rebekah both gave birth to twins after covering themselves with a veil, with Tamar bearing Perez and Zerah, leading to the Jews prevailing over their enemies despite Haman's belief in his success. Ibn Ezra and Rashi provide insights into the meanings of "צדקה" and the fulfillment of days to bear between different women in the text. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention that Tamar gave birth to twins in her womb. 

|וַיְהִ֥י בְלִדְתָּ֖הּ וַיִּתֶּן־יָ֑ד וַתִּקַּ֣ח הַמְיַלֶּ֗דֶת וַתִּקְשֹׁ֨ר עַל־יָד֤וֹ שָׁנִי֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר זֶ֖ה יָצָ֥א רִאשֹׁנָֽה׃|28 J|While she was in labor, one of them put out a hand, and the midwife tied a crimson thread on that hand, to signify: This one came out first.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The births of Peretz and Zerach in Chasidut symbolize missed opportunities for spiritual growth, emphasizing sincerity in mitzvot to bond with the Creator. In Halakhah, if a fetus extends its hand from the womb and then returns it, the mother is impure. In Midrash, Tamar's actions in Sotah led to rewards of descendants who became kings and prophets. Ibn Ezra and Da'at Zekenim provide explanations for Moses not circumcising his son on the eighth day. In Talmud, Rav Huna and Rebbi Abba discuss impurity after childbirth and the credibility of witnesses in multiple births. Zerah's name meaning "brightness" in Tanakh and the scarlet thread on the firstborn's hand in Targum are also mentioned. 

|וַיְהִ֣י ׀ כְּמֵשִׁ֣יב יָד֗וֹ וְהִנֵּה֙ יָצָ֣א אָחִ֔יו וַתֹּ֕אמֶר מַה־פָּרַ֖צְתָּ עָלֶ֣יךָ פָּ֑רֶץ וַיִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖וֹ פָּֽרֶץ׃|29 J|But just then it drew back its hand, and out came its brother; and she said, “What a breach  you have made for yourself!” So he was named Perez.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The birth of twins Peretz and Zerach symbolizes the journey towards spiritual growth and service to God, with Peretz being born first despite Zerach initially appearing first, leading to the establishment of the Kingdom of David. Various commentaries discuss the significance of the twins' names, the breach made during birth, and the implications of the birth order for the kingdom, highlighting the connection between kingship and priesthood. Additionally, the concept of breaching a fence is connected to the power of Esau, with David ultimately avenging the forces of Esau as the Messiah. 

|וְאַחַר֙ יָצָ֣א אָחִ֔יו אֲשֶׁ֥ר עַל־יָד֖וֹ הַשָּׁנִ֑י וַיִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖וֹ זָֽרַח׃|30 J|Afterward his brother came out, on whose hand was the crimson thread; he was named Zerah. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The "crimson thread" in Genesis 38:30 represents the shining of the Light of the Face, symbolizing a warning and linked to the sun's redness at sunrise and sunset, with Zerach and Peretz symbolizing the sun and the moon respectively. Zerach was considered the firstborn by hand emergence, but Peretz was recognized as the firstborn for emerging fully from the womb, paralleling Achan's four acts of sacrilege. Judah marries Tamar, leading to the birth of twins Perez and Zarah, while Joseph is imprisoned in Egypt, and Pharaoh's officers find issues with the king's food. Chapter 38 of Genesis develops Yehuda's character, highlighting the continuity and discontinuity between generations and the lineage leading to royalty, providing crucial development for Yehuda before the story continues in Chapter 39. In labor, one of the twins puts out a hand, and the midwife ties a crimson thread on it to indicate he was the first to come out, named Zorach or Zarach due to the scarlet thread. 

## Genesis 39

|וְיוֹסֵ֖ף הוּרַ֣ד מִצְרָ֑יְמָה וַיִּקְנֵ֡הוּ פּוֹטִיפַר֩ סְרִ֨יס פַּרְעֹ֜ה שַׂ֤ר הַטַּבָּחִים֙ אִ֣ישׁ מִצְרִ֔י מִיַּד֙ הַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הוֹרִדֻ֖הוּ שָֽׁמָּה׃|1 J|When Joseph was taken down to Egypt, Potiphar, a courtier of Pharaoh and his prefect  —a [type of] Egyptian official  —bought him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph was brought down to Egypt as a slave to Potiphar, fulfilling the decree made to Abraham that his descendants would be strangers and sometimes slaves in a foreign land. Joseph's descent marked the beginning of this decree, and his time in Egypt saved Israel from Gehenna. In the Talmud, Rabbi Elazar explains that Joseph brought down Pharaoh's astrologers by interpreting dreams, while Potiphar attempted to have relations with Joseph but was castrated by an angel. Additionally, Benaiah killed a huge Egyptian man with a spear in his hand using a club, as described in II Samuel 23:21 and I Chronicles 11:23. 

|וַיְהִ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־יוֹסֵ֔ף וַיְהִ֖י אִ֣ישׁ מַצְלִ֑יחַ וַיְהִ֕י בְּבֵ֖ית אֲדֹנָ֥יו הַמִּצְרִֽי׃|2 J|יהוה was with Joseph, and he was a successful man; and he stayed in the house of his Egyptian master.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text explores how the inner essence of Bnei Yisrael remains with them in exile, using the story of Joseph in Egypt as an example of divine truth being revealed and hidden. Joseph's success is attributed to God's protection and favor, leading to his rise to power in his master's household. The first degree of prophecy inspires individuals to perform good deeds and achieve noble goals, as seen in figures like the judges of Israel and kings like Saul and David. Additionally, the text from the Midrash illustrates how trouble is signified by certain phrases, such as "it was in the days," and how God's presence with Joseph led to his success. Rabbeinu Bahya and Abarbanel provide interpretations of symbolism in the Bible, linking gemstones on the High Priest's breastplate to specific tribes and discussing the significance of repeated verbs in verses about Joseph's success. Ultimately, Joseph's prosperity is attributed to God's assistance and divine influence. 

|וַיַּ֣רְא אֲדֹנָ֔יו כִּ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה אִתּ֑וֹ וְכֹל֙ אֲשֶׁר־ה֣וּא עֹשֶׂ֔ה יְהֹוָ֖ה מַצְלִ֥יחַ בְּיָדֽוֹ׃|3 J|And when his master saw that יהוה was with him and that יהוה lent success to everything he undertook,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's success in Potiphar's house was attributed to the Lord being with him, leading to divine assistance recognized by Potiphar, who appointed Joseph as his personal attendant. This success was both natural and providential, with God transforming seemingly unsuccessful endeavors into prosperity, ultimately resulting in Joseph being put in charge of Potiphar's house and treasures. Joseph's success is linked to his actions, emphasizing the importance of active participation in fulfilling commandments. His piety and fear of God protected him from temptation and ensured his future descendants would be able to offer sacrifices without harm, highlighting the principle of punishment fitting the crime. Joseph's humility and acknowledgment of God's role in his success are evident in his constant invocation of God's name and crediting of God for his achievements, leading to patience and prosperity. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize that Joseph's success was due to the Word of the Lord being with him, resulting in all his endeavors being successful. 

|וַיִּמְצָ֨א יוֹסֵ֥ף חֵ֛ן בְּעֵינָ֖יו וַיְשָׁ֣רֶת אֹת֑וֹ וַיַּפְקִדֵ֙הוּ֙ עַל־בֵּית֔וֹ וְכׇל־יֶשׁ־ל֖וֹ נָתַ֥ן בְּיָדֽוֹ׃|4 J|he took a liking to Joseph. He made him his personal attendant and put him in charge of his household, placing in his hands all that he owned.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph served as Potifar's personal valet, managing all of Potifar's belongings and overseeing all aspects of the household with extreme regard for cleanliness. Potifar recognized Joseph's success as coming from God, promoting him due to favor in his eyes and his honesty. In various Midrashim, it is explained that finding favor is akin to befriending, being put in charge, and giving one's daughter in marriage. Additionally, Ramban discusses the consequences of defiling the Sanctuary, while Rashbam notes textual similarities in different biblical passages. In the Targum, Joseph found favor with Potiphar and was appointed as supervisor over his household. 

|וַיְהִ֡י מֵאָז֩ הִפְקִ֨יד אֹת֜וֹ בְּבֵית֗וֹ וְעַל֙ כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֶשׁ־ל֔וֹ וַיְבָ֧רֶךְ יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת־בֵּ֥ית הַמִּצְרִ֖י בִּגְלַ֣ל יוֹסֵ֑ף וַיְהִ֞י בִּרְכַּ֤ת יְהֹוָה֙ בְּכׇל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֶשׁ־ל֔וֹ בַּבַּ֖יִת וּבַשָּׂדֶֽה׃|5 J|And from the time that the Egyptian put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, יהוה blessed his house for Joseph’s sake, so that the blessing of יהוה was upon everything that he owned, in the house and outside.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God blessed Potiphar's household due to Joseph's presence, similar to Oved Edom hosting the Holy Ark. Joseph's success was attributed to his Divine knowledge and fear of God, leading to favor with Potiphar. The blessing on Potiphar's belongings was due to Joseph's elevated status, ministering directly to him and being in charge of the household. The blessing received by Laban and the Egyptian contrasted with the lack of blessing in Ahab's house due to not fearing God. The righteous, such as Jacob and Joseph, brought blessings with them wherever they went, as seen in the examples of Israel, Jacob, and Joseph. 

|וַיַּעֲזֹ֣ב כׇּל־אֲשֶׁר־לוֹ֮ בְּיַד־יוֹסֵף֒ וְלֹא־יָדַ֤ע אִתּוֹ֙ מְא֔וּמָה כִּ֥י אִם־הַלֶּ֖חֶם אֲשֶׁר־ה֣וּא אוֹכֵ֑ל וַיְהִ֣י יוֹסֵ֔ף יְפֵה־תֹ֖אַר וִיפֵ֥ה מַרְאֶֽה׃|6 J|He left all that he had in Joseph’s hands and, with him there, he paid attention to nothing save the food that he ate. Now Joseph was well built and handsome.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, prayers build up the Shekhinah for union, symbolized by baking. Ramban explains that Potiphar left everything to Joseph except the bread due to cultural differences. The term "form" is not applicable to God in Hebrew. In Kabbalah, the union of Tiferet and Malkhut creates all souls. Rebecca was attracted to Isaac's greatness in Midrash. Joseph's vanity led to his downfall in Musar. Rashi suggests "bread" in Genesis 39:6 is a euphemism for marriage. Potiphar left everything to Joseph except the food he ate in Targum. 

|וַיְהִ֗י אַחַר֙ הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה וַתִּשָּׂ֧א אֵֽשֶׁת־אֲדֹנָ֛יו אֶת־עֵינֶ֖יהָ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֑ף וַתֹּ֖אמֶר שִׁכְבָ֥ה עִמִּֽי׃|7 J|After a time, his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and said, “Lie with me.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's righteousness and fear of God are demonstrated through his refusal of Mrs. Potiphar's advances, leading to his rise to prominence despite setbacks. The importance of trusting in God's plan is highlighted, along with the consequences of Reuben, Shimon, and Levi's actions, and the praise given to Judah and Issachar. Joseph's resistance to temptation and subsequent imprisonment are seen as a test of his righteousness. The significance of Joseph's beauty and the consequences of his preening are discussed, while the Second Temple period emphasizes the importance of resisting bodily pleasures. The Talmud draws parallels between Joseph's temptation and those of Lot and Samson, highlighting the theme of temptation involving the eyes. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan recount Mrs. Potiphar's attempts to seduce Joseph in Genesis 39:7. 

|וַיְמָאֵ֓ן ׀ וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־אֵ֣שֶׁת אֲדֹנָ֔יו הֵ֣ן אֲדֹנִ֔י לֹא־יָדַ֥ע אִתִּ֖י מַה־בַּבָּ֑יִת וְכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־יֶשׁ־ל֖וֹ נָתַ֥ן בְּיָדִֽי׃|8 J|But he refused. He said to his master’s wife, “Look, with me here, my master gives no thought to anything in this house, and all that he owns he has placed in my hands.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's refusal to commit adultery with his master's wife was marked by protest and amazement, showing his disgust at her immoral demand and teaching us to combat the yetzer hara by recognizing the trust placed in us by God. His loyalty to God and his master was greater than his fear of her anger, emphasizing his moral obligations and loyalty to God over personal desires. Joseph's righteousness in refusing Potifar's wife's advances due to his trust in God and fear of sinning was rewarded, highlighting the importance of following God's commandments over human authority. The use of the shalsheleth cantillation mark in Genesis 19:16 is explained by Minchat Shai, and Ramban discusses the significance of Joseph's refusal, emphasizing the cultural differences between Egyptians and Hebrews. Lessons in Leadership explores Joseph's internal conflict of identity while facing temptation in Egypt, highlighting his struggle between betraying his master and his Jewish beliefs. Joseph's response to Potifar's wife in the Targum emphasizes his loyalty to his master and God, refusing to betray the trust placed in him. 

|אֵינֶ֨נּוּ גָד֜וֹל בַּבַּ֣יִת הַזֶּה֮ מִמֶּ֒נִּי֒ וְלֹֽא־חָשַׂ֤ךְ מִמֶּ֙נִּי֙ מְא֔וּמָה כִּ֥י אִם־אוֹתָ֖ךְ בַּאֲשֶׁ֣ר אַתְּ־אִשְׁתּ֑וֹ וְאֵ֨יךְ אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֜ה הָרָעָ֤ה הַגְּדֹלָה֙ הַזֹּ֔את וְחָטָ֖אתִי לֵֽאלֹהִֽים׃|9 J|He wields no more authority in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except yourself, since you are his wife. How then could I do this most wicked thing, and sin before God?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of resisting temptation by recognizing Hashem's trust and choosing not to sin, as seen in Joseph's refusal of Potiphar's wife. Jewish Thought discusses the Jewish people's interactions with non-Israelite nations and Moses' expectation of doubt, while Midrash highlights how Joseph, David, and Boaz overcame evil inclinations with oaths. Musar considers lashon hara more severe than other sins, attributing it as the cause of idolatry, illicit relations, and bloodshed. Commentary praises Joseph's steadfastness in refusing Potiphar's wife, citing his loyalty to God and moral integrity. Talmud discusses the distinction between sins committed with the body and money, using examples like Joseph and Potiphar's wife, and considers forbidden sexual relations, bloodshed, and malicious speech as great transgressions. Targum interprets Joseph's refusal of Potiphar's wife as acknowledging his authority but refusing to sin due to it being evil and against God. 

|וַיְהִ֕י כְּדַבְּרָ֥הּ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֖ף י֣וֹם ׀ י֑וֹם וְלֹא־שָׁמַ֥ע אֵלֶ֛יהָ לִשְׁכַּ֥ב אֶצְלָ֖הּ לִהְי֥וֹת עִמָּֽהּ׃|10 J|And much as she coaxed Joseph day after day, he did not yield to her request to lie beside her, to be with her.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators interpret Joseph's refusal to be alone with Potiphar's wife in Genesis 39:10 as a demonstration of his commitment to his religion and conscience, resisting temptation and avoiding inappropriate behavior despite her persistent advances. The Midrash praises Joseph's righteousness and wisdom, highlighting his adherence to the commandments and his ultimate success in Egypt. Rabbi Elazar explains that Joseph's steadfastness in refusing to commit adultery served as a role model for prioritizing Torah study over worldly distractions, avoiding consequences in this world and the World-to-Come. 

|וַיְהִי֙ כְּהַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה וַיָּבֹ֥א הַבַּ֖יְתָה לַעֲשׂ֣וֹת מְלַאכְתּ֑וֹ וְאֵ֨ין אִ֜ישׁ מֵאַנְשֵׁ֥י הַבַּ֛יִת שָׁ֖ם בַּבָּֽיִת׃|11 J|One such day, he came into the house to do his work. None of the household being there inside,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of vigilance in serving God, as illustrated by Joseph's resistance to temptation through seeing his father's image. The Commentary praises Joseph's righteousness for resisting Potiphar's wife's advances, with different interpretations suggesting he was either inspired by his father's image or found himself impotent. The Midrash compares Joseph's righteousness to that of Mordekhai and highlights his observance of the commandments, leading to eventual rewards from God. The Zohar interprets "to do his work" as studying Torah and performing mitzvot to resist the evil urge. In the Talmud, there is a discussion on whether Joseph's actions should be counted among the prohibited work on Shabbat, with explanations on the circumstances of his encounter with Potiphar's wife. The Targum simply states that Joseph found no one else in the house on the specific day he came to examine his accounts. 

|וַתִּתְפְּשֵׂ֧הוּ בְּבִגְד֛וֹ לֵאמֹ֖ר שִׁכְבָ֣ה עִמִּ֑י וַיַּעֲזֹ֤ב בִּגְדוֹ֙ בְּיָדָ֔הּ וַיָּ֖נׇס וַיֵּצֵ֥א הַחֽוּצָה׃|12 J|she caught hold of him by his garment and said, “Lie with me!” But he left his garment in her hand and got away and fled outside.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In the Kedushat Levi commentary, Yaakov's love for Rachel and Joseph's resistance to Potiphar's wife are connected to the attribute of Tiferet. Joseph's actions in fleeing from temptation are praised in various commentaries and liturgical texts, reflecting his commitment to chastity and righteousness. The Talmud and Midrash also highlight Joseph's wise actions and rewards for his righteousness, while the Targum recounts the story of Joseph fleeing from Potiphar's wife in Genesis 39:12. 

|וַיְהִי֙ כִּרְאוֹתָ֔הּ כִּֽי־עָזַ֥ב בִּגְד֖וֹ בְּיָדָ֑הּ וַיָּ֖נׇס הַחֽוּצָה׃|13 J|When she saw that he had left it in her hand and had fled outside,|

Chasidut explains how Rachel's physical attributes symbolize the attribute of harmony, which can elevate physical matters spiritually. Joseph used this attribute to avoid sinning when faced with temptation from Potiphar's wife, who falsely accused him to avoid shame. Musar compares Joseph leaving his garment with Mrs. Potiphar to Queen Esther taking control of the kingdom without relations with the king. Targum describes Joseph fleeing from Potiphar's wife, leaving his garment as evidence of her false accusations. 

|וַתִּקְרָ֞א לְאַנְשֵׁ֣י בֵיתָ֗הּ וַתֹּ֤אמֶר לָהֶם֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר רְא֗וּ הֵ֥בִיא לָ֛נוּ אִ֥ישׁ עִבְרִ֖י לְצַ֣חֶק בָּ֑נוּ בָּ֤א אֵלַי֙ לִשְׁכַּ֣ב עִמִּ֔י וָאֶקְרָ֖א בְּק֥וֹל גָּדֽוֹל׃|14 J|she called out to her servants and said to them, “Look, he had to bring us a Hebrew to dally with us! This one came to lie with me; but I screamed loud.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Potiphar's wife falsely accused Joseph of trying to take advantage of her, using his Hebrew identity against him and exaggerating the situation to gain support. Joseph's righteousness and wisdom ultimately led to his success in Egypt, as emphasized in various Midrashim. The Second Temple commentary praises Abraham and Joseph for rejecting lusts and passions, while the Targum depicts Potiphar's wife's false accusations in a dramatic manner. Abraham in Mamre received news from a fugitive in Genesis 14:13. 

|וַיְהִ֣י כְשׇׁמְע֔וֹ כִּֽי־הֲרִימֹ֥תִי קוֹלִ֖י וָאֶקְרָ֑א וַיַּעֲזֹ֤ב בִּגְדוֹ֙ אֶצְלִ֔י וַיָּ֖נׇס וַיֵּצֵ֥א הַחֽוּצָה׃|15 J|And when he heard me screaming at the top of my voice, he left his garment with me and got away and fled outside.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph left his garment with Potiphar's wife when she falsely accused him of attempting to rape her, leading him to flee when she started yelling, as stated in Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 39:15. 

|וַתַּנַּ֥ח בִּגְד֖וֹ אֶצְלָ֑הּ עַד־בּ֥וֹא אֲדֹנָ֖יו אֶל־בֵּיתֽוֹ׃|16 J|She kept his garment beside her, until his master came home.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that Joseph's master refers to Potiphar, not the garment's owner, while Steinsaltz notes that Potiphar's wife kept Joseph's garment with her until her husband returned. Kabbalah relates the Matron to Malchut and Esther's rule over Achashverosh to Joseph's ability to attract negative forces. In the Midrash, Joseph's escape symbolizes his leap by the merit of the patriarchs, and Potiphar's wife falsely accuses him of seduction. Ramban discusses the High Priest's garments coming from the Temple treasury, and Targum notes that Potiphar's wife kept Joseph's garment with her until Potiphar returned. 

|וַתְּדַבֵּ֣ר אֵלָ֔יו כַּדְּבָרִ֥ים הָאֵ֖לֶּה לֵאמֹ֑ר בָּֽא־אֵלַ֞י הָעֶ֧בֶד הָֽעִבְרִ֛י אֲשֶׁר־הֵבֵ֥אתָ לָּ֖נוּ לְצַ֥חֶק בִּֽי׃|17 J|Then she told him the same story, saying, “The Hebrew slave whom you brought into our house came to me to dally with me;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights Potiphar's impotence as a consequence of his desire for homosexual acts with Joseph, showcasing God's orchestration of events to bring down the wicked and strengthen the righteous. Commentary explores Potiphar's anger towards his wife's accusations against Joseph, suggesting various interpretations for his actions. Kabbalah delves into the symbolism of riding animals to represent responsibility and control, while Midrash discusses the corrupt actions of the Israelites and Ishmael, contrasting negative and positive interpretations. Quoting Commentary provides examples of how the term "לצחק" can refer to different actions in different verses, and Targum explains Potiphar's wife's accusation against Joseph. Tosefta presents Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai's interpretation of "m'tzachek" in Genesis 21:9 as Ishmael's inappropriate behavior towards Isaac, diverging from Rabbi Akiva's view. 

|וַיְהִ֕י כַּהֲרִימִ֥י קוֹלִ֖י וָאֶקְרָ֑א וַיַּעֲזֹ֥ב בִּגְד֛וֹ אֶצְלִ֖י וַיָּ֥נׇס הַחֽוּצָה׃|18 J|but when I screamed at the top of my voice, he left his garment with me and fled outside.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's integrity is demonstrated by his refusal to comply with his master's wife's advances, leading to his imprisonment. His obedience to God's commandments and wisdom in avoiding temptation eventually result in his reward of becoming a ruler. Pharaoh's decision to send carriages to bring Joseph's family to Egypt indicates a welcome, dispelling Yaakov's previous concerns about antisemitism in Egypt. The Targum translations of Joseph's statement emphasize his reaction to the situation. 

|וַיְהִי֩ כִשְׁמֹ֨עַ אֲדֹנָ֜יו אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֣י אִשְׁתּ֗וֹ אֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבְּרָ֤ה אֵלָיו֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר כַּדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה עָ֥שָׂה לִ֖י עַבְדֶּ֑ךָ וַיִּ֖חַר אַפּֽוֹ׃|19 J|When his master heard the story that his wife told him, namely, “Thus and so your slave did to me,” he was furious.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Potiphar's impotency may have been a result of his desire to use Joseph for homosexual practices, leading to fatal errors in judgment. The Almighty orchestrated events to allow the wicked to make mistakes, ultimately leading to their downfall and strengthening Joseph's faith in God. Potiphar did not believe his wife's false accusation of Joseph trying to rape her, possibly due to Joseph's righteousness or a miracle of God, putting Joseph in prison to avoid scandal. Rabbi Abahu suggests that Potiphar punished Joseph despite believing in his innocence to protect his family's reputation. Ibn Ezra and Ramban provide interpretations of specific words in the text, while Targum mentions Potiphar's anger upon hearing the accusation. 

|וַיִּקַּח֩ אֲדֹנֵ֨י יוֹסֵ֜ף אֹת֗וֹ וַֽיִּתְּנֵ֙הוּ֙ אֶל־בֵּ֣ית הַסֹּ֔הַר מְק֕וֹם אֲשֶׁר־ הַמֶּ֖לֶךְ אֲסוּרִ֑ים וַֽיְהִי־שָׁ֖ם בְּבֵ֥ית הַסֹּֽהַר׃|20 J|So Joseph’s master had him put in prison, where the king’s prisoners were confined. But even while he was there in prison,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's time in prison, despite being innocent, led to interpreting dreams and ultimately becoming a leader in Egypt. The Torah emphasizes Joseph's righteousness and adherence to God's commandments, highlighting how the Lord was with him in both prosperity and trouble. Various words in the Hebrew Bible are spelled with a waw but read with a yod, as seen in the Talmud, and Joseph's placement in the prison is detailed in different Targum commentaries. 

|וַיְהִ֤י יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־יוֹסֵ֔ף וַיֵּ֥ט אֵלָ֖יו חָ֑סֶד וַיִּתֵּ֣ן חִנּ֔וֹ בְּעֵינֵ֖י שַׂ֥ר בֵּית־הַסֹּֽהַר׃|21 J|יהוה was with Joseph—extending kindness to him and disposing the chief jailer favorably toward him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph found favor in the eyes of those around him, even in prison, due to divine protection and influence, allowing him to oversee all activities in the prison. Moses seeks to understand God's ways and find favor, leading to promises of miraculous distinctions and blessings. The Midrash draws parallels between Joseph and Zion, highlighting their experiences and divine favor. Fathers are encouraged to teach their sons Torah and mitzvot for lasting success. Or HaChaim emphasizes the removal of barriers between Israel and God's favor, while Targum highlights the Lord's support and kindness towards Joseph. 

|וַיִּתֵּ֞ן שַׂ֤ר בֵּית־הַסֹּ֙הַר֙ בְּיַד־יוֹסֵ֔ף אֵ֚ת כׇּל־הָ֣אֲסִירִ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֖ר בְּבֵ֣ית הַסֹּ֑הַר וְאֵ֨ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֤ר עֹשִׂים֙ שָׁ֔ם ה֖וּא הָיָ֥ה עֹשֶֽׂה׃|22 J|The chief jailer put in Joseph’s charge all the prisoners who were in that prison, and he was the one to carry out everything that was done there.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph was the supervisor of the other prisoners in jail, overseeing their work and daily routines, evidence of his good character and ability to manage effectively. Despite Potiphar's wife's persistent attempts to seduce him, Joseph remained faithful to God, with God ensuring his success in times of trouble and prosperity. The Israelites were punished for making the golden calf, not for worshiping it, as they did not actually make it, with the plague being a partial punishment for their sin. Joseph was appointed by the prison chief to be in control of all the prisoners and tasks in the prison. 

|אֵ֣ין ׀ שַׂ֣ר בֵּית־הַסֹּ֗הַר רֹאֶ֤ה אֶֽת־כׇּל־מְא֙וּמָה֙ בְּיָד֔וֹ בַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אִתּ֑וֹ וַֽאֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא עֹשֶׂ֖ה יְהֹוָ֥ה מַצְלִֽיחַ׃|23 J|The chief jailer did not supervise anything that was in Joseph’s  charge, because יהוה was with him, and whatever he did יהוה made successful.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's success in prison was attributed to God's presence with him, leading the commandant to trust him completely. Despite being falsely accused and pursued by Zulycah, Joseph remained steadfast in his faith. The story in Genesis 39 reflects a pattern of success, imprisonment, and rise to power, with key words connecting different elements. The Targum emphasizes that the prison chief trusted Joseph due to seeing no fault in him, attributing his success to the Word of the Lord. 

## Genesis 40

|וַיְהִ֗י אַחַר֙ הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה חָ֥טְא֛וּ מַשְׁקֵ֥ה מֶֽלֶךְ־מִצְרַ֖יִם וְהָאֹפֶ֑ה לַאֲדֹנֵיהֶ֖ם לְמֶ֥לֶךְ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|1 E|Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt gave offense to their lord the king of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Chief of the cup-bearer and the Chief of the bakers sinned by committing offenses against the King of Egypt, leading to their imprisonment and the baker being hanged. The Torah hints at the future downfall of the King of Egypt, showcasing God's power over earthly rulers. The butler and baker sinned in different ways, with the butler having a fly in his goblet and the baker having a pebble in his loaf. Joseph's righteousness is highlighted in his refusal to sin with Potiphar's wife, and lashon hara is considered a serious transgression with corresponding punishment. The Egyptian king's butler and baker conspired to poison their master, the king of Egypt. 

|וַיִּקְצֹ֣ף פַּרְעֹ֔ה עַ֖ל שְׁנֵ֣י סָרִיסָ֑יו עַ֚ל שַׂ֣ר הַמַּשְׁקִ֔ים וְעַ֖ל שַׂ֥ר הָאוֹפִֽים׃|2 E|Pharaoh was angry with his two courtiers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh was angry at his two courtiers, who were castrated and held distinguished offices, because they had not supervised their underlings carefully, which was divinely orchestrated to save Joseph from the dungeon. The Torah instructs remembrances to be tied to acts of observance to prevent forgetting important commandments, as seen in the case of the chief cupbearer who forgot Joseph's request. Rabban Simon b. Gamaliel said a one-day-old baby can violate Sabbath if necessary to preserve his life, but Sabbath cannot be violated for King David once he is dead. Ramban explains that Joseph was placed in the king's prison due to the love his master had for him, caused by God. The weak-willed incontinent soul is served by three servants: the chief baker, the chief butler, and the chief cook, as mentioned by Moses. 

|וַיִּתֵּ֨ן אֹתָ֜ם בְּמִשְׁמַ֗ר בֵּ֛ית שַׂ֥ר הַטַּבָּחִ֖ים אֶל־בֵּ֣ית הַסֹּ֑הַר מְק֕וֹם אֲשֶׁ֥ר יוֹסֵ֖ף אָס֥וּר שָֽׁם׃|3 E|and put them in custody, in the house of the prefect,  in the same prison house where Joseph was confined.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph placed the courtiers in custody in the house of the chief executioner to prevent their escape, leading to his interpretation of their dreams and eventual release from prison as part of the divine plan. The prison held distinguished prisoners with special privileges, while Joseph's interpretation of dreams for the butler and baker showed that interpretations belong to God. The Targums state that the chief executioner placed them in the same prison where Joseph was already imprisoned. Rashbam explains the term "משרת" in Numbers 6:3 as related to being freed from chains. 

|וַ֠יִּפְקֹ֠ד שַׂ֣ר הַטַּבָּחִ֧ים אֶת־יוֹסֵ֛ף אִתָּ֖ם וַיְשָׁ֣רֶת אֹתָ֑ם וַיִּהְי֥וּ יָמִ֖ים בְּמִשְׁמָֽר׃|4 E|The prefect assigned Joseph to them, and he attended them. When they had been in custody for some time,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph was brought to the captain of the guard's house and placed in a dungeon with the butler and baker, serving them for a year before interpreting their dreams. Rashbam compares Joseph's role with Aaron and his sons' leadership over the Levites, while Tur HaArokh explains Joseph spent a total of 12 years in jail, with 9 years before the king's prisoners joined him. Targum states Joseph was appointed by the chief of the slaughterers to serve with them in the house of custody. 

|וַיַּֽחַלְמוּ֩ חֲל֨וֹם שְׁנֵיהֶ֜ם אִ֤ישׁ חֲלֹמוֹ֙ בְּלַ֣יְלָה אֶחָ֔ד אִ֖ישׁ כְּפִתְר֣וֹן חֲלֹמ֑וֹ הַמַּשְׁקֶ֣ה וְהָאֹפֶ֗ה אֲשֶׁר֙ לְמֶ֣לֶךְ מִצְרַ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲסוּרִ֖ים בְּבֵ֥ית הַסֹּֽהַר׃|5 E|both of them—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison—dreamed in the same night, each his own dream and each dream with its own meaning.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators offer different interpretations of Genesis 40:5:1, with Ramban suggesting consistency between the dreams and their interpretations, Ibn Ezra pointing out details that could predict the future, Rashbam indicating easy interpretability, Radak highlighting personalization, and Tur HaArokh emphasizing emotion-based interpretation. Rabbi Ḥama bar Abba from the Midrash explains the interconnectedness of the dreams of the butler and baker, as Joseph served them in prison before interpreting their dreams, directing them to God for interpretations. Ramban and Ibn Ezra discuss Joseph's association with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah due to his brothers' mistreatment, and Targum notes that both the butler and baker had dreams with individual interpretations while imprisoned in Egypt. 

|וַיָּבֹ֧א אֲלֵיהֶ֛ם יוֹסֵ֖ף בַּבֹּ֑קֶר וַיַּ֣רְא אֹתָ֔ם וְהִנָּ֖ם זֹעֲפִֽים׃|6 E|When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were distraught.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prisoners in the dungeon were distressed by their dreams, leading to Joseph interpreting the dreams as a gift from God. Worry is a negative quality that can be seen in one's countenance and must be addressed spiritually. Rashi and Chizkuni explain that נסו means in wrath, with Onkelos translating as נסיסין. The chief officer in Daniel expressed concern about endangering his life if he did not eat the allotted food. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe Joseph noticing the prisoners' distress in the morning. 

|וַיִּשְׁאַ֞ל אֶת־סְרִיסֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר אִתּ֧וֹ בְמִשְׁמַ֛ר בֵּ֥ית אֲדֹנָ֖יו לֵאמֹ֑ר מַדּ֛וּעַ פְּנֵיכֶ֥ם רָעִ֖ים הַיּֽוֹם׃|7 E|He asked Pharaoh’s courtiers, who were with him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you appear downcast today?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph fearlessly inquired about the dreams of Pharaoh's officers in prison, showcasing his wisdom and courage despite the potential danger, emphasizing the change in status between them and his concern for their well-being. His inquiry was driven by loyalty and attentiveness to their distress, highlighting his unique perspective on the world and ability to see specific details and relationships in every situation. The Hebrew term "panim" has various meanings, and the servant of Pharaoh in dreams is described as a eunuch, unable to procreate or enter the holy assembly. Joseph's question to Pharaoh's officials in his master's house focused on their current distress and change in demeanor compared to previous days. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֔יו חֲל֣וֹם חָלַ֔מְנוּ וּפֹתֵ֖ר אֵ֣ין אֹת֑וֹ וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֜ם יוֹסֵ֗ף הֲל֤וֹא לֵֽאלֹהִים֙ פִּתְרֹנִ֔ים סַפְּרוּ־נָ֖א לִֽי׃|8 E|And they said to him, “We had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.” So Joseph said to them, “Surely God can interpret! Tell me [your dreams].”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 40:8, Joseph suggests that interpretations of dreams belong to God and he may be able to interpret the dreams with God's help, as seen in various commentaries such as Akeidat Yitzchak, Kabbalah, Midrash, and Targum. The ability to interpret dreams is seen as a gift from God, emphasizing the importance of listening and learning from the wise rather than making judgments on traditions or explanations. 

|וַיְסַפֵּ֧ר שַֽׂר־הַמַּשְׁקִ֛ים אֶת־חֲלֹמ֖וֹ לְיוֹסֵ֑ף וַיֹּ֣אמֶר ל֔וֹ בַּחֲלוֹמִ֕י וְהִנֵּה־גֶ֖פֶן לְפָנָֽי׃|9 E|Then the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph. He said to him, “In my dream, there was a vine in front of me.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Chief of the butlers emphasizes his dream in Genesis 40:9, related to good health, while the Chief of the bakers' mistake leads to his demise. Joseph gains the trust of the ministers by interpreting their dreams. The dream of the chief butler in the Midrash symbolizes Israel's redemption, with the four cups representing various concepts. Leaning while eating at the Seder is required, with exceptions for certain individuals. In the Second Temple text, a dream involving a vine symbolizes wickedness and harm. The chief butler tells Joseph about his vine-related dream in the Targum. 

|וּבַגֶּ֖פֶן שְׁלֹשָׁ֣ה שָׂרִיגִ֑ם וְהִ֤וא כְפֹרַ֙חַת֙ עָלְתָ֣ה נִצָּ֔הּ הִבְשִׁ֥ילוּ אַשְׁכְּלֹתֶ֖יהָ עֲנָבִֽים׃|10 E|On the vine were three branches. It had barely budded, when out came its blossoms and its clusters ripened into grapes.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Kedushat Levi, the three branches on the vine in Genesis 40:10 symbolize the Temple, King, and High Priest, while Likutei Moharan links affluence to those close to the government. Likutei Halakhot discusses gratitude and the categories of people who should recite the thanksgiving prayer. The dream in Genesis 40:10 and Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 88:5 connect the vine to Israel and prominent figures like Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. Rabbeinu Bahya explains Passover meat preparation in Exodus 12:8, and the Talmud discusses the symbolism of the three branches in Pharaoh's butler's dream. The dream in Book II 30:4 of the Second Temple expressed a desire for the vine to remain fruitless. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both describe the vine with three branches in Genesis 40:10. 

|וְכ֥וֹס פַּרְעֹ֖ה בְּיָדִ֑י וָאֶקַּ֣ח אֶת־הָֽעֲנָבִ֗ים וָֽאֶשְׂחַ֤ט אֹתָם֙ אֶל־כּ֣וֹס פַּרְעֹ֔ה וָאֶתֵּ֥ן אֶת־הַכּ֖וֹס עַל־כַּ֥ף פַּרְעֹֽה׃|11 E|Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 40:11, Ibn Ezra suggests "va-eschat" means "to cut," Rashbam says "I squeezed," Radak explains "shachat" as closing off, Radak clarifies "el kose" means "into the cup," Rav Hirsch translates "al kaf Paroh" as Pharaoh reaching for the cup, Rashi notes "va-eschat" only appears in this verse, and Steinsaltz summarizes Joseph pressing grapes into Pharaoh's cup. The dream in the Second Temple involves a vine with three stalks bearing grapes squeezed into Pharaoh's cup, symbolizing senselessness and passion. The Midrash connects the vine in the butler's dream to Israel, with three tendrils representing Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, and Joseph interpreting the dream correctly. Rava explains the three cups in the dream signify future misfortunes for Egypt, while the Talmud links the Four Cups of Passover to promises of deliverance in Exodus and the four kingdoms. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe Joseph interpreting Pharaoh's dream by squeezing grapes into the cup. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר לוֹ֙ יוֹסֵ֔ף זֶ֖ה פִּתְרֹנ֑וֹ שְׁלֹ֙שֶׁת֙ הַשָּׂ֣רִגִ֔ים שְׁלֹ֥שֶׁת יָמִ֖ים הֵֽם׃|12 E|Joseph said to him, “This is its interpretation: The three branches are three days.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The dream of the chief butler in Genesis 40:12 is interpreted by Joseph as referring to events that would occur in three days, symbolically representing the restoration of the butler to his position. The separation of the tribe of Levi from the other tribes was necessary to prevent all of Israel from dying in the desert, as explained in the Midrash. Rabbi Shimon questions the wording in the verse, using "ve-arka" instead of "ve-ar'a," linking it to the descendants of Cain who were expelled and became confused. Joseph's interpretation of the dream in Targum Jonathan and Targum Jerusalem also emphasizes the eventual deliverance of the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob from slavery in Egypt. 

|בְּע֣וֹד ׀ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים יִשָּׂ֤א פַרְעֹה֙ אֶת־רֹאשֶׁ֔ךָ וַהֲשִֽׁיבְךָ֖ עַל־כַּנֶּ֑ךָ וְנָתַתָּ֤ כוֹס־פַּרְעֹה֙ בְּיָד֔וֹ כַּמִּשְׁפָּט֙ הָֽרִאשׁ֔וֹן אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָיִ֖יתָ מַשְׁקֵֽהוּ׃|13 E|In three days Pharaoh will pardon you  and restore you to your post; you will place Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, as was your custom formerly when you were his cupbearer.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh will restore the chief butler to his previous position after three days, as indicated by the dream. The original meaning of mishpat in the Bible refers to habits or customs rather than justice. The four cups mentioned in Genesis 40:11-13 are explained in the Liturgy as connected to the Torah. The chief butler's dream symbolizes Israel's redemption in the Midrash. Joseph spent time in Potiphar's house and prison due to lashon hara, and the tribe of Levi was counted separately to prevent catastrophe. Ramban, Rashi, and Nachmanides interpret different aspects of the census in the Quoting Commentary. The Four Cups of Passover have various interpretations in the Talmud, and Psalms 80:16 emphasizes God's planting. The Targum states that Pharaoh will restore the cupbearer to his position in three days. 

|כִּ֧י אִם־זְכַרְתַּ֣נִי אִתְּךָ֗ כַּאֲשֶׁר֙ יִ֣יטַב לָ֔ךְ וְעָשִֽׂיתָ־נָּ֥א עִמָּדִ֖י חָ֑סֶד וְהִזְכַּרְתַּ֙נִי֙ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֔ה וְהוֹצֵאתַ֖נִי מִן־הַבַּ֥יִת הַזֶּֽה׃|14 E|But think of me when all is well with you again, and do me the kindness of mentioning me to Pharaoh, so as to free me from this place.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph asked the chief cupbearer to remember him and speak to Pharaoh on his behalf, hoping for his release from prison, believing Pharaoh would release him upon realizing his innocence. Acts of kindness through speech are considered mitzvot and are rewarded by God, as exemplified by Joseph, Abraham, and Sarah. Rabbi Shimon explains that Joseph's dreams came from God, not about remembrance. Joseph and Moses faced additional suffering due to their words and actions, with Joseph spending two extra years in prison for asking the butler to remember him. The Mishnah outlines measurements for the Shabbat limit, and Musar emphasizes the importance of using Torah as medication to resist the evil inclination. Ramban explains the compensation for a miscarriage when summoned by the woman's husband, not the woman herself, and Targum highlights Joseph's request to the chief butler for his release from prison. 

|כִּֽי־גֻנֹּ֣ב גֻּנַּ֔בְתִּי מֵאֶ֖רֶץ הָעִבְרִ֑ים וְגַם־פֹּה֙ לֹא־עָשִׂ֣יתִֽי מְא֔וּמָה כִּֽי־שָׂמ֥וּ אֹתִ֖י בַּבּֽוֹר׃|15 E|For in truth, I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews; nor have I done anything here that they should have put me in the dungeon.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph emphasizes his innocence and connection to his Hebrew ancestors when explaining his situation, distinguishing himself from Canaanites. Various Midrashim explore biblical narratives, including responses to the Torah and offerings made by biblical figures. Ibn Ezra analyzes linguistic aspects, while Second Temple texts highlight Abraham's pride in his Hebrew identity. The Talmud discusses equivalence in vows and circumcision, with interpretations from different sages. In the Tanakh, Joseph's explanations differ based on his audience, emphasizing his innocence. Targum interpretations of Genesis 40:15 focus on Joseph's unjust imprisonment. 

|וַיַּ֥רְא שַׂר־הָאֹפִ֖ים כִּ֣י ט֣וֹב פָּתָ֑ר וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף אַף־אֲנִי֙ בַּחֲלוֹמִ֔י וְהִנֵּ֗ה שְׁלֹשָׁ֛ה סַלֵּ֥י חֹרִ֖י עַל־רֹאשִֽׁי׃|16 E|When the chief baker saw how favorably he had interpreted, he said to Joseph, “In my dream, similarly, there were three openwork baskets  on my head.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph accurately interprets the dreams of the chief butler and chief baker, with the chief baker's dream symbolizing the Jewish people and their fate. Rabban Gamaliel and his father's house were strict in certain practices, such as only baking wafer-cakes on festivals. The use of the word "אף" by the serpent in questioning G-d's words is linked to divine anger. The dreams of the chief butler and chief baker in the Second Temple text symbolize their roles, with the lifting of three baskets of wheaten loaves representing the ruling part of the soul. Rabbi Elazar explains in the Talmud that the baker knew Joseph's interpretation was good because each of them was shown their own dream and the interpretation of the other's dream. 

|וּבַסַּ֣ל הָֽעֶלְי֗וֹן מִכֹּ֛ל מַאֲכַ֥ל פַּרְעֹ֖ה מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה אֹפֶ֑ה וְהָע֗וֹף אֹכֵ֥ל אֹתָ֛ם מִן־הַסַּ֖ל מֵעַ֥ל רֹאשִֽׁי׃|17 E|In the uppermost basket were all kinds of food for Pharaoh that a baker prepares; and the birds were eating it out of the basket above my head.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak explains that "בסל" means basket. Rav Hirsch notes the audacity of the bird eating food meant for Pharaoh. Steinsaltz describes the uppermost basket containing food for Pharaoh. The Midrash interprets Joseph's dreams for the chief baker and chief butler. The commentary discusses the significance of birds in the Torah. The Second Temple text talks about unforeseen events destroying one's plans. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the bird eating from the basket on the speaker's head in Genesis 40:17. 

|וַיַּ֤עַן יוֹסֵף֙ וַיֹּ֔אמֶר זֶ֖ה פִּתְרֹנ֑וֹ שְׁלֹ֙שֶׁת֙ הַסַּלִּ֔ים שְׁלֹ֥שֶׁת יָמִ֖ים הֵֽם׃|18 E|Joseph answered, “This is its interpretation: The three baskets are three days.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Or HaChaim, Radak, and Steinsaltz discuss Joseph's interpretation of the dreams of the chief baker and chief butler. The chief baker's dream symbolized his impending execution, while the chief butler's dream indicated his restoration to his position. In the Targum, Joseph explains that the three baskets in the dream represent three days until the chief baker's death, with additional interpretations linking the baskets to the enslavements of the house of Israel in Egypt. Ultimately, Joseph's accurate interpretations of the dreams demonstrate his gift of prophecy. 

|בְּע֣וֹד ׀ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים יִשָּׂ֨א פַרְעֹ֤ה אֶת־רֹֽאשְׁךָ֙ מֵֽעָלֶ֔יךָ וְתָלָ֥ה אוֹתְךָ֖ עַל־עֵ֑ץ וְאָכַ֥ל הָע֛וֹף אֶת־בְּשָׂרְךָ֖ מֵעָלֶֽיךָ׃|19 E|In three days Pharaoh will lift off your head  and impale you upon a pole; and the birds will pick off your flesh.”|

Ibn Ezra interprets "be'od" as "before again" and "yissa" as "remove or raise" in Genesis 40:19, while Rashbam suggests the baker will be beheaded and Tur HaArokh sees Pharaoh raising the cupbearer's head as a promotion. The Midrash discusses conception, dreams, the tribe of Levi, peace, and rewards from God, emphasizing the importance of peace. Musar explains the separate counting of the tribe of Levi to prevent disaster in the desert. Ramban and Rabbeinu Bahya offer interpretations of "kol yotzei tzava" and "se'u" in relation to a census, while Siftei Chakhamim and Ibn Ezra discuss the meaning of "sh'oh" and "li-sheloshet yamim." Targum Jonathan predicts the fate of the baker in Genesis 40:19. 

|וַיְהִ֣י ׀ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁלִישִׁ֗י י֚וֹם הֻלֶּ֣דֶת אֶת־פַּרְעֹ֔ה וַיַּ֥עַשׂ מִשְׁתֶּ֖ה לְכׇל־עֲבָדָ֑יו וַיִּשָּׂ֞א אֶת־רֹ֣אשׁ ׀ שַׂ֣ר הַמַּשְׁקִ֗ים וְאֶת־רֹ֛אשׁ שַׂ֥ר הָאֹפִ֖ים בְּת֥וֹךְ עֲבָדָֽיו׃|20 E|On the third day—his birthday—Pharaoh made a banquet for all his officials, and he singled out  his chief cupbearer and his chief baker from among his officials.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh celebrated his birthday by judging his servants, restoring the Chief of the butlers and hanging the Chief of the bakers, highlighting the importance of seeking favor with rulers to avoid punishment. Joseph accurately predicts the fate of the chief baker and chief butler through dream interpretations, as seen in the outcome on Pharaoh's birthday. The reconciliation between the King of Egypt and the cup-bearer on Pharaoh's birthday symbolizes the body's desires on the day of birth, not eternal light. The Talmud specifically identifies the king's birthday as being on the third day, associated with Pharaoh's birthday in Genesis 40:20. 

|וַיָּ֛שֶׁב אֶת־שַׂ֥ר הַמַּשְׁקִ֖ים עַל־מַשְׁקֵ֑הוּ וַיִּתֵּ֥ן הַכּ֖וֹס עַל־כַּ֥ף פַּרְעֹֽה׃|21 E|He restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearing, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains "mashkehu" in Genesis 40:21 as the chief butler's drink and in verse 13 as giving him a drink, while Steinsaltz notes Pharaoh restored the chief butler to his position. Chizkuni compares the chief butler's unavoidable crime to a fly landing on a cup. Joseph correctly interprets the chief baker's dream of three baskets symbolizing the four kingdoms that would subjugate Israel, with Rome being the fourth kingdom. The chief baker is hanged on Pharaoh's birthday. The phrase "ἐπὶ σπονδαῖς" in the context of pouring wine as cup-bearer is related to "on the conditions of a truce" in the Second Temple period. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos state that the chief butler was reinstated to his position after Joseph interpreted his dream. 

|וְאֵ֛ת שַׂ֥ר הָאֹפִ֖ים תָּלָ֑ה כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר פָּתַ֛ר לָהֶ֖ם יוֹסֵֽף׃|22 E|but the chief baker he impaled—just as Joseph had interpreted to them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The chief baker in Genesis was hanged for negligence after a pebble was found in his breakfast roll, fulfilling Joseph's interpretation of his dream. The word "תלה" in Genesis 40:22 is related to hanging, as seen in other instances in the Bible, and the word "עניך" in Genesis 16:11 relates to suffering. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan confirm the chief baker's fate as predicted by Joseph. 

|וְלֹֽא־זָכַ֧ר שַֽׂר־הַמַּשְׁקִ֛ים אֶת־יוֹסֵ֖ף וַיִּשְׁכָּחֵֽהוּ׃|23 E|Yet the chief cupbearer did not think of Joseph; he forgot him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The chief butler forgot about Joseph, delaying his release from prison for two years. The lesson is to trust in God rather than relying on others. Moses, Queen Esther, and Joseph showed humility and gratitude by not overlooking those who had helped them. Joseph's trust in the chief butler instead of God led to his delayed release.
