## Deuteronomy 16

|שֹׁפְטִ֣ים וְשֹֽׁטְרִ֗ים תִּֽתֶּן־לְךָ֙ בְּכׇל־שְׁעָרֶ֔יךָ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לְךָ֖ לִשְׁבָטֶ֑יךָ וְשָׁפְט֥וּ אֶת־הָעָ֖ם מִשְׁפַּט־צֶֽדֶק׃|18|You shall appoint magistrates and officials for your tribes, in all the settlements that your God יהוה is giving you, and they shall govern the people with due justice.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of appointing judges and officers to ensure fair justice on earth, reflecting the attribute of mercy seen in celestial spheres. It highlights the need for self-judgment, judging favorably, and maintaining love and fear of God in all thoughts and actions, particularly in Jerusalem. The Torah commands Israel to appoint judges and law enforcement officers in all cities to ensure fair judgments and righteousness, reflecting the ideal of peace central to the Torah's teachings. The Jewish court aims for perfect truth in judgment, with strict procedures for evidence. The Halakhah mandates the appointment of judges in every Jewish community to enforce Torah commandments and maintain justice. Jewish thought emphasizes the necessity of laws and judges to prevent wrongdoing and maintain order, while Kabbalah discusses the quality of justice and righteousness in divine judgment. The Midrash stresses the importance of appointing righteous judges for fair judgment, and Musar highlights the need to impute merit to others in judgment. The Talmud discusses the importance of appointing fit judges over the community and the obligation to establish courts in every city only in Eretz Yisrael. Rashbam, Rabbeinu Yonah, Or HaChaim, Haamek Sheilah, and Rashi provide further insights on appointing judges. Finally, responsa stress the obligation for judges to rule in accordance with legal standards, ensuring just law and right rulings. 

|לֹא־תַטֶּ֣ה מִשְׁפָּ֔ט לֹ֥א תַכִּ֖יר פָּנִ֑ים וְלֹא־תִקַּ֣ח שֹׁ֔חַד כִּ֣י הַשֹּׁ֗חַד יְעַוֵּר֙ עֵינֵ֣י חֲכָמִ֔ים וִֽיסַלֵּ֖ף דִּבְרֵ֥י צַדִּיקִֽם׃|19|You shall not judge unfairly: you shall show no partiality; you shall not take bribes, for bribes blind the eyes of the discerning and upset the plea of the just.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various texts from Chasidut, Halakhah, Jewish Thought, Midrash, Mishnah, Musar, Quoting Commentary, Talmud, Tanakh, Targum, and Tosefta emphasize the prohibition against bribery, warning against accepting bribes in judicial processes to ensure fair and impartial judgment. Bribery is seen as blinding the eyes of the wise and perverting justice, with severe consequences for those who engage in corrupt practices. The importance of upholding justice, truth, and impartiality in legal matters is stressed across these commentaries and teachings. 

|צֶ֥דֶק צֶ֖דֶק תִּרְדֹּ֑ף לְמַ֤עַן תִּֽחְיֶה֙ וְיָרַשְׁתָּ֣ אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לָֽךְ׃|20|Justice, justice shall you pursue, that you may thrive and occupy the land that your God יהוה is giving you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The pursuit of justice and righteousness is emphasized in various Jewish texts, highlighting the need for ethical conduct, fair judgment, and adherence to laws for both individuals and judges. The consequences of corrupt judgments, the qualities required of judges, and the importance of pursuing righteousness to achieve life and honor are all discussed, with the pursuit of justice seen as essential for a harmonious society and the fulfillment of God's covenant with the people. Different approaches to achieving fair judgment, including avoiding bribes and following the best court for justice, are outlined in these texts. 

|לֹֽא־תִטַּ֥ע לְךָ֛ אֲשֵׁרָ֖ה כׇּל־עֵ֑ץ אֵ֗צֶל מִזְבַּ֛ח יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּעֲשֶׂה־לָּֽךְ׃|21|You shall not set up a sacred post—any kind of pole beside the altar of your God יהוה that you may make—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In prayer, one should not seek personal gain or defer to human traits, judges should be appointed based on Torah knowledge and suitability, wooden structures are prohibited in the Temple, and the importance of justice in judgment is emphasized. The prohibition of planting trees near the altar is likened to appointing unfit judges, and the Talmud discusses the implications of building wooden porticoes in the Temple courtyard. The Asherah is described as a sacred grove of Canaanitic worship associated with fertility, and the need to avoid planting near the altar is highlighted in various texts. 

|וְלֹֽא־תָקִ֥ים לְךָ֖ מַצֵּבָ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר שָׂנֵ֖א יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|22|or erect a stone pillar; for such your God יהוה detests.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut interprets the prohibition of setting up a stone pillar in Deuteronomy 16:22 as a metaphor for spiritual preparation for the afterlife and prioritizing core principles over personal opinions. Commentary from Ramban, Rashi, and others links the prohibition to Canaanite idol worship, contrasting it with permissible sacrifices to God on altars. Halakhah extends the prohibition to appointing judges not well-versed in Torah law and building wooden structures in the Temple. Jewish Thought explores the reasons behind prohibitions like marrying two sisters and planting trees in the Temple mount. Midrash discusses fair judgment in trials and the importance of unity among the people for redemption. The Second Temple text emphasizes the impermanence of human existence, reflected in the prohibition against erecting pillars to oneself. Targum warns against building monuments that God detests and appointing proud individuals as leaders.

## Deuteronomy 17

|לֹא־תִזְבַּח֩ לַיהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ שׁ֣וֹר וָשֶׂ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִהְיֶ֥ה בוֹ֙ מ֔וּם כֹּ֖ל דָּבָ֣ר רָ֑ע כִּ֧י תוֹעֲבַ֛ת יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ הֽוּא׃|1|You shall not sacrifice to your God יהוה an ox or a sheep that has any defect of a serious kind, for that is abhorrent to your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut warns against praying from a place of deficiency and with negative intentions, emphasizing the importance of presenting offerings free from defects. Halakhah prohibits offering animals with temporary blemishes as sacrifices, with transgressions resulting in lashes. Kabbalah states that only Israel is affected by holiness, while the nations are not included. Midrash discusses laws of substitution in sacrifices and the prohibition of sacrificing blemished animals. Quoting Commentary clarifies that both the hire of a harlot and the price of a dog are considered abominations to God. Talmud explains differing opinions on slaughtering offerings with improper intent and the prohibition of sacrificing blemished animals. Tanakh states that eating the flesh of a sacrifice of well-being on the third day is unacceptable. Targum warns against offering blemished or defective animals as sacrifices to God. 

|כִּֽי־יִמָּצֵ֤א בְקִרְבְּךָ֙ בְּאַחַ֣ד שְׁעָרֶ֔יךָ אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ נֹתֵ֣ן לָ֑ךְ אִ֣ישׁ אוֹ־אִשָּׁ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר יַעֲשֶׂ֧ה אֶת־הָרַ֛ע בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהֹוָה־אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לַעֲבֹ֥ר בְּרִיתֽוֹ׃|2|If there is found among you, in one of the settlements that your God יהוה is giving you, a man or woman who has affronted your God יהוה and transgressed the Covenant—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The law against idolatry applies both in and outside of the Land of Israel, with worshipers to be stoned at the gates of the city where they worshiped; women are specifically mentioned due to susceptibility, and the covenant is violated with idolatry. Cities of refuge cannot be condemned to prevent destruction, and witchcraft and idolatry involving women were prevalent. The Sifrei commentaries emphasize consequences of idolatry, the Talmud discusses stoning locations, and Tosefta addresses Passover observance in a state of impurity. 

|וַיֵּ֗לֶךְ וַֽיַּעֲבֹד֙ אֱלֹהִ֣ים אֲחֵרִ֔ים וַיִּשְׁתַּ֖חוּ לָהֶ֑ם וְלַשֶּׁ֣מֶשׁ ׀ א֣וֹ לַיָּרֵ֗חַ א֛וֹ לְכׇל־צְבָ֥א הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־צִוִּֽיתִי׃|3|turning to the worship of other gods and bowing down to them, to the sun or the moon or any of the heavenly host, something I never commanded—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut and Talmudic commentary emphasize the prohibition of worshiping celestial bodies like the sun and moon, which are not commanded by God, and warn against engaging with the world of Action-Asiyah. The Mishnah discusses the punishment for inciters who lead others to idol worship, while the Talmud and Targum highlight changes made to clarify God's commandments and avoid idolatry. Rabbeinu Bahya explains the significance of daily offerings in countering astrological influences and fasting as a form of repentance. 

|וְהֻֽגַּד־לְךָ֖ וְשָׁמָ֑עְתָּ וְדָרַשְׁתָּ֣ הֵיטֵ֔ב וְהִנֵּ֤ה אֱמֶת֙ נָכ֣וֹן הַדָּבָ֔ר נֶעֶשְׂתָ֛ה הַתּוֹעֵבָ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את בְּיִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|4|and you have been informed or have learned of it, then you shall make a thorough inquiry. If it is true, the fact is established, that abhorrent thing was perpetrated in Israel,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries on Deuteronomy 17:4 stress the importance of thorough investigation and examination in legal proceedings, with Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Tur HaArokh, Rabbeinu Bahya, Siftei Chakhamim, and Rav Hirsch all highlighting different aspects of this process. The legislation is also noted to apply in the Diaspora by Tur HaArokh. The Midrash emphasizes the use of seven cross-examinations and factual reviews in legal proceedings, while Ramban and Bartenura discuss the application of these laws to idol worship and the detailed examinations required before imposing the death penalty. The Talmud further elaborates on the requirements for congruent testimony and thorough investigations in capital cases. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also stress the importance of accurate and authenticated information in hearing reports of wrongdoing within the community of Yisroel. 

|וְהֽוֹצֵאתָ֣ אֶת־הָאִ֣ישׁ הַה֡וּא אוֹ֩ אֶת־הָאִשָּׁ֨ה הַהִ֜וא אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָ֠שׂ֠וּ אֶת־הַדָּבָ֨ר הָרָ֤ע הַזֶּה֙ אֶל־שְׁעָרֶ֔יךָ אֶת־הָאִ֕ישׁ א֖וֹ אֶת־הָאִשָּׁ֑ה וּסְקַלְתָּ֥ם בָּאֲבָנִ֖ים וָמֵֽתוּ׃|5|you shall take the man or the woman who did that wicked thing out to the public place, and you shall stone that man or woman to death.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The punishment for idolatry in ancient times was stoning until death, requiring two witnesses for conviction and execution at the city gate where the idol was worshipped to demonstrate the deity's inability to save the idolater's life (Guides, Halakhah, Commentary, Mishnah, Quoting Commentary, Talmud, Targum). The Mishnah outlines cases judged by a court of seventy-one judges, including an entire tribe sinning, a false prophet, or a High Priest transgressing a prohibition carrying a possible death sentence. The Talmud discusses scenarios for stoning and emphasizes following Torah laws and commandments, while the Tosefta addresses the Passover offering in cases of impurity within the community. 

|עַל־פִּ֣י ׀ שְׁנַ֣יִם עֵדִ֗ים א֛וֹ שְׁלֹשָׁ֥ה עֵדִ֖ים יוּמַ֣ת הַמֵּ֑ת לֹ֣א יוּמַ֔ת עַל־פִּ֖י עֵ֥ד אֶחָֽד׃|6|A person shall be put to death only on the testimony of two or more  witnesses; no one shall be put to death on the testimony of a single witness.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah requires two or three witnesses for capital punishment, with Ramban insisting on a Sanhedrin of twenty-three judges for acceptance of testimony. Halakhah prohibits women as witnesses and emphasizes oral testimony over written. The Midrash discusses the importance of witnesses in enforcing decrees and recounts the story of Akhan's punishment. The Mishnah explores the significance of two and three witnesses in rendering testimony valid or invalid, with differing opinions on disqualifying witnesses. Musar discusses the appointment of judges and law-enforcers and the prohibition of handling fire on the Sabbath as a testimony to God's creation ex nihilo. The Talmud emphasizes the necessity of testimony from witnesses' mouths, the requirement of two witnesses for punishment, and the invalidity of disjointed testimony in capital law. Lastly, Targum highlights the need for two or three witnesses for death sentences, not just one. 

|יַ֣ד הָעֵדִ֞ים תִּֽהְיֶה־בּ֤וֹ בָרִאשֹׁנָה֙ לַהֲמִית֔וֹ וְיַ֥ד כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם בָּאַחֲרֹנָ֑ה וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֥ הָרָ֖ע מִקִּרְבֶּֽךָ׃|7|Let the hands of the witnesses be the first to put [the condemned] to death, followed by the hands of the rest of the people. Thus you will sweep out evil from your midst.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra discusses singular and plural nouns in biblical texts, Steinsaltz emphasizes the role of witnesses in the court process, Halakhah explains the commandment to judge capital cases in the Land of Israel, Kabbalah discusses the negative effects of envy and authority, Midrash connects the process of putting someone to death to the story of Jacob and Laban, Mishnah details the process of stoning and hanging the condemned, Musar discusses the migration of souls and the lineage of Bileam, Quoting Commentary highlights the burning bush and the prohibition against sorceresses, Second Temple examines the execution of apostates, Talmud explains the procedures for stoning, Tanakh recounts the stoning of Naboth, and Targum interprets the importance of witnesses in executing the guilty party. 

|כִּ֣י יִפָּלֵא֩ מִמְּךָ֨ דָבָ֜ר לַמִּשְׁפָּ֗ט בֵּֽין־דָּ֨ם ׀ לְדָ֜ם בֵּֽין־דִּ֣ין לְדִ֗ין וּבֵ֥ין נֶ֙גַע֙ לָנֶ֔גַע דִּבְרֵ֥י רִיבֹ֖ת בִּשְׁעָרֶ֑יךָ וְקַמְתָּ֣ וְעָלִ֔יתָ אֶ֨ל־הַמָּק֔וֹם אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִבְחַ֛ר יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ בּֽוֹ׃|8|If a case is too baffling for you to decide, be it a controversy over homicide, civil law, or assault—matters of dispute in your courts—you shall promptly repair to the place that your God יהוה will have chosen,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of consulting judges and the Supreme Court in resolving disputes, especially in matters of judgment and legal complexities, is highlighted in various commentaries, halakhic texts, and Jewish thought. The significance of the Great Sanhedrin in making difficult judgments, the authority of the sages, and the reliance on divine decree are emphasized, along with the need to follow the decisions of the court and seek guidance in challenging cases. The role of the Sanhedrin in resolving disputes, the complexity of legal matters, and the importance of distinguishing between different types of impurity, blood, and disputes are recurring themes across different texts and commentaries. 

|וּבָאתָ֗ אֶל־הַכֹּהֲנִים֙ הַלְוִיִּ֔ם וְאֶ֨ל־הַשֹּׁפֵ֔ט אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִהְיֶ֖ה בַּיָּמִ֣ים הָהֵ֑ם וְדָרַשְׁתָּ֙ וְהִגִּ֣ידוּ לְךָ֔ אֵ֖ת דְּבַ֥ר הַמִּשְׁפָּֽט׃|9|and appear before the levitical priests, or the magistrate in charge at the time, and present your problem. When they have announced to you the verdict in the case,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of seeking guidance from priests, Levites, and judges appointed by God is emphasized in various texts, highlighting the authority of the Supreme Court in interpreting and applying Torah teachings. The Torah instructs to follow the word of the teachings without deviation, warning against nullifying any part of the Torah even as times change. It is crucial to obey the judges and priests of one's generation to prevent serious consequences and maintain the tradition passed down through generations. 

|וְעָשִׂ֗יתָ עַל־פִּ֤י הַדָּבָר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יַגִּ֣ידֽוּ לְךָ֔ מִן־הַמָּק֣וֹם הַה֔וּא אֲשֶׁ֖ר יִבְחַ֣ר יְהֹוָ֑ה וְשָׁמַרְתָּ֣ לַעֲשׂ֔וֹת כְּכֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר יוֹרֽוּךָ׃|10|you shall carry out the verdict that is announced to you from that place that יהוה chose, observing scrupulously all their instructions to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The highest court's rulings must be obeyed, followed, and adhered to, including those from the Sanhedrin, with emphasis on the judges' instructions and the obligation to follow their commands in all matters related to the Torah, under penalty of execution. The duties of the heart detailed in Scripture require reflection and intellectual investigation to sift truth from false notions, focusing on moral obligations in relationships with society, family, and oneself, with the ultimate judge being G-d. The importance of following the decrees of the rabbis is emphasized, as they are in accordance with God's will, using various biblical examples to illustrate this point. The Talmud discusses the rules for issuing death sentences and explores the conditions under which individuals are liable for punishment based on their adherence to or deviation from the rulings of the High Court, with specific references to different scenarios and interpretations of the law. 

|עַל־פִּ֨י הַתּוֹרָ֜ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר יוֹר֗וּךָ וְעַל־הַמִּשְׁפָּ֛ט אֲשֶׁר־יֹאמְר֥וּ לְךָ֖ תַּעֲשֶׂ֑ה לֹ֣א תָס֗וּר מִן־הַדָּבָ֛ר אֲשֶׁר־יַגִּ֥ידֽוּ לְךָ֖ יָמִ֥ין וּשְׂמֹֽאל׃|11|You shall act in accordance with the instructions given you and the ruling handed down to you; you must not deviate from the verdict that they announce to you either to the right or to the left.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of following the teachings of the sages and tzaddik of the generation to achieve spiritual clarity and understanding of mishpat, while Jewish Thought and Kabbalah stress the authority of Torah scholars in interpreting and applying laws. Halakhah highlights the necessity of obeying decrees and ordinances of the Sanhedrin, with Musar emphasizing the importance of listening to wise men even if their rulings seem contradictory. The Talmud and Responsa emphasize the significance of adhering to established laws and teachings, while the Tanakh instructs to follow the teachings of Moses without deviation for success. 

|וְהָאִ֞ישׁ אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂ֣ה בְזָד֗וֹן לְבִלְתִּ֨י שְׁמֹ֤עַ אֶל־הַכֹּהֵן֙ הָעֹמֵ֞ד לְשָׁ֤רֶת שָׁם֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ א֖וֹ אֶל־הַשֹּׁפֵ֑ט וּמֵת֙ הָאִ֣ישׁ הַה֔וּא וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֥ הָרָ֖ע מִיִּשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|12|Should either party [to the dispute] act presumptuously and disregard the priest charged with serving there your God יהוה, or the magistrate, that party shall die. Thus you will sweep out evil from Israel:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of upholding the authority of the Sanhedrin and following its rulings, with severe consequences for defying the court. Disobeying the directives of the court is a negative commandment, while heeding its decisions is a positive commandment in matters of Torah. Deliberate sins are considered more severe than impulsive sins, as seen in the case of king Menashe. The Torah tradition guides judgment and natural laws exist to enable humans to fulfill their destiny. Mishnah and Talmudic texts discuss the punishment for rebellious elders who go against the Supreme Court's rulings, with different opinions on the process and frequency of executions. The Targums state that those who disobey the priest or judge serving before God are to be executed to eliminate evil from Israel. 

|וְכׇל־הָעָ֖ם יִשְׁמְע֣וּ וְיִרָ֑אוּ וְלֹ֥א יְזִיד֖וּן עֽוֹד׃|13|all the people will hear and be afraid and will not act presumptuously again.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The law mandates that the execution of an elder who disobeys the Supreme Court's ruling should be postponed until the next festival in Jerusalem to ensure widespread awareness and deterrence, serving as a public example to promote respect for authority and discourage rebellion. Various commandments from the Torah are discussed, emphasizing the importance of following God's laws and remembering Jewish history and values. The Talmud and Tosefta outline the process for dealing with rebellious individuals, suggesting execution during a festival in Jerusalem to serve as a warning to others. 

|כִּֽי־תָבֹ֣א אֶל־הָאָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ נֹתֵ֣ן לָ֔ךְ וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֖הּ וְיָשַׁ֣בְתָּה בָּ֑הּ וְאָמַרְתָּ֗ אָשִׂ֤ימָה עָלַי֙ מֶ֔לֶךְ כְּכׇל־הַגּוֹיִ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר סְבִיבֹתָֽי׃|14|If, after you have entered the land that your God יהוה has assigned to you, and taken possession of it and settled in it, you decide, “I will set a king over me, as do all the nations about me,”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The concept of having a king over Israel is debated among commentators, with some arguing for the necessity of a king for unity and stability, while others believe temporary leaders and judges can suffice. Samuel's criticism of the people's request for a king was due to a lack of faith in the Bet Din to administer Torah law effectively. The appointment of a king is seen as a concession to human weakness rather than a religious necessity, with the focus on maintaining a well-ordered society through a balance of judges and a king. The appointment of a king in Israel was a debated topic among commentators, with different opinions on the Torah's allowance for it and the reasons behind the request for a king. The elders of Israel requested a king to govern them like other nations, despite warnings of the consequences. The Talmud discusses various mitzvot related to entering and settling in Eretz Yisrael, including appointing a king, cutting off the seed of Amalek in war, and building the Temple in Jerusalem. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the scenario of the Israelites entering the land, inheriting it, and desiring a king like the surrounding nations. 

|שׂ֣וֹם תָּשִׂ֤ים עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ מֶ֔לֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִבְחַ֛ר יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ בּ֑וֹ מִקֶּ֣רֶב אַחֶ֗יךָ תָּשִׂ֤ים עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ מֶ֔לֶךְ לֹ֣א תוּכַ֗ל לָתֵ֤ת עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ אִ֣ישׁ נׇכְרִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹֽא־אָחִ֖יךָ הֽוּא׃|15|you shall be free to set a king over yourself, one chosen by your God יהוה. Be sure to set as king over yourself one of your own people; you must not set a foreigner over you, one who is not your kin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of appointing a king over Israel who cares for the entire community, emphasizing the need to avoid appointing a king with anger and highlighting the significance of accepting the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven. The appointment of a king over Israel is seen as a positive development to elevate the people spiritually, with the king's character and intentions being crucial. The king must be an Israelite, and only a Jewish king is allowed to rule over Israel, with the king serving as the heart of Israel. 

|רַק֮ לֹא־יַרְבֶּה־לּ֣וֹ סוּסִים֒ וְלֹֽא־יָשִׁ֤יב אֶת־הָעָם֙ מִצְרַ֔יְמָה לְמַ֖עַן הַרְבּ֣וֹת ס֑וּס וַֽיהֹוָה֙ אָמַ֣ר לָכֶ֔ם לֹ֣א תֹסִפ֗וּן לָשׁ֛וּב בַּדֶּ֥רֶךְ הַזֶּ֖ה עֽוֹד׃|16|Moreover, he shall not keep many horses or send people back to Egypt to add to his horses, since יהוה has warned you, “You must not go back that way again.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah prohibits a Jewish king from dwelling in Egypt and accumulating many horses, emphasizing trust in God over military might and foreign influences. The Mishnah outlines restrictions on the king's behavior and possessions, while Musar highlights the symbolic significance of the king's actions and the dangers of material reliance. The Talmud recounts historical events related to these prohibitions, and Tanakh provides examples of reliance on God over worldly powers. The Targum reinforces the warning against excessive horses to prevent negative consequences. 

|וְלֹ֤א יַרְבֶּה־לּוֹ֙ נָשִׁ֔ים וְלֹ֥א יָס֖וּר לְבָב֑וֹ וְכֶ֣סֶף וְזָהָ֔ב לֹ֥א יַרְבֶּה־לּ֖וֹ מְאֹֽד׃|17|And he shall not have many wives, lest his heart go astray; nor shall he amass silver and gold to excess.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut focuses on Shlomo HaMelech's understanding of spirits and demons, breaking kelipot to reveal the Tetragrammaton, emphasizing the need to find good within evil. Halakhah prohibits a king from accumulating excessive wealth and wives, emphasizing Torah study and the needs of Israel. Jewish Thought stresses the importance of abstinence from permitted pleasures and fulfilling commandments. Midrash discusses Solomon's downfall due to disregarding Torah commands, while Mishnah outlines restrictions on a king's wives, horses, and wealth. Musar links yein nessech to prohibitions for a Jewish king, and the Talmud discusses limitations on a king's possessions and religious duties, using Solomon as an example. Tanakh emphasizes God's role in providing for David, and Targum states restrictions on a king's wives and wealth to prevent rebellion. 

|וְהָיָ֣ה כְשִׁבְתּ֔וֹ עַ֖ל כִּסֵּ֣א מַמְלַכְתּ֑וֹ וְכָ֨תַב ל֜וֹ אֶת־מִשְׁנֵ֨ה הַתּוֹרָ֤ה הַזֹּאת֙ עַל־סֵ֔פֶר מִלִּפְנֵ֖י הַכֹּהֲנִ֥ים הַלְוִיִּֽם׃|18|When he is seated on his royal throne, he shall have a copy of this Teaching written for him on a scroll by  the levitical priests.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah commands a king to write two Torah scrolls, one for himself and one to carry at all times, with specific regulations outlined in Jewish law. The king's constant study and observance of the Torah are emphasized to instill fear of God and refine his character. The requirement for the king to have the Torah at all times serves as a model for all individuals to prioritize Torah study in their lives, as highlighted in various commentaries, including Ramban and Talmudic sources. 

|וְהָיְתָ֣ה עִמּ֔וֹ וְקָ֥רָא ב֖וֹ כׇּל־יְמֵ֣י חַיָּ֑יו לְמַ֣עַן יִלְמַ֗ד לְיִרְאָה֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהָ֔יו לִ֠שְׁמֹ֠ר אֶֽת־כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֞י הַתּוֹרָ֥ה הַזֹּ֛את וְאֶת־הַחֻקִּ֥ים הָאֵ֖לֶּה לַעֲשֹׂתָֽם׃|19|Let it remain with him and let him read in it all his life, so that he may learn to revere his God יהוה, to observe faithfully every word of this Teaching as well as these laws.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the king studying Torah to bring life into his leadership, while Halakhah mandates a king to write a Torah scroll, read from it daily, and have it with him at all times. Jewish Thought explores true freedom in serving God, Kabbalah discusses the king's need for Torah to learn awe for God, Midrash emphasizes the importance of impartiality in leadership, Mishnah outlines limitations for kings, Musar stresses the fear of God through Torah study, and Talmud details requirements for a king. Commentary highlights the significance of a prince bringing an offering for atonement, with Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Ramban, and others providing insights. Targum emphasizes the king's daily reading of the Torah, and Tosefta discusses the importance of writing a Sefer Torah for personal use and studying it continually. 

|לְבִלְתִּ֤י רוּם־לְבָבוֹ֙ מֵֽאֶחָ֔יו וּלְבִלְתִּ֛י ס֥וּר מִן־הַמִּצְוָ֖ה יָמִ֣ין וּשְׂמֹ֑אול לְמַ֩עַן֩ יַאֲרִ֨יךְ יָמִ֧ים עַל־מַמְלַכְתּ֛וֹ ה֥וּא וּבָנָ֖יו בְּקֶ֥רֶב יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|20|Thus he will not act haughtily toward his fellows or deviate from the Instruction to the right or to the left, to the end that he and his descendants may reign long in the midst of Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The appointment of a king in Judaism emphasizes humility, adherence to divine law, and servant leadership to ensure a long reign and avoid negative consequences. Kings are anointed from a horn, not priests, and anointing is required in cases of succession disputes. The king of Israel is commanded to have a special Torah scroll, read it daily, and lead the nation under the sacred canopy of the divine word. The Targum emphasizes that a king should not be prideful towards his brothers, follow the commandments, and have a long reign over his kingdom.

## Deuteronomy 18

|לֹֽא־יִ֠הְיֶ֠ה לַכֹּהֲנִ֨ים הַלְוִיִּ֜ם כׇּל־שֵׁ֧בֶט לֵוִ֛י חֵ֥לֶק וְנַחֲלָ֖ה עִם־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל אִשֵּׁ֧י יְהֹוָ֛ה וְנַחֲלָת֖וֹ יֹאכֵלֽוּן׃|1|The levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no territorial portion with Israel. They shall live only off יהוה’s offerings by fire as their  portion,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Levites are prohibited from inheriting land in the Land of Israel and are to receive offerings from the people to sustain themselves. The concept of surrender and humility allows connection with the Creator, contrasting with arrogance. The tribe of Levi did not receive a hereditary portion of land, as their portion was the fire offerings of God. The priests of the tribe of Levi will not have a portion or inheritance with the rest of the Israelites, but will eat the offerings of the Lord as their portion. 

|וְנַחֲלָ֥ה לֹא־יִֽהְיֶה־לּ֖וֹ בְּקֶ֣רֶב אֶחָ֑יו יְהֹוָה֙ ה֣וּא נַחֲלָת֔וֹ כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּר־לֽוֹ׃|2|and shall have no portion among their brother tribes: יהוה is their portion, as promised.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that priests and Levites did not inherit land in Israel, as stated in Deuteronomy 18:2, to ensure their dedication to serving God. The Levites are excluded from inheriting land or spoils due to their spiritual role, with the rationale that they should not be involved in material pursuits. The allocation of cities of refuge in the Land of Israel and the scattering of Israel among the gates of the world are discussed in the Midrash, with the promise of gathering them back in the future. Aaron is told in Numbers 18:20 that he will not have a share of land or possessions among the Israelites, as God himself is his portion and inheritance. 

|וְזֶ֡ה יִהְיֶה֩ מִשְׁפַּ֨ט הַכֹּהֲנִ֜ים מֵאֵ֣ת הָעָ֗ם מֵאֵ֛ת זֹבְחֵ֥י הַזֶּ֖בַח אִם־שׁ֣וֹר אִם־שֶׂ֑ה וְנָתַן֙ לַכֹּהֵ֔ן הַזְּרֹ֥עַ וְהַלְּחָיַ֖יִם וְהַקֵּבָֽה׃|3|This then shall be the priests’ due from the people: Everyone who offers a sacrifice, whether an ox or a sheep, must give the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach to the priest.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah commands priests to receive portions of non-consecrated animals, including the foreleg, cheekbones, and stomach, as compensation for specific actions, not obligatory for wild or consecrated animals, exclusive to non-priests [Commentary]. The commandment to give a priest specific parts of slaughtered animals is universal, practiced at all times, with some exceptions for consecrated animals and hybrids [Halakhah]. The text emphasizes the importance of following Torah commandments, helping the poor, and showing compassion, while discussing various laws and commandments related to offerings and priestly gifts [Midrash]. Priests are entitled to receive various offerings, with differences in opinion regarding certain items, and the mitzva of giving the first sheared wool to a priest applies to sheep but not goats or cattle [Mishnah]. Various commentators, including Rashi, Bartenura, and Ibn Ezra, detail the parts of sacrificial animals that must be given to priests according to Deuteronomy 18:3 [Quoting Commentary]. The Talmud discusses the obligation to give gifts of the priesthood from slaughtered animals, the requirements for sharing tithes and Sabbatical produce in Syria, and the exemption of gifts of the priesthood from hybrid animals like a koy [Talmud]. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan specify the parts of sacrifices that priests will receive according to Deuteronomy 18:3 [Targum]. The Tosefta addresses various laws regarding ritual slaughter, gifts for the poor, separation of terumah and priestly gifts, and the obligations related to the first of the fleece and priestly gifts, outlining rights and obligations regarding newborns and priestly gifts [Tosefta]. 

|רֵאשִׁ֨ית דְּגָֽנְךָ֜ תִּירֹֽשְׁךָ֣ וְיִצְהָרֶ֗ךָ וְרֵאשִׁ֛ית גֵּ֥ז צֹאנְךָ֖ תִּתֶּן־לֽוֹ׃|4|You shall also give him the first fruits of your new grain and wine and oil, and the first shearing of your sheep.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the obligation to give the first shearing of flocks to the priest, with specific measurements and rules outlined in Deuteronomy 18:4. Various commentators emphasize the symbolic importance of these gifts, the levels of generosity in giving them, and the specific requirements for donations and fleece of sheep. The concept of tithing is connected to the sephirah of Malkhut in Kabbalah, highlighting the importance of giving back to the divine. The Midrash delves into laws regarding offerings, the story of Korach, and the significance of various elements in Judaism. The Mishnah details the obligation of the first shearing of wool for sheep, not goats or cattle, and the specific weight required for the priest. Rav Huna explains that the universe was created due to merits acquired by Israel, including setting aside challah, giving tithes, and bringing first ripe fruits to the Temple. Rashi and Ramban explore the meaning of "In the beginning God created" in Genesis 1:1, connecting it to the creation of the world for the sake of Torah and Israel. The Talmud discusses the strictness of consecrated items compared to terumah, specific measurements and rules for priestly gifts, and the importance of following purity laws to avoid sin. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan instruct to give the first portion of grain, wine, olive oil, and sheep's fleece to the designated recipient in Deuteronomy 18:4. In Tosefta, it is explained that failure to fulfill obligations as a Kohen or Levite results in not receiving associated gifts, and certain animals are exempt from the obligation of the first of the fleece based on specific conditions. 

|כִּ֣י ב֗וֹ בָּחַ֛ר יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ מִכׇּל־שְׁבָטֶ֑יךָ לַעֲמֹ֨ד לְשָׁרֵ֧ת בְּשֵׁם־יְהֹוָ֛ה ה֥וּא וּבָנָ֖יו כׇּל־הַיָּמִֽים׃|5|For your God יהוה has chosen him and his descendants, out of all your tribes, to be in attendance for service in the name of יהוה for all time.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sacrificial service in the Temple must be performed standing, with priests provided with food and clothing to serve, and the High Priest pronouncing the 42-lettered name of God on the Day of Atonement. The Sefer HaChinukh, Mishneh Torah, Sefer HaMitzvot, and Mishnah detail various requirements and prohibitions related to Temple service, sanctification, and priestly duties. The prophet, Temple, and priests all represent divine authority and the will of God, with blessings, oaths, and prayers made in the name of God seeking divine intervention. The Midrash discusses rules for the Priestly Blessing, the importance of priests being chosen to bless the people, and specific actions and prayers during various occasions. The Talmud emphasizes that priests must stand while performing Temple service and reciting the Priestly Benediction, with lifted hands, and that priests sitting disqualify the rites they perform. The Tosefta states that all priestly rituals are incumbent upon the sons of Aaron, and Kohanim receive their portion from God's offerings when they do His will. 

|וְכִֽי־יָבֹ֨א הַלֵּוִ֜י מֵאַחַ֤ד שְׁעָרֶ֙יךָ֙ מִכׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֲשֶׁר־ה֖וּא גָּ֣ר שָׁ֑ם וּבָא֙ בְּכׇל־אַוַּ֣ת נַפְשׁ֔וֹ אֶל־הַמָּק֖וֹם אֲשֶׁר־יִבְחַ֥ר יְהֹוָֽה׃|6|If a Levite would go, from any of the settlements throughout Israel where he has been residing, to the place that יהוה has chosen, he may do so whenever he pleases.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of connecting with others close to the tzaddik for guidance and wisdom. Commentary discusses the eligibility of Levites and priests to serve in the Temple, highlighting the specific obligations related to Temple service. Halakhah details the shifts for priests and Levites in the Temple, with priests having more flexibility in offering sacrifices. Midrash distinguishes between Levites and Cohanim in performing sacrificial service. Quoting Commentary contrasts Ramban's interpretation with Rashi's on the repetition of words in Scripture. Talmud allows priests to sacrifice offerings at any time, even outside their designated watch. Targum emphasizes the fulfillment of obligation for a Levite coming to the chosen place with all his soul's desire. 

|וְשֵׁרֵ֕ת בְּשֵׁ֖ם יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהָ֑יו כְּכׇל־אֶחָיו֙ הַלְוִיִּ֔ם הָעֹמְדִ֥ים שָׁ֖ם לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|7|He may serve in the name of his God יהוה like all his fellow Levites who are there in attendance before יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 18:7, priests from the countryside are granted equality in service and share of sacrifices with those already in function based on a rotational system. Levites were obligated to serve in the Temple as gatekeepers and singers during sacrifices, with only Levites allowed to recite songs during Temple service. The Levites must stand while serving, and both Cohanim and Levites have a portion and inheritance with Israel. The Rabbis discuss differences between individual burnt offerings and communal gift offerings, with priests allowed to offer sacrifices at any time they desire. Priests are allowed to sacrifice offerings at any time they desire, even outside of their designated priestly watch, and there is a mitzva to perform the service while standing. The Talmud indicates a basic requirement to accompany communal offerings with song. 

|חֵ֥לֶק כְּחֵ֖לֶק יֹאכֵ֑לוּ לְבַ֥ד מִמְכָּרָ֖יו עַל־הָאָבֽוֹת׃|8|They shall receive equal shares of the dues, without regard to personal gifts or patrimonies.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Priests in Jerusalem during festivals can partake in sin-offerings, share sacrificial meat equitably, and offer personal sacrifices out of turn. The system of priestly rosters, established by King David and Samuel, ensures orderly service in the Temple with each roster serving for two weeks per year. Levites can eat a share of offerings brought during festivals regardless of roster affiliation. The priests' shares were determined by agreements resembling sales contracts between ancestors, and priests were entitled to equal shares of meal-offerings regardless of duties or family groups. All priestly watches have equal status in portions of Festival offerings, only applicable during pilgrimage Festivals when all of Israel enters through one gate. 

|כִּ֤י אַתָּה֙ בָּ֣א אֶל־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ נֹתֵ֣ן לָ֑ךְ לֹֽא־תִלְמַ֣ד לַעֲשׂ֔וֹת כְּתוֹעֲבֹ֖ת הַגּוֹיִ֥ם הָהֵֽם׃|9|When you enter the land that your God יהוה is giving you, you shall not learn to imitate the abhorrent practices of those nations.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebbe Nachman warns against praying with kavanot if unfit, likening it to sorcery, emphasizing the importance of only using Kabbalistic meditations for understanding and issuing rulings (Likutei Moharan, Part II 120:1:2). The text prohibits engaging in abominable practices like sorcery and divination, discussing the influence of astrology and warning against relying on such practices for knowledge of the future. Noahides are commanded to observe seven laws, including blasphemy and idolatry, with consequences for transgressions. Certain acts, like sorcery, are permitted for Torah study and teaching purposes, exemplified by Rabbi Gamliel and others. The Tosefta discusses criteria for a beguiled city in the Land of Israel and the importance of truthfulness and avoiding causing the righteous to live among the wicked. 

|לֹֽא־יִמָּצֵ֣א בְךָ֔ מַעֲבִ֥יר בְּנֽוֹ־וּבִתּ֖וֹ בָּאֵ֑שׁ קֹסֵ֣ם קְסָמִ֔ים מְעוֹנֵ֥ן וּמְנַחֵ֖שׁ וּמְכַשֵּֽׁף׃|10|Let no one be found among you who consigns a son or daughter to the fire, or who is an augur, a soothsayer, a diviner, a sorcerer,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various forbidden practices are condemned in Jewish law, including passing children through fire for idol worship, engaging in sorcery, divination, and seeking supernatural knowledge. Violations of these prohibitions can result in lashes, stoning, or other penalties. The Torah emphasizes the importance of relying on God for guidance and avoiding these practices. The Talmud discusses interpretations and consequences of these prohibitions, while the Tosefta outlines the specific commandments for the sons of Noach, including prohibitions against idolatry and other forbidden practices. 

|וְחֹבֵ֖ר חָ֑בֶר וְשֹׁאֵ֥ל אוֹב֙ וְיִדְּעֹנִ֔י וְדֹרֵ֖שׁ אֶל־הַמֵּתִֽים׃|11|one who casts spells, or one who consults ghosts or familiar spirits, or one who inquires of the dead.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various Jewish commentaries, Halakhah, Jewish thought, Kabbalah, Midrash, Mishnah, and Talmud all discuss prohibitions against practices such as necromancy, divination, sorcery, and consulting with the dead, emphasizing the importance of following God's statutes and avoiding sinful behaviors. The Talmud differentiates between different types of practitioners and their specific methods and punishments, while the prophet in Judaism is described as warning of a future that can be changed through human choices rather than predicting outcomes. The Tanakh and Targum also warn against seeking guidance from ghosts or familiar spirits and engaging in activities like snake charming and using magical knots. 

|כִּֽי־תוֹעֲבַ֥ת יְהֹוָ֖ה כׇּל־עֹ֣שֵׂה אֵ֑לֶּה וּבִגְלַל֙ הַתּוֹעֵבֹ֣ת הָאֵ֔לֶּה יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ מוֹרִ֥ישׁ אוֹתָ֖ם מִפָּנֶֽיךָ׃|12|For anyone who does such things is abhorrent to יהוה, and it is because of these abhorrent things that your God יהוה is dispossessing them before you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah prohibits practices like divination and idol worship, considering them abominations to the Lord. The Canaanites were dispossessed from their land for engaging in such practices. Rabbi Shimon b. Yochai compares Israel's relationship with God to a king feeding his obedient sons and servants. The Talmud explains that Gentiles are warned about specific prohibitions, including idolatry. The Targum mentions that those who commit abominations are expelled by the Lord. 

|תָּמִ֣ים תִּֽהְיֶ֔ה עִ֖ם יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|13|You must be wholehearted with your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of wholehearted faith in God, avoiding seeking answers from other sources and being pure-hearted. Halakhah prohibits involvement in occult arts and emphasizes that true wisdom comes from faith in God. Jewish Thought warns against seeking answers through forbidden means and emphasizes innocence and trust in God. Kabbalah discusses balancing and perfecting spiritual aspects, while Midrash praises those who follow God's commandments wholeheartedly. Musar highlights the importance of being wholehearted with God, encompassing all praiseworthy qualities. Quoting Commentary explains that being whole-hearted with God means trusting in His control over fate and aligning internal virtues with external actions. Responsa permits consulting sorcerers in cases of danger but prohibits it otherwise, while Talmud argues against consulting astrologers. Tanakh describes Noah as righteous and blameless, walking with God, and Targum emphasizes the importance of walking in perfect trust and fear of God. 

|כִּ֣י ׀ הַגּוֹיִ֣ם הָאֵ֗לֶּה אֲשֶׁ֤ר אַתָּה֙ יוֹרֵ֣שׁ אוֹתָ֔ם אֶל־מְעֹנְנִ֥ים וְאֶל־קֹסְמִ֖ים יִשְׁמָ֑עוּ וְאַתָּ֕ה לֹ֣א כֵ֔ן נָ֥תַן לְךָ֖ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|14|Those nations that you are about to dispossess do indeed resort to soothsayers and augurs; to you, however, your God יהוה has not assigned the like.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes that the Israelites are forbidden from consulting soothsayers or diviners, as they have prophets and the "Urim and Thummim" for guidance on God's plans. The Torah warns against falsehood and idolatry, stressing the importance of faith in God and distinguishing between true prophets and diviners. The Jewish people are urged to trust in God rather than resorting to divination, which is associated with the Gentile nations. The Midrash teaches the importance of following God's guidance like Avraham did, rather than relying on divination like the nations. The Torah prohibits divination and emphasizes trust in God over seeking guidance from diviners. Sforno, Ibn Ezra, Ramban, and Targum all highlight the contrast between seeking God's proximity and relying on demonic divination practices, emphasizing the importance of prophecy and faith in God. 

|נָבִ֨יא מִקִּרְבְּךָ֤ מֵאַחֶ֙יךָ֙ כָּמֹ֔נִי יָקִ֥ים לְךָ֖ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ אֵלָ֖יו תִּשְׁמָעֽוּן׃|15|From among your own people, your God יהוה will raise up for you a prophet like myself; that is whom you shall heed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The concept of prophecy in the Land of Israel is discussed, emphasizing that prophets will arise only from among the Israelites, like Moses, and will deliver messages from God faithfully. It is a mitzvah to listen to prophets as long as they do not deviate from the Torah's laws, and any temporary changes they suggest should align with the Torah's overall message. The importance of understanding the deeper meaning behind the mitzvot, respecting parents, and eradicating perversions for holiness on a national level is highlighted. The exclusivity of prophecy, Torah, the land of Israel, and resurrection of the dead to the Jewish people is emphasized through biblical verses and interpretations. The Gemara suggests that even if a true prophet tells you to transgress a mitzvah, you must listen to him for the requirement of the hour, indicating that a Torah mitzvah can be uprooted in an active manner. 

|כְּכֹ֨ל אֲשֶׁר־שָׁאַ֜לְתָּ מֵעִ֨ם יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ בְּחֹרֵ֔ב בְּי֥וֹם הַקָּהָ֖ל לֵאמֹ֑ר לֹ֣א אֹסֵ֗ף לִשְׁמֹ֙עַ֙ אֶת־קוֹל֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהָ֔י וְאֶת־הָאֵ֨שׁ הַגְּדֹלָ֥ה הַזֹּ֛את לֹֽא־אֶרְאֶ֥ה ע֖וֹד וְלֹ֥א אָמֽוּת׃|16|This is just what you asked of your God יהוה at Horeb, on the day of the Assembly, saying, “Let me not hear the voice of my God יהוה any longer or see this wondrous fire any more, lest I die.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah prohibits practices related to propitiating the constellations to prevent idol worship, compensating for lost benefits with adherence to mitzvoth and reliance on prophets. Esau's deceitful nature is contrasted with Jacob's integrity in Isaac's blessing. The Israelites merited prophets by asking God in Chorev, leading to the need for prophets throughout generations. The four methods of executing someone legally in Jewish law are stoning, burning, sword, and asphyxiation, symbolizing different sins and executed by the angel of death based on Justice. The Israelites feared the sounds at Mount Sinai, leading to the need for Moses as an intermediary and later prophets. The text refutes claims that verses in Scripture allude to Mohammed, emphasizing the importance of upholding the teachings of Moses and not adding or subtracting from them. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the Israelites' request at Choreiv to avoid hearing the voice of Adonoy and seeing the great fire of God to prevent death. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֵלָ֑י הֵיטִ֖יבוּ אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֵּֽרוּ׃|17|Whereupon יהוה said to me, “They have done well in speaking thus.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites believed in Moses as a prophet, leading to a commitment to accept future prophets as intermediaries for communication with God, as implied by Moses. R. Akiva believes they should respond affirmatively to both affirmatives and negatives from God's commands. Ibn Ezra notes a similarity between Isaiah 15:7:2 and Deuteronomy 8:17. The Talmud discusses the importance of not speaking before someone wiser and the examples of appropriate and inappropriate ways of speaking. The Targum confirms that the words spoken by the people were correct, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 18:17. 

|נָבִ֨יא אָקִ֥ים לָהֶ֛ם מִקֶּ֥רֶב אֲחֵיהֶ֖ם כָּמ֑וֹךָ וְנָתַתִּ֤י דְבָרַי֙ בְּפִ֔יו וְדִבֶּ֣ר אֲלֵיהֶ֔ם אֵ֖ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲצַוֶּֽנּוּ׃|18|I will raise up for them from among their own people a prophet like yourself, in whose mouth I will put My words and who will speak to them all that I command;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The primary function of a prophet is to instruct Israel regarding God's word, with the prophet relaying God's commands to the people when necessary and not establishing a new faith. It is a mitzvah to listen to a prophet, as failure to do so may result in death at the hand of God. Following post-Mosaic prophets, priests, and judges is important for guidance in interpreting laws and regulations, as they have divine assistance and vast learning. The appointment of a prophet is based on the merit of Israel, and prophets must speak in accordance with the will of God. Moses' decline in prophetic abilities is hinted at in Deut. 18:18, and a prophet's role is to uphold Torah laws, not establish a new religion. God promises to raise up a prophet from among the people to speak His words, like Moses, and commandments to the people. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה הָאִישׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יִשְׁמַע֙ אֶל־דְּבָרַ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר בִּשְׁמִ֑י אָנֹכִ֖י אֶדְרֹ֥שׁ מֵעִמּֽוֹ׃|19|and anybody who fails to heed the words [the prophet] speaks in My name, I Myself will call to account.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Prophets are appointed by God to command people to fulfill the precepts of the Torah and warn against transgression, with dire consequences for those who do not heed their words. Failure to listen to a prophet can result in death by the hand of God, and those who suppress or violate a prophecy may face execution by strangulation. The Talmud and Mishnah both emphasize the importance of obeying the commands of a prophet, as God will demand accountability and punish those who refuse to obey. 

|אַ֣ךְ הַנָּבִ֡יא אֲשֶׁ֣ר יָזִיד֩ לְדַבֵּ֨ר דָּבָ֜ר בִּשְׁמִ֗י אֵ֣ת אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־צִוִּיתִיו֙ לְדַבֵּ֔ר וַאֲשֶׁ֣ר יְדַבֵּ֔ר בְּשֵׁ֖ם אֱלֹהִ֣ים אֲחֵרִ֑ים וּמֵ֖ת הַנָּבִ֥יא הַהֽוּא׃|20|But any prophet who presumes to speak in My name an oracle that I did not command to be uttered, or who speaks in the name of other gods—that prophet shall die.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah warns that false prophets who speak in the name of other gods or make inaccurate prophecies will face death by strangulation, as outlined in Deuteronomy 18:19-20 and reiterated in various commentaries, including the Mishnah and Talmud. Such prophets, whether claiming to speak for false gods or idols, are considered guilty of idolatry and subject to the death penalty. The seriousness of false prophecy is emphasized, with consequences including execution by strangulation for deliberate sinners who speak falsely in the name of the Lord. Additionally, cases involving false prophets, an entire tribe's sin, or a High Priest transgressing serious prohibitions must be judged by a court of seventy-one judges, as detailed in the Mishnah and Talmud. The text also cautions against false Messiahs, urging patience and faith in awaiting the true redemption of Israel. 

|וְכִ֥י תֹאמַ֖ר בִּלְבָבֶ֑ךָ אֵיכָה֙ נֵדַ֣ע אֶת־הַדָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־דִבְּר֖וֹ יְהֹוָֽה׃|21|And should you ask yourselves, “How can we know that the oracle was not spoken by יהוה?”—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban, Rashi, Sforno, Tur HaArokh, Rav Hirsch, and Mishneh Torah explain the criteria for distinguishing false prophets from true ones, emphasizing the importance of accurate predictions of future events. The Sifri on Parshat Shoftim addresses conflicting prophecies regarding the fate of the Temple, with the Torah instructing not to fear prophecies that do not come true. Jeremiah warns against false prophets claiming the return of the vessels of the House of God from Babylon, while Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan discuss discerning statements not spoken by the Lord in Deuteronomy 18:21. 

|אֲשֶׁר֩ יְדַבֵּ֨ר הַנָּבִ֜יא בְּשֵׁ֣ם יְהֹוָ֗ה וְלֹֽא־יִהְיֶ֤ה הַדָּבָר֙ וְלֹ֣א יָבֹ֔א ה֣וּא הַדָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־דִבְּר֖וֹ יְהֹוָ֑ה בְּזָדוֹן֙ דִּבְּר֣וֹ הַנָּבִ֔יא לֹ֥א תָג֖וּר מִמֶּֽנּוּ׃|22|if the prophet speaks in the name of יהוה and the oracle does not come true, that oracle was not spoken by יהוה; the prophet has uttered it presumptuously: do not stand in dread of that person.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

False prophets who make predictions that do not come true should be considered illegitimate, as true prophets are confirmed by miracles from God. The importance of not fearing or refraining from executing a false prophet is emphasized, with the commandment to kill them even if they prophesy about the fulfillment of commandments. The construction of the tabernacle falls under Divine intervention, emphasizing the need to discern true prophecy from false prophecy and not rely on unacceptable means for knowledge. Offenses punishable by strangulation include false prophecy, with the need to demonstrate criminal intent in prosecuting false prophets. If a prophet's words do not come true, it is not from the Lord but spoken maliciously, and one should not fear them.

## Deuteronomy 19

|כִּֽי־יַכְרִ֞ית יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ אֶת־הַגּוֹיִ֔ם אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לְךָ֖ אֶת־אַרְצָ֑ם וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֕ם וְיָשַׁבְתָּ֥ בְעָרֵיהֶ֖ם וּבְבָתֵּיהֶֽם׃|1|When your God יהוה has cut down the nations whose land your God יהוה is assigning to you, and you have dispossessed them and settled in their towns and homes,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses establishes cities of refuge for unintentional murderers in the land, emphasizing the sanctity of human life and the need to cleanse the land from idolatry and innocent blood. Judges must measure the distance precisely to the nearest city with a court of 23 judges, excluding Jerusalem, and the mitzvah only applies in the land given by God. The obligation to designate cities of refuge is dependent on entry into the land, with specific requirements and the need for six cities to ensure availability. The "enlargement" of the border allows for the establishment of additional cities of refuge, permitting the consumption of secular meat meals. The destruction of nations by God and the Israelites inheriting their land, cities, and houses is emphasized in Targum translations. 

|שָׁל֥וֹשׁ עָרִ֖ים תַּבְדִּ֣יל לָ֑ךְ בְּת֣וֹךְ אַרְצְךָ֔ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לְךָ֖ לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|2|you shall set aside three cities in the land that your God יהוה is giving you to possess.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses establishes six cities of refuge within Israel for inadvertent killers to flee to, with specific requirements for their designation and maintenance. The commandment applies only in Eretz Yisrael and is the responsibility of both the king and the community, with details explained in various commentaries. The cities are spiritually and physically significant, with mystical symbolism related to the soul's journey in the afterlife. Moses designated three cities in TransJordan and Yehoshua set aside three in Canaan, with a total of six required before serving as a haven. The Talmud discusses differing views on the number of cities needed and notes five things missing in the last Temple compared to the first. The Targums also emphasize the setting apart of three cities within the land. 

|תָּכִ֣ין לְךָ֮ הַדֶּ֒רֶךְ֒ וְשִׁלַּשְׁתָּ֙ אֶת־גְּב֣וּל אַרְצְךָ֔ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יַנְחִֽילְךָ֖ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ וְהָיָ֕ה לָנ֥וּס שָׁ֖מָּה כׇּל־רֹצֵֽחַ׃|3|You shall survey the distances, and divide into three parts the territory of the country that your God יהוה has allotted to you, so that any [man]  who has killed someone  may have a place to flee to.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The establishment of cities of refuge for unintentional murderers is detailed in various texts, including Mishneh Torah and Talmud, with specific requirements for roads leading to these cities, equal division of the land, and spiritual significance in guiding sinners to safety through God's mercy and guidance. The division of the land into three parts symbolizes spiritual ascent and rehabilitation for unintentional killers, with clear roads and signs pointing the way to ensure equal distance and accessibility to each city. Additionally, the consequences of intentional wrongdoing, such as in the case of Yoav, are highlighted as punishment for deliberate actions despite seeking refuge. 

|וְזֶה֙ דְּבַ֣ר הָרֹצֵ֔חַ אֲשֶׁר־יָנ֥וּס שָׁ֖מָּה וָחָ֑י אֲשֶׁ֨ר יַכֶּ֤ה אֶת־רֵעֵ֙הוּ֙ בִּבְלִי־דַ֔עַת וְה֛וּא לֹא־שֹׂנֵ֥א ל֖וֹ מִתְּמֹ֥ל שִׁלְשֹֽׁם׃|4|Now this is the case of the killer who may flee there and live: one who has slain another unwittingly, without having been an enemy in the past.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Murderers, whether intentional or unintentional, must acknowledge their status and not accept honors or positions of authority. Cities of refuge provide protection for unintentional killers, who must disclose their status when honored. Torah scholars accompany them to prevent attacks, and they must return to their previous office after the High Priest's death. The Talmud discusses laws of unintentional murder and exile, with Rabbi Meir suggesting blind people be included in exile. The Targum discusses unintentional murder cases without prior enmity towards the victim. 

|וַאֲשֶׁר֩ יָבֹ֨א אֶת־רֵעֵ֥הוּ בַיַּ֘עַר֮ לַחְטֹ֣ב עֵצִים֒ וְנִדְּחָ֨ה יָד֤וֹ בַגַּרְזֶן֙ לִכְרֹ֣ת הָעֵ֔ץ וְנָשַׁ֤ל הַבַּרְזֶל֙ מִן־הָעֵ֔ץ וּמָצָ֥א אֶת־רֵעֵ֖הוּ וָמֵ֑ת ה֗וּא יָנ֛וּס אֶל־אַחַ֥ת הֶעָרִים־הָאֵ֖לֶּה וָחָֽי׃|5|For instance, a man goes with another fellow into a grove to cut wood; as his hand swings the ax to cut down a tree, the ax-head flies off the handle and strikes the other so that he dies. That man shall flee to one of these cities and live.—|

Various Jewish commentators, Halakhic authorities, and Midrashim discuss unintentional murder and the laws surrounding it, including the circumstances that warrant exile, exemptions for certain situations like acts during a mitzvah, and differing opinions on legal matters such as the treatment of blind individuals. The Mishnah and Talmud delve into specific scenarios and interpretations of verses like Deuteronomy 19:5 to determine liability for unintentional killings and the purpose of cities of refuge. Philo and Targum offer additional insights into the concept of unintentional homicide and seeking refuge in God. 

|פֶּן־יִרְדֹּף֩ גֹּאֵ֨ל הַדָּ֜ם אַחֲרֵ֣י הָרֹצֵ֗חַ כִּי־יֵחַם֮ לְבָבוֹ֒ וְהִשִּׂיג֛וֹ כִּֽי־יִרְבֶּ֥ה הַדֶּ֖רֶךְ וְהִכָּ֣הוּ נָ֑פֶשׁ וְלוֹ֙ אֵ֣ין מִשְׁפַּט־מָ֔וֶת כִּ֠י לֹ֣א שֹׂנֵ֥א ה֛וּא ל֖וֹ מִתְּמ֥וֹל שִׁלְשֽׁוֹם׃|6|Otherwise, when the distance is great, the blood-avenger, pursuing the killer in hot anger, may overtake him and strike him down; yet he did not incur the death penalty, since he had never been the other’s enemy.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The need for multiple cities of refuge to protect unintentional murderers from blood redeemers seeking revenge is emphasized in Deuteronomy 19:6. The Mishneh Torah states that a blood redeemer is not liable for killing someone who unintentionally killed outside the Sabbath limits of his city of refuge. The Midrash discusses various emotions and actions of the heart, emphasizing justice and mercy through biblical examples. Rashi highlights the importance of cities of refuge being close enough for fugitives to reach quickly. The Talmud clarifies that the blood redeemer is exempt from punishment if they kill an unintentional murderer on the way to a city of refuge. In Leviticus 25:25, the nearest redeemer has the right to redeem sold property. The Targums warn against blood redeemers pursuing and killing murderers out of anger. 

|עַל־כֵּ֛ן אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ לֵאמֹ֑ר שָׁלֹ֥שׁ עָרִ֖ים תַּבְדִּ֥יל לָֽךְ׃|7|That is why I command you: set aside three cities.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment to establish three cities of refuge in the land is a positive commandment in Eretz Yisrael, ensuring unintentional killers can flee for protection and receive a fair trial. The Midrash emphasizes that all six cities of refuge must be designated before any can serve as a city of refuge, while both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that three cities should be set apart for specific purposes as commanded in Deuteronomy 19:7. 

|וְאִם־יַרְחִ֞יב יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ אֶת־גְּבֻ֣לְךָ֔ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּ֖ע לַאֲבֹתֶ֑יךָ וְנָ֤תַן לְךָ֙ אֶת־כׇּל־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֶּ֖ר לָתֵ֥ת לַאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ׃|8|And when your God יהוה enlarges your territory, as was sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land that was promised to be given to your fathers—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment to add three more cities of refuge, in accordance with Deuteronomy 19:8-9, will be fulfilled in the era of the King Mashiach with the cities of the Keni, K'nizi, and the Kadmoni. The mitzvah of expanding one's borders is rewarded by God with an actual expansion of territory, as seen in the promise to the forefathers. The three Temples that will be built in the future are symbolized by the wells dug by Isaac in Genesis 26, with each well representing a different Temple. Ramban discusses the symbolic meaning of the wells and predicts a time of peace and prosperity when the Third House will be built. In Genesis 15:9, God instructs Abraham to bring specific animals for sacrifice, and both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention that if God expands the boundaries of the land as promised, the people will receive the entire land. 

|כִּֽי־תִשְׁמֹר֩ אֶת־כׇּל־הַמִּצְוָ֨ה הַזֹּ֜את לַעֲשֹׂתָ֗הּ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָנֹכִ֣י מְצַוְּךָ֮ הַיּוֹם֒ לְאַהֲבָ֞ה אֶת־יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ וְלָלֶ֥כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֖יו כׇּל־הַיָּמִ֑ים וְיָסַפְתָּ֨ לְךָ֥ עוֹד֙ שָׁלֹ֣שׁ עָרִ֔ים עַ֖ל הַשָּׁלֹ֥שׁ הָאֵֽלֶּה׃|9|if you faithfully observe all this Instruction that I enjoin upon you this day, to love your God יהוה and to walk in God’s ways at all times—then you shall add three more towns to those three.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that there will be a total of nine cities of refuge, Ibn Ezra stresses the importance of walking in God's ways, Tur HaArokh highlights that observing all commandments leads to the addition of three more cities of refuge, Nachmanides explains that when all Jewish people observe all commandments out of love for God, the three additional cities will be established, Rabbeinu Bahya mentions a third group of three cities of refuge to be added, and Steinsaltz clarifies that the three additional cities will be needed when the land expands due to people observing the commandments. The Levites do not have an ancestral portion in Eretz Yisrael but were commanded to provide cities for them to dwell in, including the six cities of refuge and 42 additional cities, with three more cities to be added in the future. Moses set aside three cities of refuge across the Jordan, another three in Eretz Yisrael, and in the future, they will set up another three, totaling nine cities of refuge. The text emphasizes the importance of emulating God's ways in all aspects of life and clinging to God with such intensity that one cannot part from Him. Abba Shaul advocates for six additional cities of refuge in the Northern part of the Land of Promise, while R. Nehorai suggests a total of fifteen cities. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan discuss adding three cities to the existing three when following God's commandments to love Him and walk in His ways. 

|וְלֹ֤א יִשָּׁפֵךְ֙ דָּ֣ם נָקִ֔י בְּקֶ֣רֶב אַרְצְךָ֔ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לְךָ֖ נַחֲלָ֑ה וְהָיָ֥ה עָלֶ֖יךָ דָּמִֽים׃|10|Thus blood of the innocent will not be shed, bringing bloodguilt upon you in the land that your God יהוה is allotting to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Deuteronomy 19:10 warns against spilling innocent blood in the land given by God, placing responsibility on the people as a whole to prevent murders and seek justice for the victims. Various commandments and prohibitions are discussed, emphasizing the importance of following God's laws as gratitude for redemption from Egypt. The establishment of six towns of asylum for unintentional murderers is outlined, with a fluid interpretation of biblical texts by Rabbinic law transmitters and editors. The responsibility of court agents to prevent accidental bloodshed is discussed, with negligence leading to guilt as if they had shed the blood. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also stress the importance of not shedding innocent blood in the land. 

|וְכִֽי־יִהְיֶ֥ה אִישׁ֙ שֹׂנֵ֣א לְרֵעֵ֔הוּ וְאָ֤רַב לוֹ֙ וְקָ֣ם עָלָ֔יו וְהִכָּ֥הוּ נֶ֖פֶשׁ וָמֵ֑ת וְנָ֕ס אֶל־אַחַ֖ת הֶעָרִ֥ים הָאֵֽל׃|11|If, however, a man who is the enemy of another lies in wait and sets upon [the victim] and strikes a fatal blow and then flees to one of these towns,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Sefer Chasidim warns against minor transgressions leading to serious offenses like murder, referencing Deuteronomy 19:11. The Mishnah explains the process of trial and punishment for intentional murderers, including fleeing to cities of refuge. Rashbam, Sforno, Rashi, and other commentaries interpret Deuteronomy 19:11 in various ways related to intent and murder. The Talmud discusses the legal status of intent in cases of murder, with Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis holding different views. Leviticus 19:17 instructs individuals not to hate relatives but to reprove them. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 19:11 mention fleeing to cities of refuge after causing death through ambush. 

|וְשָֽׁלְחוּ֙ זִקְנֵ֣י עִיר֔וֹ וְלָקְח֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ מִשָּׁ֑ם וְנָתְנ֣וּ אֹת֗וֹ בְּיַ֛ד גֹּאֵ֥ל הַדָּ֖ם וָמֵֽת׃|12|the elders of his town shall have him brought back from there and shall hand him over to the blood-avenger to be put to death;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 19:12, the elders of the city send murderers to face justice and be tried by the blood redeemer, resulting in a death sentence. The Mishneh Torah outlines the process for unintentional and intentional killers seeking refuge and facing trial, with those found guilty of intentional murder being executed. The Talmud specifies that guilty individuals are executed, while innocent ones are freed or returned to the city of refuge. Exodus 21:13 provides guidelines for unintentional killings and assigns a place of asylum, with Targum emphasizing the role of the elders in sending offenders for execution. 

|לֹא־תָח֥וֹס עֵֽינְךָ֖ עָלָ֑יו וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֧ דַֽם־הַנָּקִ֛י מִיִּשְׂרָאֵ֖ל וְט֥וֹב לָֽךְ׃|13|you must show him no pity. Thus you will purge Israel of the blood of the innocent,  and it will go well with you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of not showing pity towards murderers, stressing the need to eliminate sources of evil to protect society. Judges are commanded not to have compassion for killers, those obligated to pay fines, or pursuers, and to avoid favoritism based on social status or wealth. The Mishnah discusses laws regarding accidental killing and the establishment of cities of refuge, emphasizing the importance of heeding even lighter commandments. The Torah warns against polluting the land with bloodshed and emphasizes the need to atone for bloodshed through the blood of the perpetrator. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 19:13 stress the importance of eliminating shedding of innocent blood to ensure the well-being of Israel. 

|לֹ֤א תַסִּיג֙ גְּב֣וּל רֵֽעֲךָ֔ אֲשֶׁ֥ר גָּבְל֖וּ רִאשֹׁנִ֑ים בְּנַחֲלָֽתְךָ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּנְחַ֔ל בָּאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לְךָ֖ לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|14|You shall not move your neighbor’s landmarks, set up by previous generations, in the property that will be allotted to you in the land that your God יהוה is giving you to possess.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against removing a neighbor's landmark in the Land of Israel is emphasized in various texts, including the Halakhah, Midrash, Musar, Second Temple writings, Talmud, Tanakh, and Targum, highlighting the importance of respecting boundaries to avoid disputes and maintain peace. Violating this commandment is seen as challenging the original distribution of land and can lead to severe consequences, with the boundaries set by previous generations considered sacred. 

|לֹֽא־יָקוּם֩ עֵ֨ד אֶחָ֜ד בְּאִ֗ישׁ לְכׇל־עָוֺן֙ וּלְכׇל־חַטָּ֔את בְּכׇל־חֵ֖טְא אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֶֽחֱטָ֑א עַל־פִּ֣י ׀ שְׁנֵ֣י עֵדִ֗ים א֛וֹ עַל־פִּ֥י שְׁלֹשָֽׁה־עֵדִ֖ים יָק֥וּם דָּבָֽר׃|15|A single witness may not validate against an [accused] party any guilt or blame for any offense that may be committed; a case can be valid only on the testimony of two witnesses or more.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut warns against speaking negatively about others to avoid being influenced by evil inclinations (Rishpei Aish, Mishpotim 44). Commentary emphasizes the requirement of two witnesses for testimony in legal matters (Sanhedrin, Deuteronomy 19:15). Halakhah prohibits rendering decisions based on single witness testimony in various cases (Deuteronomy 19:15). Maimonides notes exceptions to the two-witness rule, emphasizing unity and compassion in Jewish law (Yevamot 87b). Midrash highlights the importance of witnesses in establishing truth and justice in legal proceedings. Mishnah discusses scenarios where one witness's testimony may be sufficient in certain cases. Musar stresses the importance of not being a vain witness and not seeking vengeance for revealed sins. Quoting various commentaries on the significance of multiple witnesses in legal matters. Talmud explores interpretations and implications of the two-witness requirement in various legal contexts. Tanakh states that multiple witnesses are needed to warrant a death sentence for murder (Numbers 35:30). Targum Jonathan emphasizes the need for two or three witnesses to establish a matter (Deuteronomy 19:15). 

|כִּֽי־יָק֥וּם עֵד־חָמָ֖ס בְּאִ֑ישׁ לַעֲנ֥וֹת בּ֖וֹ סָרָֽה׃|16|If someone appears against another party to testify maliciously and gives incriminating yet false testimony,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

False witnesses can be identified when their testimony is discredited by other witnesses proving their absence at the crime scene, as crucial in preventing miscarriages of justice. Sinners, including thieves and violent individuals, are disqualified from being witnesses based on biblical verses and Rabbinic decree. A husband can divorce his wife with a written document to prevent false claims, as stated in Deuteronomy 24:1. Pursuit of wisdom, property, and Torah is emphasized in Midrash texts, warning against robbery and highlighting the importance of righteous actions. Women are not allowed to testify in court according to Talmud, and witnesses must stand while testifying. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan comment on false witnesses in Deuteronomy 19:16. 

|וְעָמְד֧וּ שְׁנֵֽי־הָאֲנָשִׁ֛ים אֲשֶׁר־לָהֶ֥ם הָרִ֖יב לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה לִפְנֵ֤י הַכֹּֽהֲנִים֙ וְהַשֹּׁ֣פְטִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִהְי֖וּ בַּיָּמִ֥ים הָהֵֽם׃|17|the two parties to the dispute shall appear before יהוה, before the priests or magistrates in authority at the time,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of standing before God during testimonies, the need for witnesses and litigants to stand during legal proceedings, the privileges and exemptions of Torah sages, the prohibition of flattery towards rulers during judgment, the declaration of belief in God as creator after prayer, the mitzvah of defending the poor, and the credibility of witnesses in legal matters. The Talmud discusses the requirement for witnesses to stand while testifying, the importance of equality and respect in legal proceedings, and the need for both parties to be heard before a decision is made. 

|וְדָרְשׁ֥וּ הַשֹּׁפְטִ֖ים הֵיטֵ֑ב וְהִנֵּ֤ה עֵֽד־שֶׁ֙קֶר֙ הָעֵ֔ד שֶׁ֖קֶר עָנָ֥ה בְאָחִֽיו׃|18|and the magistrates shall make a thorough investigation. If the one who testified is a false witness, having testified falsely against a fellow Israelite,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text explains the process of identifying false witnesses in court, where a second pair of witnesses contradicting the first pair by proving an alibi results in the first pair being considered false witnesses and subject to the same punishment intended for the accused. The Torah requires evidence that the witnesses could not have witnessed the alleged crime, rather than incontrovertible proof of falsehood, to ensure accountability for deceit. The importance of speaking the truth as a commandment from God is emphasized, with references to various verses. In Mishnah Makkot, witnesses are only considered conspiring witnesses if impeached by another set of witnesses, not just their testimony, and diligent inquiry is required in cases of plotting witnesses to determine the truth. 

|וַעֲשִׂ֣יתֶם ל֔וֹ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר זָמַ֖ם לַעֲשׂ֣וֹת לְאָחִ֑יו וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֥ הָרָ֖ע מִקִּרְבֶּֽךָ׃|19|you shall do to the one as the one schemed to do to the other. Thus you will sweep out evil from your midst;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

False witnesses who conspire against an innocent person are punished according to their intentions, with the punishment being equal to the crime they sought to inflict, whether it be death, stripes, or payment of money (Halakhah, Mishnah, Jewish Thought). The Torah decrees that conspiring witnesses must be punished, either through lashes or financial restitution, and they are not executed if the accused has already been put to death based on their false testimony (Guides, Talmud). The punishment for plotting witnesses is seen as a divine decree, with the judges relying on the Holy Spirit to ensure justice is served (Commentary). 

|וְהַנִּשְׁאָרִ֖ים יִשְׁמְע֣וּ וְיִרָ֑אוּ וְלֹֽא־יֹסִ֨פוּ לַעֲשׂ֜וֹת ע֗וֹד כַּדָּבָ֥ר הָרָ֛ע הַזֶּ֖ה בְּקִרְבֶּֽךָ׃|20|others will hear and be afraid, and such evil things will not again be done in your midst.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The law requires a public announcement for lying witnesses, as stated in Deuteronomy 19:20, to warn qualified witnesses and deter others from committing similar crimes. The punishment of false witnesses serves as a deterrent and reminder for the community to act with care when submitting testimony. The radiance of specific lights in the Sefirot chain down from Keter to Malchut, showing how attributes like judgment ultimately stem from kindness and serve to deter sin. The execution of the stubborn and rebellious son in Deuteronomy 21:18 serves as a deterrent and benefit to others, similar to other cases like rebellious elders and plotting witnesses. The Talmud discusses the need for a proclamation to inform the public about condemned transgressors, emphasizing the warning against continuing sinful conduct. The Targum states that witnessing punishment for evil deeds will deter others from committing similar acts. 

|וְלֹ֥א תָח֖וֹס עֵינֶ֑ךָ נֶ֣פֶשׁ בְּנֶ֗פֶשׁ עַ֤יִן בְּעַ֙יִן֙ שֵׁ֣ן בְּשֵׁ֔ן יָ֥ד בְּיָ֖ד רֶ֥גֶל בְּרָֽגֶל׃|21|Nor must you show pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries on Deuteronomy 19:15-21 explain the concept of "eye for eye" as referring to monetary compensation, warn against showing pity to false witnesses, emphasize the need for justice to be served, and link the phrase to retribution. The Babylonian Talmud discusses the importance of multiple witnesses in establishing guilt and the consequences for false witnesses. Mishneh Torah prohibits showing pity in judgments concerning fines, while Sefer HaChinukh emphasizes not showing pity to those who intentionally harm others. R. Yehudah interprets "you shall have no pity" as indicating monetary compensation, and the Mishnah states that conspiring witnesses are executed only after the accused's verdict is concluded. The Targum emphasizes that justice should be served without compassion, with punishments equivalent to the harm caused.

## Deuteronomy 20

|כִּֽי־תֵצֵ֨א לַמִּלְחָמָ֜ה עַל־אֹיְבֶ֗ךָ וְֽרָאִ֜יתָ ס֤וּס וָרֶ֙כֶב֙ עַ֚ם רַ֣ב מִמְּךָ֔ לֹ֥א תִירָ֖א מֵהֶ֑ם כִּֽי־יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ עִמָּ֔ךְ הַמַּֽעַלְךָ֖ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|1|When you [an Israelite warrior] take the field against your enemies, and see horses and chariots—forces larger than yours—have no fear of them, for your God יהוה, who brought you from the land of Egypt, is with you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the symbolism of war horses and chariots in facing enemies, emphasizing the need to rely on God's help in battle. The Guides mention the encouragement to not fear enemies in battle and exemptions from fighting for certain individuals. The Midrash highlights the importance of relying on God in times of war and executing justice before battle. The Mishnah discusses cases where women are permitted to their yevamin but forbidden to their husbands. Musar emphasizes the pursuit of peace even with foes and trust in God during challenges. Quoting Commentary explains the use of trumpets in obligatory wars and the perception of enemies as insignificant. Second Temple texts discuss the symbolism of enemies in war representing unruly thoughts. The Talmud discusses the requirements for an unintentional murderer to remain in a city of refuge until the death of the High Priest. Targum emphasizes the need to not fear when facing a stronger enemy in battle. 

|וְהָיָ֕ה כְּקָֽרׇבְכֶ֖ם אֶל־הַמִּלְחָמָ֑ה וְנִגַּ֥שׁ הַכֹּהֵ֖ן וְדִבֶּ֥ר אֶל־הָעָֽם׃|2|Before you join battle, the priest shall come forward and address the troops.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The priest anointed for war speaks to the people in Hebrew before battle, reciting verses and words of encouragement, instilling confidence and divine support in the soldiers while emphasizing spiritual preparedness over military strategy. The priest's role is crucial in preparing the army for battle, ensuring their readiness and commitment to the cause, as seen in various biblical examples and Mishnah regulations. 

|וְאָמַ֤ר אֲלֵהֶם֙ שְׁמַ֣ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אַתֶּ֨ם קְרֵבִ֥ים הַיּ֛וֹם לַמִּלְחָמָ֖ה עַל־אֹיְבֵיכֶ֑ם אַל־יֵרַ֣ךְ לְבַבְכֶ֗ם אַל־תִּֽירְא֧וּ וְאַֽל־תַּחְפְּז֛וּ וְאַל־תַּֽעַרְצ֖וּ מִפְּנֵיהֶֽם׃|3|He shall say to them, “Hear, O Israel! You are about to join battle with your enemy. Let not your courage falter. Do not be in fear, or in panic, or in dread of them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of recognizing Hashem's Oneness and having faith in Him before battle, with even reciting "Shema Yisrael" being enough merit to save us. Commentary from Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and others stresses the significance of not fearing or panicking during warfare, while Halakhah mandates soldiers not to be afraid or run away from enemies. The priest anointed for war in the Talmud warns against fighting against brothers and reassures the people that God will be with them in battle, emphasizing the use of Hebrew language for conveying seriousness and holiness. Tanakh recounts the treatment of captives in battle, while Targum emphasizes the importance of not being faint-hearted or panicked when facing enemies. 

|כִּ֚י יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֔ם הַהֹלֵ֖ךְ עִמָּכֶ֑ם לְהִלָּחֵ֥ם לָכֶ֛ם עִם־אֹיְבֵיכֶ֖ם לְהוֹשִׁ֥יעַ אֶתְכֶֽם׃|4|For it is your God יהוה who marches with you to do battle for you against your enemy, to bring you victory.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries, halakhic guidelines, liturgical prayers, Midrashic teachings, Mishnaic laws, Talmudic discussions, Targum interpretations, and Tosefta readings emphasize the importance of relying on God's strength in battle, with the presence of the sacred ark symbolizing divine protection and victory. Specific guidelines are given for exemptions from combat, encouraging soldiers not to be afraid, and reciting verses to inspire courage before engaging in war. The text also highlights the significance of the priest anointed for war, the role of Phinehas as the chaplain of the army, and the ultimate salvation and victory provided by God in battle. 

|וְדִבְּר֣וּ הַשֹּֽׁטְרִים֮ אֶל־הָעָ֣ם לֵאמֹר֒ מִֽי־הָאִ֞ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֨ר בָּנָ֤ה בַֽיִת־חָדָשׁ֙ וְלֹ֣א חֲנָכ֔וֹ יֵלֵ֖ךְ וְיָשֹׁ֣ב לְבֵית֑וֹ פֶּן־יָמוּת֙ בַּמִּלְחָמָ֔ה וְאִ֥ישׁ אַחֵ֖ר יַחְנְכֶֽנּוּ׃|5|Then the officials shall address the troops, as follows: “Is there anyone who has built a new house but has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his home, lest he die in battle and another dedicate it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the concept of Chinukh as introducing someone to a particular occupation, not applicable in all contexts of beginning, as seen in biblical verses and examples from the Gemara and Sanhedrin. The Torah exempts soldiers who have built new houses but not yet lived in them from battle to prevent distractions and maintain morale, with priests anointed for war addressing the nation and releasing men from combat under certain circumstances. The text discusses the commandment to anoint a priest for war, the order of priorities for sensible men in establishing occupation, marriage, and housing, and the distinctions between milhemet mizvah and milhemet reshut in Jewish law. The Torah emphasizes the importance of building a house, planting a vineyard, and marrying a wife in that order, with exemptions and rules applying to different scenarios, and discussions on invoking a specific name of G-d to counteract fears when traveling. The Talmud delves into the rules regarding who should speak to the people before battle, exemptions related to owning a house, and the obligations and exemptions based on the size and type of house. The Tosefta discusses instances where a priest speaks to soldiers at the border and regarding war regulations, with exemptions for soldiers who have built new houses but not yet inaugurated them, adding that new additions to the house also warrant returning home. 

|וּמִֽי־הָאִ֞ישׁ אֲשֶׁר־נָטַ֥ע כֶּ֙רֶם֙ וְלֹ֣א חִלְּל֔וֹ יֵלֵ֖ךְ וְיָשֹׁ֣ב לְבֵית֑וֹ פֶּן־יָמוּת֙ בַּמִּלְחָמָ֔ה וְאִ֥ישׁ אַחֵ֖ר יְחַלְּלֶֽנּוּ׃|6|Is there anyone who has planted a vineyard but has never harvested it? Let him go back to his home, lest he die in battle and another harvest it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators interpret the requirement to not eat the fruit of a vineyard until the fourth year after planting differently, with some focusing on the redemption of the fruit, the celebration of the harvest, or the owner's enjoyment. Mishneh Torah advises establishing an occupation, purchasing a house, and marrying a wife in that order, while the Talmud emphasizes building a house, planting a vineyard, and marrying a wife. Exemptions from battle are discussed based on planting vineyards or orchards, with specific guidelines on behavior and duties for soldiers. The Tosefta clarifies that someone who plants a vineyard or five fruit trees can return home without deconsecrating them, with differing opinions on the application of the verse. 

|וּמִֽי־הָאִ֞ישׁ אֲשֶׁר־אֵרַ֤שׂ אִשָּׁה֙ וְלֹ֣א לְקָחָ֔הּ יֵלֵ֖ךְ וְיָשֹׁ֣ב לְבֵית֑וֹ פֶּן־יָמוּת֙ בַּמִּלְחָמָ֔ה וְאִ֥ישׁ אַחֵ֖ר יִקָּחֶֽנָּה׃|7|Is there anyone who has paid the bride-price for a wife,  but who has not yet taken her [into his household]? Let him go back to his home, lest he die in battle and another take her [into his household as his wife].”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah exempts a man betrothed but not married from going to war as his time to die has not come, with disagreement on the interpretation of terms; preparation for marriage includes learning a trade and following a specific order outlined in the Torah; the text emphasizes the concept of free will, maturity before marriage, and God's incomprehensible knowledge; the officers were instructed to allow those who built a house, planted a vineyard, or betrothed a wife to return home before battle, with specific exemptions and consequences discussed in various texts. 

|וְיָסְפ֣וּ הַשֹּׁטְרִים֮ לְדַבֵּ֣ר אֶל־הָעָם֒ וְאָמְר֗וּ מִי־הָאִ֤ישׁ הַיָּרֵא֙ וְרַ֣ךְ הַלֵּבָ֔ב יֵלֵ֖ךְ וְיָשֹׁ֣ב לְבֵית֑וֹ וְלֹ֥א יִמַּ֛ס אֶת־לְבַ֥ב אֶחָ֖יו כִּלְבָבֽוֹ׃|8|The officials shall go on addressing the troops and say, “Is there anyone afraid and disheartened? Let him go back to his home, lest the courage of his comrades flag like his.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the impact of fear due to sins on one's ability to go to battle, contrasting forgiveness and true repentance. The commentary on Deuteronomy 20:8 discusses the reasons for exemption from battle, including concerns about personal matters like building a house or betrothing a wife. Halakhah details the procedures for preparing for war and emphasizes the importance of not showing fear in battle. Jewish Thought delves into the moral implications of various biblical stories, emphasizing the importance of protecting the weak and following God's teachings. The Talmud and Mishnah discuss the roles of priests and officers in addressing the army before battle and the criteria for returning from battle, including fearfulness and sins. Tanakh recounts Gideon's reduction of troops based on fear and timidity, while Targum and Tosefta discuss the conditions under which soldiers are exempt from battle, including fear of sin and personal circumstances. 

|וְהָיָ֛ה כְּכַלֹּ֥ת הַשֹּׁטְרִ֖ים לְדַבֵּ֣ר אֶל־הָעָ֑ם וּפָ֥קְד֛וּ שָׂרֵ֥י צְבָא֖וֹת בְּרֹ֥אשׁ הָעָֽם׃|9|When the officials have finished addressing the troops, army commanders shall assume command of the troops.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah commands the appointment of captains of hosts to lead the troops in battle, with guards to prevent desertion and ensure focus, highlighting the importance of leaders and preparation for G-d's intervention. In times of mandatory war, all must go out to battle, even newlyweds, with exemptions for elective wars. The Mishnah discusses the appointment of captains of legions and guards to prevent fleeing, with specific rules and procedures outlined for military orders during times of war. The Talmud addresses rituals and declarations to be said in the holy language, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling obligations, even for newlyweds. After officers speak to the people, army commanders are appointed to lead the troops. 

|כִּֽי־תִקְרַ֣ב אֶל־עִ֔יר לְהִלָּחֵ֖ם עָלֶ֑יהָ וְקָרָ֥אתָ אֵלֶ֖יהָ לְשָׁלֽוֹם׃|10|When you approach a town to attack it, you shall offer it terms of peace.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the requirement to offer peace before waging war on a city, even in the case of the seven nations of Canaan, with terms of tribute and service, while highlighting the distinction between permissible and obligatory wars. The Torah allows for voluntary wars under prescribed laws, with peace terms required before waging war, except with Ammon and Moav. The importance of seeking peace even in times of war is emphasized in various Jewish commentaries, highlighting the power and significance of peace in Jewish tradition. Ramban, Gur Aryeh, Tur HaArokh, Rabbeinu Bahya, Or HaChaim, and Chizkuni provide insights into the laws of war and the exceptions to offering peace before battle. R. Jose the Galilean and Talmud emphasize the importance of peace, even in times of conflict, and Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Deuteronomy 20:10 as instructing to offer peace before engaging in battle. 

|וְהָיָה֙ אִם־שָׁל֣וֹם תַּֽעַנְךָ֔ וּפָתְחָ֖ה לָ֑ךְ וְהָיָ֞ה כׇּל־הָעָ֣ם הַנִּמְצָא־בָ֗הּ יִהְי֥וּ לְךָ֛ לָמַ֖ס וַעֲבָדֽוּךָ׃|11|If it responds peaceably and lets you in, all the people present there shall serve you at forced labor.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban explains that surrendering nations must accept tribute and servitude, as seen in the Gibeonite incident. The king is entitled to propose settlements, and war should only be waged after offering peace. During wartime, values become perverted, emphasizing the need for peace. Moses made three requests to God, which were all granted. Tosafot discusses the sanctity of God's name in upholding vows, using the Gibeonites as an example. If a city responds with peace, its people will become tribute payers and servants. 

|וְאִם־לֹ֤א תַשְׁלִים֙ עִמָּ֔ךְ וְעָשְׂתָ֥ה עִמְּךָ֖ מִלְחָמָ֑ה וְצַרְתָּ֖ עָלֶֽיהָ׃|12|If it does not surrender to you, but would join battle with you, you shall lay siege to it;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Siftei Chakhamim, and Steinsaltz agree that if a nation refuses peace and goes to war, besieging it is justified. Positive Commandment 190:1 from Sefer HaMitzvot details the rules for optional wars against other nations, including the treatment of those who refuse peace. The Torah emphasizes ethical conduct in warfare, addressing impurity, treatment of prisoners, and prohibitions against certain actions. Rabbi Levi highlights instances where God agreed with Moses, including offering peace to a town. Peace is considered a high quality in Musar, with examples from Abraham, Sarah, Joseph, his brothers, and David and Saul. Ibn Ezra interprets specific phrases in Isaiah to emphasize the importance of peace. In Zechariah 9:10, it is prophesied that the ruler will bring peace and banish weapons. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan agree that a city that refuses peace should be besieged. 

|וּנְתָנָ֛הּ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ בְּיָדֶ֑ךָ וְהִכִּיתָ֥ אֶת־כׇּל־זְכוּרָ֖הּ לְפִי־חָֽרֶב׃|13|and when your God יהוה delivers it into your hand, you shall put all its males to the sword.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that following prescribed actions will lead to victory, while Steinsaltz clarifies that killing male inhabitants is permitted as they are considered enemies. The text warns against adding or subtracting from commandments and states that a prophet may not innovate new commandments. The Jerusalem Talmud discusses the punishment for sorcery, with different rabbis arguing for stoning or beheading based on interpretations of verses. In Deuteronomy 20:13, both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that God will deliver the enemy into the hands of the Israelites, who are instructed to kill all the males with the sword. 

|רַ֣ק הַ֠נָּשִׁ֠ים וְהַטַּ֨ף וְהַבְּהֵמָ֜ה וְכֹל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִהְיֶ֥ה בָעִ֛יר כׇּל־שְׁלָלָ֖הּ תָּבֹ֣ז לָ֑ךְ וְאָֽכַלְתָּ֙ אֶת־שְׁלַ֣ל אֹיְבֶ֔יךָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֛ן יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לָֽךְ׃|14|You may, however, take as your booty the women, the children, the livestock, and everything in the town—all its spoil—and enjoy the use of the spoil of your enemy, which your God יהוה gives you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi clarifies that "the little ones" refers to male children, while Steinsaltz explains that women and children can be taken as plunder in war. Halakhah dictates that in war, all males past majority should be killed, but women and children should not be harmed unless the seven nations or Amalek refuse a peaceful settlement. The Midrash discusses the selection of Israel for the Torah, the conquest of Jericho, and the punishment of Achan. Various commentators, such as Sforno and Rambam, discuss the consumption of enemies' possessions in war and the purification of captured loot. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that in conquest, Israelites are allowed to take women, children, and spoils as plunder. 

|כֵּ֤ן תַּעֲשֶׂה֙ לְכׇל־הֶ֣עָרִ֔ים הָרְחֹקֹ֥ת מִמְּךָ֖ מְאֹ֑ד אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹא־מֵעָרֵ֥י הַגּֽוֹיִם־הָאֵ֖לֶּה הֵֽנָּה׃|15|Thus you shall deal with all towns that lie very far from you, towns that do not belong to nations hereabout.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz explain that those "very far off" are not part of the seven nations and are distant from the Land of Israel. Halakhah dictates that war should be waged against nations that refuse peaceful settlements or the seven mitzvot, sparing women and children in some cases but not for the seven nations or Amalek. In the Midrash, Joshua allowed nations to leave, make peace, or wage war, resulting in different outcomes. Ramban states that peace must be offered before war in both permissible and obligatory wars, with different terms for distant cities and the seven nations. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan agree that the same treatment should be applied to all cities far away and not part of the seven nations. 

|רַ֗ק מֵעָרֵ֤י הָֽעַמִּים֙ הָאֵ֔לֶּה אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לְךָ֖ נַחֲלָ֑ה לֹ֥א תְחַיֶּ֖ה כׇּל־נְשָׁמָֽה׃|16|In the towns of the latter peoples, however, which your God יהוה is giving you as a heritage, you shall not let a soul remain alive.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Rashi interprets the eruptive plague on a house in Leviticus as a sign of buried treasures being revealed, symbolizing the elevation of fallen sparks to serve the Creator. In Commentary, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Rav Hirsch, Steinsaltz, and Chizkuni provide different perspectives on the treatment of the Canaanite nations, with varying opinions on peace, expulsion, and exceptions to the commandment to kill all people from these nations. Halakhah outlines the commandment to annihilate all members of the seven Canaanite nations, emphasizing the positive and negative aspects of this commandment. In Jewish Thought, idolatry, the commandment of karet, and the annihilation of the seven nations are discussed as ways to remove obstacles to the knowledge of God. In Musar, the connection between exterminating the Canaanite nations and the sanctity of the Holy Land is highlighted, with a focus on spiritual symbolism and the balance of negative forces. Lastly, the Talmud presents various opinions on the treatment of Canaanites, witches, and executions, while Tanakh and Targum provide scriptural references emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands regarding the Canaanites. 

|כִּֽי־הַחֲרֵ֣ם תַּחֲרִימֵ֗ם הַחִתִּ֤י וְהָאֱמֹרִי֙ הַכְּנַעֲנִ֣י וְהַפְּרִזִּ֔י הַחִוִּ֖י וְהַיְבוּסִ֑י כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוְּךָ֖ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|17|No, you must proscribe  them—the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites—as your God יהוה has commanded you,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The command to destroy the nations in Canaan, including the Girgashites, is for the security of the Israelites and allows them to keep the belongings of the conquered nations. The obligation to wage war, even at the risk of life, cannot be set aside, emphasizing the importance of peace and mercy. Various commentaries discuss the legal status of certain nations and the call for peace in both permissible and obligatory wars. In the Talmud, the Gibeonites were excluded from the Jewish marriage pool, and idols captured in wars could become permitted over time. Leviticus 27:29 states that anyone dedicated for destruction cannot be redeemed. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan command the complete destruction of the nations in Canaan, while Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon have differing views on where the Torah was written. 

|לְמַ֗עַן אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא־יְלַמְּד֤וּ אֶתְכֶם֙ לַעֲשׂ֔וֹת כְּכֹל֙ תּֽוֹעֲבֹתָ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשׂ֖וּ לֵאלֹֽהֵיהֶ֑ם וַחֲטָאתֶ֖ם לַיהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶֽם׃|18|lest they lead you into doing all the abhorrent things that they have done for their gods and you stand guilty before your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentaries on Deuteronomy 20:18 warn against allowing former inhabitants to remain in the land to prevent them from leading the Israelites to sin. The importance of following Torah commandments, such as consecrating firstborns and not dwelling with certain nations, is emphasized, with consequences for not doing so. The Talmud discusses the destruction of gentiles in Eretz Yisrael unless they repented, while the Targum warns against idol worship. Rabbi Shimon believes the Torah was written for gentiles to understand the consequences of not repenting. 

|כִּֽי־תָצ֣וּר אֶל־עִיר֩ יָמִ֨ים רַבִּ֜ים לְֽהִלָּחֵ֧ם עָלֶ֣יהָ לְתׇפְשָׂ֗הּ לֹֽא־תַשְׁחִ֤ית אֶת־עֵצָהּ֙ לִנְדֹּ֤חַ עָלָיו֙ גַּרְזֶ֔ן כִּ֚י מִמֶּ֣נּוּ תֹאכֵ֔ל וְאֹת֖וֹ לֹ֣א תִכְרֹ֑ת כִּ֤י הָֽאָדָם֙ עֵ֣ץ הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה לָבֹ֥א מִפָּנֶ֖יךָ בַּמָּצֽוֹר׃|19|When in your war against a city you have to besiege it a long time in order to capture it, you must not destroy its trees, wielding the ax against them. You may eat of them, but you must not cut them down. Are trees of the field human to withdraw before you into the besieged city?|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the significance of the month of Elul for rectifying the covenant and finding a wife, while Tu BiShevat symbolizes the connection between upper and lower realms. Halakhah prohibits wanton destruction, including cutting down fruit trees, and extends to other forms of destruction. Kabbalah discusses the connection between Talmidei Chachamim and the Tree of Life, while Midrash highlights the importance of not destroying trees during war. Musar emphasizes the ongoing battle against the evil urge and the importance of repentance, prayer, and charity. The Talmud discusses scenarios where actions like tearing clothes or cutting down trees may violate the prohibition against destruction, while Targum emphasizes the value of trees as a source of sustenance. 

|רַ֞ק עֵ֣ץ אֲשֶׁר־תֵּדַ֗ע כִּֽי־לֹא־עֵ֤ץ מַאֲכָל֙ ה֔וּא אֹת֥וֹ תַשְׁחִ֖ית וְכָרָ֑תָּ וּבָנִ֣יתָ מָצ֗וֹר עַל־הָעִיר֙ אֲשֶׁר־הִ֨וא עֹשָׂ֧ה עִמְּךָ֛ מִלְחָמָ֖ה עַ֥ד רִדְתָּֽהּ׃|20|Only trees that you know do not yield food may be destroyed; you may cut them down for constructing siegeworks against the city that is waging war on you, until it has been reduced.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the rules of war, including the permission to destroy non-fruit-bearing trees during a siege, the importance of protecting fruit trees, and the adaptation of Jewish law to changing circumstances. It also addresses specific scenarios, such as the treatment of women in sieged cities and the significance of avoiding slander and being mindful of food consumption. The prohibition against cutting down fruit trees during a siege is seen as a temporary suspension of Torah law in cases of great need.

## Deuteronomy 21

|כִּי־יִמָּצֵ֣א חָלָ֗ל בָּאֲדָמָה֙ אֲשֶׁר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ נֹתֵ֤ן לְךָ֙ לְרִשְׁתָּ֔הּ נֹפֵ֖ל בַּשָּׂדֶ֑ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖ע מִ֥י הִכָּֽהוּ׃|1|If, in the land that your God יהוה is assigning you to possess, someone slain is found lying in the open, the identity of the slayer not being known,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut likens desecration of Shabbat to loss of one's first wife, resulting in consequences [Likutei Moharan 277:4:2]. Commentary emphasizes justice and public accountability in murder cases, detailing the investigation process and ritual significance. Halakhah allows for one witness testimony in certain cases and uses circumstantial evidence for justice. Mishnah specifies conditions for rituals, including heifer's neck breaking. Talmud discusses procedures for unsolved murders and exclusion of Jerusalem from ritual participation. 

|וְיָצְא֥וּ זְקֵנֶ֖יךָ וְשֹׁפְטֶ֑יךָ וּמָדְדוּ֙ אֶל־הֶ֣עָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֖ר סְבִיבֹ֥ת הֶחָלָֽל׃|2|your elders and magistrates shall go out and measure the distances from the corpse to the nearby towns.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In cases of unsolved murder, the elders of the High Court in Jerusalem must measure the distance to nearby cities to identify the closest one, with specific rituals prescribed by the Torah. The Mishnah and Talmud discuss the number of judges required for legal proceedings, the qualifications needed for judges, and the significance of their actions. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos mention that elders and judges are involved in measuring distances from a corpse to surrounding cities, while Tosefta highlights the seriousness of bloodshed and impurity in the Temple. 

|וְהָיָ֣ה הָעִ֔יר הַקְּרֹבָ֖ה אֶל־הֶחָלָ֑ל וְלָֽקְח֡וּ זִקְנֵי֩ הָעִ֨יר הַהִ֜וא עֶגְלַ֣ת בָּקָ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־עֻבַּד֙ בָּ֔הּ אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־מָשְׁכָ֖ה בְּעֹֽל׃|3|The elders of the town nearest to the corpse shall then take a heifer which has never been worked, which has never pulled in a yoke;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The red heifer used in the ritual must be free of physical blemishes and have never performed any work, including carrying a yoke, with the elders of the closest city responsible for selecting a calf that meets these criteria. The law of restoring lost property and breaking the neck of a heifer serve to uncover murderers and prevent cultivation until the culprit is found, promoting mutual respect and justice. The Mishnah clarifies specific procedures and exceptions for the red heifer ritual, while the Talmud discusses disqualifications for the animals based on labor and yoke-bearing, as well as the city selection process. 

|וְהוֹרִ֡דוּ זִקְנֵי֩ הָעִ֨יר הַהִ֤וא אֶת־הָֽעֶגְלָה֙ אֶל־נַ֣חַל אֵיתָ֔ן אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹא־יֵעָבֵ֥ד בּ֖וֹ וְלֹ֣א יִזָּרֵ֑עַ וְעָֽרְפוּ־שָׁ֥ם אֶת־הָעֶגְלָ֖ה בַּנָּֽחַל׃|4|and the elders of that town shall bring the heifer down to an everflowing wadi, which is not tilled or sown. There, in the wadi, they shall break the heifer’s neck.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries and texts discuss the ritual of breaking the neck of a heifer in the case of an unknown murderer, with different interpretations and implications. The Mishnah details specific laws regarding offerings and rituals, including prohibitions on deriving benefit from certain items and mixing forbidden items. The Talmud delves into laws related to the heifer's neck-breaking ceremony, Torah study, and moral lessons. In Genesis 15:9, God instructs Abraham to bring specific animals for sacrifice, while the Targum describes the process of taking the calf to a stony valley for decapitation. The Tosefta distinguishes between the red heifer and the heifer whose neck is broken in terms of validity for sacrifice. 

|וְנִגְּשׁ֣וּ הַכֹּהֲנִים֮ בְּנֵ֣י לֵוִי֒ כִּ֣י בָ֗ם בָּחַ֞ר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ לְשָׁ֣רְת֔וֹ וּלְבָרֵ֖ךְ בְּשֵׁ֣ם יְהֹוָ֑ה וְעַל־פִּיהֶ֥ם יִהְיֶ֖ה כׇּל־רִ֥יב וְכׇל־נָֽגַע׃|5|The priests, sons of Levi, shall come forward; for your God יהוה has chosen them for divine service and to pronounce blessing in the name of יהוה, and every lawsuit and case of assault  is subject to their ruling.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The involvement of priests, specifically the sons of Levi, is crucial in cases of innocent bloodshed, as they are responsible for performing rituals for atonement and blessing, investigating murders, and pronouncing rulings on matters of purity and disputes. Priests must rely on sages to declare individuals pure or impure based on blemishes, with specific laws prohibiting certain attire and grooming practices. The Talmud employs the "hekesh" analogy method to interpret texts, emphasizing the importance of appointing judges and officers for fair judgment. Kabbalistic teachings connect oil and wine to different aspects of thought and judgment, while the Midrash highlights the role of priests in serving and pronouncing rulings. The Mishnah details the procedures for priests in purifying a city from murder, emphasizing the priestly attribute of Chesed. 

|וְכֹ֗ל זִקְנֵי֙ הָעִ֣יר הַהִ֔וא הַקְּרֹבִ֖ים אֶל־הֶחָלָ֑ל יִרְחֲצוּ֙ אֶת־יְדֵיהֶ֔ם עַל־הָעֶגְלָ֖ה הָעֲרוּפָ֥ה בַנָּֽחַל׃|6|Then all the elders of the town nearest to the corpse shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the wadi.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, washing in the Holy Temple symbolizes removing personal motives and aligning actions with God's will, as seen in the washing of the Cohanim. The elders of the city wash their hands to show innocence in Deuteronomy 21:6. The requirement for elders to wash their hands before a ritual sacrifice applies to all elders in the city, even if there are a hundred of them. In Mishnah Sotah 9:6, the Elders wash their hands and declare innocence in the case of a murdered victim. Joseph informed his brothers of religious subjects by mentioning the Heifer with the broken neck. Second Temple laws emphasized acts of kindness and care for others. The Talmud discusses specific verses related to the heifer whose neck is broken and the removal of ashes. In Targum, the elders wash their hands over the beheaded calf. Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yosei clarify the types of animals used for atonement in Tosefta. 

|וְעָנ֖וּ וְאָמְר֑וּ יָדֵ֗ינוּ לֹ֤א אֶת־הַדָּ֣ם הַזֶּ֔ה וְעֵינֵ֖ינוּ לֹ֥א רָאֽוּ׃|7|And they shall make this declaration: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The elders and priests declare their innocence in the murder case, emphasizing their fulfillment of duties as hosts to any passing guests. The rituals surrounding the murder case underscore the importance of providing for guests and ensuring their safety. The Talmud teaches the sequence of building a house, planting a vineyard, and getting married, along with the actions of the elders and priests in cases of murder. The Akeidat Yitzchak emphasizes presenting offerings thoughtfully and acknowledging God's role in providing abundance. The Mishnah details the procedures for the elders and priests in cases of an unsolved murder, while Musar discusses confession as a positive commandment for atonement. Rabbeinu Bahya explains the significance of bringing bikkurim in a basket, and the Talmud clarifies the actions and responsibilities of the court and individuals in cases of murder. The Targums emphasize the innocence of those involved in unsolved murder cases, and the Tosefta highlights the importance of individual statements in specific situations. 

|כַּפֵּר֩ לְעַמְּךָ֨ יִשְׂרָאֵ֤ל אֲשֶׁר־פָּדִ֙יתָ֙ יְהֹוָ֔ה וְאַל־תִּתֵּן֙ דָּ֣ם נָקִ֔י בְּקֶ֖רֶב עַמְּךָ֣ יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְנִכַּפֵּ֥ר לָהֶ֖ם הַדָּֽם׃|8|Absolve, יהוה, Your people Israel whom You redeemed, and do not let guilt for the blood of the innocent remain among Your people Israel.” And they will be absolved of bloodguilt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the concept of transgression and the need for God's salvation, highlighting the importance of relying on God for rectification. In Deuteronomy 21:8, various commentaries emphasize atonement for shedding blood, forgiveness after specific ceremonies, and divine judgment bringing about atonement. Halakhah details the decapitation of a calf for atonement, requirements for forgiveness, and the Yizkor memorial service. Midrash explores Abraham's inheritance of the land through atonement offerings, while Mishnah prescribes rituals for unsolved murder cases. Quoting Commentary connects the heifer ritual to sacrificial practices for atonement. Talmud discusses the prohibition of benefiting from the heifer and confession rituals during the ceremony. Targum highlights the kohanim asking for forgiveness and atonement through the heifer's blood. Tosefta emphasizes the importance of individual statements in various contexts. 

|וְאַתָּ֗ה תְּבַעֵ֛ר הַדָּ֥ם הַנָּקִ֖י מִקִּרְבֶּ֑ךָ כִּֽי־תַעֲשֶׂ֥ה הַיָּשָׁ֖ר בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|9|Thus you will remove from your midst guilt for the blood of the innocent, for you will be doing what is right in the sight of יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of proper judicial action to remove guilt for innocent blood, highlighting the necessity of punishing the guilty party rather than relying on divine intervention. It stresses the significance of doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord to prevent further shedding of innocent blood and promote peace. The mitzvah of eglah arufah symbolizes the community's responsibility for each other and the prevention of unjust punishment, while various texts from the Talmud discuss the prohibition of certain items and actions, such as the heifer whose neck is broken in a murder ritual. The Mishneh Torah discusses the obligation to follow the middle path in character traits, emulating God's good and just ways, and the appointment of a king is seen as a means of expedited administration during emergencies, allowing for the right to ignore certain Biblical laws.
