      "Rabbi Yehoshua validates offerings made by a priest later found to be disqualified due to flawed lineage, as God accepts the work of a priest's hands after the fact. The blessing of the tribe of Levi in Deuteronomy 33:11 is interpreted to include even the service of those deemed profane, and the priesthood is voided retroactively for those disqualified from Temple service. The work of a Levite is valid regardless of lineage, as all descendants of Levi are included. Bringing incense leads to wealth, as indicated by the blessing in Deuteronomy 33:11, and even those with physical limitations are encouraged to participate in Temple service.\n",

      "Benjamin, the tribe of Benjamin, was privileged to host the Divine Presence as the Temple was built in his territory, with the Holy of Holies located within his portion. This unique sanctity led Benjamin to desire to absorb the strip of land where the altar was built, causing a dispute with the tribe of Judah over ownership. The Divine Presence rested in the portion of Benjamin in various locations, including Shiloh, Nov, Gibeon, and the Eternal House. The Sages also noted that Benjamin, along with other select individuals, was exempt from the decay of worms after death. Benjamin's hosting of the Divine Presence was emphasized in various blessings and traditions, highlighting his special role in Jewish history and religious practice.\n",

Rabbi Yoḥanan cured his bulmos by eating ripe figs from the east side of a tree, as they ripen first there due to the sun. The Talmud also mentions that fruits grown in a place facing the sun are considered more precious.\n",
      "(33, 15)\n",
      "The Jerusalem Talmud discusses the location of sacred structures in the land of Benjamin, specifically mentioning the Tabernacle and Temple. It notes that although the Temple is associated with Judah, it was actually located in Benjamin, with the altar situated at the border between Benjamin and Joseph. The text also mentions the consumption of sacrificial meat in Joseph's part, emphasizing the importance of Joseph in the divine dwelling.\n",
      "(33, 16)\n",
      "Rabbi Yosei interprets Moses' blessing to Joseph as a reference to offerings of lesser sanctity being consumed among the haters near Shiloh, while the Jerusalem Talmud discusses the location of the Temple in Benjamin's territory and the consumption of sacral meat in Joseph's part. The text also mentions the altar being situated on the border between Benjamin and Joseph, with the Divine Presence dwelling in the greatness of Joseph.\n",

Bava Kamma 2b:4 explains the concept of goring using horns. Bava Kamma 17a:10 and 17a:11 discuss the rewards associated with Joseph and Issachar. Berakhot 56b:15 advises reciting a specific verse upon dreaming of an ox to prevent negative outcomes.\n",

      "Zebulun questioned why he received mountains and seas while his brothers received fields and vineyards, but God assured him that his territory would be valuable due to the ḥilazon and other resources found there. God promised that anyone who took these resources without permission would not prosper in their business.\n",

      "The Sages of the school of Rabbi Sheila emphasize that even someone who received the Torah directly from God like Moses will not be unpunished if they engage in sexual intercourse with an adulteress. It is considered disrespectful to God if one does not take three steps backward after prayer or recite \"Peace,\" with specific bowing gestures. The Torah scroll should be handled and rolled with specific care, with the right hand only, to show honor. The Torah was given with the right hand, and it is emphasized that studying the Torah for its own sake is crucial. The Torah was described as white fire engraved in black fire, a fiery law given by God. The Jewish people are compared to fire in their nature, and the Torah was given to them to humble and guide them. Rabbi Akiva avoided a mistake by interpreting a verse to understand God's uniqueness among angels. The Torah was given to the Jewish people, and the money of gentile nations appeared at that time. The nations cannot claim they were never offered the Torah, as references to its giving are found in different locations. The right hand is associated with the Torah, while the left hand is connected to phylacteries. Vengeance for good and evil is mentioned in verses, emphasizing divine justice. The right hand should not be used for certain actions due to its significance in Torah-related practices.\n",

      "Moses was buried in the portion of Gad, a distance of four miles from the portion of Reuben, and was carried by God Himself. The Torah study is not interrupted until the soul departs from a dying person, as seen when Rabbi Akiva continued teaching until his son's death, emphasizing the importance of honoring the dead. Moses is considered righteous for causing others to be righteous, while Jeroboam is blamed for causing others to sin. Moses is also associated with being the inscriber in the Torah.\n",

      "In the Jerusalem Talmud Sanhedrin 10:2:17, it is explained that Moses was instructed to appoint judges to execute sinners among the Israelites, resulting in 157,200 people being killed. When a man brought a Midianite woman before Moses, Phineas took action by killing them both with a spear, leading to six miracles occurring, including the prevention of the bodies separating, the spear going into the woman's belly, and the plague being stopped when Phineas prayed.\n",

      "Rebbi Tanḥum states four conditions for collecting grasses and relieving oneself, while Rebbi Aqiba identifies lakes in the land of Naftali. The cup of Grace should be full, decorated, and washed according to Rebbi Aḥa, and Rabbi Yoḥanan states that reciting a blessing over a full cup leads to a boundless inheritance. The tribe of Naphtali received additional land near the Sea of Tiberias for fishing, as mentioned in various texts.\n",

      "The Gemara discusses the tribal portion of Asher where oil flows abundantly, as seen when a gentile messenger was sent to bring one million maneh worth of oil. The text also delves into the number of nails permissible on shoes, with different opinions ranging from five to thirteen, and the rules regarding scraping, anointing, and walking in new boots or sandals on the Sabbath. Additionally, a homily on Ecclesiastes 12:11 emphasizes the importance of clear and sweet words in Torah study.\n",
      "(33, 25)\n",
      "It is forbidden to wear nail-studded work-boots on the Sabbath, but shoes decorated with nails are permitted. Different opinions exist on the number of nails that constitute a decoration, with Rebbi Hanina suggesting seven, Rebbi Aha suggesting nine, and Rebbi putting thirteen on one shoe and eleven on the other. It is permitted to put all nails on one sandal or boot. Scuffing old boots or sandals is prohibited, but oiling or dipping them in water is allowed. Anointing one's foot in a boot or sandal is not permitted, but oiling the foot before putting on footwear is allowed.\n",
      "(33, 26)\n",
      "In the Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 4:2:12, three scrolls were found in the Temple courtyard, with discrepancies in the text that were resolved by confirming two versions and annulling one. The Chagigah 12b:14 commentary discusses the heavenly beings and God's dwelling in the Aravot, connecting it to the concept of \"heaven\" through a verbal analogy.\n",
      "(33, 27)\n",
      "In Tractate Soferim 6:4, three Torah scrolls were found in the Temple court with variations in text, leading to the adoption of readings from two scrolls and discarding the reading from one. In Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 4:2:12, similar variations were found in three scrolls, leading to the same outcome. In Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:1:3, Rebbi Abba discusses the creation of the world from water to land. Jerusalem Talmud Makkot 3:13:2 discusses the theological significance of God's omnipresence. In Chagigah 12b:2, Rabbi Yosei discusses the elements the world stands upon. In Chullin 89a:9, it is suggested that the world endures in the merit of those who restrain themselves during quarrels and render themselves as if they were non-existent.\n",

      "Rava explains that when Israel dwells in wealth and prominence, their solitude will be one of safety, but if they reject God's directive and learn from gentiles, their solitude will be one of sorrow. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina states that Moses issued decrees for the Jewish people to reach a spiritual level like Jacob, but these were later revoked by prophets like Amos who pointed out their shortcomings.\n",
      "(33, 29)\n",
      "Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said delighting in Shabbat rescues from exile, citing Isaiah 58:14 and Deuteronomy 33:29. Rav said God grants desires to those who delight in Shabbat, citing Psalms 37:4. Delighting in Shabbat can be with simple items like beets and fish. In Megillah, Mordecai refuses to ride a horse prepared by Haman due to fasting, kicking him instead, citing Proverbs 24:17 and Deuteronomy 33:29. In Berakhot, verses from Deuteronomy emphasize the greatness and closeness of Israel to God.\n",
      "(33, 4)\n",
      "The Torah is compared to the betrothed bride of the Jewish people until one studies it and consummates his marriage with it, as stated in Deuteronomy 33:4 (Pesachim 49b:10, Berakhot 57a:4). Torah is considered an inheritance for the Jewish people, with 613 mitzvot corresponding to the number of a person's limbs, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 33:4 (Sanhedrin 59a:2, Makkot 23b:18). Withholding halakha from being studied is likened to robbing someone of their ancestral inheritance (Sanhedrin 91b:18). Torah is seen as a source of wisdom, understanding, and a place in the World-to-Come in various dream interpretations (Berakhot 57a:4).\n",
      "(33, 5)\n",
      "The Gemara discusses the requirement of ten verses for the Remembrances and Shofarot prayers on Rosh Hashanah, noting that there are only three verses related to Kingship in the Torah. Rabbi Yosei suggests including four verses, including the three related to Kingship and a concluding one.\n",
      "(33, 6)\n",
      "The Talmud discusses the connection between the blessings of Reuben and Judah in Moses' blessing of the tribes, linking them to the concept of resurrection of the dead. Reuben's blessing is interpreted as living in this world and not dying in the World-to-Come, while Judah's blessing is connected to the idea of awakening at the end of days. The text also mentions examples of declarations that take effect even if stated conditionally, such as Judah's request to take Benjamin to Egypt. Additionally, it discusses prayers for those who descended alive into the pit, with Moses and Hannah being mentioned as having prayed for them.\n",
      "(33, 7)\n",
      "Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani explains that the connection between the blessings of Reuben and Judah lies in the prayers of Moses, as Judah's confession led to Reuben's confession, ultimately granting Judah access to the heavenly study hall. Moses' prayers for Judah's understanding of Torah matters and ability to contend with adversaries were also answered, allowing Judah to join the other righteous people in Heaven. This is exemplified by the verse in Deuteronomy 33:7 where Judah's hands contend for him.\n",
      "(33, 9)\n",
      "Ravina discussed the tribe of Levi, specifically mentioning that some members engaged in idol worship and were killed by their relatives, as indicated in Deuteronomy 33:9. (Yoma 66b:16)\n",
      "(34, 1)\n",
      "Moses was physically strong until his death, able to ascend Mount Nebo in one step, and died in the portion of Reuben. The boundaries of Eretz Yisrael include any area shown to Moses before his death, as described in Deuteronomy 34:1-3.\n",

      "(34, 12)\n",
      "In Menachot 30a:3, the discussion is about finishing a Torah scroll in the middle of a column, with different opinions on where certain words may be written. In Tractate Soferim 9:7, specific rules are given regarding the size of certain Hebrew letters in the Torah. The Jerusalem Talmud Taanit 4:5:2 discusses the timeline of Moses receiving the Ten Commandments and breaking the tablets. Avot DeRabbi Natan 2:3 explains how Moses added an extra day of purity for the Israelites before receiving the Torah, and the subsequent actions he took were in accordance with God's will. In Avot DeRabbi Natan 2:7, the Writings are said to warn against heresy and the dangers of associating with wicked individuals or prostitutes.\n",
      "(34, 4)\n",
      "Rabbi Simlai taught that there are 613 mitzvot in the Torah, with 365 prohibitions corresponding to days in the solar year and 248 positive mitzvot to a person's limbs. Rebbi Zeïra in the Jerusalem Talmud prohibits relieving oneself in a cemetery, citing Proverbs 17:5. Rabbi Yonatan in the Talmud discusses how the dead converse with each other based on Deuteronomy 34:4.\n",
      "(34, 5)\n",
      "Moses died and was born on the seventh of Adar, with his death being compared to a divine kiss, just like Miriam's. Moses' greatness is emphasized through his ability to forge compromises between God and the Jewish people. There is a dispute over whether Moses wrote the entire Torah or only part of it, with some attributing the last eight verses to Joshua. Moses, Aaron, and Miriam were spared the Angel of Death, dying instead by the mouth of the Lord. Moses' soul was taken by God with a kiss and stored under the Throne of Glory, along with the souls of all the righteous. The Angel of Death could not find Moses after his soul was taken, as he was stored away for the World to Come.\n",
      "(34, 6)\n",
      "Moses was the only one involved in transporting Joseph's bones, indicating his greatness, and God Himself buried Moses, as seen in Deuteronomy. The location of Moses' grave remains unknown, fulfilling the verse in Deuteronomy. The attributes of God, such as clothing the naked and visiting the sick, should be emulated by humans. The Torah begins and ends with acts of kindness, as shown in Genesis and Deuteronomy. Joseph and Moses were both praised for their actions, with God ultimately being the greatest.\n",
      "(34, 7)\n",
      "Moses was physically strong despite the statement that he could no longer go out and come in, as evidenced by his ability to ascend Mount Nebo in one step. A nest found on a person's head is considered as being on the ground for the mitzva of sending away the mother bird, as indicated by the verse \"earth upon his head.\" The existence of Moses before his birth is alluded to in the Torah through the word \"beshaggam,\" which has the same numerical value as the name Moshe, and he lived a total of 120 years.\n",
      "(34, 8)\n",
      "Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi instructed to reconvene study sessions after thirty days of mourning, following the example of the mourning for Moses. The mourning period is derived from various biblical references, such as the mourning for Samuel, the anointing oil, and the days of isolation for the dead. The mourning for Aaron for thirty days was due to his fair judgments and ability to bring peace, leading to many children being named after him. Aaron's mourning was more intense than Moses', as Aaron's actions were seen as more impactful.\n",
      "(33, 3)\n",
      "Moses asked God to exempt Torah scholars from paying taxes and to allow them to be exclusively under His authority, as indicated in Deuteronomy 33:3. Torah scholars are described as those who travel extensively to study and discuss God's teachings.\n",
      "(34, 3)\n",
      "Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi believed the Temple would be rebuilt between Judah and Benjamin and wanted to prepare the fields of Jericho for this. The Kenites, descendants of Moses' father-in-law, ate the produce there. The descendants of Jethro were supported through charity until they went to Jabez to study Torah and became a people of God under the guidance of a righteous man named Jabez.\n",
      "(34, 9)\n",
      "Rava asked Rabba bar Mari about the saying that gratitude for wine should go to the one who pours it, which is derived from God transferring authority from Moses to Joshua. Even though Moses was just a conduit for God's spirit to Joshua, he received credit for it.\n"
