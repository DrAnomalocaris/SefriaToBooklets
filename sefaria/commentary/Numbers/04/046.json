This is why he speaks about עשות משפט, “the dispensing of justice,” in the infinitive. He does not speak about particular people dispensing justice but refers to the phenomenon which when observed inspires great joy. <br> Naturally, the joy which accompanies the performance of a commandment by an individual Jew is in a class by itself. Seeing that performance of the commandments is called עבודת ה', “serving the Lord,” we can understand what is written in Deut. 28,16 תחת אשר לא עבדת את ה' אלוקיך בשמחה, “on account of the fact that you did not perform the commandments of the Lord your G’d with joy, etc.” When David writes in Psalms 100,2 עבדו את ה' בשמחה, “serve the Lord with joy,” he does not refer to the offering of sacrificial animals but to the performance of each and every commandment which it is our duty to perform. Joy is the ingredient which makes service of the Lord something perfect. This concept helps us understand the unusual phrase in Numbers 4,46 לעבוד עבודת עבודה. Concerning this expression our sages in Erchin 11 ask what kind of service this is that the Torah speaks of there. The answer given in the Talmud is that the Torah speaks of offering songs and hymns. The Levites are commanded to offer songs and encourage expressions of joy to accompany the sacrificial offerings. All of this was to ensure that joy is the prevailing sentiment accompanying service of the Lord.<br> It is well known that the age of thirty is the age at which man is at the zenith of his physical power (Avot end of chapter 5). Beginning with the age of fifty our physical strength begins to decline. This is the reason that the years during which the Levites perform active service are between the ages of 30-50. How would he be able to offer song to G’d at a time when he feels that his physical strength is already beginning to ebb? This is also why we have been taught in Chulin 24 that although Levites who are afflicted with certain physical blemishes are not disqualified from performing their service, they are disqualified as soon as they are over fifty years of age. This is why the Torah writes in 8,25: “from fifty years of age he shall withdraw from the legion of work and no longer work.” This is also why the census of the Levites included the ones between the ages of 30-50 only.", "versionTitle": "Torah Commentary by Rabbi Bachya ben Asher, trans.

Therefore he was in doubt about the Levites and did not know what to do with them. And when he had finished all those who were counted of the people, and the Levites remained alone [uncounted], the Holy One, blessed be He, explained to him that he was not to count them <i>among the children of Israel</i> but that he should take their sum separately, for he was to <i>appoint</i> them <i>over the Tabernacle of the Testimony</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">87</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 50.</i><br>He stated <i>‘p’kod’</i> [<i>‘number’</i> — in the singular] <i>the children of Levi</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">88</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 3:15.</i> meaning that he [Moses] was to count them by himself without [the assistance of] the princes, and it was he [Moses] who called upon Aaron to be with him,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 39: <i>All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered</i> etc. Thus it is clear that Aaron also participated in the counting of the Levites.

See Note 93.</i> since he [Aaron] was the prince of that tribe, and just as the princes of Israel were [present] at [the counting of] their tribes, so was the prince of the Levites to be present when they were counted.

According to tradition, Moses divided the priests into eight Divisions, four from the families of Eleazar and four from Ithamar, and later on when the Sanctuary was built in Jerusalem, David and Samuel sub-divided them into twenty-four Divisions. Each Division served for a period of one week, and during the three Festivals all the Divisions were in attendance simultaneously (see “The Commandments” Vol. I, pp. 46-47). See also Ramban further, Verse 53, and at Note 96, for additional aspects of this term as used by Ramban. — It should be noted that the concept of <i>mishmaroth</i> applied also to the Levites and Israelites, for just as the priests were divided into twenty-four Divisions, so also were the other two groups. Each week a new <i>mishmar</i> of priests, Levites, and Israelites would arrive in Jerusalem to attend to the Divine Services in the Sanctuary. The Israelites’ function was to “stand by” the daily offerings brought for the whole congregation of Israel, for “how can a man’s offering be offered while he does not stand by it?” (Taanith 26a). Such a group of Israelites is referred to as a <i>ma’amad</i> (literally: “stand by”). In the text of Ramban before us, however, reference is only to the Divisions of the priests and Levites.</i> And Scripture repeats in another place, <i>These are they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites … whom Moses and Aaron numbered ‘according to the commandment of the Eternal’ by the hand of Moses</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 4:37. The verse seems to indicate that G-d had explicitly commanded Aaron’s presence at the census, which does not corroborate Ramban’s interpretation above. Ramban therefore explains that although there was no <i>explicit</i> command, there had been a hint, and <i>Moses</i> therefore, in asking Aaron to be present, was indeed acting <i>according to the command of the Eternal</i>.</i> Because He had already hinted through the dots [on the word <i>v’Aharon</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 39: <i>All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered</i> etc. Thus it is clear that Aaron also participated in the counting of the Levites.

The verse seems to indicate that G-d had explicitly commanded Aaron’s presence at the census, which does not corroborate Ramban’s interpretation above. Ramban therefore explains that although there was no <i>explicit</i> command, there had been a hint, and <i>Moses</i> therefore, in asking Aaron to be present, was indeed acting <i>according to the command of the Eternal</i>.</i> But the [presence of the] princes of the congregation [at the numbering of the Levites]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">91</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 4: 46.</i> was not obligatory, and Moses called them in order to show them respect, [therefore Scripture does not state that their presence was “according to the commandment of the Eternal”]. In Tractate Bechoroth<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">94</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Bechoroth 4a.</i> the Rabbis have said that the dots on the word <i>Aharon</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">89</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 39: <i>All that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered</i> etc. Thus it is clear that Aaron also participated in the counting of the Levites.

See Note 93.</i> are to hint that Aaron himself was not counted at all in the census of the Levites.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">95</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a marked difference on this point between the language of Rashi (see above Note 90) and that of Ramban. According to Rashi, the dots on the word <i>Aharon</i> indicate that “he was not in the census of the Levites,” which can be interpreted as saying that he did not participate in <i>counting</i> the people, and only Moses did it. Mizrachi in fact interprets Rashi in this way, since the verse [<i>whom Moses and Aaron counted</i>] refers to those who did the actual counting of the Levites, thus the dots on the word “Aaron” indicate that he did not participate in the counting — but he himself may well have <i>been counted</i>. Ramban’s language, however, clearly means that “Aaron himself <i>was not counted</i> at all in the census of the Levites.” This explains why Ramban does not quote this explanation of the Gemara in the name of Rashi, as he is wont to do, since his interpretation of the text of Bechoroth 4a is different than Rashi’s.</i>", "versionTitle": "Commentary on the Torah by Ramban (Nachmanides).

T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> Numbers commences with several lists that serve to arrange and catalog the Israelite camp in the wilderness: first, the “accountings” of the Israelites fit for battle; then, the symmetrical arrangement of the camp itself, around the Tabernacle; and finally, the special listing of the Levite population, accompanied by an enumeration of its special tasks in the camp. The first part of Numbers thus takes place as it were in the shadow of Mount Sinai—that is, under the aegis of the priestly school of thinking, in which order is everything.", "There is a strong military bent to the arrangement. The census of Chapter 1 is not a head count of the entire Israelite population, but rather of those “twenty years of age and upward,” those eligible to serve in the army. The setup of the camp resembles that in ancient Egypt, with the sanctuary and ark (here “Dwelling” and “coffer”) in the center (in the Egypt of Raamses II—thought by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus—it was the king’s throne). The Levites, whom we have not encountered previously as a group with tasks distinct from those of the priests, emerge in this part of the book as caretakers and perhaps guardians of the sanctuary, in addition to their tasks of dismantling and transport of the “Holy-Shrine.” This military aspect reflects an ancient concept of Israel as the “forces of Y<small>HWH</small>,” surely a conquest image, which later becomes standardized in language in the phrase usually rendered “the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”", "Some of the material in this section might well have been put elsewhere. Chapters 5–7 would have fit nicely in Leviticus; Chapter 7, the listing of the tribal gifts brought to the sanctuary upon its dedication, could even have followed Ex. 40, where Moshe completes the erection of the structure. That these chapters are here therefore must be the result of a conscious decision, either to include material that did not find its way into the other books, or out of a feeling that they were appropriately placed in the book about Israel’s wanderings in the wilderness."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account.

This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

The Rabbis say: It does not invalidate. Rabbi Elazar said: Rabbi Meir’s source is from this verse: “I have given the Levites, given [to Aaron and to his sons…to perform the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting], and to atone for the children of Israel…” (Numbers 8:19); just as lack of atonement<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One who fails to sprinkle the blood of the offering.</i> disqualifies, so, too, lack of song disqualifies. The Rabbis establish from that verse: Just as atonement is during the day, so, too, song is during the day. <br>Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Shmuel: From where in the Torah is the requirement of song derived? The verse states: “He shall serve in the name of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 18:7). What is the service that includes the name of the Lord? That is song. Rabbi Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: From here: “Take up [<i>se’u</i>] song, sound the timbrel; a pleasing lyre with a harp” (Psalms 81:3).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yitzḥak interprets <i>avodat masa </i>as referring to song. <i>Se'u </i>can mean lift up something, and it can mean lift up a voice.</i> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: “They will raise [<i>yisu</i>] their voices, they will sing, for the majesty of the Lord…” (Isaiah 24:14). It is taught: “But to the sons of Kehat he did not give, because the sacred service is upon them; they shall bear [<i>yisa’u</i>] on the shoulder” (Numbers 7:9). From the fact that it is stated: “On the shoulder,” do I not know that “they shall bear [<i>yisa’u</i>]”? Why does the verse state: “<i>Yisa’u</i>”? <i>Yisa’u </i>is nothing other than an expression of song. Likewise it says: “Take up [<i>se’u</i>] song, sound the timbrel…,” and it says: “They will raise [<i>yisu</i>] their voices, they will sing.” Ḥananya, the son of Rabbi Yehoshua’s brother said: From here:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is another source for the requirement of song.</i> “Moses would speak and God would answer him with a voice” (Exodus 19:19), regarding matters of voice.

That is song.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Song is sung as an accompaniment to the pouring of the libation of  a sacrifice.
