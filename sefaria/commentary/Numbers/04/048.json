The reason for this statement is that since Scripture said above <i>in the day that the Eternal spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">154</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 1.</i> it refers back and says [here] that the command for counting the Levites was not given in Mount Sinai; for only the choosing of the [four] children of Aaron [as priests] took place in Mount Sinai on the day that He commanded Moses about the making of the Tabernacle, but he was not given the command about the choosing of [all] the Levites [as ministers to the priests] at Mount Sinai, but <i>in the wilderness of Sinai</i> in the Tent of Meeting, just like the commandment mentioned [above] concerning [the counting of] the children of Israel [about which it is clearly stated that it was <i>in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 1:1.</i><br>Now the tribe of Levi was not like all the other tribes, for [even though they were counted] <i>from a month old and upward</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">155</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 15 here.</i> [unlike the other tribes who were counted only from the age of twenty years and over], they were still only <i>twenty and two thousand</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">156</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further. Verse 39.</i> and from thirty years old and over they were all together [only] <i>eight thousand</i> [<i>and five hundred and fourscore</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">157</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 4:48.</i> Thus, their number from twenty years old and over does not reach even a half of the [number of the] smallest of [the other] tribes of Israel!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">158</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The smallest tribe was that of Menasheh, which numbered — from the age of twenty and over — 32,200 (above, 1:35). Thus the Levites, who numbered 8000 men above the age of thirty, certainly do not reach half of the numbers of Menasheh, even after taking into consideration a few more thousand between the ages of twenty and thirty.</i> And they did not as yet carry the ark, [that we should say] that its holiness took a toll of them!<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">159</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to tradition, the carrying of the ark involved great risk. Any of the Kohathites who was unworthy of carrying it immediately suffered a punishment; so also anyone who attended to it with an unwilling heart (Bamidbar Rabbah 5:1). But, as Ramban points out, when this census of the Levites was taken, they were not yet carrying the ark, since they only journeyed from Mount Sinai on the twentieth of Iyar. So the question reappears, why were their numbers so few?</i> This is indeed astonishing, that His servants and His pious ones should not be <i>blessed of the Eternal</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">160</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 65:23.</i> as were the rest of the people!<br>Therefore I am of the opinion that this is a confirmation of what our Rabbis have said,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">161</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma <i>Va’eira</i> 6. See also Ramban on Exodus 5:4.</i> that the tribe of Levi was not [subject to] the enslavement of Egyptian bondage and the rigorous work [that was imposed on the rest of the tribes]. Now since the children of Israel’s <i>lives</i> were <i>made bitter</i> by the Egyptians <i>with hard work</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">162</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exodus 1:14.</i> in order to diminish them, the Holy One, blessed be He, increased them [miraculously] to overcome the decree of the Egyptians, just as He said, <i>And as they afflicted them, so they multiplied and so they grew</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">163</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 12.</i> and just as it is said also with reference to the decree that <i>if it be a son, then ye shall kill him</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">164</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 16.</i> — <i>and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">165</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> — since the Holy One, blessed be He, said: “We shall see <i>whose words shall stand, Mine or theirs</i>. ”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">166</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 44:28. See Vol. I, p. 457.</i> But the tribe of Levi [which was not subject to bondage] reproduced and increased in a normal way, and therefore they did not become as numerous as the other tribes. Perhaps also [their small numbers were] on account of the anger of the patriarch [Jacob] towards them,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">167</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 34:25-30, and 49:5-7.</i> for the tribe of Shimon which now had a large population<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, 1:23, where the verse numbers them at <i>fifty-nine thousand and three hundred</i>.</i> decreased, so that at the time of their entry into the Land [they numbered only] twenty-two thousand [and two hundred<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 26:14.</i> — whereas most of the other tribes increased in the same period, or decreased relatively slightly]; similarly, Levi, the tribe of His pious ones,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 33:8.</i> was not decreased in the plague [caused because of Peor,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">171</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 25:9.</i> and yet at the time of entry into the Land they numbered only one thousand more<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">172</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 26:62.</i> than their present twenty-two thousand!

T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> Numbers commences with several lists that serve to arrange and catalog the Israelite camp in the wilderness: first, the “accountings” of the Israelites fit for battle; then, the symmetrical arrangement of the camp itself, around the Tabernacle; and finally, the special listing of the Levite population, accompanied by an enumeration of its special tasks in the camp. The first part of Numbers thus takes place as it were in the shadow of Mount Sinai—that is, under the aegis of the priestly school of thinking, in which order is everything.", "There is a strong military bent to the arrangement. The census of Chapter 1 is not a head count of the entire Israelite population, but rather of those “twenty years of age and upward,” those eligible to serve in the army. The setup of the camp resembles that in ancient Egypt, with the sanctuary and ark (here “Dwelling” and “coffer”) in the center (in the Egypt of Raamses II—thought by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus—it was the king’s throne). The Levites, whom we have not encountered previously as a group with tasks distinct from those of the priests, emerge in this part of the book as caretakers and perhaps guardians of the sanctuary, in addition to their tasks of dismantling and transport of the “Holy-Shrine.” This military aspect reflects an ancient concept of Israel as the “forces of Y<small>HWH</small>,” surely a conquest image, which later becomes standardized in language in the phrase usually rendered “the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”", "Some of the material in this section might well have been put elsewhere. Chapters 5–7 would have fit nicely in Leviticus; Chapter 7, the listing of the tribal gifts brought to the sanctuary upon its dedication, could even have followed Ex. 40, where Moshe completes the erection of the structure. That these chapters are here therefore must be the result of a conscious decision, either to include material that did not find its way into the other books, or out of a feeling that they were appropriately placed in the book about Israel’s wanderings in the wilderness."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

So, the Holy One blessed be He commanded to write the number of the Levites separately and together, because they were members of His household, upright, and especially dear to him. <br><b>“According to the directive of the Lord he counted them, at the hand of Moses, each man to his service, and to his burden, and his count was as the Lord commanded Moses” (Numbers 4:49).</b> <br>“According to the directive of the Lord he counted them, at the hand of Moses.” This is said in reference to the sons of Kehat, as Aaron counted the sons of Kehat and said: ‘So-and-so and so-and-so will bear the Ark, and so-and-so and so-and-so will bear the altar, and likewise all the vessels of the most sacred order.’ Just as the Holy One blessed be He commanded Moses that Aaron should perform, so Aaron performed. That is, “at the hand of Moses.” From where do you say that it is regarding the sons of Kehat that the verse is speaking? It is as it is written:<b> </b>“Each man to his service, and to his burden.” So it is written regarding the sons of Kehat: “Aaron and his sons shall come, and assign them, each man to his service and to his burden” (Numbers 4:19). <br>“And his count was as the Lord commanded Moses.” This is said in reference to the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, as the Holy One blessed be He commanded that their service should be under his [Moses’] direction, with his brother Aaron. Regarding the sons of Gershon it is written: “You shall assign them all their burden as a commission” (Numbers 4:27), Moses was with them. Regarding the sons of Merari it is written: “And by names you shall appoint the instruments of the commission of their burden” (Numbers 4:32), it included Moses. That is why it is written: “And his count was as the Lord commanded Moses,” as Moses counted and said so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so of the sons of Gershon will bear the woven strips of fabric. So-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so will bear the Tent of Meeting, and likewise regarding all the instruments of their service. He would assign the burden of the sons of Gershon by number. Likewise, Moses counted and said so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so of the sons of Merari will bear the beams; so-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so of the sons of Merari will bear the bars; and likewise it was regarding all the instruments of the service of the burden of the sons of Merari; he would assign them by number to their service. That is, “as the Lord commanded Moses.” Moses was commanded regarding these two families, the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, that he should command them how they should bear and how they should guard what is in their care. That is, “as the Lord commanded Moses.”", "versionTitle": "The Sefaria Midrash Rabbah, 2022", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}]
