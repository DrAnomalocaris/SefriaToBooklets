Scripture should have said, “And they journeyed from Rephidim and they encamped in the wilderness of Sinai, in the third month after their going forth from the land of Egypt,” just as it said above concerning the wilderness of Sin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 17:1: <i>And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin… and encamped in Rephidim</i>.</i> But [Scripture’s manner of expression here is] due to the fact that their coming into the wilderness of Sinai was an occasion for joy and a festival to them, and that since they left Egypt they had been yearning for it. They knew that they would receive the Torah there, for Moses had told them what was said to him, <i>Ye shall serve G-d upon the mountain</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">132</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 3:12.</i> And to Pharaoh also he said, <i>Let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey, into the wilderness and sacrifice unto the Eternal our G-d</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">133</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 5:3.</i> For this reason, Scripture begins the section with the statement that <i>in the third month… the same day</i> that the month began,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">134</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse here, and mentioned in Rashi.</i> <i>they came</i> there [as they had eagerly anticipated]. Following this opening, Scripture reverts [to the usual style] as in the other journeys: <i>And they journeyed from Rephidim</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i><br>Now here too Scripture should have said “and they journeyed from Rephidim <i>and encamped</i> in the wilderness of Sinai.” Instead it writes, <i>and they came to the wilderness of Sinai</i>. This is because Scripture’s intent is to state that as soon as they came to the wilderness of Sinai and saw the mountain in front of them, they encamped in the wilderness and did not wait until they would enter a spot better for encampment. Instead, they camped in the wilderness or in Horeb,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">136</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Deuteronomy 4:10.</i> which was a waste land before the mountain. This is the purport of the verse; <i>and they encamped in the wilderness, and there Israel encamped before the mount</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i><br>It is possible that they separated from their midst all <i>the mixed multitude that was among them</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">137</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 11:4. See also above, 12:38.</i> and the children of Israel alone camped before the mountain while the mixed multitude was behind them. For the Torah was given to Israel, as He said, <i>Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">138</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 3.</i> and this is the meaning of the expression, <i>and there Israel encamped</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> It may be that [the name “Israel”] is mentioned as a mark of honor at the time of their acceptance of the Torah.<br>Now Rashi wrote: “<i>And they journeyed from Rephidim</i>. What need was there for Scripture to state again expressly from where they set forth on the journey? Is it not already stated that they were encamped in Rephidim<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">131</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 17:1: <i>And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin… and encamped in Rephidim</i>.</i> and it is thus evident that they journeyed from there? It [i.e., the intent of the verse] is to declare that their departure from Rephidim was like their encampment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Encampment.” In our Rashi: “coming.”</i> in the wilderness of Sinai. Just as their encampment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">139</sup><i class=\"footnote\">“Encampment.” In our Rashi: “coming.”</i> [in the wilderness of Sinai] was with repentance,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">140</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The repentance is indicated by the word <i>vayichan</i>, which is in the singular, thus indicating that Israel encamped before the mountain as one man and with one mind, “while all other encampments were with murmerings and with dissension” (Rashi, quoting Mechilta).</i> so also was their departure [from Rephidim] with repentance.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">141</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, 17:7, for their sin in Rephidim. The present analogy between their coming into the wilderness of Sinai, which was surely in a spirit of repentance, as explained above, and their departure from Rephidim, thus teaches us that their departure was also with repentance.</i> Thus Rashi’s language. But I have not understood this. It says in connection with all journeys: <i>and they pitched</i> [camp] <i>in Elim;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">142</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 33:9.</i> <i>And they took their journey from Elim… and they came unto the wilderness of Sin;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">143</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 16:1.</i> <i>And they journeyed from the wilderness of Sin… and encamped in Rephidim;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">144</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:1.</i> and so the entire section of <i>Mas’ei</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 33:1-49.</i> is written [with the name of the place whence they set forth on the journey repeated after it had already been mentioned that they had encamped there]. The intent of the repetition by Scripture is that there were no other encampments between them.<br>In the Mechilta, we find the following text<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">146</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mechilta on the verse here.</i> [on the same theme that Rashi mentioned, but presented in such a form that the above difficulties are eliminated]: “<i>And they departed from Rephidim and came to the desert of Sinai</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">135</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> Has it not already been stated in the section of the Torah dealing with all stages of the journey [from Egypt to the Jordan]: <i>And they journeyed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of Sinai?</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">147</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 33:15.</i> And what need is there for Scripture to state here, <i>and they came to the desert of Sinai?</i> It [i.e., the intent of the verse] is to declare that their departure from Rephidim [was like their encampment in the wilderness of Sinai], etc.” The purport of this text of the Mechilta is to explain why, on account of certain new details mentioned there,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">148</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verses 9 and 14.</i> Scripture repeated in the section of <i>Eileh Mas’ei</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">145</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 33:1-49.</i> all stages of the journey from Elim and Rephidim mentioned here, although this journey [from Rephidim to the wilderness of Sinai] is mentioned in identical language both here and there. It was for this reason that [the Mechilta] was compelled to interpret that [the Scriptural restatement] was on account of the above analogy: [Just as their encampment at Sinai was with repentance, so also etc.].", "versionTitle": "Commentary on the Torah by Ramban (Nachmanides).

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

It is concerned, then, with the transfer of leadership from Moshe to Yehoshua (Joshua); with provisions for two and a half tribes to remain on the east bank of the Jordan River, as long as they take part in the impending invasion; with listing the entire route of the Israelites, from Egypt to the plains of Moab; and with the borders of the land to be conquered.", "As has been the case earlier in the book, however, other material intervenes: a theme and variation doublet on the inheritance of land in a case where a man leaves daughters, not sons; two chapters on what sacrifices are to be brought on holy days; a section on vows taken by women; war with Midyan and the precise apportioning of spoils, both to warriors and to the sanctuary; and the law regarding accidental homicide, in which family vengeance is circumvented by the existence of “safe” Levite towns to which the manslayer may flee.", "The inconsistent thematics may again be explained by the intrusion of an editorial hand, again by priestly interests. In Levine’s view, most of Chapters 25–36 function to establish matters of importance in the priestly view, just as in Chapters 1–10. Here law takes precedence over narrative.", "Despite the varied subject matter of this section, it holds together structurally, via the common biblical technique of word (sound) repetition. The rather common verb <i>tzivvah</i>, “command,” weaves through every one of Chapters 26–36, except for 33. Sometimes it introduces what God wants the Israelites to do; sometimes it leads to the formula of fulfillment, “as YHWH commanded the Children of Israel, so they did”; still other times it refers to a command given by Moshe himself. The entire section begins with the verb (26:4), and ends with it as well (36:13). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking.", "Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. 26), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come-near” (27:1 and 36:1). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it.", "Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again.", "What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy.", "<img>", "<b><i>Num. 26:3</i> Moshe spoke, and El’azar the priest, to them in the Plains of Moav …</b>"], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.
