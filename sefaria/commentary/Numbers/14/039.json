אותם באבנים עד שנמשכו ונכנסו תחת ענני הכבוד תחת כנפי השכינה שנאמר (במדבר יד) ויפול משה ואהרן על פניהם לפני כל קהל עדת בני ישראל וגו' ויהושע בן נון וכלב בן יפנה מן התרים את הארץ קרעו בגדיהם ויאמרו וגו' הארץ אשר עברנו בה לתור אותה טובה הארץ מאד מאד וגו' ויאמרו כל העדה לרגום אותם באבנים וגו'. בא וראה מה עשו ישראל ומה הוציאו בשפתותיהם ואח\"כ היו מבקשים לעלות אל הארץ שנאמר וישכימו בבקר ויעלו אל ראש ההר לאמר הננו ועלינו אל המקום אשר אמר ה' כי חטאנו מה כתיב בתריה ויאמר משה למה זה אתם עוברים את פי ה' והיא לא תצלח וגו' ויעפילו לעלות אל ראש ההר וגו' וירד העמלקי והכנעני היושב בהר ההוא ויכום ויכתום עד החרמה מיד חזרו וישבו באבל כבראשונה שנאמר (במדבר יד) ויתאבלו העם מאד. מכאן אמרו כל המנודה יום אחד מלמטה אעפ\"י שהתירו לו אין לו היתר מלמעלה עד שלשה ימים וכל המנודה מלמטה שלשה ימים אף על פי שהתירו לו אין לו היתר מלמעלה עד שבעה ימים וכל המנודה מלמטה שבעה ימים אעפ\"י שהתירו לו אין לו היתר מלמעלה עד שלשים יום וכל המנודה מלמטה שלשים יום אעפ\"י שהתירו לו אין לו היתר מלמעלה לעולם ולעולמי עולמים לכך נאמר ויתאבלו העם מאד. באותה שעה אמר הקב\"ה למשה לך ומרצה את אותן העניים שכבר יצא לבם מעליהם אמר משה לפניו רבש\"ע במה ארצה אותם אמר ליה הקב\"ה למשה לך ומרצה אותם בדברי תורה שנאמר (במדבר טו) ואמרת אליהם כי תבאו אל ארץ מושבותיכם וגו' ועשיתם אשה לה' עולה או זבח וגו' באותה שעה היתה מריבה גדולה בין ישראל לגרים אמר לו הקב\"ה למשה למה עשו מריבה אלו עם אלו אמר משה לפניו רבש\"ע אתה יודע אמר לו הקב\"ה למשה ולא

שיהא בעל דינו עמו שנאמר (דברים יט) ועמדו שני האנשים אשר להם הריב לפני ה' וגו' וכן אם אומר לו אדם לחבירו פלוני חבירי חייב לי מאתים זוז והרי יש לי עד אחד ותהא מצטרף עמו וטול אתה מנה יאמר לו כך מודיע אני

אומר כתיב (במדבר לה) והוא לא אויב לו ולא מבקש רעתו לא אויב לו ולא מבקש רעתו ידיננו שנאמר ושפטו העדה לפסול את השונאים מלישב בדין. אין לי אלא שונאים קרובים מנין שהם פסולין לישב בדין ת\"ל ושפטו העדה בין

פסול בהם קרובים דיינים שהדברים נגמרים על פיהם אינו דין שיפסול בהם קרובים אין לי אלא לרוצח לשאר חייבי מיתות מנין ת\"ל (דברים יט) על המשפטים האלה. יכול כשם שדיני נפשות בעשרים ושלשה כך דיני ממונות בעשרים ושלשה ת\"ל על המשפטים האלה אלה בעשרים ושלשה ואין דיני ממונות בעשרים ושלשה. ועוד שהרי הוא אומר עד האלקים יבא דבר שניהם (שמות כב) ומניין שדיני נפשות בעשרים ושלשה ת\"ל ושפטו העדה הרי עשרה והצילו העדה הרי עוד עשרה הרי כאן עשרים ומנין עוד שלש הרי אתה דן הואיל ואמרה התורה הרוג על פי עדים ואמרה תורה הרוג על פי דיינין מה עדים שנים אף דיינים שנים ואין בית דין שקול מוסיפין עליהם עוד אחר הרי כאן עשרים ושלשה

This pattern was already seen in the book of Exodus, where, despite the climactic miracle of deliverance at the Sea of Reeds, the Israelites “grumbled against Moshe” at Mara because of lack of drinkable water. Although a strain in later biblical thinking remembered the wilderness period as a kind of honeymoon (cf. Jer. 2:2), the Torah itself chose to remember it as a severe time of testing which the ex-slaves ultimately failed to pass.", "The second part of Numbers is a remarkable collection of rebellion narratives that simultaneously display striking similarities and great and colorful differences. The section details six rebellions of the people, and two of the leaders themselves. They are united by a consistent vocabulary: verbs such as “grumble” and “assemble/gather/speak against” depict complaints against Moshe and Aharon and against God. These stories also display the recurring themes of dearth of food and water, and God’s anger at the rebellions, usually expressed in some form of plague (or, additionally, fire).", "Rather than unfold in simple chronological order, one following another, these pieces of the text have been intensified by priestly editing, which has interspersed the stories with a number of cultic and legal passages (Chaps. 15, 18, and 19, all of which bear the theme word “law” [Heb. <i>hok</i> or <i>hukka</i>]), and which are somehow related to previous or succeeding narratives. The interruptions also allow each of the memorable rebellion narratives to “breathe,” giving the audience time to digest the images and the drama presented therein. The stories possess both in abundant measure; one thinks, for instance, of the “meat between the teeth” (11:33), of the grape clusters borne on a pole by two men (13:23); and of the great confrontation with Korah in Chapter 16 (not to mention its resolution), as well as Moshe’s dramatic failure in Chapter 20.", "As in any great literature, repetition of story type or type scene is here accomplished via variation of the most telling kind. In this case we observe once again an alternating pattern to the rebellions, a pattern which reveals not one theme but several:", "The people, over lack of food (chapter 11)", "Moshe’s siblings, over prophetic primacy (12)", "The people, over the spies’ false report (14)", "Levites, over Moshe and Aharon’s prerogatives (16)", "The people, over the rebellious Levites’ sinister fate (17)", "Moshe himself, over the burden of leading the people (20)", "The people, over the lack of food and water (21)", "The pattern observable here is broken, in true biblical rhetorical style (where the last in a sequence often serves by its oddness to reinforce the whole), in a final rebellion (Chap. 25), where the people’s actions involve neither the “complaining” vocabulary nor a revolt against human leadership, but rather comprise the greatest biblical crime of them all: worship of other gods. Viewed in this patterned fashion, the rebellion narratives emerge with a kind of crescendo effect.", "It is also possible, as I have done in “On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure,” above, to follow the scheme put forth by Mann—a three-part structure to the section, each with its internal logic and conclusions. These are treated below; for the moment, it will suffice to see in the first subsection (Chaps. 11–14) the inevitable result of wilderness rebellions: the divine decree that the slave generation must die out before entering the Promised Land; the second subsection (16–20) deals with the challenges to the leadership of Moshe and Aharon, and results in a similar decree, that they will die outside the land; and the third subsection (20–25) chronicles the encounter of the Israelites with neighboring nations, which initially goes in their favor but ends with the disastrous incident at Baal Pe’or (25).", "The primary issue in these stories, to the biblical writer, is lack of trust in God. Each of the three sections mentions or implies that problem; 14:11 and 20:12 use the verb itself, and the narrative of Chapter 25 suggests it. The bottom line is that the Israelites could not keep faith with God—even after both staggering acts of divine intervention (i.e., rescue) and demonstrations of the force of divine wrath—and this lack of faith led ultimately to their dying out in the wilderness outside the Promised Land, in punishment. The stories clearly were meant to be understood as an unfortunate example for later generations, and were taken as such already in the biblical period (see, for example, the treatment in Psalm 78).", "Read on another level, the rebellion narratives are largely concerned with the issue of human leadership, its qualifications, manifestations, and limitations (and even failures). Has there ever been a leader as beleaguered as Moshe? From the beginning of his career on the sands of Egypt, where he assumes the mantle of leadership in the matter of retaliating against the sadistic Egyptian taskmaster (Ex. 2:11–12), to its end at the plains of Moab, in stern address to the people he has struggled to lead (this is the setting of the entire next book, Deuteronomy), he must evoke trust in God, lead the people through an uncharted wilderness, and inspire confidence in his own leadership. His success is muted by the passing of the generation he initially leads, before it can enter Canaan; like them, he too must pass on—with merely a look beyond the Jordan, but no more. Later generations of Jewish readers wept on confronting Moshe’s seemingly premature death, and created heroic tales of his pleading before God to be let into the land he had so long sought to reach. In Numbers he fully deserves this stature, alternately interceding with and cajoling God, standing up for and then almost giving up on this people with whom his life has become so enmeshed. Our stories stress his gifts of prophecy and his pathos as a deeply human leader.", "A final, troubling issue is the character of God in this part of the book. It is a measure of the Bible’s artistry that the rebellion accounts are so varied in content and style; but the variations in punishment—from undetailed death to skin disease to stoning and the earth opening up, just to mention a few examples—create an impression, not of artistic richness but of unremitting severity. The Bible does not seem to have a problem with this kind of divine behavior, and other ancient cultures would have felt at home here, but already in late antiquity, and continuing down to our own day, Jews and Christians most often have preferred, and prayed to, a more forgiving, nurturing, and compassionate God. Dealing with these texts, in the end, raises the question of whether to understand them as the result of “historical necessity” or “literary conceit” (that is, the old generation simply had to die out) or as they stand in the text: a harsh portrayal of what happened when the covenant people violated the covenant."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

The “grumbling” of Ex. 16 finally returns, and God and Moshe talk to one another in a manner that recalls the Golden Calf incident of Ex. 32–34. God wishes to destroy the people and start all over again with Moshe; the prophet, for his part, reminds God of his essentially merciful nature, and basically blackmails him by pointing out what will happen to his reputation among the nations should he destroy the Israelites. Unlike the resolution in Exodus, this time the people—at least the older generation—are doomed to die out. After two years of both miraculous rescues and despair, it has become clear that the former slaves will not be able to accomplish the work of conquest—even with divine help. That is to be left to their children, whom Moshe will address in Deuteronomy.", "V.26 begins a section that seems to double the earlier part of the chapter. Perhaps it stems from a separate tradition concerning the incident. It leads to the people’s disastrous attempt to force the issue by invading Canaan without the Coffer and Moshe (hence, without God).

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account.

This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

The Amalekites and the Canaanites are before you at the border. Israel went ahead on the mountains to go to the land of Israel. Moses and the Ark did not move out of the gate. The Amalekites and the Canaanites who dwelled in those mountains came and killed many Israelites.", "Ibn Shuaib writes. Our sages said that even though Miriam did not intend to speak slander, yet the Holy One punished her that she became leprous. How much more so, when someone speaks slander and his intention is to cause anguish to people. Concerning this, King Solomon said, “<i>death and life are in the power of the tongue</i>” [Proverbs, 18:21]. Death and life depend on the tongue. The Midrash tells a story about a king’s son who was very sick. The doctors said that he could only become healthy by drinking the milk of a lion. A person came before the king and said: I will bring the milk. The king responded, I will make you a marshal. That man immediately asked for ten goats, and he went to the lion’s den. On the first day, he gave the lion one goat to eat. On the second day, he again gave it a goat to eat, and showed himself a little to the lioness from a distance expecting that the lion should see that he was the one who was feeding it the goats. He did the same on the third day, and stood a little closer and played with the lioness a little bit. On the tenth day he milked it and took the milk and left there. At night he came to an inn and he had a dream about the great celebration that the king would make for him. In the dream, his feet said: we did this since we went to the lion’s den. The hands said: we did this since we milked it. The eyes said: if we had not been there, you would not have seen where the lion’s den was, and you could not have helped. The ears said: if you had not heard from the doctors that milk should be brought from a lioness. Then the heart said: if it was not my intellect and had not given you the advice to take goats and to play with the lioness, to take her milk. The tongue said: I made everything with my speech before the king to give goats. If I had been mute, then none of you would have helped. All the other organs immediately shouted at the tongue. You are the lowliest organ in the person, and you want to make yourself important. The tongue responded: you will see how everything depends on me. The person awoke from his sleep. He was very frightened by the dream. He came to the king with the milk and said, I have brought <i>milk of a female dog.</i> This means, milk from a female dog. The king and the nobles became very angry with him. They said to him: we have enough milk from dogs, and the king immediately ordered him thrown into prison. The person fell asleep at night. The tongue began to speak and said. I told you that I am better than all the other organs, since with my speech you will all be killed. All the organs began to speak. We recognize that you are better than all the organs. Therefore, we will make you a master over all of us, but protect us from death. In the morning, the king commanded that the man with the milk should be hanged. They led him out to be hanged and the man pleaded that they should listen to him one more time. He wanted to heal the king’s son with the milk. He was immediately brought to the king with great joy. The man said to the king. In Israel, lionesses are called <i>female dogs</i>, and I spoke as we speak in Israel in my language. The king checked if the milk was from a lioness. They found that it was true and the king made the man a marshal. Concerning this, the verse says, “<i>death and life are in the power of the tongue</i>” [Proverbs, 18:21].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibn Shuaib, II: 357–358.</i>"], "versionTitle": "A Critical Translation into English; Edited and translated by Morris M.

The people were roundly berated by God, Moses, and Aaron. They were told that their corpses would fall in the wilderness and that the number of days of their scouting mission would parallel the years it would take them to arrive at the Holy Land: forty. “And Moses spoke these words to all the Israelites, and the people mourned deeply” (Num. 14:39). A mission designed to speed up the journey by creating excitement for the end goal turned into yet another punishable offense. The people ambivalently accepted their shame: “Here we are, and we shall go up to the place that the Lord said, for we have offended” (Num. 14:40). There was no passion here, only bowed heads and a reluctant spirit. They charged toward the mountain before them, a last-ditch failed show of atonement, but their leader stayed behind: “And they strove to go up the mountaintop, and the Ark of the Lord’s Covenant, and Moses did not budge from the midst of the camp” (Num. 40:44). Moses stayed put, right beside the object that told his uncompromising story. Robert Alter’s translation of “<i>lo mashu</i>” as “he did not budge” helps the reader understand Moses’ singular, stubborn focus on the end goal, while the Israelites tried but failed to offer a weak, symbolic gesture.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Robert Alter, <i>The Five Books of Moses </i>(New York: W.W.

Moreover, he must know how to implement his compassion properly. For instance, just as a parent must refrain from feeding an infant adult food, so too, a compassionate leader must refrain from granting wicked people inappropriate kindness.<br>The souls of the Jewish people originate in a sublime source. As such, they are extraordinarily spiritual and refined, and are in essence entirely removed from sin.<br>A Jew sins only when a spirit of foolishness enters into him. That is the most pitiable state that he can find himself. Compared to that, any other suffering is as nothing.<br>A Torah leader must have compassion on such a person and fill him with proper spiritual awareness. In doing so, the leader relieves him of the heavy burden of his sins.<br>Moses was a uniquely compassionate Torah leader, dedicating himself to helping the Jewish people even at the risk of his own well-being. He opened the light of consciousness for the Jews. In doing so, he worked to create a civilized world, because the essence of a human being is his consciousness. A person who lacks that is uncivilized — in fact, he is not even considered a human being, but an animal in human form.<br>*<br>In our world, people can be divided into two groups: those who are above (compared to a “son”) and those who are below (compared to a “student”). The Tzaddik must guide both of them.<br>Those people who are above are on a high spiritual level. The Tzaddik must show them that ultimately, they know nothing of God, and he must challenge them to consider, “Where is the place of His glory?”<br>Those who are below are on a low spiritual level. The Tzaddik must show them that they can still hope to return to God, because “the whole earth is filled with His glory.”<br>In addition, these two types must be combined. The “son” must partake of something of the “student,” and the “student” must partake of something of the “son.” This is necessary so that both will possess the fear of God.<br>If a person on a high level only experiences his distance from God, he might feel too far to fear God. Therefore, he must be given something of the awareness of the person on a low level: that God’s glory fills the earth — i.e., that God is close to him.<br>And if a person on a low level only experiences how the world is filled with God’s glory, he might lose all sense of self and thus be unable to fear God. Therefore, he must be given something of the awareness of the person on a high level — a measure of distance from God — so that he will continue to be self-aware and he will be capable of fearing God.<br>*<br>Everyone can be a teacher. For instance, when two people discuss religious matters and one inspires the other, he is the teacher to the other. That kind of discussion civilizes the world and fills it with true human beings.<br>The act of teaching also expands the awareness of the teacher. A concept just beyond a person’s comprehension hovers outside his mind. When he acts as a teacher and transfers his wisdom and awareness to someone else, he creates a space in his own mind into which that hovering awareness can enter.<br>Thus, as soon as a teacher reveals one concept, a new awareness enters his mind. This process can occur repeatedly. This obligates him to be careful about what he reveals, because ultimately, he may be open to receiving an awareness of transcendent concepts beyond time — meaning, concepts that time would not suffice to explain. That is something that would leave him in a state of confusion, and so it is something he must avoid.<br>As for the sage and rabbi of the generation, the transcendent awareness that hovers around him is on the level of “length of days and years,” the World to Come, which is “a day that is entirely long,” transcending time. All of the time of this world is nothing compared to even a single moment of the World to Come. There, time is expressed as transcendent states of awareness. Attaining these states constitutes the essential delight of the World to Come: the knowledge of the unknown, the ultimate good hidden from all eyes. When the sage speaks with his students and fills them with his awareness, these transcendent states of awareness enter into him.<br>There are states of transcendent awareness that cannot be put into words. These are called “hands” because, like gesturing hands, they can communicate only hints. They bring these hints down to a level where God’s sovereign providence is revealed.<br>Along with the influx of hints comes an influx of abundance, including monetary wealth.<br>Having income is related to eating, since the principal purpose of work is to obtain food. When the levels of “son” and “student” combine, when a spiritually powerful person eats, he can experience an illumination of God’s will so that he will yearn for God without even knowing what he wants.<br>The Temple (which combined the dynamics of the “son” and the “student”) also brought down monetary blessing. Thus, it contained a huge basin called the “Sea of Solomon,” which is associated with the revelation of God’s sovereign providence.<br>In the days that the Temple existed, we were free of the burden of sin. The daily morning offering atoned for sins of the previous night, and the daily afternoon offering atoned for the sins of the previous day. But now that the Temple has been destroyed, we cannot adequately cleanse ourselves of our sins.<br>In the days of Moses, the sin of the spies<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Numbers 13:1-14:39.</i> foreshadowed the destruction of the Temple. In that instance, Moses begged God to “please forgive the sin of this nation.” God acceded to his request, and that constituted the eventual re-inauguration of the Temple — as commemorated by Chanukah.<br>Similarly, when an individual is successful in his request for forgiveness (on Yom Kippur), that leads to a spiritually successful Chanukah, which corresponds to the re-inauguration of the Temple.<br>It is good for a person’s soul to rise and cling to its place in the upper worlds. That is what happens when a person dies. But that does not constitute his ultimate perfection. The soul attains perfection only when it exists both above and below.<br>In order to achieve that, a person must leave behind a blessing in this world. He does this in the form of sharing his awareness with a son or a student, who remains here below even as this person’s soul rises upward. In that sense, the person still exists in this world.<br>All of the above concepts apply to the well-being of the lungs. When the lungs are in proper balance, they are composed of these levels of “son” and “student.”</small><br><b>Send Us a Compassionate Leader</b><br>“Your compassion is abundant, HaShem.

He further notes that the law of fringes applies to pants. However, he then goes on to say that this interpretation is of no consequence, for the rabbis say that the fringes are specially prepared threads which are placed on the corner of any garment having four corners. Therefore pants are not included in the law of fringes.</i>", "versionTitle": "Ibn Ezra's commentary on the Pentateuch, tran. and annot. by H. Norman Strickman and Arthur M. Silver.
