|בְּהַנְחֵ֤ל עֶלְיוֹן֙ גּוֹיִ֔ם בְּהַפְרִיד֖וֹ בְּנֵ֣י אָדָ֑ם יַצֵּב֙ גְּבֻלֹ֣ת עַמִּ֔ים לְמִסְפַּ֖ר בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|8|When the Most High gave nations their homes And set the divisions of humanity, [God] fixed the boundaries of peoples In relation to Israel’s numbers. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

God created the world with the intention of bringing the Israelite nation into existence, with nations deriving their existence from blessings meant for Israel. The borders of nations are set according to the number of the children of Israel, with Israel being the main focus. The Torah was given to guide the world and was apportioned to the tribes of Israel since the confusion of languages. The seventy ministering angels are assigned portions on earth and in nations, with HaShem taking Jerusalem and the Jewish people as His portions. The Targum commentaries emphasize how God established the boundaries of nations based on the number of the Bnei Yisroel, highlighting the significance of the Israelites in the divine plan. 

|כִּ֛י חֵ֥לֶק יְהֹוָ֖ה עַמּ֑וֹ יַעֲקֹ֖ב חֶ֥בֶל נַחֲלָתֽוֹ׃|9|For יהוה’s portion is this people; Jacob, God’s own allotment. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries, including Chasidut, Halakhah, Jewish Thought, Kabbalah, Liturgy, Midrash, Musar, and Second Temple texts, discuss the concept of Israel as chosen by God as His portion and inheritance, distinct from other nations. They highlight the importance of Torah, prayer, faith, repentance, and adherence to divine commandments in maintaining this special relationship, with references to Jacob and his descendants as the foundation of the House of Israel. The texts emphasize the unity and uniqueness of the Jewish people, their connection to God, and the significance of their role in the world. Additionally, Targum translations of Deuteronomy 32:9 reinforce the idea that Israel is the Lord's portion and inheritance. 

|יִמְצָאֵ֙הוּ֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִדְבָּ֔ר וּבְתֹ֖הוּ יְלֵ֣ל יְשִׁמֹ֑ן יְסֹבְבֶ֙נְהוּ֙ יְב֣וֹנְנֵ֔הוּ יִצְּרֶ֖נְהוּ כְּאִישׁ֥וֹן עֵינֽוֹ׃|10|[God] found them in a desert region, In an empty howling waste. [God] engirded them, watched over them, Guarded them as the pupil of God’s eye. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Bnei Yisrael's recognition of their need for something greater to receive the Torah, given in the wilderness to highlight the importance of fulfillment. God protected the Israelites in the desert, providing for their needs and surrounding them with His presence. The High Priest symbolizes sanctity and atonement through the Yom Kippur goats, while the Sefirot concept in Kabbalah distinguishes between Israel and the nations. The Midrash praises Israel for quickly assimilating the Torah at Mount Sinai, and various commentaries offer interpretations on different biblical passages. Yahweh guided the Israelites in the wilderness, and Targum highlights God's provision and protection in the desolate land. 

|כְּנֶ֙שֶׁר֙ יָעִ֣יר קִנּ֔וֹ עַל־גּוֹזָלָ֖יו יְרַחֵ֑ף יִפְרֹ֤שׂ כְּנָפָיו֙ יִקָּחֵ֔הוּ יִשָּׂאֵ֖הוּ עַל־אֶבְרָתֽוֹ׃|11|Like an eagle who rouses its nestlings, Gliding down to its young, So did [God] spread wings and take them, Bear them along on pinions; |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of tzitzit in protecting garments and serving as a safeguard for commandments, praising tzaddikim for elevating daat and the rectification of brit. God's guidance is compared to an eagle with its young, emphasizing trust and faith. Prophecy must provide additional information, and rewards for fulfilling commandments are not revealed to prevent selective observance. The flags of the camps in the desert symbolized their characteristics, with Dan's featuring an eagle for protection and speed. The Targum describes God's protection of Israel as an eagle caring for its young. 

|יְהֹוָ֖ה בָּדָ֣ד יַנְחֶ֑נּוּ וְאֵ֥ין עִמּ֖וֹ אֵ֥ל נֵכָֽר׃|12|יהוה alone did guide them, No alien god alongside. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

In various texts, including Chasidut, Liturgy, Musar, and Targum, the unique relationship between God and the Jewish people is emphasized, highlighting that Israel is led by God alone without the presence of foreign gods. This exclusivity is seen as a promise for the future, focusing on unity and reliance on God, with a special emphasis on the Land of Israel and the individual responsibility of each Israelite. Additionally, the importance of forbidden sexual relationships in the Land of Israel is discussed, as well as insights from various commentators on different verses and concepts in the Bible. 

|יַרְכִּבֵ֙הוּ֙ עַל־ אָ֔רֶץ וַיֹּאכַ֖ל תְּנוּבֹ֣ת שָׂדָ֑י וַיֵּנִקֵ֤הֽוּ דְבַשׁ֙ מִסֶּ֔לַע וְשֶׁ֖מֶן מֵחַלְמִ֥ישׁ צֽוּר׃|13|[God] set them atop the highlands, To feast on the yield of the earth; Nursing them with honey from the crag, And oil from the flinty rock, |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Deuteronomy 32:13 metaphorically describes the blessings of the land of Israel, emphasizing the abundance of honey and oil. When reading Parashat Ha'azinu, the Torah reading is divided into sections that end with verses of rebuke to motivate repentance. The term "rakab" in Hebrew symbolizes dominion over the heavens, while the Jewish people ascend to the Unlimited One. In the Midrash, the Hebrew midwives were Yokheved and Miriam, with righteous women in Egypt being rewarded. The Levites recited the song of Ha'azinu in six sections during Shabbat offerings, and Abraham's ten trials resulted in miracles for his children in Egypt. God instructed Moses to lead the Israelites to the promised land in Exodus 33:1. 

|חֶמְאַ֨ת בָּקָ֜ר וַחֲלֵ֣ב צֹ֗אן עִם־חֵ֨לֶב כָּרִ֜ים וְאֵילִ֤ים בְּנֵֽי־בָשָׁן֙ וְעַתּוּדִ֔ים עִם־חֵ֖לֶב כִּלְי֣וֹת חִטָּ֑ה וְדַם־עֵנָ֖ב תִּשְׁתֶּה־חָֽמֶר׃|14|Curd of kine and milk of flocks; With the best  of lambs, And rams of Bashan, and he-goats; With the very finest  wheat— And foaming grape-blood was your drink. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut recommends eating lean animal meat and drinking olive oil for conception, focusing on Torah to subdue physical desires and find happiness. Commentary discusses Israel's deviation from spiritual teachings and the consequences of neglecting Torah. Halakhah emphasizes the importance of righteousness and repentance, while Jewish Thought delves into the song of Moshe and neglecting spiritual duties for material wealth. Kabbalah warns against becoming wealthy and denying God, while Midrash highlights rebellion due to satiety. Musar stresses the need to control desires and focus on repentance, while Quoting Commentary explores various interpretations of biblical texts. Second Temple discusses forsaking God for material pleasures, Talmud links the sin of the Golden Calf to riches, and Tanakh describes rebellion and consequences. Targum highlights Israel's rebellion, wealth, and abandonment of God. 

|יַקְנִאֻ֖הוּ בְּזָרִ֑ים בְּתוֹעֵבֹ֖ת יַכְעִיסֻֽהוּ׃|16|They incensed [God] with alien things, Vexed [God] with abominations. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text from Deuteronomy 32:16 discusses how the Israelites provoked God with abominable deeds such as idolatry, pederasty, and sorcery, leading to His anger and jealousy. The Midrash explores the severe punishment for idol worship and licentiousness, contrasting forgiveness for idol worship with harsh consequences for violating interpersonal laws. The Targum commentaries emphasize that the people incited God's anger through idol worship and abominable actions. 

|יִזְבְּח֗וּ לַשֵּׁדִים֙ לֹ֣א אֱלֹ֔הַּ אֱלֹהִ֖ים לֹ֣א יְדָע֑וּם חֲדָשִׁים֙ מִקָּרֹ֣ב בָּ֔אוּ לֹ֥א שְׂעָר֖וּם אֲבֹתֵיכֶֽם׃|17|They sacrificed to demons, no-gods, Gods they had never known, New ones, who came but lately, Who stirred not your forebears’ fears.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries explore the concept of idol worship among the Israelites, describing how they sacrificed to non-deities and demons in hopes of gaining favor, but these beings were ultimately powerless and not truly feared. The worship of spirits and idols extended to imaginary entities, illustrating the futility of such practices. Additionally, the Targum commentaries emphasize the worthlessness and instability of the idols worshipped by the Israelites. 

|צ֥וּר יְלָדְךָ֖ תֶּ֑שִׁי וַתִּשְׁכַּ֖ח אֵ֥ל מְחֹלְלֶֽךָ׃|18|You neglected the Rock who begot you, Forgot the God who labored to bring you forth. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text explores concepts related to Jewish history and theology, including miracles, redemption, and the destruction of the Second Temple, emphasizing the relationship between human actions and divine intervention. It discusses the consequences of forgetting God, the importance of repentance and spiritual growth, and the impact of Israel's sins on their relationship with God, as well as the significance of historical events like the fifteenth of Av and the destruction of Beitar on Jewish identity and religious observance. The text also touches on themes of pride, humility, and the need for spiritual rectification in the face of worldly temptations, citing various commentaries and sources from Chasidut, Jewish Thought, Kabbalah, Midrash, Musar, Quoting Commentary, Talmud, Tanakh, and Targum. 

|וַיַּ֥רְא יְהֹוָ֖ה וַיִּנְאָ֑ץ מִכַּ֥עַס בָּנָ֖יו וּבְנֹתָֽיו׃|19|יהוה saw and was vexed And spurned these sons and daughters. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The wickedness of women in the generation of the destruction of the First Temple led to God's anger and the refinement of their character in exile. Fear of God is essential for lasting Torah study, with Torah compared to a son and fear to a daughter. The song of Moshe (Ha’azinu) hints at the future resurrection of the Israelite people and explores God's attributes and man's imperfection. In Midrash, Resh Lakish consoles R. Chiya b. Abba after a tragedy, cautioning against inviting misfortune with ominous words. Performing mitzvot brings goodness, while transgressions can lead to punishment, but repentance removes them from God's view. Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rashi, and Ramban offer interpretations of Deuteronomy 32:19 regarding the writing of the song of Haazinu. In Targum, God's anger is provoked by His beloved children, who are referred to as sons and daughters. 

|וַיֹּ֗אמֶר אַסְתִּ֤ירָה פָנַי֙ מֵהֶ֔ם אֶרְאֶ֖ה מָ֣ה אַחֲרִיתָ֑ם כִּ֣י ד֤וֹר תַּהְפֻּכֹת֙ הֵ֔מָּה בָּנִ֖ים לֹא־אֵמֻ֥ן בָּֽם׃|20|[God] said: I will hide My countenance from them, And see how they fare in the end. For they are a treacherous breed, Children with no loyalty in them. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators discuss God's decision to hide His face from the Israelites in Deuteronomy 32:20 due to their actions and lack of faithfulness. The fear of the Lord is crucial for safeguarding Torah and acts of lovingkindness, ensuring lasting impact through Torah study and good deeds. The Gaon of Vilna emphasized the importance of faithful prayer, while Kabbalah explains that God conceals His face when enclothed in physical garments. In Selichot prayers, there is a plea for forgiveness and a question of why God hides during times of trouble. In the Midrash, R. Meir interprets names to discern one's nature, while R. Meir, R. Juda, and R. Jose pay attention to names for signs of wickedness. Rabbi Meir's interpretation in the Talmud highlights the eternal bond between God and His people. 

|הֵ֚ם קִנְא֣וּנִי בְלֹא־אֵ֔ל כִּעֲס֖וּנִי בְּהַבְלֵיהֶ֑ם וַֽאֲנִי֙ אַקְנִיאֵ֣ם בְּלֹא־עָ֔ם בְּג֥וֹי נָבָ֖ל אַכְעִיסֵֽם׃|21|They incensed Me with no-gods, Vexed Me with their futilities;   I’ll incense them with a no-folk, Vex them with a nation of fools. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses Israelites worshiping false gods, leading to punishment by nations like the Chaldeans and Edomites. Descriptions in the Torah are metaphorical, and God's divinity is embodied in various ways. Rabbi Meir and Midrash texts highlight consequences of immoral actions and importance of repentance. Commentary from Ibn Ezra, Rashi, Ramban, and Talmudic interpretations provide insights into the text. Verses from Isaiah, Obadiah, and Psalms prophesy destruction and despise for nations like Edom. The Targum emphasizes Israel's angering God through idol worship. 

|כִּי־אֵשׁ֙ קָדְחָ֣ה בְאַפִּ֔י וַתִּיקַ֖ד עַד־שְׁא֣וֹל תַּחְתִּ֑ית וַתֹּ֤אכַל אֶ֙רֶץ֙ וִֽיבֻלָ֔הּ וַתְּלַהֵ֖ט מוֹסְדֵ֥י הָרִֽים׃|22|For a fire has flared in My wrath And burned to the bottom of Sheol, Has consumed the earth and its increase, Eaten down to the base of the hills. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Chizkuni, and Rav Hirsch interpret the text as describing God's burning anger consuming Jerusalem and punishing the people. Midrash teaches that studying the Torah prevents affliction and suffering, while neglecting it leads to suffering. Quoting commentary further emphasizes the importance of proper observance and honoring God to avoid severe punishment. Targum describes a powerful wind of fire destroying the earth and its produce. 

|אַסְפֶּ֥ה עָלֵ֖ימוֹ רָע֑וֹת חִצַּ֖י אֲכַלֶּה־בָּֽם׃|23|I will sweep misfortunes on them, Use up My arrows on them: |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators explain that in Deuteronomy 32:23, the phrase "אספה" signifies the deployment of all punishments against the guilty, exhausting all arrows of punishment, emphasizing the severity and variety of disasters that will befall them. The text contrasts the destruction of the wicked with the resilience of the righteous, highlighting how God does not punish until a nation is destroyed. Israel's survival is ensured by God's unchanging nature, even in the face of punishment and anger. The cycle of judgment and vengeance reflects God's ultimate justice, as seen in examples from Genesis, Deuteronomy, and Daniel. Ameimar from the Talmud explains that God does not repeatedly strike the Jewish people like other nations, ensuring they will not be completely destroyed despite being struck many times for their sins. The Targums on Deuteronomy 32:23 mention the idea of God bringing calamities or evil upon the people as a form of punishment. 

|מְזֵ֥י רָעָ֛ב וּלְחֻ֥מֵי רֶ֖שֶׁף וְקֶ֣טֶב מְרִירִ֑י וְשֶׁן־בְּהֵמֹת֙ אֲשַׁלַּח־בָּ֔ם עִם־חֲמַ֖ת זֹחֲלֵ֥י עָפָֽר׃|24|Wasting famine, ravaging plague, Deadly pestilence, and fanged beasts Will I let loose against them, With venomous creepers in dust. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators provide interpretations of different phrases in Deuteronomy 32:24, such as Rashi explaining "מזי רעב" as "hairy through hunger" and Rashbam describing "וקטב מרירי" as being stabbed by robbers. In Mishnah Eruvin 10:6, it is allowed to stand in one domain and drink in another, and in Musar, Torah study is seen as a way to dispel afflictions. Rabbi Yoḥanan warns against issuing halakhic rulings in front of one's teacher in the Talmud, and in Tanakh, Leviticus 26:22 mentions the threat of wild beasts attacking the people. The Targum commentary on Deuteronomy 32:24 describes the punishment of the Israelites for their sins, including being sent into captivity and being attacked by various dangers. 

|מִחוּץ֙ תְּשַׁכֶּל־חֶ֔רֶב וּמֵחֲדָרִ֖ים אֵימָ֑ה גַּם־בָּחוּר֙ גַּם־בְּתוּלָ֔ה יוֹנֵ֖ק עִם־אִ֥ישׁ שֵׂיבָֽה׃|25|The sword shall deal death without, As shall the terror within, To youth and maiden alike, The suckling as well as the aged. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that the sword will destroy people outside the city, while terror will cause fear and death within homes, with all ages affected. Moses first spoke harshly to Israel, then consoled them with blessings, connecting the laws of jealousy in Numbers to idol worship and future retribution. Rabbeinu Bahya discusses a series of punishments for sins, including the destruction of the Holy Temple, emphasizing the importance of Torah study for the survival of the Torah. The Sages teach to limit time outside during a plague, as described in verses in Isaiah and Deuteronomy. Judah and the elders of Israel are depicted as worshiping false gods in Jeremiah and Ezekiel, with the Targum translations emphasizing the widespread destruction by the sword. 

|אָמַ֖רְתִּי אַפְאֵיהֶ֑ם אַשְׁבִּ֥יתָה מֵאֱנ֖וֹשׁ זִכְרָֽם׃|26|I might have reduced them to naught,   Made their memory cease among humankind, |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators interpret the phrase "אמרתי אפאיהם" in Deuteronomy 32:26 differently, with Ramban, Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Rashbam, and Rav Hirsch each offering their own explanations. The song of Moshe is divided into six parts, including allusions to the future redemption and resurrection of the Israelite people. The Selichot prayers on Erev Rosh Hashana seek mercy to prevent the nations from questioning God's existence. The Midrash discusses the story of Haman plotting against the Jewish people, highlighting their resilience and divine protection. A disciple's doubts about the Ramban's claims were dispelled when the Ramban showed how the disciple's name was hinted at in a verse from Parashas Ha’azinu. Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Targum Jerusalem all describe God abandoning and destroying the people, eliminating their memory. 

|לוּלֵ֗י כַּ֤עַס אוֹיֵב֙ אָג֔וּר פֶּֽן־יְנַכְּר֖וּ צָרֵ֑ימוֹ פֶּן־יֹֽאמְרוּ֙ יָדֵ֣נוּ רָ֔מָה וְלֹ֥א יְהֹוָ֖ה פָּעַ֥ל כׇּל־זֹֽאת׃|27|But for fear of the taunts of the foe, Their enemies who might misjudge And say, “Our own hand has prevailed; None of this was wrought by יהוה !” |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the fear that the enemies of Israel will attribute their power to themselves and their gods, rather than to God, leading to misinterpretation by the gentiles. Midrash texts emphasize the significance of God's voice in punishing enemies, the restraint of judgment as praise to God, and the naming of righteous individuals as an honor from God. Sforno, Tur HaArokh, and Ramban provide interpretations of specific commandments in Deuteronomy. The Talmud describes how the Levites recited the song of Ha'azinu in sections as part of Shabbat offerings, while the Targum emphasizes the danger of enemies attributing their success to their own strength rather than to God's decree. 

|כִּי־ג֛וֹי אֹבַ֥ד עֵצ֖וֹת הֵ֑מָּה וְאֵ֥ין בָּהֶ֖ם תְּבוּנָֽה׃|28|For they are a folk void of sense, Lacking in all discernment. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Likutei Moharan, it is explained that understanding is necessary to reveal counsel, as seen in the verse "The counsels in man's heart are deep waters, yet a man of understanding can draw them out." Without understanding, counsel is lost, as shown in the statement "For they are a nation devoid of counsel, and there is no understanding among them." The enemies of Israel are described as lacking understanding of God's actions and punishment and failing to recognize the role of God in Israel's fate. Different commentators interpret the lack of counsel among the nations in various ways, with some focusing on the lack of wisdom and others highlighting the failure of the Jewish people to heed God's guidance. 

|ל֥וּ חָכְמ֖וּ יַשְׂכִּ֣ילוּ זֹ֑את יָבִ֖ינוּ לְאַחֲרִיתָֽם׃|29|Were they wise, they would think upon this, Gain insight into their future: |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentaries on Deuteronomy 32:29 highlight that misfortunes and victories are due to God's punishment and divine intervention. In Mishnah Ketubot 1:7, Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Eliezer accept a woman's claim of hymen rupture by wood, while Rabbi Yehoshua requires proof. The Targums on Deuteronomy 32:29 stress the importance of wisdom and understanding the law. In Kabbalah, the Divine quality of Kingship-Malchut is special to Yehudah, and in Musar, humility, remembrance of death, and accountability before God are essential to avoid sin and pride. Rashi, Siftei Chakhamim, Or HaChaim, and Rabbeinu Bahya provide insights on various biblical verses. 

|אֵיכָ֞ה יִרְדֹּ֤ף אֶחָד֙ אֶ֔לֶף וּשְׁנַ֖יִם יָנִ֣יסוּ רְבָבָ֑ה אִם־לֹא֙ כִּֽי־צוּרָ֣ם מְכָרָ֔ם וַֽיהֹוָ֖ה הִסְגִּירָֽם׃|30|“How could one have routed a thousand, Or two put ten thousand to flight, Unless their Rock had sold them,  יהוה had given them up?” |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how God's punishment led to Israelites being pursued by their enemies, the promises of the Torah will be fulfilled in the future, the Almighty is the origin of all things, and the importance of humility in divine favor. Additionally, the Midrash highlights David's humility, Abraham's choice between Gehenna and exile, and Jerusalem's ultimate comfort. Rashi explains Dan's vengeance against the Philistines, Siftei Chakhamim discusses the proportion of non-Jews pursuing and killing Jews, and the Talmud recounts the disagreement over Bar Koziba being the Messiah. The Targum emphasizes the importance of God's presence in defeating enemies. 

|כִּ֛י לֹ֥א כְצוּרֵ֖נוּ צוּרָ֑ם וְאֹיְבֵ֖ינוּ פְּלִילִֽים׃|31|For their rock is not like our Rock, In our enemies’ own estimation.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that judgments should only be brought before Israel and not idolaters, as doing so would profane the name of God and give honor to idolatry. Jewish lawsuits should not be brought before gentile courts, even if they rule in a manner consistent with Jewish law, as it implies the superiority of what they worship. Litigants in Israel should not turn to idolatrous judges for decisions, as it renounces God and Israel's law. The Targum commentaries on Deuteronomy 32:31 emphasize that while the idols of other nations are not comparable to the Almighty God of Israel, when the people of Israel sin, they face punishment from God. 

|כִּֽי־מִגֶּ֤פֶן סְדֹם֙ גַּפְנָ֔ם וּמִשַּׁדְמֹ֖ת עֲמֹרָ֑ה עֲנָבֵ֙מוֹ֙ עִנְּבֵי־ר֔וֹשׁ אַשְׁכְּלֹ֥ת מְרֹרֹ֖ת לָֽמוֹ׃|32|Ah! The vine for them is from Sodom, From the vineyards of Gomorrah; The grapes for them are poison, A bitter growth their clusters. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators explain in Deuteronomy 32:32:1 that idolaters lack counsel and understanding, contrasted with Israel's ability to produce good fruit. Midrash texts warn against the dangers of overindulging in wine and compare people's behavior to that of Sodom. Musar teachings connect Noach's indulgence in wine to Adam's downfall and discuss the regulations for the Nazirite. Quoting commentary highlights interpretations of biblical verses by Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bahya, Siftei Chakhamim, and Rashbam. The Second Temple text uses imagery of the vine of Sodom to warn against drunkenness. The Talmud advises reciting specific verses to prevent negative outcomes in dreams, while the Tanakh recounts the story of Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Targum translations of Deuteronomy 32:32 emphasize the wickedness of idolaters compared to the people of Sodom. 

|חֲמַ֥ת תַּנִּינִ֖ם יֵינָ֑ם וְרֹ֥אשׁ פְּתָנִ֖ים אַכְזָֽר׃|33|Their wine is the venom of asps, The pitiless poison of vipers. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The venom of serpents symbolizes the cruel punishment of the wicked by a merciless enemy during exile, while the snake in the Garden of Eden represents temptation and disobedience, associated with craftiness and chaos. Hypocrites who make mistakes in Torah learning will wither like grass, leading to intentional sin and spiritual destruction, warning against associating with the ignorant. Noach's failure to fully restore mankind's stature due to excessive wine consumption is similar to Adam's sin, leading to a debasement of spirituality. Psalms 140:4 refers to spider venom, and Proverbs 12:10 emphasizes compassion towards animals. The Targums on Deuteronomy 32:33 compare the people's wine to serpent venom and malice to cruel reptiles. 

|הֲלֹא־ה֖וּא כָּמֻ֣ס עִמָּדִ֑י חָת֖וּם בְּאוֹצְרֹתָֽי׃|34|Lo, I have it all put away, Sealed up in My storehouses, |
|--:|:-:|:--|

God is aware of the actions of Israel's enemies and has stored up the consequences of their deeds for a future day of judgment, with punishment being a well-guarded secret known only to Him. The concept of retribution for sin is emphasized, with the idea that sins are recorded and pending retribution, not forgotten, leading to continued wrongdoing if one believes their sins are discarded. The Mishnah states that while everything is predetermined, individuals still have free will, and outcomes are based on one's actions. The Talmud discusses interpretations of various phrases, while the Targum mentions that the deeds of the wicked are known and stored for judgment day. 

|לִ֤י נָקָם֙ וְשִׁלֵּ֔ם לְעֵ֖ת תָּמ֣וּט רַגְלָ֑ם כִּ֤י קָרוֹב֙ י֣וֹם אֵידָ֔ם וְחָ֖שׁ עֲתִדֹ֥ת לָֽמוֹ׃|35|To be My vengeance and recompense, At the time that their foot falters. Yea, their day of disaster is near, And destiny rushes upon them. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries on Deuteronomy 32:35 offer interpretations of God's vengeance and recompense, emphasizing the impending punishment for the wicked and the reward for the righteous. The Jewish Thought commentary discusses the role of individuals in hastening the Redemption, while the Midrash highlights the sanctification of the month, the significance of the shofar blast, and the coming judgment on the nations. The Mishnah discusses prohibited actions before gentile festivals, and the Musar commentary emphasizes repentance and understanding the consequences of sin. Quoting commentaries delve into God's acts of kindness and judgment, the use of the term "festivals," and prophecies by Balaam and Moses. In the Talmud, rabbis engage in discussions on various religious and legal topics, while the Targum emphasizes God's role in avenging the wicked and rewarding the righteous. 

|כִּֽי־יָדִ֤ין יְהֹוָה֙ עַמּ֔וֹ וְעַל־עֲבָדָ֖יו יִתְנֶחָ֑ם כִּ֤י יִרְאֶה֙ כִּֽי־אָ֣זְלַת יָ֔ד וְאֶ֖פֶס עָצ֥וּר וְעָזֽוּב׃|36|For יהוה will vindicate God’s people And take revenge for  God’s servants, Upon seeing that their might is gone, And neither bond nor free is left. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes waking up at midnight to connect with Hashem through the good point in each Jew, as seen in Chazal's discussion on the moment of midnight and Moshe's disclosure of redemption. David HaMelekh's praise at midnight is explained by his knowledge, symbolized by the harp above his bed, and the importance of charity in Israel's redemption is stressed. Halakhah states that out of the sixty commandments, forty-six are obligatory for women, with specific mnemonics for the commandments they must follow and those they are exempt from. Liturgy focuses on repentance, seeking alignment with God's will, and overcoming struggles against impurity and exile. Midrash discusses God's joy in punishing nations and careful consideration when judging the righteous, as indicated in Proverbs and Devarim. Musar highlights that both good deeds and suffering for Torah observance will hasten redemption, as explained in the Torah portion of Ha'azinu. Quoting commentary from various sources, including Ramban, Rashi, and Rashbam, provides insights on biblical verses and prophecies. Responsa explain the uncertainty of determining the date of the Redemption and the Messiah's arrival, cautioning against miscalculations and dismissing astrology's influence. In the Second Temple period, the brothers facing torture find comfort in God's kindness, as expressed in Deuteronomy. The Talmud links the arrival of the Messiah to various signs among the Jewish people. Tanakh describes God's mercy and vengeance on Zion, with the holy people's power being restored after a specific time. Targum commentaries on Deuteronomy 32:36 discuss God's judgment on Israel with mercy and reconsideration of punishment for his servants. 

|וְאָמַ֖ר אֵ֣י אֱלֹהֵ֑ימוֹ צ֖וּר חָסָ֥יוּ בֽוֹ׃|37|[God] will say: Where are their gods, The rock in whom they sought refuge, |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the mocking question about the whereabouts of Israel's God and the contrast between Israel's trust in God as a rock of protection and the ineffectiveness of false gods worshipped by the people. In the Liturgy, the Torah passage Deuteronomy 32:37 is referenced in the Seder Ma'amadot 5:8. The Midrash predicts disrespect between generations, rebellion within families, and an increase in insolence and lack of respect before the arrival of the Messiah, noting the Divine Presence's withdrawal due to arrogance and idol worship. Abarbanel explains in Joel 2:15-17 the significance of blowing a shofar in Zion as a warning of an impending enemy attack and a plea for mercy from Hashem. The Torah commands not to destroy the corners of the beard, questioning where one's King and strength are. Psalms 79:10 and 115:2 emphasize the importance of God avenging the spilled blood of His servants to show His presence and power to the nations. The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 32:37 highlight the questioning of the strength and reliability of idols or false gods trusted by the Israelites. In the Talmud, Titus is identified as the wicked individual who insulted and blasphemed God. 

|אֲשֶׁ֨ר חֵ֤לֶב זְבָחֵ֙ימוֹ֙ יֹאכֵ֔לוּ יִשְׁתּ֖וּ יֵ֣ין נְסִיכָ֑ם יָק֙וּמוּ֙ וְיַעְזְרֻכֶ֔ם יְהִ֥י עֲלֵיכֶ֖ם סִתְרָֽה׃|38|Who ate the fat of their offerings And drank their libation wine? Let them rise up to your help, And let them be a shield unto you! |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the contrast between the powerlessness of false idols and the protection offered by the one true God, with a focus on the mockery of Israel's enemies towards their belief in a single deity. The prohibition against drinking wine used for idolatrous libations is derived from Deuteronomy 32:38 and is considered a negative commandment with severe consequences. The song of Moshe (Ha’azinu) is divided into six parts, focusing on God's favors, the people's sins, punishments, destruction, and future redemption of Israel. R. Ahawa bar Ze'era discusses the significance of actions and outcomes, contrasting Titus entering the Holy of Holies peacefully with Aaron's sons being destroyed by fire. Noach's attempt to restore mankind's stature through circumcision and wine consumption is marred by debauchery, leading to his downfall. The Gemara discusses the prohibition of benefiting from blood poured before idolatry and the prohibition of wine belonging to gentiles. Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Targum Jerusalem emphasize divine intervention and protection for those who consumed sacrifices and libations. 

|רְא֣וּ ׀ עַתָּ֗ה כִּ֣י אֲנִ֤י אֲנִי֙ ה֔וּא וְאֵ֥ין אֱלֹהִ֖ים עִמָּדִ֑י אֲנִ֧י אָמִ֣ית וַאֲחַיֶּ֗ה מָחַ֙צְתִּי֙ וַאֲנִ֣י אֶרְפָּ֔א וְאֵ֥ין מִיָּדִ֖י מַצִּֽיל׃|39|See, then, that I, I am the One; There is no god beside Me. I deal death and give life; I wounded and I will heal: None can deliver from My hand. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes aligning with Divine attributes to reveal God's glory, achieve complete teshuva, and elevate beyond the Sefirot. Commentary underscores God's power over life and death, healing, and salvation. Halakhah connects prayer for healing to biblical verses, while Jewish Thought discusses sacrifices, fear of God, and divine presence. Kabbalah delves into the Cause of Causes, Sefirot, and God's control over existence. Midrash explores prayer, divine knowledge, resurrection, and respect for leaders. Musar discusses the influence of patriarchs' merit, belief in resurrection, and denial's consequences. Quoting Commentary provides interpretations from various commentators. Second Temple discusses clear intuition of God's existence and mastery of dreams. Talmud resolves contradictions regarding God's abilities and merit transfer between generations. Tanakh describes God's wrath and people's unfaithfulness. Targum emphasizes God's exclusive power over life and death, smiting, and healing, with no other gods beside Him. 

|כִּֽי־אֶשָּׂ֥א אֶל־שָׁמַ֖יִם יָדִ֑י וְאָמַ֕רְתִּי חַ֥י אָנֹכִ֖י לְעֹלָֽם׃|40|Lo, I raise My hand to heaven And say: As I live forever, |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes raising hands in holiness to draw divine blessings, connecting it to purification and divine providence. Commentary discusses God's oath-taking gesture of raising his hand to heaven as a symbol of swearing and divine justice. Halakhah recommends starting and ending Torah readings with positive matters, except in cases like Parashat Ha'azinu. Jewish Thought highlights the unity and attributes of God, emphasizing praise and trust in His eternal nature. Midrash explains the significance of standing positions in Psalms and God's oath due to lack of faith. Quoting Commentary includes interpretations of God's oath and actions in various biblical verses. Targum interprets God's declaration of eternal life and existence in different contexts. 

|אִם־שַׁנּוֹתִי֙ בְּרַ֣ק חַרְבִּ֔י וְתֹאחֵ֥ז בְּמִשְׁפָּ֖ט יָדִ֑י אָשִׁ֤יב נָקָם֙ לְצָרָ֔י וְלִמְשַׂנְאַ֖י אֲשַׁלֵּֽם׃|41|When I whet My flashing blade And My hand lays hold on judgment, Vengeance will I wreak on My foes, Will I deal to those who reject Me. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the protection of the tzaddik from the evil eye and the significance of "yad" and "name" in relation to the Sabbath. Commentary discusses the anthropomorphic language in the Torah and the symbolism of covering bread during blessings. Jewish Thought explores the abstract nature of God and the symbolism of the sanctuary. Midrash emphasizes the importance of justice in divine and human judgment. Musar discusses the concept of litigants before God and their connection to Deuteronomy 32:41. Quoting Commentary highlights God's vengeance on the Egyptians and the Levites' rituals in the Temple. Tanakh portrays God's anger towards nations at ease, and Targum emphasizes the sharpened sword of God for judgment and vengeance. 

|אַשְׁכִּ֤יר חִצַּי֙ מִדָּ֔ם וְחַרְבִּ֖י תֹּאכַ֣ל בָּשָׂ֑ר מִדַּ֤ם חָלָל֙ וְשִׁבְיָ֔ה מֵרֹ֖אשׁ פַּרְע֥וֹת אוֹיֵֽב׃|42|I will make My arrows drunk with blood— As My sword devours flesh— Blood of the slain and the captive From the long-haired enemy chiefs. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that enemies sustain themselves from extraneous elements in the mind, which when consumed, lead to their downfall. Halakhah uses metaphoric imagery to describe God's attributes, while Midrash discusses God's presence for Israel's protection and judgment on idolaters. Commentary and quoting commentary provide interpretations of biblical verses related to God's punishment and protection. In the Talmud, Court decisions made with effort are upheld, showing the importance of exertion. Targum emphasizes God's punishment on those who harm His people. 

|הַרְנִ֤ינוּ גוֹיִם֙ עַמּ֔וֹ כִּ֥י דַם־עֲבָדָ֖יו יִקּ֑וֹם וְנָקָם֙ יָשִׁ֣יב לְצָרָ֔יו וְכִפֶּ֥ר אַדְמָת֖וֹ עַמּֽוֹ׃|43|O nations, acclaim God’s people! For He’ll avenge the blood of His servants, Wreak vengeance on His foes, And cleanse His people’s land. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how Israel will be praised for their loyalty to God, who will avenge their blood and render vengeance to their adversaries, with the land serving as atonement. Living in Eretz Yisrael leads to forgiveness of sins, and burial there brings atonement. The Liturgy includes prayers for remembrance and vengeance of Jewish martyrs, and the Talmud discusses the use of Aramaic words in the Torah. The Targum versions of Deuteronomy 32:43 emphasize the nations praising God for avenging the blood of His servants and bringing justice to His enemies. 

|וַיָּבֹ֣א מֹשֶׁ֗ה וַיְדַבֵּ֛ר אֶת־כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֥י הַשִּׁירָֽה־הַזֹּ֖את בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י הָעָ֑ם ה֖וּא וְהוֹשֵׁ֥עַ בִּן־נֽוּן׃|44|Moses came, together with Hosea son of Nun, and recited all the words of this poem in the hearing of the people.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses appointed Joshua as his successor, ensuring his humility by referring to him as Hoshea, with the Torah mentioning them together to transfer authority publicly. The Mishneh Torah outlines scribe traditions for Torah scrolls, the role of a spokesman in teaching Torah, and the importance of attributing teachings to the original sage. In Sifrei Devarim 334:1, Moses' authority is transferred to Joshua as his time ends. Ramban explains the Song of Ha'azinu written by Moses and Joshua, serving as a testimony of Israel's history and future redemption. God instructs Moses to appoint Joshua as his successor in Numbers 27:18. Hoshe’a assists Moses in reciting the song in the tabernacle, and the Tosefta states that repetition of names in the Tanach praises individuals like Avraham, Yehoshua, and Moshe, expressing love and encouragement. 

|וַיְכַ֣ל מֹשֶׁ֗ה לְדַבֵּ֛ר אֶת־כׇּל־הַדְּבָרִ֥ים הָאֵ֖לֶּה אֶל־כׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|45|And when Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses concluded his speech to the Israelites, as stated in the Targum. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ שִׂ֣ימוּ לְבַבְכֶ֔ם לְכׇ֨ל־הַדְּבָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י מֵעִ֥יד בָּכֶ֖ם הַיּ֑וֹם אֲשֶׁ֤ר תְּצַוֻּם֙ אֶת־בְּנֵיכֶ֔ם לִשְׁמֹ֣ר לַעֲשׂ֔וֹת אֶת־כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֖י הַתּוֹרָ֥ה הַזֹּֽאת׃|46|he said to them: Take to heart all the words with which I have warned you this day. Enjoin them upon your children, that they may observe faithfully all the terms of this Teaching.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of attentively focusing on the words of the Torah, passing down teachings to future generations, understanding the deeper meanings of Torah stories, and the significance of garments as symbols of character traits and moral conditions are emphasized in the commentary, Jewish Thought, and Midrash. Rashi discusses the identification of Ibzan as Boaz and the divine intervention in Ruth 4:13, while Targum highlights Moses instructing the Israelites to focus on and teach the Torah to fulfill its commands. 

|כִּ֠י לֹֽא־דָבָ֨ר רֵ֥ק הוּא֙ מִכֶּ֔ם כִּי־ה֖וּא חַיֵּיכֶ֑ם וּבַדָּבָ֣ר הַזֶּ֗ה תַּאֲרִ֤יכוּ יָמִים֙ עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתֶּ֜ם עֹבְרִ֧ים אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֛ן שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|47|For this is not a trifling thing for you: it is your very life; through it you shall long endure on the land that you are to possess upon crossing the Jordan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that studying the Torah's esoteric dimension is crucial for a deeper understanding, while Halakhah stresses the importance of following all Torah commandments for life. Jewish Thought highlights the Torah's purpose of providing guidance and rewards, and Kabbalah questions the negative effects of toiling in vain. The Midrash warns against reading the Sh'ma in filthy places and emphasizes the Torah's significance, while Musar underscores the need to fulfill all Torah words for the soul's completeness. Quoting Commentary discusses the lessons of repentance from the red heifer legislation and the hidden wisdom in Torah narratives, and the Talmud delves into various decrees and teachings on impurity, rewards for careful speech, and helping others with mitzvot. The Targum translations stress the essential nature of the Torah for life and longevity. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֤ר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה בְּעֶ֛צֶם הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּ֖ה לֵאמֹֽר׃|48|That very day יהוה spoke to Moses:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The phrase "בעצם היום הזה" signifies a decisive action in broad daylight, emphasizing the importance and inevitability of events. Moses' unique relationship with God allowed him to communicate directly without needing advance knowledge, unlike other prophets like Bileam. The phrase is used to show that God's will cannot be stopped by human interference, as seen in instances like Noach entering the ark and the Israelites leaving Egypt. Ramban and Radak explain the significance of the phrase in various contexts, while Targum Jonathan specifies the timing of God speaking to Moses. 

|עֲלֵ֡ה אֶל־הַר֩ הָעֲבָרִ֨ים הַזֶּ֜ה הַר־נְב֗וֹ אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מוֹאָ֔ב אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־פְּנֵ֣י יְרֵח֑וֹ וּרְאֵה֙ אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֲנִ֥י נֹתֵ֛ן לִבְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לַאֲחֻזָּֽה׃|49|Ascend these heights of Abarim to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab facing Jericho, and view the land of Canaan, which I am giving the Israelites as their holding.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses is instructed to go to Mount Nevo to see the land of Canaan, symbolizing the culmination of his leadership. He appoints Joshua as his successor before his death. Moses dies and is buried in the inheritance of the tribe of Gad, praised by angels and Israel for his justice. The Israelites travel to Iye-abarim, near the border of Moab. Moses calls upon Joseph's spirit to reveal himself, comparing this event to Elisha making iron float, indicating his ability to bring up Joseph's coffin. 

|וּמֻ֗ת בָּהָר֙ אֲשֶׁ֤ר אַתָּה֙ עֹלֶ֣ה שָׁ֔מָּה וְהֵאָסֵ֖ף אֶל־עַמֶּ֑יךָ כַּֽאֲשֶׁר־מֵ֞ת אַהֲרֹ֤ן אָחִ֙יךָ֙ בְּהֹ֣ר הָהָ֔ר וַיֵּאָ֖סֶף אֶל־עַמָּֽיו׃|50|You shall die on the mountain that you are about to ascend, and shall be gathered to your kin, as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his kin;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses is instructed by God to willingly prepare for death on Mount Nebo, similar to Aaron's passing, in order to be gathered to his people and join the righteous in eternal life. Despite Moses' desire to live, the angel of death insists on his passing, but through prayer and divine protection, Moses accepts his fate. The concept of being gathered to one's people before death is explored through various interpretations, emphasizing the continuation of existence beyond the physical body and the importance of righteous individuals in Jewish thought and tradition. 

|עַל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר מְעַלְתֶּ֜ם בִּ֗י בְּתוֹךְ֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּמֵֽי־מְרִיבַ֥ת קָדֵ֖שׁ מִדְבַּר־צִ֑ן עַ֣ל אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־קִדַּשְׁתֶּם֙ אוֹתִ֔י בְּת֖וֹךְ בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|51|for you both broke faith with Me among the Israelite people, at the waters of Meribath-kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, by failing to uphold My sanctity among the Israelite people.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites broke faith with God at the Waters of Merivah in the wilderness of Tzin, resulting in Moses and Aaron being punished for not sanctifying God, leading to their denial of entry into the promised land. Moses' failure to sanctify God by striking the rock instead of speaking to it caused consequences, emphasizing the imperfection of humans and the need to follow God's commandments. The Shekhinah's presence at the rock where Moses struck it led to consequences, and the Liturgy praises biblical figures for their faithful actions involving water, seeking salvation in their honor. The deaths of Moses and Aaron are discussed in the Midrash, with Moses not allowed to enter the Land of Israel due to the incident at the waters of dispute. Moses and Aaron's failure to sanctify God's name at the waters of Meribah resulted in missed opportunities to demonstrate God's power, with differing interpretations on whether Moses sinned. Moses' request to die like Aaron was denied, and his soul was stored under the Throne of Glory, while the Targum explains that their punishment was due to being unfaithful, rebellious, and not sanctifying God's word at the Waters of Contention. 

|כִּ֥י מִנֶּ֖גֶד תִּרְאֶ֣ה אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ וְשָׁ֙מָּה֙ לֹ֣א תָב֔וֹא אֶל־הָאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־אֲנִ֥י נֹתֵ֖ן לִבְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|52|You may view the land from a distance, but you shall not enter it—the land that I am giving to the Israelite people.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses Moses breaking faith with God at the Waters of Merivah in the wilderness of Tzin, resulting in him being unable to enter the promised land. Despite Moses' pleas and requests, God denies him entry, stating that he will not pass through the land alive or dead. Moses is allowed to see the land from a distance, but not enter it during his lifetime, with the promise of entering it beyond death. The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 32:52 also emphasize that Moses will see the land from afar, but not enter it.
