## Genesis 41

|וַיְהִ֕י מִקֵּ֖ץ שְׁנָתַ֣יִם יָמִ֑ים וּפַרְעֹ֣ה חֹלֵ֔ם וְהִנֵּ֖ה עֹמֵ֥ד עַל־הַיְאֹֽר׃|1 E|After two years’ time, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,|

In Chasidut, Mei HaShiloach explains that Yosef's salvation came after refinement in recognizing God's goodness and having a pure heart, while Ba'al Shem Tov discusses removing darkness through Torah study. Ramban and Onkelos disagree on the translation of "ye'or," Ibn Ezra discusses reckoning the two years, and various commentators offer interpretations of Pharaoh's dream. Rabbi Chiya in Kabbalah discusses the end of darkness and perfection, while Midrash draws parallels between Joseph and Zion's trials and redemption. In quoting commentary, Rashi explains the term "יָמִים" literally as days, not years, and the Talmud rejects a two-year interpretation of the term "yamim" in a Nazir's vow. Targum Jonathan mentions Pharaoh's dream as a sign of remembrance of Joseph before the Word of the Lord. 

|וְהִנֵּ֣ה מִן־הַיְאֹ֗ר עֹלֹת֙ שֶׁ֣בַע פָּר֔וֹת יְפ֥וֹת מַרְאֶ֖ה וּבְרִיאֹ֣ת בָּשָׂ֑ר וַתִּרְעֶ֖ינָה בָּאָֽחוּ׃|2 E|when out of the Nile there came up seven cows, handsome and sturdy, and they grazed in the reed grass.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The seven characteristics of love, awe, beauty, victory, splendor, foundation, and majesty are represented by the seven healthy cows in Genesis 41:2, essential for connecting with God and overcoming arrogance and hatred towards others. Various interpretations of Pharaoh's dream in Genesis 41:2:1 are discussed by Ramban, Radak, Tur HaArokh, Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rashi, Steinsaltz, Rav Hirsch, Tze'enah Ure'enah, Da'at Zekenim, and Chizkuni. The importance of interpretation and understanding deeper meanings in Jewish thought, Kabbalistic teachings on the ten sefirot, and Midrash on the significance of dreams, brotherhood, and the Nile are highlighted. Ibn Ezra's interpretation of Genesis 1:2, Rabbeinu Bahya's emphasis on seeking wisdom, and Rashi's explanation of Hosea 13:15 in the Targum are also mentioned. 

|וְהִנֵּ֞ה שֶׁ֧בַע פָּר֣וֹת אֲחֵר֗וֹת עֹל֤וֹת אַחֲרֵיהֶן֙ מִן־הַיְאֹ֔ר רָע֥וֹת מַרְאֶ֖ה וְדַקּ֣וֹת בָּשָׂ֑ר וַֽתַּעֲמֹ֛דְנָה אֵ֥צֶל הַפָּר֖וֹת עַל־שְׂפַ֥ת הַיְאֹֽר׃|3 E|But presently, seven other cows came up from the Nile close behind them, ugly and gaunt, and stood beside the cows on the bank of the Nile;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Evil Inclination tempts individuals to sin in seven ways, including love of money and pleasure, fear of punishment, self-glorification, triumph over enemies, self-praise, attachment to worldly desires, and seeking power, but repentance can extract good deeds from its influence. Pharaoh's dream of cows standing next to each other indicated immediate famine following years of plenty, with lean cows representing the famine. Pharaoh tests Joseph's interpretation by altering details, leading to unity during good years and division during bad years. Ramban explains that the cows were feeding on grass by the river, related to brotherhood, as described in Targum Jonathan. 

|וַתֹּאכַ֣לְנָה הַפָּר֗וֹת רָע֤וֹת הַמַּרְאֶה֙ וְדַקֹּ֣ת הַבָּשָׂ֔ר אֵ֚ת שֶׁ֣בַע הַפָּר֔וֹת יְפֹ֥ת הַמַּרְאֶ֖ה וְהַבְּרִיאֹ֑ת וַיִּיקַ֖ץ פַּרְעֹֽה׃|4 E|and the ugly gaunt cows ate up the seven handsome sturdy cows. And Pharaoh awoke.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the Evil Inclination tempting individuals in seven ways, advising on how to combat it through mitzvot and teshuvah. Commentary on Pharaoh's dream interprets it as a warning of famine consuming abundance, emphasizing the significance of Pharaoh's awakening. In the Midrash, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish and Rabbi Yehoshua illustrate the superiority of God's greatness over human greatness through Pharaoh's example. Targum translations of Genesis 41:4 describe the dream where thin cows eat fat cows and Pharaoh wakes up. 

|וַיִּישָׁ֕ן וַֽיַּחֲלֹ֖ם שֵׁנִ֑ית וְהִנֵּ֣ה ׀ שֶׁ֣בַע שִׁבֳּלִ֗ים עֹל֛וֹת בְּקָנֶ֥ה אֶחָ֖ד בְּרִיא֥וֹת וְטֹבֽוֹת׃|5 E|He fell asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven ears of grain, solid and healthy, grew on a single stalk.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 41:5, commentators discuss the symbolism of seven ears of grain on one stalk representing plenty and abundance. Samael injuring Jacob's thigh joint symbolizes later descendants suffering under harsh decrees, reversed by the Hasmoneans overcoming the Greeks. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan recount Joseph's dream of seven healthy ears of grain on a single stalk. 

|וְהִנֵּה֙ שֶׁ֣בַע שִׁבֳּלִ֔ים דַּקּ֖וֹת וּשְׁדוּפֹ֣ת קָדִ֑ים צֹמְח֖וֹת אַחֲרֵיהֶֽן׃|6 E|But close behind them sprouted seven ears, thin and scorched by the east wind.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh's dream in Genesis 41 symbolized the worsening famine each year, with Rashi and Ibn Ezra explaining the significance of the east wind. Midrash texts highlight the respect shown to royalty by various biblical figures and Joseph's ability to interpret Pharaoh's dream accurately. Mishnah Bava Metzia 9 discusses the conditions under which a cultivator can subtract from owed produce due to damage, with Rabbi Yehuda adding specific conditions. Targum translations emphasize the destructive effects of the east wind in Pharaoh's dream. 

|וַתִּבְלַ֙עְנָה֙ הַשִּׁבֳּלִ֣ים הַדַּקּ֔וֹת אֵ֚ת שֶׁ֣בַע הַֽשִּׁבֳּלִ֔ים הַבְּרִיא֖וֹת וְהַמְּלֵא֑וֹת וַיִּיקַ֥ץ פַּרְעֹ֖ה וְהִנֵּ֥ה חֲלֽוֹם׃|7 E|And the thin ears swallowed up the seven solid and full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke: it was a dream!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the seven ways the Evil Inclination tempts individuals to sin, emphasizing the importance of teshuvah to extract good deeds from its influence. The Torah portion of Miketz provides advice on serving God, while the light of Hanukkah candles should only be used to direct oneself towards God. Ibn Ezra discusses how Hebrew speakers convey meaning clearly through different words and spellings. The Talmud notes Noah's prohibition from sexual relations in the Ark and advises on when to engage in relations for those desiring children. Proverbs 1:8 advises to heed parental discipline, while Targum describes Pharaoh's dream in Genesis 41:7. 

|וַיְהִ֤י בַבֹּ֙קֶר֙ וַתִּפָּ֣עֶם רוּח֔וֹ וַיִּשְׁלַ֗ח וַיִּקְרָ֛א אֶת־כׇּל־חַרְטֻמֵּ֥י מִצְרַ֖יִם וְאֶת־כׇּל־חֲכָמֶ֑יהָ וַיְסַפֵּ֨ר פַּרְעֹ֤ה לָהֶם֙ אֶת־חֲלֹמ֔וֹ וְאֵין־פּוֹתֵ֥ר אוֹתָ֖ם לְפַרְעֹֽה׃|8 E|Next morning, his spirit was agitated, and he sent for all the magician-priests of Egypt, and all its sages; and Pharaoh told them his dreams, but none could interpret them for Pharaoh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar both had troubling dreams that needed interpretation, leading to challenges in understanding their significance. Joseph accurately interpreted Pharaoh's dream about the upcoming famine, leading to his rise in status and the salvation of Egypt. Jacob's doubt about the significance of his dream of the ladder was resolved after events in Shechem. Jonah preferred death over life because he had already died once, while Elijah did not die. The Mishnah states conditions under which a person does not make a bet peras. Ramban explains the sorcery of Egypt's magicians, and Targum highlights the importance of Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream. Nebuchadnezzar sought the meaning of his dream anxiously, while Pharaoh's dream indicated the release of Joseph from prison. 

|וַיְדַבֵּר֙ שַׂ֣ר הַמַּשְׁקִ֔ים אֶת־פַּרְעֹ֖ה לֵאמֹ֑ר אֶת־חֲטָאַ֕י אֲנִ֖י מַזְכִּ֥יר הַיּֽוֹם׃|9 E|The chief cupbearer then spoke up and said to Pharaoh, “I must make mention today of my offenses.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators on Genesis 41:9:1 discuss the chief butler's admission of his sins before Pharaoh, noting the necessity of recalling faults (Ibn Ezra), the chief butler's own sin leading to his imprisonment (Sforno), the chief butler addressing Pharaoh's advisers (Or HaChaim), mentioning past sins for the king's interest (Radak), guilt in forgetting his promise to Joseph (Tur HaArokh), and recognition of his primary role in the situation (Malbim). The Torah emphasizes remembrance of important events and commandments to prevent forgetting, with failure to remember being considered culpable, as shown by the chief cupbearer's forgetfulness of Joseph's request in Genesis. The magicians' inability to interpret Pharaoh's dream leads to the chief butler mentioning Joseph, who is eventually elevated to a position of prominence. Confessing sins, even at the risk of death, can bring mercy and forgiveness from God, as demonstrated by the Chief Butler's confession to assist Pharaoh in Genesis 41:9 according to Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. 

|פַּרְעֹ֖ה קָצַ֣ף עַל־עֲבָדָ֑יו וַיִּתֵּ֨ן אֹתִ֜י בְּמִשְׁמַ֗ר בֵּ֚ית שַׂ֣ר הַטַּבָּחִ֔ים אֹתִ֕י וְאֵ֖ת שַׂ֥ר הָאֹפִֽים׃|10 E|Once Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and placed me in custody in the house of the prefect,  together with the chief baker.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The title "Pharaoh" is used for the king of Egypt in the Bible, and the repetition of "me" in Genesis 41:10:2 is in line with Hebrew usage. In the Midrash, it is noted that God can cause masters to be angry at their servants, as seen with Pharaoh and Joseph, and vice versa, as seen with Bigtan and Teresh. In the Targum, Pharaoh puts the speaker and chief baker under guard in the house of the chief executioner due to his anger (Onkelos Genesis 41:10; Targum Jonathan on Genesis 41:10). 

|וַנַּֽחַלְמָ֥ה חֲל֛וֹם בְּלַ֥יְלָה אֶחָ֖ד אֲנִ֣י וָה֑וּא אִ֛ישׁ כְּפִתְר֥וֹן חֲלֹמ֖וֹ חָלָֽמְנוּ׃|11 E|We had dreams the same night, he and I, each of us a dream with a meaning of its own.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators on Genesis 41:11:1 note that the dreams of the cupbearer and the baker were accurately interpreted, unlike the interpretations given by the wise men to Pharaoh. Ramban explains that interpreting dreams means foretelling the future, with each dream consistent with its interpretation, while Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra clarifies that the dreams seen were true and not just a result of worries. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe how Pharaoh and his cupbearer had dreams on the same night but each dream had its own interpretation. 

|וְשָׁ֨ם אִתָּ֜נוּ נַ֣עַר עִבְרִ֗י עֶ֚בֶד לְשַׂ֣ר הַטַּבָּחִ֔ים וַ֨נְּסַפֶּר־ל֔וֹ וַיִּפְתׇּר־לָ֖נוּ אֶת־חֲלֹמֹתֵ֑ינוּ אִ֥ישׁ כַּחֲלֹמ֖וֹ פָּתָֽר׃|12 E|A Hebrew youth was there with us, a servant of the prefect; and when we told him our dreams, he interpreted them for us, telling each of the meaning of his dream.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The chief of the butlers interpreted each dream individually to dissuade Pharaoh from promoting Joseph, who was referred to as a youth, a fool, and a slave. Jeremiah's statement about being known before birth applies to all prophets, with Joseph and Joshua both being called young despite their ages. The chief butler feared for his position if Pharaoh died without revealing Joseph's dream interpretation, leading to Joseph being summoned and promoted. The Talmud explains that dreams follow the interpretation given to them, as seen in Pharaoh's ministers and Joseph's interpretations. 

|וַיְהִ֛י כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר פָּֽתַר־לָ֖נוּ כֵּ֣ן הָיָ֑ה אֹתִ֛י הֵשִׁ֥יב עַל־כַּנִּ֖י וְאֹת֥וֹ תָלָֽה׃|13 E|And as he interpreted for us, so it came to pass: I was restored to my post, and the other was impaled.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Different commentators have varying interpretations of who is responsible for restoring the cupbearer to his position in Genesis 41:13:1, with some attributing it to Pharaoh and others to Joseph, highlighting the power of interpretation in determining outcomes. Joseph's ability to accurately interpret dreams led to his release from prison and rise to greatness in Egypt, showcasing the importance of dreams and their interpretations. Rabbeinu Bahya and Gevia Kesef discuss Joseph's qualities and the concept that commands in Hebrew language and logic may refer to potential actions, essential for understanding the Torah and Prophets. In the Talmud, Rabbi Eliezer warns against acting on dreams before their interpretation, while Rabbi Elazar and Rava emphasize that dreams follow the interpretation given. The Targums confirm that Joseph's interpretation of dreams came true, resulting in the restoration of the cupbearer and the execution of the baker. 

|וַיִּשְׁלַ֤ח פַּרְעֹה֙ וַיִּקְרָ֣א אֶת־יוֹסֵ֔ף וַיְרִיצֻ֖הוּ מִן־הַבּ֑וֹר וַיְגַלַּח֙ וַיְחַלֵּ֣ף שִׂמְלֹתָ֔יו וַיָּבֹ֖א אֶל־פַּרְעֹֽה׃|14 E|Thereupon Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was rushed from the dungeon. He had his hair cut and changed his clothes, and he appeared before Pharaoh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh quickly brought Joseph out of the dungeon, where he was shaved and changed clothes before being presented to Pharaoh. The text highlights the importance of adorning oneself both externally and internally in service of God, similar to meeting royalty, and emphasizes God's pleasure in those who make peace. The parallels between Joseph and Zion in their treatment, suffering, and redemption are also highlighted, along with the importance of sincerity and devotion in worship. Additionally, the Talmud provides guidance on interpreting dreams, advising positive verses to counter negative outcomes. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר פַּרְעֹה֙ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף חֲל֣וֹם חָלַ֔מְתִּי וּפֹתֵ֖ר אֵ֣ין אֹת֑וֹ וַאֲנִ֗י שָׁמַ֤עְתִּי עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר תִּשְׁמַ֥ע חֲל֖וֹם לִפְתֹּ֥ר אֹתֽוֹ׃|15 E|And Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, but no one can interpret it. Now I have heard it said of you that for you to hear a dream is to tell its meaning.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that interpreting the world around us is essential for achieving everlasting life, as all affairs of the world are like a dream that requires interpretation and comes from God. Commentary highlights Joseph's reputation for accurately interpreting dreams, emphasizing that the ability to understand dreams comes from God. Midrash explains that because Joseph attributed the interpretation of dreams to God, he was promised greatness and leadership. Quoting Commentary connects the word "שמע" to understanding, similar to the French word "entendre." In Tanakh, King Nebuchadnezzar sought to understand the meaning of a troubling dream, while in Targum, Pharaoh sought Joseph's help to interpret his dream after hearing of Joseph's ability to explain dreams. 

|וַיַּ֨עַן יוֹסֵ֧ף אֶת־פַּרְעֹ֛ה לֵאמֹ֖ר בִּלְעָדָ֑י אֱלֹהִ֕ים יַעֲנֶ֖ה אֶת־שְׁל֥וֹם פַּרְעֹֽה׃|16 E|Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, “Not I! God will see to Pharaoh’s welfare.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, humility is emphasized as acknowledging that accomplishments come from the kindness of the Creator, as seen in Yosef's example in Genesis 41:16. Joseph's humility in attributing dream interpretation to God reflects a belief in free will and the limitations of human power compared to the divine, highlighting the importance of turning to the Creator rather than intermediaries like horoscopes. Joseph's deference to royalty in interpreting Pharaoh's dreams is also noted in Midrash and Musar, emphasizing the respect shown by biblical figures towards rulers and the authority of God over earthly events. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר פַּרְעֹ֖ה אֶל־יוֹסֵ֑ף בַּחֲלֹמִ֕י הִנְנִ֥י עֹמֵ֖ד עַל־שְׂפַ֥ת הַיְאֹֽר׃|17 E|Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Yaakov's arrival in Egypt led to the people sowing seed again despite a predicted famine, with Rashi and Nachmanides addressing questions about Yaakov annulling his son's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream. Radak, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz offer interpretations of Pharaoh's dream and its retelling. The Midrash discusses offerings made by the tribe of Manasseh and praises Joseph for his righteousness. In the Second Temple period, the river in Pharaoh's dream is interpreted as a symbol of speech. Pharaoh tells Joseph about his dream in Targum. 

|וְהִנֵּ֣ה מִן־הַיְאֹ֗ר עֹלֹת֙ שֶׁ֣בַע פָּר֔וֹת בְּרִיא֥וֹת בָּשָׂ֖ר וִיפֹ֣ת תֹּ֑אַר וַתִּרְעֶ֖ינָה בָּאָֽחוּ׃|18 E|when out of the Nile came up seven sturdy and well-formed cows and grazed in the reed grass.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh's dream of seven cows was initially described differently in the Torah and by Pharaoh, with Joseph correcting Pharaoh's account. Joseph's wisdom and insight were demonstrated when he accurately interpreted the dream and showed deference to royalty when summoned by Pharaoh. Different rabbis had varying interpretations of the length of the famine mentioned in the dream, with some linking it to events in biblical history. The Targums describe the cows as either well-fleshed cows or fat-fleshed oxen grazing by the river. 

|וְהִנֵּ֞ה שֶֽׁבַע־פָּר֤וֹת אֲחֵרוֹת֙ עֹל֣וֹת אַחֲרֵיהֶ֔ן דַּלּ֨וֹת וְרָע֥וֹת תֹּ֛אַר מְאֹ֖ד וְרַקּ֣וֹת בָּשָׂ֑ר לֹֽא־רָאִ֧יתִי כָהֵ֛נָּה בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם לָרֹֽעַ׃|19 E|Presently there followed them seven other cows, scrawny, ill-formed, and emaciated—never had I seen their likes for ugliness in all the land of Egypt!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators interpret Pharaoh's dream of the lean cows as emphasizing the poor quality of the cows, with Ibn Ezra explaining the use of synonyms, Da'at Zekenim suggesting it was a test for Joseph, and Chizkuni noting the repetition as a compliment to Joseph. In the Midrash, Pharaoh tests Joseph's interpretation skills by altering the details of the dream, but Joseph corrects him each time, impressing Pharaoh with his wisdom and insight. In the Targum, seven poor, bad-looking, and thin-fleshed cows appear in Egypt, standing out for their badness compared to others in the land of Mizraim. 

|וַתֹּאכַ֙לְנָה֙ הַפָּר֔וֹת הָרַקּ֖וֹת וְהָרָע֑וֹת אֵ֣ת שֶׁ֧בַע הַפָּר֛וֹת הָרִאשֹׁנ֖וֹת הַבְּרִיאֹֽת׃|20 E|And the seven lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven cows, the sturdy ones;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak explains that the "הרקות" in Genesis 41:20 refers to cows with a thin layer of flesh, as seen in verse 19, while Steinsaltz describes how the lean cows ate the fat cows. Rashi connects the forty years of uninhabited land in Ezekiel 29:11 to the forty-two years of famine in Pharaoh's dream, with only two years of famine occurring before Jacob arrived in Egypt. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both describe how the thin and bad-looking cows devoured the healthy cows in Genesis 41:20. 

|וַתָּבֹ֣אנָה אֶל־קִרְבֶּ֗נָה וְלֹ֤א נוֹדַע֙ כִּי־בָ֣אוּ אֶל־קִרְבֶּ֔נָה וּמַרְאֵיהֶ֣ן רַ֔ע כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר בַּתְּחִלָּ֑ה וָאִיקָֽץ׃|21 E|but when they had consumed them, one could not tell that they had consumed them, for they looked just as bad as before. And I awoke.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the Evil Inclination inducing sin in seven characteristics, Torah insights leading to both creation and famine, the importance of renewing habits to avoid forgetfulness, Yosef's nullification of Paroh's deception through recognizing holiness, preparation sustaining through hardship, trust in Hashem revealing inherent good, and Torah and prayer nullifying illusions. In the commentary, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Sforno, and Radak analyze Pharaoh's dream in Genesis 41:21, noting details like the ill-favored cows remaining unchanged and connections to warnings about food not satiating. Kabbalah warns of Israel suffering when mixed with evil influences, while Targum describes the lack of recognition in the dream's ending. 

|וָאֵ֖רֶא בַּחֲלֹמִ֑י וְהִנֵּ֣ה ׀ שֶׁ֣בַע שִׁבֳּלִ֗ים עֹלֹ֛ת בְּקָנֶ֥ה אֶחָ֖ד מְלֵאֹ֥ת וְטֹבֽוֹת׃|22 E|In my other dream, I saw seven ears of grain, full and healthy, growing on a single stalk;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reuben warns his brothers that they are responsible for Joseph's suffering, even though they did not physically harm him (Commentary). Pharaoh tests Joseph with a dream, which Joseph accurately interprets, impressing Pharaoh (Midrash). Jacob's success in battle against the Emorites is attributed to charity, struggle against evil urges, and prayer, referred to as הקול קול יעקב (Musar). Sforno explains the term "מלאתך" in Exodus 22:28 as a heave for the priest, referencing Genesis 41:22, and Ramban discusses the significance of honoring one's father over one's grandfather (Quoting Commentary). Targum Jonathan describes a dream similar to Onkelos in Genesis 41:22, where seven healthy ears of grain grow on one stalk (Targum). 

|וְהִנֵּה֙ שֶׁ֣בַע שִׁבֳּלִ֔ים צְנֻמ֥וֹת דַּקּ֖וֹת שְׁדֻפ֣וֹת קָדִ֑ים צֹמְח֖וֹת אַחֲרֵיהֶֽם׃|23 E|but right behind them sprouted seven ears, shriveled, thin, and scorched by the east wind.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators offer different interpretations of the word "tz'numoth" in Genesis 41:23, with Ramban suggesting it means "separated into many pieces," Ibn Ezra equating it to "images" or "hard," Rashbam suggesting it means "hard as stone," Radak referencing the Talmudic term for dried bread, Tur HaArokh explaining it as "split open into many small sections," and Siftei Chakhamim discussing Pharaoh's use of the term in the context of Joseph's interpretation of the dream, while Rashi translates it as "parched," relating it to a lack of moisture and hardness similar to a rock. In the Midrash, Pharaoh tests Joseph by altering details of his dream, but Joseph corrects him each time, proving his wisdom and insight. Bartenura explains that the term "בבכורות" in Genesis 41:23 refers to the time when the produce are ripe and full, with the basket containing less as they begin to shrink and shrivel up. In the Targum, Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe seven ears of corn that were shriveled, thin, and scorched by the east wind, growing after healthy ears. 

|וַתִּבְלַ֙עְןָ֙ הַשִּׁבֳּלִ֣ים הַדַּקֹּ֔ת אֵ֛ת שֶׁ֥בַע הַֽשִּׁבֳּלִ֖ים הַטֹּב֑וֹת וָֽאֹמַר֙ אֶל־הַֽחַרְטֻמִּ֔ים וְאֵ֥ין מַגִּ֖יד לִֽי׃|24 E|And the thin ears swallowed the seven healthy ears. I have told my magician-priests, but none has an explanation for me.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses Pharaoh's dream about cows and ears, with Joseph interpreting the dream as being from God. In the Second Temple period, a similar dream with ears of corn is described. Targum translations of Genesis 41:24 mention Joseph seeking interpretation from magicians who cannot provide an explanation. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֔ה חֲל֥וֹם פַּרְעֹ֖ה אֶחָ֣ד ה֑וּא אֵ֣ת אֲשֶׁ֧ר הָאֱלֹהִ֛ים עֹשֶׂ֖ה הִגִּ֥יד לְפַרְעֹֽה׃|25 E|And Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams are one and the same: Pharaoh has been told what God is about to do.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Yaakov's blessing canceling harmful decrees, while those who study Jewish law create bodies for evil forces. The Commentary highlights God's prophetic dream to Pharaoh about abundance and famine, with Joseph emphasizing the importance of preparation. The Midrash discusses Pharaoh seeking interpretations from magicians and the significance of the number "one" in Joseph's interpretation. Musar reflects on Joseph's rise to power and his constant crediting of God for his accomplishments. Quoting Commentary reinforces the message from God through repetition and the metaphor of animals in Pharaoh's dream. The Targum states that Joseph tells Pharaoh his dream is one and from God. 

|שֶׁ֧בַע פָּרֹ֣ת הַטֹּבֹ֗ת שֶׁ֤בַע שָׁנִים֙ הֵ֔נָּה וְשֶׁ֤בַע הַֽשִּׁבֳּלִים֙ הַטֹּבֹ֔ת שֶׁ֥בַע שָׁנִ֖ים הֵ֑נָּה חֲל֖וֹם אֶחָ֥ד הֽוּא׃|26 E|The seven healthy cows are seven years, and the seven healthy ears are seven years; it is the same dream.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Siftei Chakhamim, and Steinsaltz explain that the dream of the cows and ears was repeated twice to emphasize the imminent nature of the events, with the cows symbolizing growth and abundance and the ears representing the cyclical nature of growth. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret the dream as symbolizing seven years of abundance represented by the seven good cows and ears. 

|וְשֶׁ֣בַע הַ֠פָּר֠וֹת הָֽרַקּ֨וֹת וְהָרָעֹ֜ת הָעֹלֹ֣ת אַחֲרֵיהֶ֗ן שֶׁ֤בַע שָׁנִים֙ הֵ֔נָּה וְשֶׁ֤בַע הַֽשִּׁבֳּלִים֙ הָרֵק֔וֹת שְׁדֻפ֖וֹת הַקָּדִ֑ים יִהְי֕וּ שֶׁ֖בַע שְׁנֵ֥י רָעָֽב׃|27 E|The seven lean and ugly cows that followed are seven years, as are also the seven empty ears scorched by the east wind; they are seven years of famine.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph accurately predicted the seven years of famine in Pharaoh's dream, warning against complacency during the preceding abundance. Through prayer and blessings, Joseph managed to reduce the famine from 42 to only two years. The sequence of names in Genesis 36 should be memorized consistently, and the symbolic representation of famine in the dream is confirmed in both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. 

|ה֣וּא הַדָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּ֖רְתִּי אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֧ר הָאֱלֹהִ֛ים עֹשֶׂ֖ה הֶרְאָ֥ה אֶת־פַּרְעֹֽה׃|28 E|It is just as I have told Pharaoh: Pharaoh has been shown what God is about to do.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains Yaakov's arrival in Egypt allowed for the annulment of the famine through prayer, contradicting Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream. Sforno and Radak emphasize that God forewarned Pharaoh of the famine to prevent destruction in Egypt. Musar commentary highlights the symbolism of Jacob sending Joseph from Emek Chevron and the need to publicize belief in Divine providence in impure places like Egypt. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Genesis 41:28 as God revealing His plans to Pharaoh. 

|הִנֵּ֛ה שֶׁ֥בַע שָׁנִ֖ים בָּא֑וֹת שָׂבָ֥ע גָּד֖וֹל בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|29 E|Immediately ahead are seven years of great abundance in all the land of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Rashbam discuss the correct reading of the prayer without a vav, emphasizing that "sava" is a noun like "ra'av." Or HaChaim points out Joseph's specification of plenty only in Egypt and worldwide famine, supported by the description of the cows. Steinsaltz connects the seven years of plenty to the fat cows and good ears. Ramban explains that the cows and ears of corn symbolize plowing and harvesting in Pharaoh's dream, with the river representing abundance or famine in Egypt. The stored food was only in Egypt, indicating the specificity of the abundance, while the famine affected all lands. Joseph's interpretation highlighted the distinction between Egypt's ability to store food and other countries' inability to do so. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the upcoming seven years of abundance in Egypt as predicted by Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream. 

|וְ֠קָ֠מוּ שֶׁ֜בַע שְׁנֵ֤י רָעָב֙ אַחֲרֵיהֶ֔ן וְנִשְׁכַּ֥ח כׇּל־הַשָּׂבָ֖ע בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם וְכִלָּ֥ה הָרָעָ֖ב אֶת־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|30 E|After them will come seven years of famine, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. As the land is ravaged by famine,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The phrase "ונשכח כל השבע" in Genesis 41:30 represents the act of swallowing, symbolizing the seven years of famine that will devastate Egypt after seven years of abundance (Onkelos Genesis 41:30, Targum Jonathan on Genesis 41:30). 

|וְלֹֽא־יִוָּדַ֤ע הַשָּׂבָע֙ בָּאָ֔רֶץ מִפְּנֵ֛י הָרָעָ֥ב הַה֖וּא אַחֲרֵי־כֵ֑ן כִּֽי־כָבֵ֥ד ה֖וּא מְאֹֽד׃|31 E|no trace of the abundance will be left in the land because of the famine thereafter, for it will be very severe.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream in Genesis 41:31 suggests that the good years of plenty will not be recognized because the famine that follows will consume all the produce of the good years, leaving nothing behind. Both Rashi and Targum Jonathan connect this idea to the notion that the previous abundance of the land will not be remembered. 

|וְעַ֨ל הִשָּׁנ֧וֹת הַחֲל֛וֹם אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה פַּעֲמָ֑יִם כִּֽי־נָכ֤וֹן הַדָּבָר֙ מֵעִ֣ם הָאֱלֹהִ֔ים וּמְמַהֵ֥ר הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים לַעֲשֹׂתֽוֹ׃|32 E|As for Pharaoh having had the same dream twice, it means that the matter has been determined by God, and that God will soon carry it out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators, including Ramban, Ibn Ezra, and Or HaChaim, explain that Pharaoh's dream was shown twice to emphasize the imminent fulfillment of the events, specifically the impending famine after years of plenty. The importance of the Day of Atonement in symbolizing unity with God and the consequences of disobedience, such as the death of a High Priest, are highlighted in Jewish Thought. In Midrash, R. Jochanan states that dreams repeated by the same person are significant, as seen in Pharaoh's doubled dream in Genesis. Rabbi Yoḥanan in the Talmud also mentions that dreams repeated multiple times are fulfilled, similar to Pharaoh's dream being shown twice to confirm its divine origin and quick fulfillment. 

|וְעַתָּה֙ יֵרֶ֣א פַרְעֹ֔ה אִ֖ישׁ נָב֣וֹן וְחָכָ֑ם וִישִׁיתֵ֖הוּ עַל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|33 E|“Accordingly, let Pharaoh find someone  who’s discerning and wise, whom you can set over the land of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph advised Pharaoh to appoint a discerning and wise man to oversee the administration of the land, ensuring the provision of food for the people and the preservation of surplus grain during the seven years of abundance to prepare for the impending famine. Joseph suggested himself for the position, emphasizing the need for someone with exceptional qualities to fulfill the task effectively. 

|יַעֲשֶׂ֣ה פַרְעֹ֔ה וְיַפְקֵ֥ד פְּקִדִ֖ים עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ וְחִמֵּשׁ֙ אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם בְּשֶׁ֖בַע שְׁנֵ֥י הַשָּׂבָֽע׃|34 E|And let Pharaoh take steps to appoint overseers over the land, and organize  the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph advised Pharaoh to collect and store one fifth of the harvest during years of plenty to prepare for famine, saving lives (Various Commentaries). The fallen angels desired human women, reflecting man's leadership over angels (Kabbalah). Joseph, the wise man, saved Egypt from famine but was only remembered by God (Midrash). Various commentators discuss the meaning of armed provisions in preparing for journeys (Quoting Commentary). Pharaoh should appoint officials to prepare Egypt during years of abundance by storing one part in five of the land's produce (Targum). 

|וְיִקְבְּצ֗וּ אֶת־כׇּל־אֹ֙כֶל֙ הַשָּׁנִ֣ים הַטֹּב֔וֹת הַבָּאֹ֖ת הָאֵ֑לֶּה וְיִצְבְּרוּ־בָ֞ר תַּ֧חַת יַד־פַּרְעֹ֛ה אֹ֥כֶל בֶּעָרִ֖ים וְשָׁמָֽרוּ׃|35 E|Let all the food of these good years that are coming be gathered, and let the grain be collected under Pharaoh’s authority as food to be stored in the cities.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut suggests that Noach's responsibility to feed animals in the ark allowed for the permission to eat meat, as seen in the Torah's use of the word אכול. Various commentaries offer interpretations of Joseph's advice to collect and store grain, with Rashi highlighting the connection between abundance of food and the work of the poor. The Targum emphasizes the importance of storing grain under Pharaoh's authority during times of plenty. 

|וְהָיָ֨ה הָאֹ֤כֶל לְפִקָּדוֹן֙ לָאָ֔רֶץ לְשֶׁ֙בַע֙ שְׁנֵ֣י הָרָעָ֔ב אֲשֶׁ֥ר תִּהְיֶ֖יןָ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם וְלֹֽא־תִכָּרֵ֥ת הָאָ֖רֶץ בָּרָעָֽב׃|36 E|Let that food be a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will come upon the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish in the famine.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph stored food as a reserve under Pharaoh's officers to prevent famine in Egypt, ensuring the land's survival. The seven years of plenty led to a severe famine, affecting neighboring regions, and Joseph sold grain to Egyptians, intensifying the famine. The Mishnah states that obligations in a marriage contract must be fulfilled, even if omitted. Pharaoh was advised to appoint wise commissioners to collect and store food during abundance for future famine, as seen in Genesis 41:33-36. The Targum emphasizes that the stored grain will prevent the people from perishing due to hunger during the seven years of famine in Egypt. 

|וַיִּיטַ֥ב הַדָּבָ֖ר בְּעֵינֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה וּבְעֵינֵ֖י כׇּל־עֲבָדָֽיו׃|37 E|The plan pleased Pharaoh and all his courtiers.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh and his ministers approved of Joseph's plan and advice, recognizing his wisdom and practicality, which led to widespread approval among all who heard the proposal. Joseph's interpretation of dreams is seen as a gift from God, illustrating the connection between wisdom and vision. Joseph's charisma and beauty were so intense that he found favor with everyone he encountered, even being recognized by Pharaoh as having the Spirit of God within him. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 41:37 state that Pharaoh and his servants approved of the plan. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֖ה אֶל־עֲבָדָ֑יו הֲנִמְצָ֣א כָזֶ֔ה אִ֕ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֛ר ר֥וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֖ים בּֽוֹ׃|38 E|And Pharaoh said to his courtiers, “Could we find another like him—a man with the divine spirit?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Yosef represents rectification by mitigating the bad and protecting from humiliation, linked to guarding the eye from imagination. Commentary highlights Pharaoh's recognition of Yosef's exceptional wisdom and divine inspiration, leading to his appointment as viceroy despite hesitations due to his Hebrew origin. Jewish Thought discusses understanding God's attributes through light, the progression of the soul towards prophetic insights, and the denial of prophecy to those undeserving. Midrash emphasizes the significance of loving the Torah, praises Yosef for his wisdom, and highlights his exceptional qualities recognized by Pharaoh. Musar discusses the severity of lashon hara using Yosef's punishment and rise to glory as an example, contrasting Pharaoh's reaction to Moses presenting himself as a messenger of God. Quoting Commentary mentions Margaret Thatcher praising Lord Young for bringing solutions like Yosef's wisdom, and Targum notes Pharaoh's recognition of Joseph's divine spirit from the Lord. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר פַּרְעֹה֙ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף אַחֲרֵ֨י הוֹדִ֧יעַ אֱלֹהִ֛ים אוֹתְךָ֖ אֶת־כׇּל־זֹ֑את אֵין־נָב֥וֹן וְחָכָ֖ם כָּמֽוֹךָ׃|39 E|So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is none so discerning and wise as you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yosef's rulership is connected to Chokhmah and Binah, representing wisdom and understanding, which were recognized by Pharaoh, leading to his appointment as a trusted advisor based on his insight into interpreting dreams and handling the upcoming famine. The Rabbi uses a simile of the sun and different types of light to explain the attributes of God, relating Elōhim to the prophets and Adonāi to the patriarchs, emphasizing the importance of prophecy and divine connection. In the Midrash, Rabbi Yossi discusses the merit and punishment coinciding with specific days, such as the destruction of the First and Second Temples, and highlights Judah's wisdom in dealing with Joseph's anger. Pharaoh acknowledged that Joseph had a unique understanding of wisdom, understanding, and knowledge, which was inspired by his representative in the Celestial Regions. 

|אַתָּה֙ תִּהְיֶ֣ה עַל־בֵּיתִ֔י וְעַל־פִּ֖יךָ יִשַּׁ֣ק כׇּל־עַמִּ֑י רַ֥ק הַכִּסֵּ֖א אֶגְדַּ֥ל מִמֶּֽךָּ׃|40 E|You shall be in charge of my court, and by your command shall all my people be directed;  only with respect to the throne shall I be superior to you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's favoritism towards Benjamin foreshadows Mordechai's role in the Purim story, reflecting the Chasidic belief that forefathers' actions predict descendants' lives. Joseph's position under Pharaoh parallels Mordechai's under Achashverosh, emphasizing the connection between the two stories. Different interpretations of Genesis 41:40 suggest Joseph's limited authority in specific matters, with the throne remaining Pharaoh's. Rabbi Yishmael warns against sinful behavior, highlighting the importance of respecting authority and following God's decrees. Maimonides and Nachmanides disagree on the nature of eventual perfection, with Nachmanides believing it applies to both body and soul, supported by Midrash Rabbah. Psalm 105:21 states that God made Joseph master of his household and gave him authority over all his possessions. Joseph's role as head of Pharaoh's house and provider for the people is emphasized in the Targum. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֖ה אֶל־יוֹסֵ֑ף רְאֵה֙ נָתַ֣תִּי אֹֽתְךָ֔ עַ֖ל כׇּל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|41 E|Pharaoh further said to Joseph, “See, I put you in charge of all the land of Egypt.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh appoints Joseph as the supreme authority in Egypt, symbolized by the handing over of his ring and other symbols of office, acknowledging Joseph's wisdom and appointing him to oversee the land. Joseph's new role as a leader and administrator is further solidified by his actions during the years of plenty and famine. The lightbodies were created to provide warmth and indicate seasons, existing before but now taking on these functions, with their purpose and timing being significant. Joseph correctly interprets Pharaoh's dream, advising him to appoint a wise man to manage the coming years of plenty and famine, which Pharaoh agrees to after seeing the signs of Joseph's words coming true. Abraham was proclaimed ruler of Egypt, proud of being Hebrew, and gloried in doing nothing. Joseph wore a golden collar and royal ring, symbols of necessity and gift. Pharaoh appoints Joseph as ruler over all of Egypt, as stated in both Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 41:41. 

|וַיָּ֨סַר פַּרְעֹ֤ה אֶת־טַבַּעְתּוֹ֙ מֵעַ֣ל יָד֔וֹ וַיִּתֵּ֥ן אֹתָ֖הּ עַל־יַ֣ד יוֹסֵ֑ף וַיַּלְבֵּ֤שׁ אֹתוֹ֙ בִּגְדֵי־שֵׁ֔שׁ וַיָּ֛שֶׂם רְבִ֥ד הַזָּהָ֖ב עַל־צַוָּארֽוֹ׃|42 E|And removing his signet ring from his hand, Pharaoh put it on Joseph’s hand; and he had him dressed in robes of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh gave Joseph his ring, linen garments, and a gold chain, symbolizing Joseph's leadership and high office in Egypt. Licentiousness leads to chaos and destruction, as seen in historical events. The Mishnah describes the fire chamber in the Temple where elders slept with the keys. Yosef's changing clothing signifies his maturing attitude, and the importance of following commandments is emphasized. The symbolism of Joseph's attire in dreams contrasts with earthly adornments, as seen with Tamar. 

|וַיַּרְכֵּ֣ב אֹת֗וֹ בְּמִרְכֶּ֤בֶת הַמִּשְׁנֶה֙ אֲשֶׁר־ל֔וֹ וַיִּקְרְא֥וּ לְפָנָ֖יו אַבְרֵ֑ךְ וְנָת֣וֹן אֹת֔וֹ עַ֖ל כׇּל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|43 E|He had him ride in the chariot of his second-in-command, and they cried before him, “Abrek!”  Thus he placed him over all the land of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the connection between rectifying the brit and receiving double bounty, as seen with Moshe and Yosef, highlighting the relationship between wisdom and glory. The blessings over commandments symbolize the flow of blessings from the world to the world, as exemplified by Yosef being called Avrekh. Commentary delves into the meanings of the terms "mishneh" and "avrekh" in Genesis, emphasizing the significance of Joseph's righteousness in his exaltation by Pharaoh. Musar reflects on Abraham's journey through Egypt and his pursuit of true wisdom, while Second Temple commentary explores the dangers of succumbing to vainglory. Talmud discusses the interpretations of biblical references related to Pharaoh's chariot and the term "reikha," while Targum highlights Yosef's high position in Egypt and his wisdom and youth. 

|וַיֹּ֧אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֛ה אֶל־יוֹסֵ֖ף אֲנִ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה וּבִלְעָדֶ֗יךָ לֹֽא־יָרִ֨ים אִ֧ישׁ אֶת־יָד֛וֹ וְאֶת־רַגְל֖וֹ בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|44 E|Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh; yet without you, no one shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teaches that through the tzaddik, represented by Yosef, faith increases and atheism disappears, leading to dancing and hand-clapping. The importance of respecting printers' exclusive rights is emphasized. In the commentary, Pharaoh asserts his authority over Egypt, declaring Joseph as having ultimate authority. The Midrash discusses Joseph's righteousness and the rewards of observing commandments. Rabbeinu Bahya emphasizes God's rewards for observing His commandments. In the Talmud, Rabbi Yoḥanan believed Pharaoh saw royal characteristics in Joseph, while Rebbi Abbahu argues for the importance of benedictions. In Tanakh, God identifies himself as יהוה to Moses. Targum describes Pharaoh acknowledging Joseph as his viceregent. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֨א פַרְעֹ֣ה שֵׁם־יוֹסֵף֮ צָֽפְנַ֣ת פַּעְנֵ֒חַ֒ וַיִּתֶּן־ל֣וֹ אֶת־אָֽסְנַ֗ת בַּת־פּ֥וֹטִי פֶ֛רַע כֹּהֵ֥ן אֹ֖ן לְאִשָּׁ֑ה וַיֵּצֵ֥א יוֹסֵ֖ף עַל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|45 E P|Pharaoh then gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah;  and he gave him for a wife Asenath daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On. Thus Joseph emerged in charge of the land of Egypt.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, it is explained that God allowed Potiphar to believe his wife's false accusations against Joseph to bring about the downfall of the wicked. In Commentary, Joseph married Osnat, possibly to avoid being considered a slave, and she was believed to be the daughter of Dinah. In Jewish Thought, Yosef was known as "one who explains what is hidden" and it is a mission of Mashiach ben Yosef to explain hints in the Torah. In Midrash, Joseph's suffering with Potiphar's wife led to his marriage with Asenath. In Quoting Commentary, changing names signifies promotion, as seen with Joseph and Joshua. In Second Temple, Joseph changes his name to Psonthomphanech and chooses a priest as his father-in-law. In Talmud, Potiphar intended homosexual intercourse with Joseph but was castrated by the angel Gabriel. In Tanakh, names are changed and young men will be killed by the sword. In Targum, Pharaoh named Joseph Tzafnas Paneiach and he became ruler over Egypt. 

|וְיוֹסֵף֙ בֶּן־שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה בְּעׇמְד֕וֹ לִפְנֵ֖י פַּרְעֹ֣ה מֶֽלֶךְ־מִצְרָ֑יִם וַיֵּצֵ֤א יוֹסֵף֙ מִלִּפְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה וַֽיַּעֲבֹ֖ר בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|46 E P|Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt.—Leaving Pharaoh’s presence, Joseph traveled through all the land of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph, at thirty, assumed high office in Egypt, overseeing storage facilities and fields, and his reputation spread throughout the land. He married Osnath, built a grand house, and was greatly respected, increasing in greatness. The letter ל in the alphabet represents Torah and its essence, taken by Moses from Joseph to give the Torah to the Jewish people. Jacob should have been at least a hundred and seven when Joseph was thirty, and fulfillment of a good dream can be anticipated up to twenty-two years later, as seen in Joseph's dream being fulfilled after twenty-two years. Yoseif was thirty when he appeared before Pharaoh and then traveled throughout Egypt as a ruler. 

|וַתַּ֣עַשׂ הָאָ֔רֶץ בְּשֶׁ֖בַע שְׁנֵ֣י הַשָּׂבָ֑ע לִקְמָצִֽים׃|47 E|During the seven years of plenty, the land produced in abundance.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

During the seven years of plenty, the earth produced abundant crops, with Joseph overseeing the collection and storage of grain fist by fist, ensuring that each city had enough food without relying on outlying areas. The me'il garment is described as wrapping around the body with no sleeves, Ibn Ezra relates "ve-kamatz" to "li-kematzim" meaning to gather, and Targum describes the storehouses being filled completely with every blade producing two handfuls of grain during the years of abundance. 

|וַיִּקְבֹּ֞ץ אֶת־כׇּל־אֹ֣כֶל ׀ שֶׁ֣בַע שָׁנִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֤ר הָיוּ֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם וַיִּתֶּן־אֹ֖כֶל בֶּעָרִ֑ים אֹ֧כֶל שְׂדֵה־הָעִ֛יר אֲשֶׁ֥ר סְבִיבֹתֶ֖יהָ נָתַ֥ן בְּתוֹכָֽהּ׃|48 E|And he gathered all the grain of the seven years that the land of Egypt was enjoying,  and stored the grain in the cities; he put in each city the grain of the fields around it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph stored various types of food in cities during the years of plenty, paying farmers to encourage cooperation, mixing earth with grain to prevent spoilage, ensuring enough food for everyone in Egypt. The abundance of food stored in cities like Tiberias and Tzippori sufficed for the residents without needing to use grain from outlying areas, symbolizing abundance in Egypt and famine in other lands. Joseph's interpretation of the dream indicated widespread famine in other countries due to their inability to store food, while in Egypt, the grain was stored locally in cities like Tiberias and Tzippori. 

|וַיִּצְבֹּ֨ר יוֹסֵ֥ף בָּ֛ר כְּח֥וֹל הַיָּ֖ם הַרְבֵּ֣ה מְאֹ֑ד עַ֛ד כִּי־חָדַ֥ל לִסְפֹּ֖ר כִּי־אֵ֥ין מִסְפָּֽר׃|49 E|So Joseph collected produce in very large quantity, like the sands of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The surplus of grain during Joseph's time was so vast that it could not be counted, likened to the sand of the sea, leading to wise storage practices for future use. The quality of materials determines a craftsman's status in Jewish thought, with religious philosophy being highly esteemed. Joseph's accumulation of corn during the years of plenty allowed each city to have enough to eat without relying on grain from other areas. Ramban, Rashi, and others provide interpretations of various biblical verses, linking them to the Sabbath and creation. The importance of counting and inclusion is highlighted in determining holiness, as seen in the example of Joseph's corn in Egypt. 

|וּלְיוֹסֵ֤ף יֻלַּד֙ שְׁנֵ֣י בָנִ֔ים בְּטֶ֥רֶם תָּב֖וֹא שְׁנַ֣ת הָרָעָ֑ב אֲשֶׁ֤ר יָֽלְדָה־לּוֹ֙ אָֽסְנַ֔ת בַּת־פּ֥וֹטִי פֶ֖רַע כֹּהֵ֥ן אֽוֹן׃|50 E|Before the years of famine came, Joseph became the father of two sons, whom Asenath daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On, bore to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's sons Ephrayim and Menashe were born before the famine, making them regular grandchildren of Yaakov, reflecting Joseph's fulfillment of the commandment to be fruitful and multiply. Marital relations during a famine were prohibited for those who had not yet fulfilled this commandment, as seen in Joseph's case, while Levi was exempt as he had not yet had a daughter. During times of communal distress, restrictions should be placed on various activities, including sexual relations. The Midrash recounts how Joseph prepared for the famine by storing food, similar to Noah refraining from procreation during difficult times. The Talmud prohibits conjugal relations during famines to avoid children being born in hardship, but those without children may still fulfill the commandment to be fruitful and multiply. Joseph had two sons before the famine, as mentioned in the Targum. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֥א יוֹסֵ֛ף אֶת־שֵׁ֥ם הַבְּכ֖וֹר מְנַשֶּׁ֑ה כִּֽי־נַשַּׁ֤נִי אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת־כׇּל־עֲמָלִ֔י וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־בֵּ֥ית אָבִֽי׃|51 E|Joseph named the first-born Manasseh, meaning, “God has made me forget  completely my hardship and my parental home.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the significance of the names Menashe and Ephraim in relation to trials and tribulations leading to positive outcomes, reflecting a journey towards ultimate good perceived as such. It also explores the concept of increasing or decreasing day by day in spiritual growth, with Beit Shammai focusing on departing from evil and Beit Hillel emphasizing increasing enthusiasm to purify the body. The daughters of Tzelofchad symbolize the five salvations, representing the desire for salvation and redemption, linked to the messianic times. The disagreement between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel is explained in the context of spiritual illumination and purification through enthusiasm and growth, with Joseph naming his firstborn Manasseh to signify forgetting past hardships and moving forward in fulfillment of his destiny. Moses named his son Gershom to recall being a stranger in a foreign land, while Jacob arrived intact in body, children, wealth, and studies, with Joseph forgetting his Torah studies in Egypt. Ramban, Tur HaArokh, and Rashi provide interpretations of key phrases in Deuteronomy, emphasizing Moses' role in explaining the Torah to the Israelites. Yosef named his firstborn Menasheh to signify moving on from past troubles and his father's house, with God's help in forgetting the past. 

|וְאֵ֛ת שֵׁ֥ם הַשֵּׁנִ֖י קָרָ֣א אֶפְרָ֑יִם כִּֽי־הִפְרַ֥נִי אֱלֹהִ֖ים בְּאֶ֥רֶץ עׇנְיִֽי׃|52 E|And the second he named Ephraim, meaning, “God has made me fertile  in the land of my affliction.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The name Menasheh signifies forgetfulness of ancestry and past struggles, while Ephraim symbolizes becoming fruitful through holy thoughts, reflecting two paths of diminishing bodily desires or increasing spiritual enlightenment. Joseph named his second son Ephraim as a reminder of his gratitude for God's blessings after his suffering, connecting the name to his own success and rise to prominence in the land of his affliction. The text discusses the uncertainty of whether Shem or Yefet is the eldest son of Noah, with evidence suggesting Yefet is the eldest, and highlights how Ephraim's humility led to him receiving the birthright. Joseph named his sons Manasseh and Ephraim to reflect his experiences, and Moses named his son Gershom to signify feeling like a stranger in a foreign land. 

|וַתִּכְלֶ֕ינָה שֶׁ֖בַע שְׁנֵ֣י הַשָּׂבָ֑ע אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָיָ֖ה בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|53 E|The seven years of abundance that the land of Egypt enjoyed came to an end,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The seven years of plenty in Egypt ended, leading to a famine that affected Egypt and three other lands. Joseph sold grain to the Egyptians, intensifying the famine in Egypt. Pharaoh directed them to Joseph, who compelled them to circumcise themselves, ensuring their lives in the World to Come. The Targum states that the seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end as prophesied. 

|וַתְּחִלֶּ֜ינָה שֶׁ֣בַע שְׁנֵ֤י הָרָעָב֙ לָב֔וֹא כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר אָמַ֣ר יוֹסֵ֑ף וַיְהִ֤י רָעָב֙ בְּכׇל־הָ֣אֲרָצ֔וֹת וּבְכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם הָ֥יָה לָֽחֶם׃|54 E|and the seven years of famine set in, just as Joseph had foretold. There was famine in all lands, but throughout the land of Egypt there was bread.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The famine during the seven years of plenty affected lands surrounding Egypt, but Egypt was spared due to Joseph's foresight in storing food in cities. The transition from abundance to famine was abrupt in Egypt due to its reliance on the Nile for irrigation. During the famine, the Egyptians began to look sickly as food supplies ran out. After the seven years of plenty, hunger spread throughout Egypt, and Joseph compelled the Egyptians to circumcise themselves before selling them grain. Pharaoh's dream symbolized the coming abundance and famine in Egypt, with Joseph's wisdom in managing the food supply highlighted. The seven years of famine began as foretold by Joseph, with Egypt being the only land with bread available. 

|וַתִּרְעַב֙ כׇּל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם וַיִּצְעַ֥ק הָעָ֛ם אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה לַלָּ֑חֶם וַיֹּ֨אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֤ה לְכׇל־מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ לְכ֣וּ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף אֲשֶׁר־יֹאמַ֥ר לָכֶ֖ם תַּעֲשֽׂוּ׃|55 E|And when all the land of Egypt felt the hunger, the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; whatever he tells you, you shall do.”—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph maintained his Jewish identity in Egypt by keeping his Jewish name, although he received an Egyptian title from Pharaoh. However, Sefat Emet criticizes Joseph for requiring the Egyptians to be circumcised before receiving food during the famine. This act led to the people following Joseph's orders to avoid further consequences, as Pharaoh recognized Joseph as the supplier of grain. The land of Egypt is associated with impurity, and Joseph's actions symbolized purification from the serpent's influence. Radak explains that the word "כל" in Genesis 41:55 does not always mean "all," but rather "most," as seen in other examples in Scripture. Targum Jonathan on Genesis 41:55 also highlights how Pharaoh directed the people to follow Joseph's instructions during the famine. 

|וְהָרָעָ֣ב הָיָ֔ה עַ֖ל כׇּל־פְּנֵ֣י הָאָ֑רֶץ וַיִּפְתַּ֨ח יוֹסֵ֜ף אֶֽת־כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֤ר בָּהֶם֙ וַיִּשְׁבֹּ֣ר לְמִצְרַ֔יִם וַיֶּחֱזַ֥ק הָֽרָעָ֖ב בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|56 E|Accordingly, when the famine became severe in the land of Egypt, Joseph laid open all that was within, and rationed out grain to the Egyptians. The famine, however, spread over the whole world.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The concept of wealth and blessings being hidden within the mundane is highlighted in Yosef's actions during the famine, where he managed the distribution of grain to prevent panic and speculation. The severity of the famine led to Egyptians being compelled to circumcise themselves before receiving bread, with the wealthy being affected first. Yosef's measures aimed to alleviate the situation, ensuring order and providing for the people. Joseph's actions also included collecting surplus grain to prevent waste and profiteering, distributing rations per family to manage resources effectively. 

|וְכׇל־הָאָ֙רֶץ֙ בָּ֣אוּ מִצְרַ֔יְמָה לִשְׁבֹּ֖ר אֶל־יוֹסֵ֑ף כִּֽי־חָזַ֥ק הָרָעָ֖ב בְּכׇל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|57 E|So all the world came to Joseph in Egypt to procure rations, for the famine had become severe throughout the world.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

All countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph during a severe famine, fulfilling the prophecy that all the earth would come to him. Joseph ruled as king for forty years after being appointed second to the king of Egypt, implementing strict laws for purchasing food. In Zohar, Joseph symbolizes justice and is favored by God, while in Targum, people from all countries sought grain from Joseph as a place of economic refuge. Rav Yehuda said Joseph collected all the silver and gold in the world and brought it to Egypt during the famine, as stated in Genesis 47:14. 

## Genesis 42

|וַיַּ֣רְא יַעֲקֹ֔ב כִּ֥י יֶשׁ־שֶׁ֖בֶר בְּמִצְרָ֑יִם וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ לְבָנָ֔יו לָ֖מָּה תִּתְרָאֽוּ׃|1 J|When Jacob saw that there were food rations to be had in Egypt, he  said to his sons, “Why do you keep looking at one another?|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how Divine light elevates material darkness to clarify and elevate Torah, symbolized by Joseph's descent to Egypt. Jacob's concern for his family's survival in Egypt is highlighted. Halakhah dictates completing a fast if a situation improves, adapting to fasting practices when traveling. Solomon emphasizes the importance of structure in a household, correlating it with natural processes. Jacob's prophetic actions regarding Egypt are discussed in Kabbalah and Midrash. Musar stresses the importance of avoiding envy and judgment by hiding abundance. Various commentaries address the concept of "seeing" events and understanding mentally. Talmud advises minimizing indulgence after breaking a fast. Yaakov's observation of grain in Egypt prompts him to send his sons for provisions. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר הִנֵּ֣ה שָׁמַ֔עְתִּי כִּ֥י יֶשׁ־שֶׁ֖בֶר בְּמִצְרָ֑יִם רְדוּ־שָׁ֙מָּה֙ וְשִׁבְרוּ־לָ֣נוּ מִשָּׁ֔ם וְנִחְיֶ֖ה וְלֹ֥א נָמֽוּת׃|2 J|Now I hear,” he went on, “that there are rations to be had in Egypt. Go down and procure rations for us there, that we may live and not die.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Joseph's descent as a metaphor for Torah reaching lowest levels to elevate wisdom, focusing on internal essence. Commentary notes interpretations of "shivru" and significance of term "רדו" in relation to 210 years in Egypt. Midrash highlights brothers' descent, offerings symbolizing historical events, and significance of not entering through one gate. Quoting Commentary discusses duration of Israelites' exile, different interpretations of timing, and redemption from exile using numerical allusions. Responsa caution against calculating exact date of Redemption and Messiah's arrival. Targum states Jacob sends sons to Egypt to buy grain during famine. 

|וַיֵּרְד֥וּ אֲחֵֽי־יוֹסֵ֖ף עֲשָׂרָ֑ה לִשְׁבֹּ֥ר בָּ֖ר מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃|3 J|So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to get grain rations in Egypt;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's brothers traveled to Egypt in groups of ten to purchase grain, with the intention of redeeming Joseph. The number ten was significant in forming a quorum for prayer and fulfilling Joseph's dreams. Midrash texts explore the symbolism and significance of the number ten, Jacob's decision to send all ten brothers to Egypt, and Abraham's experiences mirroring those of his descendants. The Talmud emphasizes the importance of speaking wisely and waiting for one's turn to speak, using examples from biblical figures like Job, Judah, and Moses. Additionally, the Targum highlights how Joseph's ten brothers went to Egypt to buy grain. 

|וְאֶת־בִּנְיָמִין֙ אֲחִ֣י יוֹסֵ֔ף לֹא־שָׁלַ֥ח יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶת־אֶחָ֑יו כִּ֣י אָמַ֔ר פֶּן־יִקְרָאֶ֖נּוּ אָסֽוֹן׃|4 J|for Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, since he feared that he might meet with disaster.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra mentions harm and death, Radak explains Binyamin's unique relationship to Joseph, Rashi explains the fear of mischief befalling Binyamin, and Benjamin was not sent with the other brothers to avoid disaster. The Midrash highlights the true purpose of their journey - to find Joseph, not just to buy grain. The Talmud discusses Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana's opinion on harm caused by man versus harm caused by Heaven, while Rav Adda bar Ahava argues against this distinction. Yaakov did not send Binyamin with his brothers to Egypt because he feared misfortune or death might befall him, as he was still a young man according to the Targum. 

|וַיָּבֹ֙אוּ֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לִשְׁבֹּ֖ר בְּת֣וֹךְ הַבָּאִ֑ים כִּֽי־הָיָ֥ה הָרָעָ֖ב בְּאֶ֥רֶץ כְּנָֽעַן׃|5 E|Thus the sons of Israel were among those who came to procure rations, for the famine extended to the land of Canaan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains Joseph's behavior towards his brothers in Egypt as a way to prevent conflict, while Commentary discusses the brothers disguising themselves to avoid danger. Halakhah emphasizes God's unity with His knowledge, and Midrash discusses the power of ten in setting aside retribution and sanctifying God's name. Quoting Commentary and Talmud both highlight the importance of a congregation of ten for religious observations, with Targum mentioning the brothers buying grain individually to avoid the evil eye. 

|וְיוֹסֵ֗ף ה֚וּא הַשַּׁלִּ֣יט עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ ה֥וּא הַמַּשְׁבִּ֖יר לְכׇל־עַ֣ם הָאָ֑רֶץ וַיָּבֹ֙אוּ֙ אֲחֵ֣י יוֹסֵ֔ף וַיִּשְׁתַּֽחֲווּ־ל֥וֹ אַפַּ֖יִם אָֽרְצָה׃|6 E|Now Joseph was the vizier of the land; it was he who dispensed rations to all the people of the land. And Joseph’s brothers came and bowed low to him, with their faces to the ground.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's role as ruler in Egypt focused on improving the well-being of the population through religious reorientation, embodying aspects of both severity and benevolence as a true tzaddik. He personally sold grain to all, including his brothers, to confront them, symbolizing the importance of maintaining personal integrity while providing for others. Yosef overpowered impurity in the land, representing the sun ruling over the moon in Kabbalah, and combining Torah and Priesthood for Torah's sake in Musar. Prostration before Joseph reflected his authority and the fulfillment of his dreams, as seen in Targum and Commentary. Jacob's offering in the tabernacle symbolized his blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh, reflecting the roles of Jacob and Joseph in the family in Midrash. Joseph's example of interacting with the world while maintaining integrity is highlighted in various commentaries, showing it is possible to uphold personal values while providing for others. Rava in Talmud emphasizes the blessings received for teaching halakha, comparing it to Joseph's role as a provider to all the people of the land. 

|וַיַּ֥רְא יוֹסֵ֛ף אֶת־אֶחָ֖יו וַיַּכִּרֵ֑ם וַיִּתְנַכֵּ֨ר אֲלֵיהֶ֜ם וַיְדַבֵּ֧ר אִתָּ֣ם קָשׁ֗וֹת וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ מֵאַ֣יִן בָּאתֶ֔ם וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ כְּנַ֖עַן לִשְׁבׇּר־אֹֽכֶל׃|7 E|When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them; but he acted like a stranger toward them and spoke harshly to them. He asked them, “Where do you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan, to procure food.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph recognized his brothers immediately and disguised himself by speaking harshly to test their honesty and loyalty, ultimately revealing his true identity after confirming their remorse for their past actions. The brothers, including Reuben and Judah, were willing to redeem Simeon and bring Benjamin to Egypt, leading to a transformation in their relationships and understanding of one another. The term "וידבר" implies censorious speech, and Yosef is described as "yitnaker" to his brothers, possibly indicating that he disguised himself as a non-Jew. 

|וַיַּכֵּ֥ר יוֹסֵ֖ף אֶת־אֶחָ֑יו וְהֵ֖ם לֹ֥א הִכִּרֻֽהוּ׃|8 J|For though Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph recognized his brothers due to their beards and knowledge of their names, while they did not recognize him because of his changed appearance and belief that he was dead. The Torah emphasizes Joseph's brotherly love in not harming his brothers. The blessing in the Amidah prayer curses apostates and heretics, denouncing those who oppose God. Yosef's recognition of his brothers reflects the trait of Mashiach ben Yosef in every generation, with Satan hiding his characteristics. Rabbi Yohanan connects the Tamar/Yehuda episode to Yosef's story, highlighting Yehuda's punishment for betraying his brother and father. In the Talmud, it is discussed how one's appearance can change over time, leading to legal arguments about recognition. 

|וַיִּזְכֹּ֣ר יוֹסֵ֔ף אֵ֚ת הַחֲלֹמ֔וֹת אֲשֶׁ֥ר חָלַ֖ם לָהֶ֑ם וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ מְרַגְּלִ֣ים אַתֶּ֔ם לִרְא֛וֹת אֶת־עֶרְוַ֥ת הָאָ֖רֶץ בָּאתֶֽם׃|9 J|Recalling the dreams that he had dreamed about them, Joseph said to them, “You are spies, you have come to see the land in its nakedness.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the priestly garments correspond to aspects of spiritual growth, with angels recognizing God's glory in Israel through Torah and mitzvot. Joseph's actions towards his brothers in Egypt were driven by his interpretation of dreams and suspicion of their intentions. Midrash discusses the purpose of the earth and the eternal connection between Israel and the Torah, while Musar focuses on the loyalty and defense of the brothers. Commentary and Targum highlight Joseph's testing of his brothers and accusation of spying, reflecting his wisdom and desire to fulfill his dreams. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֥וּ אֵלָ֖יו לֹ֣א אֲדֹנִ֑י וַעֲבָדֶ֥יךָ בָּ֖אוּ לִשְׁבׇּר־אֹֽכֶל׃|10 J|But they said to him, “No, my lord! Truly, your servants have come to procure food.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers denied being spies, stating they came to Egypt to buy food, which was seen as a natural explanation for their journey. Joseph accused them of spying despite their explanation. Joseph recognized his brothers when they came to Egypt to buy food, but he pretended to be a stranger to them and accused them of being spies. Ultimately, Jacob agreed to send Benjamin to secure Simeon's release. In Genesis 42:10, Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both describe Joseph's brothers denying that they are spies, stating that they have come to buy grain. 

|כֻּלָּ֕נוּ בְּנֵ֥י אִישׁ־אֶחָ֖ד נָ֑חְנוּ כֵּנִ֣ים אֲנַ֔חְנוּ לֹא־הָי֥וּ עֲבָדֶ֖יךָ מְרַגְּלִֽים׃|11 J|We are all of us sons of the same man; we are being honest; your servants have never been spies!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes unity among the people of Israel for service to God; Liturgy and Commentary highlight the importance of Jewish unity as descendants of Jacob; Midrash teaches a lesson about mocking God's words; Musar discusses the brothers' acknowledgment of Joseph as a substitute for their father; Quoting Commentary connects the Israelites' fear of the Egyptians to their shared ancestry with Abraham; Second Temple commentary praises unity as a reason to hate war and love peace; Targum emphasizes the brothers' honesty and denial of being spies. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֑ם לֹ֕א כִּֽי־עֶרְוַ֥ת הָאָ֖רֶץ בָּאתֶ֥ם לִרְאֽוֹת׃|12 J|And he said to them, “No, you have come to see the land in its nakedness!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph accused his brothers of coming to reveal shameful aspects of Egypt, implying they were not capable of elevating him spiritually without all twelve brothers present. The brothers believed their ability to act as intermediaries to the celestial domain was blocked until all brothers were reunited, as seen by the absence of holy spirit during Yaakov and Joseph's separation. Joseph did not initially believe his brothers were siblings, accusing them of being spies due to entering Egypt through different gates, leading to a revelation of their family situation. Joseph, now vizier, tests his brothers' loyalty by accusing them of being spies before revealing his identity. In the Midrash, Jacob sends his sons to Egypt for food, Joseph recognizes them but they do not recognize him, leading to accusations of spying and Simeon's imprisonment. Judah convinces Jacob to send Benjamin to Egypt, and the text concludes with Jacob's fear for Benjamin's safety. In the Targum, Joseph accuses his brothers of coming to see the exposed land and the nakedness of Egypt's shame. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֗וּ שְׁנֵ֣ים עָשָׂר֩ עֲבָדֶ֨יךָ אַחִ֧ים ׀ אֲנַ֛חְנוּ בְּנֵ֥י אִישׁ־אֶחָ֖ד בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וְהִנֵּ֨ה הַקָּטֹ֤ן אֶת־אָבִ֙ינוּ֙ הַיּ֔וֹם וְהָאֶחָ֖ד אֵינֶֽנּוּ׃|13 J|And they replied, “We your servants were twelve brothers, sons of a certain man in the land of Canaan; the youngest, however, is now with our father, and one is no more.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers of Joseph established their credibility by explaining their family ties and the circumstances of their missing brother, leading Joseph to test their honesty by accusing them of being spies. Maternal brothers are only considered brothers for mourning and witness laws, not for inheritance or levirate marriage. The Talmud and Midrash emphasize the importance of brotherhood and honesty, highlighting the covenant between siblings and the laws of trust and integrity. The Targum also recounts the brothers' explanation of their family situation to Joseph. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֖ם יוֹסֵ֑ף ה֗וּא אֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבַּ֧רְתִּי אֲלֵכֶ֛ם לֵאמֹ֖ר מְרַגְּלִ֥ים אַתֶּֽם׃|14 J|But Joseph said to them, “It is just as I have told you: You are spies!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph accuses his brothers of being spies based on their detailed responses and demands they bring their youngest brother as a test of honesty, leading to Simeon remaining as a hostage. Despite their past actions, Joseph shows mercy, reveals himself, prays for them, and emphasizes divine intervention in the situation through Jacob's omission of all other names and mention of God before Joseph. The Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both mention Joseph's accusation of his brothers as spies in Genesis 42:14. 

|בְּזֹ֖את תִּבָּחֵ֑נוּ חֵ֤י פַרְעֹה֙ אִם־תֵּצְא֣וּ מִזֶּ֔ה כִּ֧י אִם־בְּב֛וֹא אֲחִיכֶ֥ם הַקָּטֹ֖ן הֵֽנָּה׃|15 J|By this you shall be put to the test: unless your youngest brother comes here, by Pharaoh, you shall not depart from this place!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the Rebbe advises a woman to remain still as a test of faith, citing verses from Genesis and Jonah to illustrate that calmness will lead to a positive outcome. In Halakhah, God's knowledge is intrinsic to His being and beyond human comprehension, as shown in biblical references. In Jewish Thought, God is depicted as the intellectus, the ens intelligens, and the ens intelligible, all one and the same, with His attributes reflecting this unity. In Midrash, God seeks for Israel to love, honor, and have awe for one another, paralleling Joseph's actions that did not transgress the Ten Commandments. Ibn Ezra interprets Isaiah 48:10 as God choosing to refine his people through affliction rather than simply selecting them, rejecting the alternate interpretation. In Second Temple, Abraham is depicted as willing to take oaths in opposite directions, swearing by the health of Pharaoh in both positive and negative forms. In Targum, Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain in Genesis 42:15 that the brothers will not be allowed to leave unless their youngest brother is brought to Egypt, as Pharaoh's life is sworn as a guarantee. 

|שִׁלְח֨וּ מִכֶּ֣ם אֶחָד֮ וְיִקַּ֣ח אֶת־אֲחִיכֶם֒ וְאַתֶּם֙ הֵאָ֣סְר֔וּ וְיִבָּֽחֲנוּ֙ דִּבְרֵיכֶ֔ם הַֽאֱמֶ֖ת אִתְּכֶ֑ם וְאִם־לֹ֕א חֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה כִּ֥י מְרַגְּלִ֖ים אַתֶּֽם׃|16 J|Let one of you go and bring your brother, while the rest of you remain confined, that your words may be put to the test whether there is truth in you. Else, by Pharaoh, you are nothing but spies!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teaches that teaching Torah to unworthy students can result in punishment, but imprisonment can rectify this. In the commentary on Genesis 42:16, Joseph tested his brothers' credibility by accusing them of being spies and eventually revealing his identity to them. The Noda BiYehudah commentary discusses the Hebrew grammar in Gen 42:16, focusing on the word "mimchem." In the Second Temple commentary, Abraham's contradictory oaths reflect conflicting values. Both Targums Onkelos and Jonathan recount Joseph testing his brothers in Genesis 42:16 by sending one to bring back their youngest brother while the rest remain locked up. 

|וַיֶּאֱסֹ֥ף אֹתָ֛ם אֶל־מִשְׁמָ֖ר שְׁלֹ֥שֶׁת יָמִֽים׃|17 J|And he confined them in the guardhouse for three days.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Through giving charity joyfully, one can redeem their soul from captivity within the forces of evil and remove the debt owed to these negative forces that rule over their heart, as explained in Tanya, Part IV; Iggeret HaKodesh 4:12. Joseph imprisoned his brothers for three days to instill fear, test their reactions, and ensure their families did not suffer hunger, without causing physical harm or financial loss, as seen in commentary on Joseph's actions. In Bereshit Rabbah 91:7, Joseph tests his brothers to see if they have changed, while in Esther Rabbah 9:2, Haman's wife advises him to hang Mordekhai on a gibbet. Both Ibn Ezra and Chizkuni interpret Exodus 19:15 as being prepared for the third day, with no additional day added by Moses, using examples from other biblical verses. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos explain that Joseph kept his brothers in prison for three days as punishment. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֤ם יוֹסֵף֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַשְּׁלִישִׁ֔י זֹ֥את עֲשׂ֖וּ וִֽחְי֑וּ אֶת־הָאֱלֹהִ֖ים אֲנִ֥י יָרֵֽא׃|18 J|On the third day Joseph said to them, “Do this and you shall live, for I fear God.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 42:18, Joseph teaches the lesson that determination to do God's will is accounted for even when immediate execution is impossible, as shown by the brothers' eventual actions. The Torah warns against being drawn to physical pleasures while eating, emphasizing that eating should be solely for sustenance and to maintain health. In Shemot Rabbah 26:3, Moses instructs Joshua to choose men for war against Amalek, highlighting Joshua's readiness to lead Israel into the Land and the significance of his lineage from Ephraim. Abraham's conduct is commended for resisting lusts and passions and fearing God. 

|אִם־כֵּנִ֣ים אַתֶּ֔ם אֲחִיכֶ֣ם אֶחָ֔ד יֵאָסֵ֖ר בְּבֵ֣ית מִשְׁמַרְכֶ֑ם וְאַתֶּם֙ לְכ֣וּ הָבִ֔יאוּ שֶׁ֖בֶר רַעֲב֥וֹן בָּתֵּיכֶֽם׃|19 J|If you are being honest, let one of you brothers be held in your place of detention, while the rest of you go and take home rations for your starving households;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra interprets "famine of your houses" as a need for corn during a famine, Or HaChaim suggests Joseph let the brothers choose who to hand over for incarceration if honest, Radak explains "shever ra'avon" as breaking hunger from the harvest, Rabbeinu Bahya emphasizes using food for health, not indulgence, Siftei Chakhamim clarifies "your place of guarding" was not made for the brothers, Rashi explains it refers to the house where the brothers are imprisoned. The text discusses linking flesh to provision and perceiving God through it. In Midrash, Joseph prostrates for mercy, Reuben reminds of betrayal, Judah questions their covenant with God, and Joseph's compassion is noted. Musar highlights Joseph providing food based on need, Torah advises against gluttony. Yehudah appeals to Joseph's mercy by recounting Binyamin's circumstances gently. Targum states one brother will be imprisoned if honest, others bring food for their households. 

|וְאֶת־אֲחִיכֶ֤ם הַקָּטֹן֙ תָּבִ֣יאוּ אֵלַ֔י וְיֵאָמְנ֥וּ דִבְרֵיכֶ֖ם וְלֹ֣א תָמ֑וּתוּ וַיַּעֲשׂוּ־כֵֽן׃|20 J|but you must bring me your youngest brother, that your words may be verified and that you may not die.” And they did accordingly.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph warns his brothers of consequences if they do not return with Benjamin, leading to their acknowledgment of guilt and agreement to his terms. The phrase "ויאמנו דבריכם" confirms their commitment to prevent their families from starving. Joseph's compassion allows them to return home, demanding Benjamin as proof of innocence, to which the brothers agree, showing acceptance of his authority. The Midrash emphasizes the importance of mercy in the story, with Joseph seeking and ultimately showing mercy towards his brothers. Ibn Ezra highlights the consequences of their lack of trustworthiness in Genesis 42:20, while Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Joseph's instruction for the brothers to bring Benjamin to verify their words and avoid death. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֞וּ אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־אָחִ֗יו אֲבָל֮ אֲשֵׁמִ֣ים ׀ אֲנַ֘חְנוּ֮ עַל־אָחִ֒ינוּ֒ אֲשֶׁ֨ר רָאִ֜ינוּ צָרַ֥ת נַפְשׁ֛וֹ בְּהִתְחַֽנְנ֥וֹ אֵלֵ֖ינוּ וְלֹ֣א שָׁמָ֑עְנוּ עַל־כֵּן֙ בָּ֣אָה אֵלֵ֔ינוּ הַצָּרָ֖ה הַזֹּֽאת׃|21 E|They said to one another, “Alas, we are being punished on account of our brother, because we looked on at his anguish, yet paid no heed as he pleaded with us. That is why this distress has come upon us.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph strategically placed the words "את האלוקים אני ירא" to emphasize the importance of determination in fulfilling God's will, even if immediate action is not possible. The brothers' acceptance of Joseph's demands led to their security and realization of their past cruelty towards him. During Yom Kippur, the confession acknowledges sins of the current generation and their ancestors, following biblical examples. The importance of remembering and performing mitzvot, as well as the significance of priestly garments and special attire for different occasions, is emphasized in Jewish thought. In the Midrash, the brothers show remorse for their actions only after realizing the gravity of their crime in Egypt. Musar highlights the importance of thorough confession before God, as shame can lead to repentance and forgiveness of sins. Ramban, Radak, Rashi, Gevia Kesef, and Chizkuni provide insights into various biblical texts, offering interpretations and explanations. The Targum underscores the brothers' acknowledgment of guilt for mistreating Joseph, leading to their current predicament. 

|וַיַּ֩עַן֩ רְאוּבֵ֨ן אֹתָ֜ם לֵאמֹ֗ר הֲלוֹא֩ אָמַ֨רְתִּי אֲלֵיכֶ֧ם ׀ לֵאמֹ֛ר אַל־תֶּחֶטְא֥וּ בַיֶּ֖לֶד וְלֹ֣א שְׁמַעְתֶּ֑ם וְגַם־דָּמ֖וֹ הִנֵּ֥ה נִדְרָֽשׁ׃|22 E|Then Reuben spoke up and said to them, “Did I not tell you, ‘Do no wrong to the boy’? But you paid no heed. Now comes the reckoning for his blood.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reuben's warning not to harm Joseph was ignored, leading to their punishment for cruelty and causing Joseph's death. The brothers' hatred towards Joseph stemmed from Jacob's favoritism, resulting in the plan to sell him to Egypt to avoid retribution. The brothers were sincere in their guilt over Joseph's suffering, with Joseph recognizing that it was God who placed him in Egypt. Yehudah's leadership is endorsed by the brothers, confirming him as the leader over Reuben (Ramban on Genesis 37:22:1, Tribal Lands, Chapter 1; Reuven 32, Tze'enah Ure'enah, Miketz 68, Tze'enah Ure'enah, Miketz 72). 

|וְהֵם֙ לֹ֣א יָֽדְע֔וּ כִּ֥י שֹׁמֵ֖עַ יוֹסֵ֑ף כִּ֥י הַמֵּלִ֖יץ בֵּינֹתָֽם׃|23 E|They did not know that Joseph understood, for there was an interpreter between him and them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how speaking with joy and passion in service leads to pleasure in the world of Understanding, with service requiring exertion and longing for the pleasure of the World to Come. Joseph imprisoned Simeon instead of Reuben, leading to various interpretations by commentators such as Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Or HaChaim, Siftei Chakhamim, Rashi, Steinsaltz, and Tze'enah Ure'enah. Yosef's brothers did not recognize his holiness as Mashiach ben Yosef, leading to misunderstandings and different interpretations in Jewish Thought texts like Kol HaTor and Akeidat Yitzchak. Judah's plea for Benjamin's innocence and Joseph's compassion towards his brothers are highlighted in the Midrash, where Joseph's ability to understand different languages is emphasized. The concept of understanding through interpretation is explored further in the Quoting Commentary, with references to biblical verses and insights from Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and Siftei Chakhamim. Joseph's brothers' lack of awareness of his understanding is attributed to an interpreter, Menasheh, in the Targum. 

|וַיִּסֹּ֥ב מֵֽעֲלֵיהֶ֖ם וַיֵּ֑בְךְּ וַיָּ֤שׇׁב אֲלֵהֶם֙ וַיְדַבֵּ֣ר אֲלֵהֶ֔ם וַיִּקַּ֤ח מֵֽאִתָּם֙ אֶת־שִׁמְע֔וֹן וַיֶּאֱסֹ֥ר אֹת֖וֹ לְעֵינֵיהֶֽם׃|24 E|He turned away from them and wept. But he came back to them and spoke to them; and he took Simeon from among them and had him bound before their eyes.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph took Simeon hostage to prevent conflict with Levi, treated him well during his captivity, and released him once the brothers left. This incident led to the ruling that Israelites should not hand over one of their own when demanded by Gentiles without specifying a person. Rabbi Shimeon explains that Yosef showed favoritism towards Shimeon due to his association with strict judgment. The brothers were terrified when Simeon was seized, and they realized their guilt for selling Joseph. Rabbeinu Bahya explains that Joseph imprisoned Simeon because he sought to kill Joseph, a view supported by the Sages in Bereshit Rabbah. 

|וַיְצַ֣ו יוֹסֵ֗ף וַיְמַלְא֣וּ אֶת־כְּלֵיהֶם֮ בָּר֒ וּלְהָשִׁ֤יב כַּסְפֵּיהֶם֙ אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־שַׂקּ֔וֹ וְלָתֵ֥ת לָהֶ֛ם צֵדָ֖ה לַדָּ֑רֶךְ וַיַּ֥עַשׂ לָהֶ֖ם כֵּֽן׃|25 E|Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, return each one’s money to his sack, and give them provisions for the journey; and this was done for them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph showed goodwill towards his brothers by filling their containers with grain and secretly returning their money, aiming to demonstrate his kindness and lack of hostile intentions. The brothers were distressed by the money's return, serving as atonement for their past actions. In the Targum, Joseph provided provisions for their journey, showing his care for them. 

|וַיִּשְׂא֥וּ אֶת־שִׁבְרָ֖ם עַל־חֲמֹרֵיהֶ֑ם וַיֵּלְכ֖וּ מִשָּֽׁם׃|26 J|So they loaded their asses with the rations and departed from there.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers quickly departed with the corn they bought, as mentioned in the Torah. The term "exalted" in reference to God should be understood as elevation in rank and dignity. Joseph commanded his brothers to fill their vessels with grain, restore the silver to their sacks, and provide provisions for the journey. Rabbi Tarfon used the phrase "My son will not go down with you" to indicate disagreement with nonsensical statements. The Targums state that the brothers placed their grain purchases on their donkeys and left. 

|וַיִּפְתַּ֨ח הָאֶחָ֜ד אֶת־שַׂקּ֗וֹ לָתֵ֥ת מִסְפּ֛וֹא לַחֲמֹר֖וֹ בַּמָּל֑וֹן וַיַּרְא֙ אֶת־כַּסְפּ֔וֹ וְהִנֵּה־ה֖וּא בְּפִ֥י אַמְתַּחְתּֽוֹ׃|27 J|As one of them was opening his sack to give feed to his ass at the night encampment, he saw his money right there at the mouth of his bag.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

One brother, possibly Levi or Reuben, found the silver strategically placed by Joseph in his sack at an inn, causing worry among the brothers as they returned home. The Midrash highlights the anxiety and fear caused by the discovery of the silver, leading to accusations and potential disaster. The principle of tit for tat is illustrated in the story, emphasizing justice in poetic ways. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan provide specific details about the brother finding the money in his bag while feeding his donkey at the inn. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֶל־אֶחָיו֙ הוּשַׁ֣ב כַּסְפִּ֔י וְגַ֖ם הִנֵּ֣ה בְאַמְתַּחְתִּ֑י וַיֵּצֵ֣א לִבָּ֗ם וַיֶּֽחֶרְד֞וּ אִ֤ישׁ אֶל־אָחִיו֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר מַה־זֹּ֛את עָשָׂ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים לָֽנוּ׃|28 J|And he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned! It is here in my bag!” Their hearts sank; and, trembling, they turned to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers found their money in their sacks, feeling it was punishment for past sins, including selling Joseph into slavery. Rabbi Simon bar Zevid and Rabbi Levi were eulogized, emphasizing the irreplaceability of Torah scholars. The text discusses how all concepts in the Prophets and Hagiographa are contained in the Torah. Rabbi Yoḥanan contemplates if everything in the Writings is alluded to in the Torah. In Proverbs and Job, foolishness and feeling humiliated by God are discussed. Joseph's brothers were shocked and confused when they found their money in their sacks, wondering why God had done this to them (Onkelos Genesis 42:28, Targum Jonathan on Genesis 42:28). 

|וַיָּבֹ֛אוּ אֶל־יַעֲקֹ֥ב אֲבִיהֶ֖ם אַ֣רְצָה כְּנָ֑עַן וַיַּגִּ֣ידוּ ל֔וֹ אֵ֛ת כׇּל־הַקֹּרֹ֥ת אֹתָ֖ם לֵאמֹֽר׃|29 J|When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had befallen them, saying,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Midrash reflects on Joseph's actions towards his brothers, Jacob's suspicions, and the importance of wisdom, while also highlighting the concept that accusations arise in times of danger. Ibn Ezra explains the interpretation of specific words in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, emphasizing the consequences of sin. The Targum simply states that the brothers reported everything to Jacob in Canaan. 

|דִּ֠בֶּ֠ר הָאִ֨ישׁ אֲדֹנֵ֥י הָאָ֛רֶץ אִתָּ֖נוּ קָשׁ֑וֹת וַיִּתֵּ֣ן אֹתָ֔נוּ כִּֽמְרַגְּלִ֖ים אֶת־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|30 J|“The man  who is lord of the land spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Tetragrammaton is a sacred name of God that conveys the meaning of "absolute existence" in Hebrew, inspiring dread in its utterance and distinct from other names of God. The righteous acts as a reconciler between conflicting qualities of God, ensuring peace and goodness in the world. Joseph's brothers were accused of being spies by Joseph when they came to Egypt during a famine, as recounted in Genesis 42:30 in both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. The Gemara discusses the term "dibber" in the context of harsh language, citing examples from Genesis and Psalms. 

|וַנֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖יו כֵּנִ֣ים אֲנָ֑חְנוּ לֹ֥א הָיִ֖ינוּ מְרַגְּלִֽים׃|31 J|We said to him, ‘We are being honest; we have never been spies!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban explains that the brothers denied being spies based on their trustworthiness, while the Midrash suggests Joseph accused them because they entered the city through different gates. Scripture does not confirm this. Onkelos translates "honest people" as "faithful men" in Targum Jonathan. 

|שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֥ר אֲנַ֛חְנוּ אַחִ֖ים בְּנֵ֣י אָבִ֑ינוּ הָאֶחָ֣ד אֵינֶ֔נּוּ וְהַקָּטֹ֥ן הַיּ֛וֹם אֶת־אָבִ֖ינוּ בְּאֶ֥רֶץ כְּנָֽעַן׃|32 J|There were twelve of us brothers, sons by the same father; but one is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers deliberately omitted certain details when recounting their conversation with Joseph to their father to avoid implicating him as Joseph's servant and to portray Joseph as overly inquisitive without cause, allowing them to avoid further suspicion from Joseph. Targum mentions that the brothers are twelve in number, with one missing and the youngest being with their father in the land of Canaan. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלֵ֗ינוּ הָאִישׁ֙ אֲדֹנֵ֣י הָאָ֔רֶץ בְּזֹ֣את אֵדַ֔ע כִּ֥י כֵנִ֖ים אַתֶּ֑ם אֲחִיכֶ֤ם הָֽאֶחָד֙ הַנִּ֣יחוּ אִתִּ֔י וְאֶת־רַעֲב֥וֹן בָּתֵּיכֶ֖ם קְח֥וּ וָלֵֽכוּ׃|33 J|But the man—who is lord of the land—said to us, ‘By this I shall know that you are being honest: leave one of your brothers with me, and take something for your starving households and be off.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Radak, and Rav Hirsch emphasize the importance of providing food for the hungry households during a famine, with Steinsaltz summarizing that one brother must stay to alleviate hunger. The pronunciation of "Tefillin" should have a drawn-out Lamed due to the dot in the letter, and "Le'Honeach" should be pronounced with a Kamatz and "Al Mitzvat" with a Patach, as ruled by the Great Achronim. Judah's offer to become a slave in place of Benjamin demonstrates complete repentance according to the sages and Rambam. The man in charge of the land told Joseph's brothers to leave one of their brothers with him as a guarantee of their honesty and take food for their hungry families. 

|וְ֠הָבִ֠יאוּ אֶת־אֲחִיכֶ֣ם הַקָּטֹן֮ אֵלַי֒ וְאֵֽדְעָ֗ה כִּ֣י לֹ֤א מְרַגְּלִים֙ אַתֶּ֔ם כִּ֥י כֵנִ֖ים אַתֶּ֑ם אֶת־אֲחִיכֶם֙ אֶתֵּ֣ן לָכֶ֔ם וְאֶת־הָאָ֖רֶץ תִּסְחָֽרוּ׃|34 J|And bring your youngest brother to me, that I may know that you are not spies, that you are being honest. I will then restore your brother to you, and you shall be free to move about in the land.’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses two types of love: one based on a father's admiration for his son's wisdom and deeds, and another rooted in unconditional love. The brothers altered Joseph's words to convince Jacob to send Benjamin with them to Egypt, not informing him of Simeon's imprisonment. Jacob's vague understanding of events in Egypt led him to send his sons there for grain, where Joseph tested them and eventually revealed his identity. Joseph promised to return Benjamin and allow the brothers to continue trading in Egypt once they proved themselves honest. 

|וַיְהִ֗י הֵ֚ם מְרִיקִ֣ים שַׂקֵּיהֶ֔ם וְהִנֵּה־אִ֥ישׁ צְרוֹר־כַּסְפּ֖וֹ בְּשַׂקּ֑וֹ וַיִּרְא֞וּ אֶת־צְרֹר֧וֹת כַּסְפֵּיהֶ֛ם הֵ֥מָּה וַאֲבִיהֶ֖ם וַיִּירָֽאוּ׃|35 E|As they were emptying their sacks, there, in each one’s sack, was his money-bag! When they and their father saw their money-bags, they were dismayed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text from Chasidut explains that even after fasting, desires and passions remain, leading to fear and reluctance to take power, as seen in the story of Joseph's brothers finding money in their sacks. Commentary from Rashbam, Radak, Rashi, Steinsaltz, and Chizkuni provides grammatical insights and highlights the worry and fear of the brothers. The Midrash discusses Judah's contemplation of past events, the concern over the returned silver, and Jacob's refusal to let Reuben take responsibility for Benjamin. Quoting commentary from Rashi connects the phrase "ויהי" in Genesis 15:17 to other instances like Genesis 42:35. The Targum recounts how the brothers found their money in their sacks, causing fear for them and their father. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ יַעֲקֹ֣ב אֲבִיהֶ֔ם אֹתִ֖י שִׁכַּלְתֶּ֑ם יוֹסֵ֤ף אֵינֶ֙נּוּ֙ וְשִׁמְע֣וֹן אֵינֶ֔נּוּ וְאֶת־בִּנְיָמִ֣ן תִּקָּ֔חוּ עָלַ֖י הָי֥וּ כֻלָּֽנָה׃|36 E|Their father Jacob said to them, “It is always me that you bereave: Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you would take away Benjamin. These things always happen to me!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 42:35-36, Yaakov's sons find money in their sacks, leading Yaakov to fear losing more children after the loss of Yosef and Shimon. Jacob accuses his sons of involvement in Joseph's disappearance, expresses reluctance to send Benjamin due to past tragedies, and suspects foul play. Reuben offers to take responsibility for Benjamin, Jacob refuses initially, and the promise of twelve tribes from Jacob is fulfilled through his sons. Rabbi Yochanan suggests Jacob's spiritual powers departed when he mourned Joseph and further diminished with Benjamin's departure, reviving when he received news of Joseph being alive. The allegorical interpretation of dreams, the tree of life and knowledge, and the practice of divination are discussed, with emphasis on signs repeating three times, as seen in Jacob's losses. Jacob laments the loss of Joseph and potential loss of Benjamin, expressing sorrow at not knowing Joseph's fate and the threat to all his children. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר רְאוּבֵן֙ אֶל־אָבִ֣יו לֵאמֹ֔ר אֶת־שְׁנֵ֤י בָנַי֙ תָּמִ֔ית אִם־לֹ֥א אֲבִיאֶ֖נּוּ אֵלֶ֑יךָ תְּנָ֤ה אֹתוֹ֙ עַל־יָדִ֔י וַאֲנִ֖י אֲשִׁיבֶ֥נּוּ אֵלֶֽיךָ׃|37 E|Then Reuben said to his father, “You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him back to you. Put him in my care, and I will return him to you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reuben offered to have his two sons be punished if he failed to bring Benjamin back to Jacob, but Jacob relied more on Judah's influence. Reuben's suggestion was seen as foolish and not dignified with a serious response, while Judah successfully persuaded Jacob to let Benjamin go to Egypt for food. In Midrash, it is explained that the guarantor responsible for a loan is the one who offers to repay it, and Jacob suspected his sons of wrongdoing when he found silver in their sacks. Reuben's offer was refused, and in Musar, it is shown that despite good intentions, Reuben's actions led to the downfall of his descendants. In the Talmud, it is argued that Reuben's offer regarding Benjamin was an example of an unconditional guarantee, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between types of guarantors. Additionally, in Targum, Reuben offers to have his two sons killed if he does not bring Benjamin back to his father, emphasizing the seriousness of his commitment. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר לֹֽא־יֵרֵ֥ד בְּנִ֖י עִמָּכֶ֑ם כִּֽי־אָחִ֨יו מֵ֜ת וְה֧וּא לְבַדּ֣וֹ נִשְׁאָ֗ר וּקְרָאָ֤הוּ אָסוֹן֙ בַּדֶּ֙רֶךְ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תֵּֽלְכוּ־בָ֔הּ וְהוֹרַדְתֶּ֧ם אֶת־שֵׂיבָתִ֛י בְּיָג֖וֹן שְׁאֽוֹלָה׃|38 J|But he said, “My son must not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left. If he meets with disaster on the journey you are taking, you will send my white head down to Sheol in grief.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov trusted Yehudah with Benjamin's safety, as he feared losing Rachel's only remaining son. Esau and his sons dwelt in the land of Seir, while Jacob's sons prospered in Canaan. Joseph's success in Egypt led to him being favored by the king and marrying Asenath. Yaakov refused to let Benjamin go with his brothers due to the sorrow he experienced from losing Joseph. 

## Genesis 43

|וְהָרָעָ֖ב כָּבֵ֥ד בָּאָֽרֶץ׃|1 J|But the famine in the land was severe.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehudah suggested waiting until there was no more bread before arguing with Jacob to send Binyamin. Jacob expressed fears and preferred not to accept the risks proposed by his sons despite the severe famine. The Midrash draws parallels between Abraham's trials and those of his descendants, with God promising to fight for Israel in the future. The Targum confirms the severity of the famine in Genesis 43:1. 

|וַיְהִ֗י כַּאֲשֶׁ֤ר כִּלּוּ֙ לֶאֱכֹ֣ל אֶת־הַשֶּׁ֔בֶר אֲשֶׁ֥ר הֵבִ֖יאוּ מִמִּצְרָ֑יִם וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵיהֶם֙ אֲבִיהֶ֔ם שֻׁ֖בוּ שִׁבְרוּ־לָ֥נוּ מְעַט־אֹֽכֶל׃|2 J|And when they had eaten up the rations which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again and procure some food for us.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno believed Jacob feared his sons wanted to lose Benjamin like Joseph, Or HaChaim emphasized the need for more grain, Rashi clarified the text, Steinsaltz highlighted context. Solomon discusses household forces in Proverbs, Midrash discusses Jacob's life, Joseph's brothers' test, and Judah's offer in Bereshit Rabbah. Yaakov's use of "שבר" and "רדו שמה" foreshadowed Egypt's exile, and Judah waited for the food stores to run out before suggesting returning to Egypt with Benjamin. Targum mentioned Jacob instructing his sons to buy more food after finishing the grain from Egypt. 

|וַיֹּ֧אמֶר אֵלָ֛יו יְהוּדָ֖ה לֵאמֹ֑ר הָעֵ֣ד הֵעִד֩ בָּ֨נוּ הָאִ֤ישׁ לֵאמֹר֙ לֹֽא־תִרְא֣וּ פָנַ֔י בִּלְתִּ֖י אֲחִיכֶ֥ם אִתְּכֶֽם׃|3 J|But Judah said to him, “The man  warned us, ‘Do not let me see your faces  unless your brother is with you.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehudah convinces Jacob to send Benjamin to Egypt to buy grain, emphasizing the importance of his presence and challenging Jacob to find an alternative solution. Judah's leadership qualities are evident in his interactions with his father, with references to warnings through witnesses in biblical verses. In the Talmud, Rebbi Ḥanina argues that night begins when three stars are visible, contradicting the Mishnah, while in the Tanakh, Pharaoh warns Moses to leave and not return. Yehudah warns his brothers that they cannot see the man's face without Benjamin, as seen in Targum Jonathan. 

|אִם־יֶשְׁךָ֛ מְשַׁלֵּ֥חַ אֶת־אָחִ֖ינוּ אִתָּ֑נוּ נֵרְדָ֕ה וְנִשְׁבְּרָ֥ה לְךָ֖ אֹֽכֶל׃|4 J|If you will let our brother go with us, we will go down and procure food for you;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers were willing to go to Egypt to buy supplies only if Yaakov sent Binyamin with them, as they feared for their safety and the possibility of death if they did not have him with them (Tur HaArokh, Genesis 43:4:1; Steinsaltz on Genesis 43:4). Joshua bin Nun cursed those who built Jericho, similar to the Egyptians who could not live in their homes after the plagues, symbolizing death of their children, while Jacob sent Benjamin back to Egypt, fearing for their lives (Midrash). Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan translate Genesis 43:4 similarly, stating that the brothers will go buy grain if Benjamin is sent with them (Targum). 

|וְאִם־אֵינְךָ֥ מְשַׁלֵּ֖חַ לֹ֣א נֵרֵ֑ד כִּֽי־הָאִ֞ישׁ אָמַ֤ר אֵלֵ֙ינוּ֙ לֹֽא־תִרְא֣וּ פָנַ֔י בִּלְתִּ֖י אֲחִיכֶ֥ם אִתְּכֶֽם׃|5 J|but if you will not let him go, we will not go down, for that man said to us, ‘Do not let me see your faces  unless your brother is with you.’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 43:1, Jacob is reluctant to send Benjamin to Egypt, but the brothers argue that they cannot go down without him as the man in Egypt said they would not see his face without Benjamin. Bereshit Rabbah 91:10 emphasizes the necessity of bringing Benjamin to Egypt due to the severe famine, with Judah offering to guarantee his safety and take responsibility for his return. The Targum highlights that they will not go down to Egypt unless Benjamin is sent with them. 

|וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לָמָ֥ה הֲרֵעֹתֶ֖ם לִ֑י לְהַגִּ֣יד לָאִ֔ישׁ הַע֥וֹד לָכֶ֖ם אָֽח׃|6 J|And Israel said, “Why did you serve me so ill as to tell the man that you had another brother?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob, referred to as "Israel" when rising to the occasion, reproaches his sons for mentioning Benjamin unnecessarily, leading to trouble. In Shemot Rabbah 18:6, God compares smiting Egypt to a king rescuing his son from barbarians. Bereshit Rabbah 91:10 shows Judah offering to guarantee Benjamin's safety forever. Barukh SheAmar on Pesach Haggadah explains how the Egyptians accused the Israelites of evil actions to justify their mistreatment. In Targum Jonathan on Genesis 43:6, Israel questions why his sons revealed the existence of another brother to the man they were dealing with. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֡וּ שָׁא֣וֹל שָֽׁאַל־הָ֠אִ֠ישׁ לָ֣נוּ וּלְמֽוֹלַדְתֵּ֜נוּ לֵאמֹ֗ר הַע֨וֹד אֲבִיכֶ֥ם חַי֙ הֲיֵ֣שׁ לָכֶ֣ם אָ֔ח וַנַּ֨גֶּד־ל֔וֹ עַל־פִּ֖י הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֑לֶּה הֲיָד֣וֹעַ נֵדַ֔ע כִּ֣י יֹאמַ֔ר הוֹרִ֖ידוּ אֶת־אֲחִיכֶֽם׃|7 J|They replied, “But the man kept asking about us and our family, saying, ‘Is your father still living? Have you another brother?’ And we answered him accordingly. How were we to know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother here’?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the importance of the wood of the bed for childbearing, Rashi clarifies the word "מולדתנו" in Genesis 43:7, Akeidat Yitzchak discusses Isaac's ancestry and intermarriage consequences, Midrash details Joseph's demand for Benjamin, Aggadat Bereshit shows Joseph's compassion towards his brothers, and Ramban, Rashi, Rashbam, and Chizkuni offer interpretations of Joseph's actions and questioning in Genesis 43:7. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan recount the brothers' questioning by the Egyptian official in Genesis 43:7. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוּדָ֜ה אֶל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֣ל אָבִ֗יו שִׁלְחָ֥ה הַנַּ֛עַר אִתִּ֖י וְנָק֣וּמָה וְנֵלֵ֑כָה וְנִֽחְיֶה֙ וְלֹ֣א נָמ֔וּת גַּם־אֲנַ֥חְנוּ גַם־אַתָּ֖ה גַּם־טַפֵּֽנוּ׃|8 J|Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy in my care, and let us be on our way, that we may live and not die—you and we and our children.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah urges Israel to send Benjamin with him to Egypt for food, emphasizing their survival depends on it, with a focus on preserving their own lives first and concern for their children. Rabbi Yosef argues Rashi's interpretation of Judah and Benjamin's story is not relevant, as Judah's argument was about Benjamin's safety, not solely benefiting others. Judah offers to be a guarantor for Benjamin, showing responsibility and selflessness, while Jacob's questioning is seen as a lack of faith in God's plan. Radak explains that the death of one brother will cause the death of the other, emphasizing the importance of Judah's insistence on Benjamin accompanying them to avoid death by hunger. Yehudah tells Israel to send Benjamin with him to live and not die, including themselves and their children [Onkelos Genesis 43:8; Targum Jonathan on Genesis 43:8]. 

|אָֽנֹכִי֙ אֶֽעֶרְבֶ֔נּוּ מִיָּדִ֖י תְּבַקְשֶׁ֑נּוּ אִם־לֹ֨א הֲבִיאֹתִ֤יו אֵלֶ֙יךָ֙ וְהִצַּגְתִּ֣יו לְפָנֶ֔יךָ וְחָטָ֥אתִֽי לְךָ֖ כׇּל־הַיָּמִֽים׃|9 J|I myself will be surety for him; you may hold me responsible: if I do not bring him back to you and set him before you, I shall stand guilty before you forever.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yehudah promises to guarantee Binyamin's return, pledging to be labeled a sinner forever if he fails, a commitment seen as unnecessary by the sages. Judah's vow is considered legally ineffective due to his inability to control the outcome, leading to potential excommunication. Despite fulfilling his promise, Judah's commitment to endure excommunication is viewed as frivolous and may have caused his bones to rattle in his coffin. The importance of brotherhood, trust, and loyalty is highlighted as Judah takes responsibility for Benjamin, seeking to ensure his safety and emphasizing the significance of keeping promises within the family. Judah's suffering for selling Joseph into slavery is discussed, with his bones rolling in his casket until Moses prayed for him to lift the curse. The concept of conditional excommunication and the need for its annulment by religious authorities is explored in relation to Judah's vow, with the understanding that failing to fulfill his promise would result in being labeled a sinner for life. Rav Yehuda and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani discuss the nullification of conditional ostracism, linking it to Judah's statement regarding Benjamin. Reish Lakish and Rav Huna derive legal obligations from Judah's assurance regarding Benjamin, while Avot DeRabbi Natan teaches the importance of humility and wisdom in communication, using biblical examples. Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Targum Jerusalem all emphasize Judah's willingness to be surety for Benjamin in Genesis 43:9. 

|כִּ֖י לוּלֵ֣א הִתְמַהְמָ֑הְנוּ כִּֽי־עַתָּ֥ה שַׁ֖בְנוּ זֶ֥ה פַעֲמָֽיִם׃|10 J|For we could have been there and back twice if we had not dawdled.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers delayed their return to Egypt, causing unnecessary suffering, but they took steps to ensure their success on the journey, including bringing a gift, returning the money found in their sacks, taking Benjamin with them, and praying for mercy from God when facing the ruler of Egypt. Yehudah emphasizes the urgency of not delaying the return to Egypt to avoid harm to all involved, while the concept of "if not for" statements is discussed in relation to the merit of the Almighty, Torah, and faith in various Midrashim. The text discusses how Egypt represents worldly desires, Moses symbolizes liberation from these passions, and the importance of focusing on spiritual growth and liberation instead of worldly distractions. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Genesis 43:10 as stating that if the brothers had not hesitated, they could have completed the journey twice already. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֜ם יִשְׂרָאֵ֣ל אֲבִיהֶ֗ם אִם־כֵּ֣ן ׀ אֵפוֹא֮ זֹ֣את עֲשׂוּ֒ קְח֞וּ מִזִּמְרַ֤ת הָאָ֙רֶץ֙ בִּכְלֵיכֶ֔ם וְהוֹרִ֥ידוּ לָאִ֖ישׁ מִנְחָ֑ה מְעַ֤ט צֳרִי֙ וּמְעַ֣ט דְּבַ֔שׁ נְכֹ֣את וָלֹ֔ט בׇּטְנִ֖ים וּשְׁקֵדִֽים׃|11 J|Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, do this: take some of the choice products of the land in your baggage, and carry them down as a gift for the man—some balm and some honey, gum, ladanum, pistachio nuts, and almonds.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of reciting the Hallel prayer and giving charity to find favor with public officials, reflecting on one's distance from God for repentance and joy in the soul. The number seven is linked to music in Jewish tradition, with the Land of Israel being considered the land of song. Halakhah discusses the process of obtaining balsam oil from the Land of Israel with a special blessing. Jewish Thought delves into Korach's rebellion against Moses and Aaron, while Midrash explores Israel's instructions to his sons on what gifts to take to Egypt. Mishnah details exemptions from peah obligations, while Musar discusses the Torah's approach to controlling evil urges. Quoting Commentary provides various interpretations from Ramban, Radak, Ibn Ezra, and others, and Talmud suggests Job's timeline. Targum elaborates on the offerings Israel instructed his sons to take to Egypt. 

|וְכֶ֥סֶף מִשְׁנֶ֖ה קְח֣וּ בְיֶדְכֶ֑ם וְאֶת־הַכֶּ֜סֶף הַמּוּשָׁ֨ב בְּפִ֤י אַמְתְּחֹֽתֵיכֶם֙ תָּשִׁ֣יבוּ בְיֶדְכֶ֔ם אוּלַ֥י מִשְׁגֶּ֖ה הֽוּא׃|12 J|And take with you double the money, carrying back with you the money that was replaced in the mouths of your bags; perhaps it was a mistake.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentators discuss the meaning of "double money" in Genesis 43:12, with some suggesting it was mistakenly placed in the brothers' bags. In Bereshit Rabbah 91:11, Israel instructs his sons to take choice produce, gifts, and double the silver to Joseph. Rashi explains "fattened cattle" in I Samuel 15:9, while Rashbam clarifies the word "אולי" in Numbers 22:33. Rabbeinu Bahya emphasizes meticulous calculations with Gentiles, and Ramban interprets "hamishneh" in Genesis 41:43. The Targum translations of Genesis 43:12 also focus on returning the money found in their bags. 

|וְאֶת־אֲחִיכֶ֖ם קָ֑חוּ וְק֖וּמוּ שׁ֥וּבוּ אֶל־הָאִֽישׁ׃|13 J|Take your brother too; and go back at once to the man.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's intention in Genesis 42:18 was to show that determination to do God's will is accounted as if it has already been done, even if circumstances prevent immediate action. The importance of bringing Benjamin when returning to the man is emphasized in the commentary, along with the need for honesty and fair dealings with non-Jews, as illustrated by the story of Joseph's brothers returning the money they found in their sacks. Israel instructed his sons to take gifts and double the silver when returning to Egypt, highlighting the importance of prayer for success and ethical treatment of Gentiles. The Targums specify the importance of bringing Benjamin when returning to the man. 

|וְאֵ֣ל שַׁדַּ֗י יִתֵּ֨ן לָכֶ֤ם רַחֲמִים֙ לִפְנֵ֣י הָאִ֔ישׁ וְשִׁלַּ֥ח לָכֶ֛ם אֶת־אֲחִיכֶ֥ם אַחֵ֖ר וְאֶת־בִּנְיָמִ֑ין וַאֲנִ֕י כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר שָׁכֹ֖לְתִּי שָׁכָֽלְתִּי׃|14 E|And may El Shaddai dispose the man to mercy toward you, that he may release to you your other brother, as well as Benjamin. As for me, if I am to be bereaved, I shall be bereaved.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that suffering refines man to recognize God, with compassion emphasized in prayer. Jacob's omission of Simeon's name in his prayer for his sons' journey to Egypt reflects his lack of favor due to the Shechem incident. In Jewish Thought, converts are not accepted in times of prosperity, and Abraham's obedience to God's commands is highlighted. In Kabbalah, references to El Shaddai and Adonai in times of trouble are discussed. The Midrash explores divine mercy, the establishment of the twelve tribes, and Joseph's interactions with his brothers. Rabbi Oshiyah comments on Jacob's words in Genesis 43:14 alluding to the four exiles. In Quoting Commentary, various commentators provide interpretations on mercy from God, treatment towards Benjamin, redemption from idolatry, and parallels between Jacob's time in Egypt and the Jewish exile under Rome. In Tanakh, Esther risks her life to save her people by instructing all Jews in Shushan to fast for three days and nights. Targum interprets Jacob's prayer for compassion from God regarding the release of Benjamin and his other son. 

|וַיִּקְח֤וּ הָֽאֲנָשִׁים֙ אֶת־הַמִּנְחָ֣ה הַזֹּ֔את וּמִשְׁנֶה־כֶּ֛סֶף לָקְח֥וּ בְיָדָ֖ם וְאֶת־בִּנְיָמִ֑ן וַיָּקֻ֙מוּ֙ וַיֵּרְד֣וּ מִצְרַ֔יִם וַיַּֽעַמְד֖וּ לִפְנֵ֥י יוֹסֵֽף׃|15 J|So the agents  took that gift, and they took with them double the money, as well as Benjamin. They made their way down to Egypt, where they presented themselves to Joseph.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers, eager and anxious, took Benjamin and a gift to Egypt, standing before Joseph who reacted emotionally, leading to fear of new accusations. In the Midrash, the sons of Jacob fought and defeated kings, making a covenant with them to dwell in the land. The Targum highlights the men taking the offering, double money, and Benjamin to Egypt, standing before Joseph. Siftei Chakhamim discusses the use of the word "words" in Leviticus 8:2. (Onkelos Genesis 43:15, Targum Jonathan on Genesis 43:15) 

|וַיַּ֨רְא יוֹסֵ֣ף אִתָּם֮ אֶת־בִּנְיָמִין֒ וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ לַֽאֲשֶׁ֣ר עַל־בֵּית֔וֹ הָבֵ֥א אֶת־הָאֲנָשִׁ֖ים הַבָּ֑יְתָה וּטְבֹ֤חַ טֶ֙בַח֙ וְהָכֵ֔ן כִּ֥י אִתִּ֛י יֹאכְל֥וּ הָאֲנָשִׁ֖ים בַּֽצׇּהֳרָֽיִם׃|16 J|When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, “Take those men  into the house; slaughter and prepare an animal, for those men will dine with me at noon.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph wanted to observe his brothers' reactions to Binyamin during a meal in his living quarters, ensuring the animals were slaughtered according to Jewish law. The Midrash emphasizes performing acts of kindness and observing God's commandments, while the suffering of Joseph's brothers was a consequence of their previous actions. The prince of Ephrayim offered on the Sabbath due to Joseph's observance, similar to other instances of apparent violations for God's command. Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yosei discuss the validity of slaughter based on Joseph's actions, as described in Targum Jonathan on Genesis 43:16. 

|וַיַּ֣עַשׂ הָאִ֔ישׁ כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֖ר אָמַ֣ר יוֹסֵ֑ף וַיָּבֵ֥א הָאִ֛ישׁ אֶת־הָאֲנָשִׁ֖ים בֵּ֥יתָה יוֹסֵֽף׃|17 J|The man did as Joseph said, and he brought the men into Joseph’s house.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Da'at Zekenim suggests the man who brought the men to Joseph's house was Joseph's son Menashe, highlighting the vulnerability of the men being alone in the man's private house. The sons of Jacob, with the help of the Lord, overpowered the kings and their armies, causing confusion and fear among them. Rashi contrasts the word "הָשַׁב" in Isaiah 42:22:3 with Genesis 43:17, noting a repetition of the word "brought" in Genesis 43:24:1 to emphasize the change in location. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both state that the man brought the men to Joseph's house as instructed by Joseph in Genesis 43:17. 

|וַיִּֽירְא֣וּ הָֽאֲנָשִׁ֗ים כִּ֣י הֽוּבְאוּ֮ בֵּ֣ית יוֹסֵף֒ וַיֹּאמְר֗וּ עַל־דְּבַ֤ר הַכֶּ֙סֶף֙ הַשָּׁ֤ב בְּאַמְתְּחֹתֵ֙ינוּ֙ בַּתְּחִלָּ֔ה אֲנַ֖חְנוּ מֽוּבָאִ֑ים לְהִתְגֹּלֵ֤ל עָלֵ֙ינוּ֙ וּלְהִתְנַפֵּ֣ל עָלֵ֔ינוּ וְלָקַ֧חַת אֹתָ֛נוּ לַעֲבָדִ֖ים וְאֶת־חֲמֹרֵֽינוּ׃|18 E|But the men were frightened at being brought into Joseph’s house. “It must be,” they thought, “because of the money replaced in our bags the first time that we have been brought inside, as a pretext to attack us and seize us as slaves, with our pack animals.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the money in the bags symbolizes desires and the fear of judgment day even for righteous individuals, with Hashem desiring all desires to be uplifted to His service. The Commentary highlights the brothers' fear of being falsely accused by Joseph and the consequences for their families. Jewish Thought discusses the precepts in the Section on Damages, emphasizing responsibility for damage caused. The Midrash mentions Joseph observing Shabbat and reassuring his brothers, while Musar focuses on the difficulty of accepting admonishment and the importance of studying Torah. Quoting Commentary includes interpretations by Ramban, Rashi, and Ibn Ezra, while Responsa establishes that wool and linen tallit are equal. Targum describes the brothers' fear of theft accusations by Joseph. 

|וַֽיִּגְּשׁוּ֙ אֶל־הָאִ֔ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־בֵּ֣ית יוֹסֵ֑ף וַיְדַבְּר֥וּ אֵלָ֖יו פֶּ֥תַח הַבָּֽיִת׃|19 E|So they went up to Joseph’s house steward and spoke to him at the entrance of the house.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's brothers spoke to the man in charge of Joseph's house at the entrance to avoid being overheard, as they were afraid to enter the house. The Midrash notes Joseph's observance of Shabbat before it was given and his kindness to Simeon while he was imprisoned. Rashi explains that the mention of bringing in twice in the verse indicates that the men were initially brought outside to speak to the man but then followed him back into the house. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both state that the brothers approached the man in charge of Joseph's house and spoke to him at the entrance. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֖וּ בִּ֣י אֲדֹנִ֑י יָרֹ֥ד יָרַ֛דְנוּ בַּתְּחִלָּ֖ה לִשְׁבׇּר־אֹֽכֶל׃|20 E|“If you please, my lord,” they said, “we came down once before to procure food.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In the Midrash, Joseph observed Shabbat and reassured his brothers before revealing their silver had been returned and releasing Simeon to them. In the Targum, the brothers refer to themselves as "my master" when asking to buy grain from the Egyptian official [Genesis 43:20]. 

|וַֽיְהִ֞י כִּי־בָ֣אנוּ אֶל־הַמָּל֗וֹן וַֽנִּפְתְּחָה֙ אֶת־אַמְתְּחֹתֵ֔ינוּ וְהִנֵּ֤ה כֶֽסֶף־אִישׁ֙ בְּפִ֣י אַמְתַּחְתּ֔וֹ כַּסְפֵּ֖נוּ בְּמִשְׁקָל֑וֹ וַנָּ֥שֶׁב אֹת֖וֹ בְּיָדֵֽנוּ׃|21 E|But when we arrived at the night encampment and opened our bags, there was each one’s money in the mouth of his bag, our money in full.  So we have brought it back with us.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers found their money in their sacks at the inn, in the correct amount, and brought it back with them, unaware of any wrongdoing. 

|וְכֶ֧סֶף אַחֵ֛ר הוֹרַ֥דְנוּ בְיָדֵ֖נוּ לִשְׁבׇּר־אֹ֑כֶל לֹ֣א יָדַ֔עְנוּ מִי־שָׂ֥ם כַּסְפֵּ֖נוּ בְּאַמְתְּחֹתֵֽינוּ׃|22 E|And we have brought down with us other money to procure food. We do not know who put the money in our bags.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 43:22, the brothers brought down silver to acquire food and did not know how it ended up in their sacks, with Targum Jonathan mentioning that they brought additional money but were unsure of who put it there [Targum]. 

|וַיֹּ֩אמֶר֩ שָׁל֨וֹם לָכֶ֜ם אַל־תִּירָ֗אוּ אֱלֹ֨הֵיכֶ֜ם וֵֽאלֹהֵ֤י אֲבִיכֶם֙ נָתַ֨ן לָכֶ֤ם מַטְמוֹן֙ בְּאַמְתְּחֹ֣תֵיכֶ֔ם כַּסְפְּכֶ֖ם בָּ֣א אֵלָ֑י וַיּוֹצֵ֥א אֲלֵהֶ֖ם אֶת־שִׁמְעֽוֹן׃|23 E|He replied, “All is well with you; do not be afraid. Your God, the God of your father’s [house], must have put treasure in your bags for you. I got your payment.” And he brought out Simeon to them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's official reassured his brothers by telling them hidden treasure was found in their sacks, likely due to common practices of hiding money under grain. Joseph observed Shabbat before it was given, comforting the men brought to his house and comparing Simeon to a cruse of oil. Judah's speech to Joseph is seen as a plea for compassion by Ramban, appealing to Joseph's fear of God and recounting their father's reluctance to send Benjamin. In Genesis 43:23, both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the man reassuring Joseph's brothers and bringing Shimon out to them. 

|וַיָּבֵ֥א הָאִ֛ישׁ אֶת־הָאֲנָשִׁ֖ים בֵּ֣יתָה יוֹסֵ֑ף וַיִּתֶּן־מַ֙יִם֙ וַיִּרְחֲצ֣וּ רַגְלֵיהֶ֔ם וַיִּתֵּ֥ן מִסְפּ֖וֹא לַחֲמֹֽרֵיהֶֽם׃|24 J|Then the steward brought the men into Joseph’s house; he gave them water to bathe their feet, and he provided feed for their asses.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The man brought the men into Joseph's house as guests, providing water for washing their feet and feed for their donkeys. (Targum) 

|וַיָּכִ֙ינוּ֙ אֶת־הַמִּנְחָ֔ה עַד־בּ֥וֹא יוֹסֵ֖ף בַּֽצׇּהֳרָ֑יִם כִּ֣י שָֽׁמְע֔וּ כִּי־שָׁ֖ם יֹ֥אכְלוּ לָֽחֶם׃|25 J|They laid out their gifts to await Joseph’s arrival at noon, for they had heard that they were to dine there.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers prepared a gift for Joseph in an ornate manner to present it upon his arrival at noon, reflecting Jewish law's emphasis on thoughtful offerings. Jacob sends Benjamin with his brothers to Egypt for protection, and Joseph reassures them, treating Simeon well despite his imprisonment. Chizkuni explains that the word "וְהִכִּינוּ" in Exodus 16:5 means not only "to prepare" but also to conceal after preparing for later presentation, as seen in Genesis 43:25 and 2 Chronicles 29:19. (Onkelos Genesis 43:25, Targum Jonathan on Genesis 43:25) 

|וַיָּבֹ֤א יוֹסֵף֙ הַבַּ֔יְתָה וַיָּבִ֥יאּוּ ל֛וֹ אֶת־הַמִּנְחָ֥ה אֲשֶׁר־בְּיָדָ֖ם הַבָּ֑יְתָה וַיִּשְׁתַּחֲווּ־ל֖וֹ אָֽרְצָה׃|26 J|When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts that they had brought with them into the house, bowing low before him to the ground.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers brought Joseph a gift prepared in a separate room to find favor as in Joseph's dream, fulfilling his dream where they prostrated to him as sheaves. The Hebrew verb "bo" signifies "to come" in reference to the fulfilment of God's word or the coming of the Shechinah, as seen in various biblical passages. Ramban interprets Jacob's dream as symbolizing his entire household bowing to Joseph, while HaKtav VeHaKabalah discusses the difference between prostration as bowing the head or on the earth. Targum Jonathan describes the brothers prostrating themselves on the ground before Joseph. 

|וַיִּשְׁאַ֤ל לָהֶם֙ לְשָׁל֔וֹם וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הֲשָׁל֛וֹם אֲבִיכֶ֥ם הַזָּקֵ֖ן אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֲמַרְתֶּ֑ם הַעוֹדֶ֖נּוּ חָֽי׃|27 J|He greeted them, and he said, “How is your aged father of whom you spoke? Is he still in good health?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra suggests "shalom" in Genesis 43:27 means "in peace," Sforno links it to physical health, Or HaChaim notes Joseph's concern for his brothers' well-being, Da'at Zekenim refers to the "old father" as Yitzchok, Rav Hirsch highlights Joseph's care for his father, and Steinsaltz notes Joseph's friendly welcome. Midrash emphasizes Joseph's continued care for his brothers, leading to reconciliation. Rabbenu Bachya praises Yehudah's strategic approach with Yosef, Tur HaArokh highlights Yosef's question about his father. Talmud discusses respecting elders and wise qualities. Targum describes Joseph's inquiry about their father's well-being. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֗וּ שָׁל֛וֹם לְעַבְדְּךָ֥ לְאָבִ֖ינוּ עוֹדֶ֣נּוּ חָ֑י וַֽיִּקְּד֖וּ ׃|28 J|They replied, “It is well with your servant our father; he is still in good health.” And they bowed and made obeisance.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers expressed gratitude for the viceroy's concern for their father's well-being by prostrating themselves. In the Midrash, Joseph showed kindness to his brothers, recognized Benjamin, and contrasted pride with humility. Yosef's sentence was increased for asking the officer to remember him, and he either embalmed his father without permission or remained silent when referred to as a servant. Rav Yehuda explains that Joseph was called "Bones" for his humility in not protesting when his brothers referred to Jacob as his servant. In the Targum, the brothers inform Joseph that their father is alive and well, bowing down before him. 

|וַיִּשָּׂ֣א עֵינָ֗יו וַיַּ֞רְא אֶת־בִּנְיָמִ֣ין אָחִיו֮ בֶּן־אִמּוֹ֒ וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הֲזֶה֙ אֲחִיכֶ֣ם הַקָּטֹ֔ן אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲמַרְתֶּ֖ם אֵלָ֑י וַיֹּאמַ֕ר אֱלֹהִ֥ים יׇחְנְךָ֖ בְּנִֽי׃|29 J|Looking about, he saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and asked, “Is this your youngest brother of whom you spoke to me?” And he went on, “May God be gracious to you, my boy.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Yaakov representing inner intelligence and grace, blessing the tribes with Chein, while Binyamin was blessed by Yosef with grace. Commentary on Genesis 43:29:1 includes Ibn Ezra explaining the unique root of "Yochnekhah," Sforno interpreting Joseph's blessing for Benjamin to gain his brothers' affection, and Radak noting Joseph recognized Benjamin due to their mother's resemblance. Midrash reflects on Joseph's emotional reaction to seeing Benjamin, his strategic actions to protect his brothers, and the peace between Judah and Joseph. Musar recounts Rabbi Yose and Rabbi Chiya expressing gratitude to a merchant, blessing him with the name Chanan for God's grace. Quoting Commentary includes Ramban on Numbers 20:10:1 discussing Moses' question as a test of faith, Rabbeinu Bahya on Shemot 34:6:6 on God's attributes, and Chizkuni on Exodus 34:6:4 interpreting "gracious" as generosity. Talmud mentions Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba suggesting Jochebed as the missing seventieth person in Jacob's family count, supported by Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina. Targum describes Jacob seeing Benjamin and Benjamin blessing the Lord in response. 

|וַיְמַהֵ֣ר יוֹסֵ֗ף כִּֽי־נִכְמְר֤וּ רַחֲמָיו֙ אֶל־אָחִ֔יו וַיְבַקֵּ֖שׁ לִבְכּ֑וֹת וַיָּבֹ֥א הַחַ֖דְרָה וַיֵּ֥בְךְּ שָֽׁמָּה׃|30 J|With that, Joseph hurried out, for he was overcome with feeling toward his brother and was on the verge of tears; he went into a room and wept there.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's compassion towards his brother Benjamin was stirred by learning about his ten sons' names, symbolizing his grief over his missing brother. The name Tetragrammaton is the distinct designation of God, denoting His unique existence. Joseph arranges a banquet for his brothers, showing concern for their wellbeing and giving special attention to Benjamin. The quality of Mercy and Graciousness is important for the righteous, as seen in Joseph's actions. In the future, God will nearly destroy all nations that attacked Jerusalem. 

|וַיִּרְחַ֥ץ פָּנָ֖יו וַיֵּצֵ֑א וַיִּ֨תְאַפַּ֔ק וַיֹּ֖אמֶר שִׂ֥ימוּ לָֽחֶם׃|31 J|Then he washed his face, reappeared, and—now in control of himself—gave the order, “Serve the meal.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph washed his face to hide his tears and maintain composure in front of his brothers, showing self-restraint in controlling his emotions despite the emotional turmoil he was experiencing. This act of restraint is compared to instances of exaggeration in the Bible and is connected to the term "restrained" in Isaiah by Rashi. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also mention Joseph washing his face before instructing to serve bread in Genesis 43:31. 

|וַיָּשִׂ֥ימוּ ל֛וֹ לְבַדּ֖וֹ וְלָהֶ֣ם לְבַדָּ֑ם וְלַמִּצְרִ֞ים הָאֹכְלִ֤ים אִתּוֹ֙ לְבַדָּ֔ם כִּי֩ לֹ֨א יוּכְל֜וּן הַמִּצְרִ֗ים לֶאֱכֹ֤ל אֶת־הָֽעִבְרִים֙ לֶ֔חֶם כִּי־תוֹעֵבָ֥ה הִ֖וא לְמִצְרָֽיִם׃|32 J|They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves; for the Egyptians could not dine with the Hebrews, since that would be abhorrent to the Egyptians.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Egyptians' disdain for sheep and goats, which they considered deities, led to a separation in dining between Joseph and his brothers as well as the Egyptians. This separation stemmed from the Covenant of Fate in Egypt, where the Jews were elevated to a unique status, emphasizing the importance of loving and respecting strangers. Joseph's slander of his brothers and the cultural differences between the Hebrews and Egyptians contributed to the mutual distaste for each other's eating habits, as seen in Genesis 43:32 and Exodus 39:6. Separate dining arrangements were made due to religious dietary restrictions, with the Egyptians unable to eat with the Hebrews because the animals they worshipped were considered unclean. 

|וַיֵּשְׁב֣וּ לְפָנָ֔יו הַבְּכֹר֙ כִּבְכֹ֣רָת֔וֹ וְהַצָּעִ֖יר כִּצְעִרָת֑וֹ וַיִּתְמְה֥וּ הָאֲנָשִׁ֖ים אִ֥ישׁ אֶל־רֵעֵֽהוּ׃|33 J|As they were seated by his direction, from the oldest in the order of his seniority to the youngest in the order of his youth, the men looked at one another in astonishment.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In the Chasidut commentary, the brothers drank wine with Yosef as a form of reparation after feeling they had achieved some level of forgiveness, which was unintentional and not with a complete heart. The seating arrangement at the banquet arranged by Yosef caused astonishment among the brothers, with confusion about the communication involved. The Midrash discusses Joseph's compassion towards Benjamin and symbolism of Judah and Joseph eating together. The Musar commentary highlights the suspicion of Joseph's motives in seeking royalty and the reconciliation between Joseph and Yehudah. The Targum mentions the seating arrangement of the brothers before Yosef according to their birth order and the placement of Benjamin next to Yosef. 

|וַיִּשָּׂ֨א מַשְׂאֹ֜ת מֵאֵ֣ת פָּנָיו֮ אֲלֵהֶם֒ וַתֵּ֜רֶב מַשְׂאַ֧ת בִּנְיָמִ֛ן מִמַּשְׂאֹ֥ת כֻּלָּ֖ם חָמֵ֣שׁ יָד֑וֹת וַיִּשְׁתּ֥וּ וַֽיִּשְׁכְּר֖וּ עִמּֽוֹ׃|34 J|Portions were served them from his table; but Benjamin’s portion was several  times that of anyone else. And they drank their fill with him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra defines "masot" as gifts in Genesis 43:34, Sforno explains that Benjamin's gifts were five times greater than any individual brother's gifts, Rashbam suggests Benjamin's gift was far greater, Rashi clarifies Benjamin received five times his own portion and additional gifts, Tze'enah Ure'enah explains Benjamin received five gifts. In Halakhah, betrothal with less than a p'rutah is invalid, but intercourse in the presence of witnesses requires a divorce. Shemot Rabbah 21 emphasizes God listens to prayers before they are spoken, the structure of daily prayers reflects service to God, and proper prayer is seen as equivalent to Temple service. Avudraham's interpretation of Numbers 4:15 and Genesis 43:34 inspired the prayer "And load us." In Midrash, Joseph tested his brothers' loyalty by framing Benjamin, who later offered a peace offering symbolizing his family's history and future, leading to divine praise for Avidan. In Mishnah Makkot 3:2, those liable for lashes include individuals who eat sacrificial food while impure, and in Mishnah Shabbat 23:2, guests may be counted from memory and lots drawn for equal portions. Rashi discusses presents from the king's palace, Rashbam compares gifts given to Binyamin in Exodus, Radak interprets receiving a blessing from the Lord, and Chizkuni interprets the word "gift." Rabbi Yosei suggests Joseph's brothers did not drink wine until they were with him in the Talmud. According to Targum, Benjamin's portion at the meal with Joseph was five times larger than the others'. 

## Genesis 44

|וַיְצַ֞ו אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֣ר עַל־בֵּיתוֹ֮ לֵאמֹר֒ מַלֵּ֞א אֶת־אַמְתְּחֹ֤ת הָֽאֲנָשִׁים֙ אֹ֔כֶל כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר יוּכְל֖וּן שְׂאֵ֑ת וְשִׂ֥ים כֶּֽסֶף־אִ֖ישׁ בְּפִ֥י אַמְתַּחְתּֽוֹ׃|1 J|Then he instructed his house steward as follows, “Fill the men’s bags with food, as much as they can carry, and put each one’s money in the mouth of his bag.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph strategically tested his brothers' loyalty by placing his goblet in Benjamin's sack, leading to discomfort and confusion but without causing harm. The use of words like karab, naga‘, and nagash in the text indicate physical nearness and movement towards others. Judah's speech to Joseph was a plea for compassion, suggesting that the goblet incident was a test by Joseph. In Genesis 44:1, Onkelos and Targum Jonathan recount Joseph instructing his steward to fill the men's bags with grain and return their money. 

|וְאֶת־גְּבִיעִ֞י גְּבִ֣יעַ הַכֶּ֗סֶף תָּשִׂים֙ בְּפִי֙ אַמְתַּ֣חַת הַקָּטֹ֔ן וְאֵ֖ת כֶּ֣סֶף שִׁבְר֑וֹ וַיַּ֕עַשׂ כִּדְבַ֥ר יוֹסֵ֖ף אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֵּֽר׃|2 J|Put my silver goblet in the mouth of the bag of the youngest one, together with his money for the rations.” And he did as Joseph told him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the meaning of the word "goblet" in Genesis 44:2, with interpretations by Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Rashi, Siftei Chakhamim, Chizkuni, and Steinsaltz. Knowledge is achieved through deeds, gematria, and the "silver goblet" in Kol HaTor 3:8, related to building Jerusalem and concealed in gematria according to the Sages. In the Midrash, Joseph's brothers unknowingly have their silver returned to them in their sacks, along with Joseph's silver goblet in Benjamin's sack. Joseph Ibn Kaspi expresses his intention to write about the secrets of the Torah in his new book "The Guide to Knowledge" or "The Silver Goblet." Onkelos and Targum Jonathan recount the story of Joseph planting a silver goblet in the youngest brother's bag in Genesis 44:2. 

|הַבֹּ֖קֶר א֑וֹר וְהָאֲנָשִׁ֣ים שֻׁלְּח֔וּ הֵ֖מָּה וַחֲמֹרֵיהֶֽם׃|3 J|With the first light of morning, the men were sent off with their pack animals.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of studying Torah in difficult circumstances, poverty, and distress, likening it to the darkness of night. The commentary discusses the early morning departure of Joseph's brothers, highlighting the use of the word "אור" as a verb and the importance of leaving during the day. In Kabbalah, Tikkunei Zohar explains the arrival of the blessed Holy One and the representation of mercy and light. Jacob warns his sons not to appear sated in front of Esau and Ishmael in the Midrash, while Mishnah discusses the consequences of a nazirite consuming forbidden items. Radak explains the significance of the name Zevulun, and Talmud analyzes the word "or" to determine its meaning. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the men being sent off with their donkeys as the morning lightened in Genesis 44:3. 

|הֵ֠ם יָֽצְא֣וּ אֶת־הָעִיר֮ לֹ֣א הִרְחִ֒יקוּ֒ וְיוֹסֵ֤ף אָמַר֙ לַֽאֲשֶׁ֣ר עַל־בֵּית֔וֹ ק֥וּם רְדֹ֖ף אַחֲרֵ֣י הָֽאֲנָשִׁ֑ים וְהִשַּׂגְתָּם֙ וְאָמַרְתָּ֣ אֲלֵהֶ֔ם לָ֛מָּה שִׁלַּמְתֶּ֥ם רָעָ֖ה תַּ֥חַת טוֹבָֽה׃|4 J|They had just left the city and had not gone far, when Joseph said to his house steward, “Up, go after those men! And when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why did you repay good with evil?|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph's brothers departed from the city, prompting a pursuit due to accusations of theft. The term "yaẓa" is discussed in relation to motion and appearance, while Joseph plans to frame his brothers by planting his silver cup in Benjamin's sack. Radak clarifies the meaning of the text using the word "et" in various biblical verses, and Targum describes Joseph instructing his house steward to pursue his brothers for their actions. 

|הֲל֣וֹא זֶ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִשְׁתֶּ֤ה אֲדֹנִי֙ בּ֔וֹ וְה֕וּא נַחֵ֥שׁ יְנַחֵ֖שׁ בּ֑וֹ הֲרֵעֹתֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר עֲשִׂיתֶֽם׃|5 J|It is the very one from which my master drinks and which he uses for divination. It was a wicked thing for you to do!’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph accused his brothers of stealing his divination cup to test their loyalty, despite already knowing their guilt through divination. The brothers denied the accusation and offered to be slaves if the goblet was found among them. The principle of self-defense applies to both Noachides and Jews, but taking the life of an innocent bystander to save oneself is forbidden. Joseph's brothers are rebuked by God for causing their father's clothes to be rent for nothing, leading them to realize their own wrongdoing. Leviticus 19:26 prohibits divination and the consumption of blood, as seen in the story of Joseph's goblet. 

|וַֽיַּשִּׂגֵ֑ם וַיְדַבֵּ֣ר אֲלֵהֶ֔ם אֶת־הַדְּבָרִ֖ים הָאֵֽלֶּה׃|6 J|He overtook them and spoke those words to them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 44:6, both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe how Joseph caught up with his brothers and spoke to them. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֔יו לָ֚מָּה יְדַבֵּ֣ר אֲדֹנִ֔י כַּדְּבָרִ֖ים הָאֵ֑לֶּה חָלִ֙ילָה֙ לַעֲבָדֶ֔יךָ מֵעֲשׂ֖וֹת כַּדָּבָ֥ר הַזֶּֽה׃|7 J|And they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything of the kind!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers returned the money they found to prove their honesty and dismissed the value of the goblet, arguing against accusations of theft. In Kabbalah, the Shechinah's connection to the divine is symbolized by the phylactery of the hand. Ramban questions Potiphar's wife's accusation of Joseph, suggesting it may have been about intimacy rather than adultery. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan convey the brothers' refusal to commit a degrading act suggested by Joseph. 

|הֵ֣ן כֶּ֗סֶף אֲשֶׁ֤ר מָצָ֙אנוּ֙ בְּפִ֣י אַמְתְּחֹתֵ֔ינוּ הֱשִׁיבֹ֥נוּ אֵלֶ֖יךָ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וְאֵ֗יךְ נִגְנֹב֙ מִבֵּ֣ית אֲדֹנֶ֔יךָ כֶּ֖סֶף א֥וֹ זָהָֽב׃|8 J|Here we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money that we found in the mouths of our bags. How then could we have stolen any silver or gold from your master’s house!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers returned the money they found in their sacks to Joseph to show their honesty and integrity, even though they were told they owed nothing (Genesis 44:8). The Midrash emphasizes the importance of loving, honoring, and having awe for one another, using a series of a fortiori inferences to highlight the covenant between the Lord and the forefathers (Tanna DeBei Eliyahu Rabbah 26:1; Bereshit Rabbah 92:7). The Targum explains that the brothers returned the money to prove they did not steal silver or gold vessels from Joseph's house (Onkelos Genesis 44:8; Targum Jonathan on Genesis 44:8). 

|אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִמָּצֵ֥א אִתּ֛וֹ מֵעֲבָדֶ֖יךָ וָמֵ֑ת וְגַם־אֲנַ֕חְנוּ נִֽהְיֶ֥ה לַֽאדֹנִ֖י לַעֲבָדִֽים׃|9 J|Whichever of your servants it is found with shall die; the rest of us, moreover, shall become slaves to my lord.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers in Genesis 44:9 initially declared death for the thief of the goblet, but later offered themselves as slaves when it was found with Benjamin, showing their innocence. Judah takes responsibility for Benjamin, suffering for his role in selling Joseph as a slave, and goes to great lengths to bring Benjamin back while the other brothers offer to become slaves. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 44:9 both agree that the thief would face death and the rest would become slaves if the missing item was found with a servant. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר גַּם־עַתָּ֥ה כְדִבְרֵיכֶ֖ם כֶּן־ה֑וּא אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִמָּצֵ֤א אִתּוֹ֙ יִהְיֶה־לִּ֣י עָ֔בֶד וְאַתֶּ֖ם תִּהְי֥וּ נְקִיִּֽם׃|10 J|He replied, “Although what you are proposing is right, only the one with whom it is found shall be my slave; but the rest of you shall go free.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph shows leniency towards his guilty brothers by only making the one with the stolen goblet his servant, rather than all of them as suggested by the law. The Midrash highlights the consequences of the king's son's wrongdoings and Joseph's brothers' accusations against Benjamin. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan provide different translations of Joseph's response to his brothers in Genesis 44:10. 

|וַֽיְמַהֲר֗וּ וַיּוֹרִ֛דוּ אִ֥ישׁ אֶת־אַמְתַּחְתּ֖וֹ אָ֑רְצָה וַֽיִּפְתְּח֖וּ אִ֥ישׁ אַמְתַּחְתּֽוֹ׃|11 J|So each one hastened to lower his bag to the ground, and each one opened his bag.|

The brothers in Genesis 44:11 hurried to lower their sacks and open them for inspection, showing their willingness to comply with Joseph's request according to Steinsaltz and Targum Jonathan. 

|וַיְחַפֵּ֕שׂ בַּגָּד֣וֹל הֵחֵ֔ל וּבַקָּטֹ֖ן כִּלָּ֑ה וַיִּמָּצֵא֙ הַגָּבִ֔יעַ בְּאַמְתַּ֖חַת בִּנְיָמִֽן׃|12 J|He searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the goblet turned up in Benjamin’s bag.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph searched the brothers' sacks starting with the oldest to avoid suspicion, leading to the discovery of the goblet in Benjamin's sack. Benjamin was unjustly accused of theft, but G'd promised him the Holy Temple on his tribal territory as compensation. The search for leaven before Passover is compared to the search for the goblet, emphasizing the importance of searching with a lamp. The Talmud derives the requirement to search for leaven from the story of finding the goblet in Benjamin's sack. 

|וַֽיִּקְרְע֖וּ שִׂמְלֹתָ֑ם וַֽיַּעֲמֹס֙ אִ֣ישׁ עַל־חֲמֹר֔וֹ וַיָּשֻׁ֖בוּ הָעִֽירָה׃|13 J|At this they rent their clothes. Each reloaded his pack animal, and they returned to the city.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers symbolically reloaded their donkeys as a punishment for causing their father to mourn by sending Joseph's coat, leading to a measure-for-measure repayment from God. The Liturgy emphasizes annulling evil decrees through repentance, prayer, and charity, as seen in various sections of the Machzor Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur Ashkenaz. In different Midrashim, Moses, the brothers' treatment of Benjamin, and Mordecai's actions in Shushan are highlighted, showing the generational impact of actions. Radak and Rashi interpret "burdened" in Zechariah 12:3 and II Chronicles 10:11 as being loaded, similar to Genesis 44:13. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the men tearing their clothes in grief and loading their donkeys in Genesis 44:13, with Targum Jonathan adding that they were given strength to endure. 

|וַיָּבֹ֨א יְהוּדָ֤ה וְאֶחָיו֙ בֵּ֣יתָה יוֹסֵ֔ף וְה֖וּא עוֹדֶ֣נּוּ שָׁ֑ם וַיִּפְּל֥וּ לְפָנָ֖יו אָֽרְצָה׃|14 J|When Judah and his brothers reentered the house of Joseph, who was still there, they threw themselves on the ground before him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Judah and his brothers went to Joseph's house where they prostrated themselves before him, fulfilling Joseph's dream of eleven stars bowing down to him. Judah spoke on behalf of his brothers and offered to take Benjamin's place as a slave, leading them to agree to sell Joseph to the Ishmaelites. Rabbeinu Bahya explains that Yaakov's placement of Ephrayim ahead of Menashe was to show respect to the older brother, and the leadership dynamic shifts to Judah in Egypt. In Targum, Judah and his brothers find Joseph still at his house and bow down before him. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר לָהֶם֙ יוֹסֵ֔ף מָֽה־הַמַּעֲשֶׂ֥ה הַזֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר עֲשִׂיתֶ֑ם הֲל֣וֹא יְדַעְתֶּ֔ם כִּֽי־נַחֵ֧שׁ יְנַחֵ֛שׁ אִ֖ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר כָּמֹֽנִי׃|15 J|Joseph said to them, “What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me practices divination?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph, as a high-ranking official, implied he could practice divination to uncover the truth about the stolen goblet, which should have deterred his brothers from stealing. The concept that God is identical with His attributes is reflected in the Hebrew language, emphasizing the unity between God and His qualities. Joseph accused his brothers of stealing the silver cup, suggesting Benjamin used it for divination to find Joseph. The role of the Messiah Ben Joseph involves defeating negative forces and subduing the serpent's influence in the land. Chizkuni explains that "enchantments" refer to instances of financial success, searching for a missing goblet, and warning against using sorcery. Yoseif asserts his expertise in divination when accusing his brothers of wrongdoing. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוּדָ֗ה מַה־נֹּאמַר֙ לַֽאדֹנִ֔י מַה־נְּדַבֵּ֖ר וּמַה־נִּצְטַדָּ֑ק הָאֱלֹהִ֗ים מָצָא֙ אֶת־עֲוֺ֣ן עֲבָדֶ֔יךָ הִנֶּ֤נּוּ עֲבָדִים֙ לַֽאדֹנִ֔י גַּם־אֲנַ֕חְנוּ גַּ֛ם אֲשֶׁר־נִמְצָ֥א הַגָּבִ֖יעַ בְּיָדֽוֹ׃|16 J|Judah replied, “What can we say to my lord? How can we plead, how can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered the crime of your servants. Here we are, then, slaves of my lord, the rest of us as much as he in whose possession the goblet was found.”|

Chasidut: Mei HaShiloach connects the brothers' false accusation to their past sin of selling Yosef, while Sippurei Maasiyot alludes to the shattering and repair of the pre-Creation sefirot in the narrative. Ibn Ezra explains the spelling of "nitztaddak," Rashi suggests God orchestrated the situation for the brothers to face their sins, and Liturgy expresses shame and repentance before God. Midrash highlights the consequences of the brothers' actions in selling Joseph, and Musar discusses the concept of "measure for measure" in their behavior. Quoting Commentary provides linguistic explanations from different verses, and Responsa explores the dilemma of saving a thief from the death penalty. Talmud explains an abbreviation in Genesis, and Targum depicts Judah offering to be a slave along with the one in possession of the goblet to justify themselves for their sins. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר חָלִ֣ילָה לִּ֔י מֵעֲשׂ֖וֹת זֹ֑את הָאִ֡ישׁ אֲשֶׁר֩ נִמְצָ֨א הַגָּבִ֜יעַ בְּיָד֗וֹ ה֚וּא יִהְיֶה־לִּ֣י עָ֔בֶד וְאַתֶּ֕ם עֲל֥וּ לְשָׁל֖וֹם אֶל־אֲבִיכֶֽם׃|17 J|But he replied, “Far be it from me to act thus! Only the one in whose possession the goblet was found shall be my slave; the rest of you go back in peace to your father.”|

Joseph did not want to be an instrument of punishment for the brothers' past crimes, only punishing the guilty party, as seen in various commentaries. Sins between humans must be atoned for directly, as shown in the example of Abraham reconciling with Lot. Judah's selfless offer as a slave in Benjamin's place leads to Joseph revealing himself and forgiving his brothers in the Midrash. Joseph's statement in Genesis 44:17 allowed the brothers to return to their father in peace, with Reuben still facing punishment for his own sins. Radak and Rabbenu Bachya highlight the strategic approach of Judah in appealing to Joseph's conscience in addressing the situation. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan depict Joseph declaring that the man with the goblet will be his slave, allowing the others to return to their father in peace.
