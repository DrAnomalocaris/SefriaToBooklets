The Torahs can be set before hand so that they can be opened to the correct portion without the necessity of rolling the scroll from one portion to the next.</i> In the first Torah six men read from the portion “<span dir=\"ltr\">אחרי מות</span>”, (Leviticus 16:1-18:30) until “and he did as the Lord commanded (Moses)”, (Leviticus 16:34). But if (Yom Kippur) falls on Shabbat, seven (men read from the first Torah), and the <i>Maftir</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maftir</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מפטיר</span>, means literally \"one who concludes\". It is the name given to the man who is the last to read in the Torah and he also usually reads the <i>haftarah</i> (see footnote 170), the section of the prophets that corresponds to the Torah reading. <i>Maftir</i> is also the name given to the three or more concluding verses of the regular weekly Torah portion as well as to the final verses read on festivals and public fast days.<br>Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 11, p. 685.</i> (the last reader) reads from the second (Torah scroll) from the portion, <i>Pinḥas</i>, (Numbers 25:10-30:1), the section “and you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month”, (Numbers 29:7-11). The <i>Maftir</i> (the <i>Haftarah</i> section from the Prophets<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Haftarah</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">הפטרה</span>, is a portion from the Prophets section of the Bible read after the Torah is read on Sabbaths, festivals, and fast days. On Sabbaths and festivals the <i>haftarah</i> is read during the Morning, <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service (see footnote 17), but on fast days it is read only during the Afternoon, <i>Minḥah</i> Service (see footnote 40). The exception to this is Yom Kippur and <i>Tishah be-Av</i> (see footnote 102) where there is a <i>haftarah</i> after the Torah reading in both the Morning and the Afternoon Service.<br>The Torah in its regular portions is read straight through during the year but such is not the case on festivals and some special Sabbaths. The <i>haftarot</i> are selected in parts from both the Former and Latter Prophets. Only two prophetic books are read in their entirety as <i>haftarot</i>, the Book of Obadiah which has only twenty-one verses and is read after the Torah portion <i>Va-Yishlaḥ</i> (Genesis 32:4-36-43) according to the Sephardi rite, and the Book of Jonah which is the <i>haftarah</i> for the <i>Minḥah</i> Service on Yom Kippur (see the Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> 622:2).<br><i>Haftarot</i> were usually selected so there would be some similarity in content between the Pentateuchal and the Prophetic portions, but often this did not happen and <i>haftarot</i> were chosen because of historical events or because of some special date. Special <i>haftarot</i> are read on special Sabbaths and the <i>haftarah</i> for each festival is based on the nature of the festival.<br>When the custom of reading the <i>haftarah</i> got started is not known for sure, but it is thought that it began during the persecutions of the Antiochus Epiphanes which preceded the Hasmonean revolt. The Torah was not permitted to be read by the Jews during the persecution for it was felt that the reading of it kept the Jews together and gave them a special strength. As a substitute for the Torah reading, sections form the Prophets were chosen that would remind the Jews of the corresponding Torah portion. Appearantly when the ban against reading the Torah was lifted, the practice of reading the <i>haftarah</i> continued. The first mention of the practice of the reading of the <i>haftarah</i> is found in the New Testament. Acts 13:15 states, \"after the reading of the law and the prophets\". <i>Haftarot</i> are also discussed in the Talmud as to which are to be read at specific times and festivals. In Mishnaic times different communities read different <i>haftarot</i>, and a set order was probably not established until talmudic times. Some <i>haftarot</i> today differ from those recorded in the Talmud, and there are differences in the Sephardi and Ashkenazi rites.<br>The <i>maftir</i>, the one who reads the <i>haftarah</i> also reads the last part of the weekly portion, (i.e., the Torah reader reads it for him). On the Sabbath, after the seventh reader from the Torah, the <i>maftir</i> usually rereads the last three verses of the weekly portion. On festivals and the four special Sabbaths, the <i>maftir</i> reads the special section from the second scroll which is usually a short description of of the festival found in the Torah. Before the <i>haftarah</i> is read (or chanted) the <i>maftir</i> precedes the <i>haftarah</i> with two blessings and after he ends the <i>haftarah</i> he recites three blessings to which a fourth one is added on Sabbaths and festivals. This fourth blessing changes with the nature of the day. The Sabbath <i>haftarah</i> usually has a minimum of twenty-one verses while the festival has at least fifteen verses. Lately it has become the custom for the Bar Mitzvah boy (a man upon reaching the age of thirteen) to chant the <i>haftarah</i> to display his ability with a Hebrew text.<br>Louis Isaac Rabinowitz, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 16, pp. 1342-44.</i>) comes from Isaiah, “and shall say, cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way” until “for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it”, (Isaiah 57:14-58:14).", "versionTitle": "Hilkhot Yom ha-Kippurim, trans. by Jan M.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

It is concerned, then, with the transfer of leadership from Moshe to Yehoshua (Joshua); with provisions for two and a half tribes to remain on the east bank of the Jordan River, as long as they take part in the impending invasion; with listing the entire route of the Israelites, from Egypt to the plains of Moab; and with the borders of the land to be conquered.", "As has been the case earlier in the book, however, other material intervenes: a theme and variation doublet on the inheritance of land in a case where a man leaves daughters, not sons; two chapters on what sacrifices are to be brought on holy days; a section on vows taken by women; war with Midyan and the precise apportioning of spoils, both to warriors and to the sanctuary; and the law regarding accidental homicide, in which family vengeance is circumvented by the existence of “safe” Levite towns to which the manslayer may flee.", "The inconsistent thematics may again be explained by the intrusion of an editorial hand, again by priestly interests. In Levine’s view, most of Chapters 25–36 function to establish matters of importance in the priestly view, just as in Chapters 1–10. Here law takes precedence over narrative.", "Despite the varied subject matter of this section, it holds together structurally, via the common biblical technique of word (sound) repetition. The rather common verb <i>tzivvah</i>, “command,” weaves through every one of Chapters 26–36, except for 33. Sometimes it introduces what God wants the Israelites to do; sometimes it leads to the formula of fulfillment, “as YHWH commanded the Children of Israel, so they did”; still other times it refers to a command given by Moshe himself. The entire section begins with the verb (26:4), and ends with it as well (36:13). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking.", "Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. 26), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come-near” (27:1 and 36:1). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it.", "Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again.", "What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy.", "<img>", "<b><i>Num. 26:3</i> Moshe spoke, and El’azar the priest, to them in the Plains of Moav …</b>"], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

7:49).</b> <br>“His offering was one silver dish [<i>kaarat</i>]….” – this is the offering that he presented in the name of Jacob, who had him precede Manasseh, and in the name of Joseph, who, because of his love, Jacob blessed him all those blessings, just as it says: “He blessed Joseph and said: The God [before whom my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, walked…]” (Genesis 48:15), and it says: “By you Israel shall bless, saying: May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh…” (Genesis 48:20). <br>“Dish [<i>kaarat</i>]” – this is Jacob; do not read it as <i>kaarat</i>, but rather, as <i>akeret</i>, who uprooted [<i>akar</i>] the right hand from Manasseh in favor of Ephraim. “Silver” – after, “the tongue of the righteous is choice silver” (Proverbs 10:20); what he said to Joseph: “His father refused, and said: I know, my son, I know; he too shall become a people…” (Genesis 48:19). “Its weight one hundred and thirty” – corresponding to the one hundred and thirty words that there are from “he laid it on Ephraim’s head” (Genesis 48:14) until “he placed Ephraim before Manasseh” (Genesis 48:20). “One silver basin [<i>mizrak</i>]” – this is Joseph, who was cast away [<i>shenizrak</i>] from his father and sold to Egypt. “One” – as he was king in Egypt, just as it says: “One of the people<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Avimelekh said this referring to himself.</i> almost lay [with your wife]” (Genesis 26:10). Likewise it says: “Joseph was the ruler over the land…” (Genesis 42:6). “Silver” – after “the tongue of the righteous is choice silver,” as due to his wisdom he was privileged to achieve kingship, just as it says: “After God has disclosed all this to you.… You will be in charge of my house…” (Genesis 41:39–40). “Seventy shekels in the sacred shekel” – as Gabriel came and added one letter from the name of the Holy One blessed be He to his name and taught him seventy languages, as it is stated: “He established it as a precept for Joseph [<i>bihosef</i>]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He added a heh, changing Joseph [Yosef] to Yehosef.</i> when he went out over Egypt; I learned a language I had not known” (Psalms 81:6), as were it not so, the Egyptians would not have accepted Joseph to rule over them. <br>“Both of them full of high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering” – Jacob and Joseph were both full-fledged righteous men, and the two of them resembled one another. This accords with what Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: “These are the chronicles of Jacob, Joseph” (Genesis 37:2). It should have said nothing other than: “These are the chronicles of Jacob, Reuben.” Why is it stated: “These are the chronicles of Jacob, Joseph”? It is to teach you that Joseph resembled his father in every respect. Just as Jacob was born circumcised, so too, Joseph was born circumcised. Just as this one, his mother was barren, so too, that one, his mother was barren. Just as this one, his mother suffered from the pain of her pregnancy, so too that one, his mother suffered during birth. Just as this one, his mother bore two, so too that one, his mother bore two. Just as this one, his brother seeks to kill him, this one, too, his brothers seek to kill him. This one, his brother hates [<i>soneh</i>] him, and that one, likewise. This one is a shepherd and that one is a shepherd. This one is hated [<i>nistam</i>] and that one is hated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 27:41, 49:23.</i> This one was stolen from twice: “Stolen in the day and stolen at night” (Genesis 31:39); that one, there is a double expression of stealing: “For I was abducted [<i>gunov gunavti</i>] [from the land of the Hebrews]” (Genesis 40:15). This one was blessed with ten blessings,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 27:28–29.</i> and that one was blessed with ten blessings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 33:13–17.</i> This one departed and went outside of the Land of Israel, and that one departed and went outside of the Land of Israel. This one took a wife outside of the Land of Israel, and that one took a wife outside of the Land of Israel. This one begot children outside of the Land of Israel, and that one begot children outside of the Land of Israel. This one, angels accompanied him, and that one, angels accompanied him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A midrash says that when Joseph went to his brothers at the behest of his father, three angels accompanied him.</i> This one ascended to greatness by means of a dream<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Genesis 28:10–16.</i> and that one ascended to greatness by means of a dream.

This one died in Egypt, and that one died in Egypt. This one was embalmed, and that one was embalmed. This one, his bones ascended, and that one, his bones ascended. Because Joseph resembled his father, that is why it is stated: “These are the chronicles of Jacob, Joseph”; and that is why it is stated: “Both of them full…” – regarding Jacob and Joseph. <br><b>“One gold ladle of ten shekels, filled with incense” (Numbers 7:50).</b> <br>“One…ladle [<i>kaf</i>]” – it corresponds to the palm of his right hand, which he placed on Ephraim’s head. Why does it call it “one”? It is because it is more significant than the left. “Gold…ten shekels” – it corresponds to the ten words that there are from: “Israel extended his right hand” (Genesis 48:14) until “and he was the younger” (Genesis 48:14). “Filled with incense” – Jacob saw this matter through the divine spirit, that Ephraim was worthy for him to place his right hand on his head. Likewise it says: “Guiding [<i>sikel</i>] his hands, as Manasseh was the first born” (Genesis 48:14). His hands were guided [<i>hiskilu</i>] by the divine spirit, just as it says: “<i>Maskil </i>of Eitan the Ezraḥite” (Psalms 89:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a psalm stated by Eitan the Ezraḥite with divine guidance.</i> <br><b>“One young bull, one ram, one sheep in its first year, as a burnt offering” (Numbers 7:51).</b> <br>“One young [<i>ben bakar</i>] bull” – corresponding to Abraham, as it is stated: “Abraham ran to the cattle [<i>habakar</i>]” (Genesis 18:7). “One ram” – corresponding to Isaac, in whose regard it is written: “[Abraham…] took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering in place of his son” (Genesis 22:13). “One sheep” – corresponding to Jacob, in whose regard it is written: “Jacob separated the sheep” (Genesis 30:40). Why did he sacrifice these three kinds of burnt offerings? It corresponds to the three patriarchs, corresponding to the blessing that Jacob blessed them: “Let my name and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac, be called upon them” (Genesis 48:16). <br><b>“One goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 7:52). <br>“And for the peace offering, two bulls, five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Elishama son of Amihud” (Numbers 7:53).</b> <br>“One goat as a sin offering” – corresponding to Joseph, as it is written: “They slaughtered a goat” (Genesis 37:31). Why did he sacrifice this corresponding to Joseph? It is because when Jacob blessed them with the name of the three patriarchs, likewise, he blessed them with the name of Joseph and made them dependent upon him, as it is stated: “By you Israel shall bless, saying: May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh” (Genesis 48:20). “And for the peace offering, two bulls” – corresponding to the two blessings that he blessed them: the former, “[may the angel…] bless the lads” (Genesis 48:16), and the latter, “by you Israel shall bless….” <br>“Five rams, [five goats, five lambs]” – three species, corresponding to three generations that Joseph saw for Ephraim, who were attributed to Joseph, and they were patrilineal houses, as it is stated: “Joseph saw great-grandchildren from Ephraim” (Genesis 50:23). Likewise it says: “These are the sons of Ephraim by their families: Of Shutelaḥ.… And these are the sons of Shutelaḥ: Of Eran…” (Numbers 26:35–36). Ephraim, Shutelaḥ, Eran, these are three sons from three generations. Why were they five each? It corresponds to the five words<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Hebrew phrase.</i> of “he placed Ephraim before Manasseh” (Genesis 48:20), as it is from there that Ephraim merited to present his offering first. <br>“This was the offering…” – because he presented the offering in this order, the Holy One blessed be He began lauding his offering: “This was the offering of Elishama….”", "versionTitle": "The Sefaria Midrash Rabbah, 2022", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "5e85c2945606368b4d871f43", "index_title": "Agra DeKala", "category": "Chasidut", "type": "", "ref": "Agra DeKala, Pinchas 27", "anchorRef": "Numbers 26:35", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 26:35"], "sourceRef": "Agra DeKala, Pinchas 27", "sourceHeRef": "אגרא דכלה, פנחס כ״ז", "anchorVerse": 35, "sourceHasEn": false, "compDate": [1801, 1841], "commentaryNum": 27, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Agra DeKala", "he": "אגרא דכלה"}, "heTitle": "פנחס", "he": "<b>יש</b> להתבונן שבמנין כל השבטים לא נאמר אלה בהתחלת המפקד, רק באפרי\"ם (במדבר כו לה) וד\"ן (במדבר כו מב). ואחשבה להיות תיבת אל\"ה, (בהחשב האלף לאלף בסוד הקטן יהיה לאלף (ישעיה ס כב), ואיכה ירדף אחד אלף (דברים לב ל)), הוא בגימטריא ה' פעמים או\"ר הנזכר במעשה בראשית, שהוא סוד ה' חסדים. וידוע שאחר החטא עשה י\"י אלקים לאדם ולאשתו כתנות עו\"ר (בעי\"ן) (בראשית ג כא), ובתורתו של ר' מאיר (ששמו הוא מאיר לשון או\"ר), היה כתוב כתנות או\"ר (ב\"ר פ\"כ י\"ב). והנה בסיבת החטא שנגנז האו\"ר ונתחלף עו\"ר (בעי\"ן (זוהר ח\"א ל\"ו ע\"ב)), מזה נמשך שיש שליטה לעי\"ן הר\"ע, וכאשר יושפע על האדם בחינת או\"ר בבחינת ה' פעמים או\"ר ה' חסדים, אזי נמתקים הה' גבורות ואין שליטה לעין (והבן, ויהי רצון שלא יאמר פינו דבר שלא כרצונו). והנה מנשה נתברך ממפקד הראשון שבחומש הפקודים עד המפקד הלז בעשרים אלף וחמש מאות, כמו שאמרו רז\"ל (ילקו\"ש יהושע רמז י\"ז) בפסוק (יהושע יז יד) אשר עד כ\"ה ברכני ד', מה שאין כן מאפרים אדרבא נחסרו, (ואפשר מזה הטעם הקדים בכאן מנשה לאפרים (במדבר כו כח) להקדים הברכה). וזה שהוסיף בכאן תיבת אל\"ה באפרים להעניקו מברכת או\"ר. להאכילו נחלת אביו שלא תשלוט בו עין. ובדן הוא להיפך שלא ישלוט בו עין, להיות מפקדו דבר חידוש שלא היה רק משפחה אחת, ועם כל זה לא תמצא כמספרו בכל השבטים זולת יהודה שהוא מלך, ולהצילו מעי\"ן נכתב בו תיבת אל\"ה, כנ\"ל:", "heVersionTitle": "Agra DeKala, Brooklyn, N.Y., 1993", "heLicense": "Public Domain", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "", "text": "", "versionTitle": null, "license": null, "versionTitleInHebrew": null}, {"_id": "5e85c2985606368b4d871f6f", "index_title": "Agra DeKala", "category": "Chasidut", "type": "", "ref": "Agra DeKala, Pinchas 32", "anchorRef": "Numbers 26:35", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 26:35"], "sourceRef": "Agra DeKala, Pinchas 32", "sourceHeRef": "אגרא דכלה, פנחס ל״ב", "anchorVerse": 35, "sourceHasEn": true, "compDate": [1801, 1841], "commentaryNum": 32, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Agra DeKala", "he": "אגרא דכלה"}, "heTitle": "פנחס", "he": "<b>ליצר משפחת היצרי לשלם משפחת השלמי (במדבר כו מט).</b> נאמר לי רמיזת הפסוק בשם הרב הק' מהרז\"ב זצוק\"ל שאמר בשם אביו הרב הק' מהרי\"מ זצוק\"ל, שהפסוק מרמז ליצר, כשהאדם חפץ לילך אחר עצת היצר באיזה דבר, משפחת היצרי הרבה משפחות וסייעתות יהיו לו לילך אחר היצר. לשל\"ם כשרוצה להלוך בשלימות העבודה, משפחת השלמי כנ\"ל. והשלים הוא ז\"ל ואמר גם כן על דרך זה לתתן משפחת התחני (במדבר כו לה), כשאדם רוצה להתפלל ולהתחנן, אזי משפחתת התחני, וכנ\"ל:", "heVersionTitle": "Agra DeKala, Brooklyn, N.Y., 1993", "heLicense": "Public Domain", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "", "text": "<b>To Yetzer, the Yitzri family.

Genesis 1:16). Why, then, does the verse state: “And to rule during the day and at night”? Rather, it is referring to the righteous, who exert control over the body that was created to illuminate during the day and the body that was created to illuminate at night. That is what is written: “The sun stood still, and the moon stopped, until the nation took vengeance against their enemies. Is it not written in the book of the upright?” (Joshua 10:13). What is the book of the upright? It is the book of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis.</i> Why is it called the book of the upright?

Is it possible to say this?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Manasseh’s descendants were more numerous than those of Ephraim (Numbers 26:34–37).</i> Rather, this refers Joshua, who would descend from him [Ephraim], who would cause the orbs of the sun and the moon, which rule from one end of the world to the other, to stand still.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And in that sense Ephraim was greater than Manasseh.</i>  <br>Rabbi Ḥanan in the name of Shmuel applied it to the end of the Torah, [where it is said of Joseph]: “A firstborn bull is his majesty…[he will gore the peoples together at the ends of the earth]” (Deuteronomy 33:17).

When the Holy One blessed be He appeared to him, he found him sitting with the book of Deuteronomy in his hand. He said to him: ‘“Be strong” Joshua, “be courageous” Joshua, “this book of the Torah shall not depart…”’ (Joshua 1:6–8). He took him and showed him to the orb of the sun. He [Joshua] said to it: ‘Just as I have not been still from [reading] this [book], so, you shall stand still before me.’ Thereupon, “The sun stood still, and the moon stopped” (Joshua 10:13). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He said to it: ‘Wayward slave, are you not the acquired possession of my ancestor [Joseph]? Did my ancestor not see you in a dream: “Behold, the sun and the moon…[were prostrating themselves to me]”?’ (Genesis 37:9).
