## Genesis 32

|וַיִּשְׁלַ֨ח יַעֲקֹ֤ב מַלְאָכִים֙ לְפָנָ֔יו אֶל־עֵשָׂ֖ו אָחִ֑יו אַ֥רְצָה שֵׂעִ֖יר שְׂדֵ֥ה אֱדֽוֹם׃|4 J|Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights Rachel and Joseph's spiritual elevation through the attribute of harmony, while Yaakov's observance of commandments and sending of angels ahead of him to confront Eisav are seen as paving the way for future challenges. Commentary discusses Jacob's respectful approach to Esau through sending messengers, potentially angels, to avoid conflict, with angels serving as intermediaries between God and man. Midrash and Musar explore the protection and symbolism of angels in Jacob's encounters, with Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish and other commentators providing insights on Esau's actions and the empires mentioned in Genesis. Targum specifies the location of Jacob's messengers to Esau. 

|וַיְצַ֤ו אֹתָם֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר כֹּ֣ה תֹאמְר֔וּן לַֽאדֹנִ֖י לְעֵשָׂ֑ו כֹּ֤ה אָמַר֙ עַבְדְּךָ֣ יַעֲקֹ֔ב עִם־לָבָ֣ן גַּ֔רְתִּי וָאֵחַ֖ר עַד־עָֽתָּה׃|5 J|and instructed them as follows, “Thus shall you say, ‘To my lord Esau, thus says your servant Jacob:  I stayed with Laban and remained until now;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The tzadik's words can bring peace with enemies through tefilah, submission to nations is necessary until redemption, transforming evil impulses requires submission and conversion, gifts to Eisav aim to draw him closer to Yaakov's path, second tithe spent on food in Jerusalem compels charity, Abraham's incomplete departure and Isaac's suspicions lead to spiritual blessings over material wealth, Jacob humbles himself before Esau for peace, showing mercy to the poor is emphasized, righteous are compared to strangers, Torah study and prayers are alternatives to physical weapons, Yaakov's reference to taking Shechem alludes to future physical warfare for Jewish people, and Angel Gabriel hints at Jewish people's three exiles to Joseph through the word "ta'eh." (Chasidut, Commentary, Jewish Thought, Midrash, Quoting Commentary, Targum) 

|וַֽיְהִי־לִי֙ שׁ֣וֹר וַחֲמ֔וֹר צֹ֖אן וְעֶ֣בֶד וְשִׁפְחָ֑ה וָֽאֶשְׁלְחָה֙ לְהַגִּ֣יד לַֽאדֹנִ֔י לִמְצֹא־חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינֶֽיךָ׃|6 J|I have acquired cattle, asses, sheep, and male and female slaves; and I send this message to my lord in the hope of gaining your favor.’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that livelihood comes automatically through doing the will of the Place, transforming others through the words of the tzadik, meriting a higher soul through Torah, and sweetening the yetzer hara for future generations. Commentary on Jacob's message to Esau highlights his humility and transparency, while Jewish Thought discusses the qualifications for attaining prophetic powers. The Midrash focuses on Jacob's modesty and righteousness in contrast to Esau's arrogance, as well as the symbolism of the gifts sent to Esau. Quoting Commentary offers interpretations of specific verses, such as the use of singular terms in referring to multiple entities. Targum recounts Jacob's message to Esau, emphasizing his lack of wealth despite his blessings and his desire to avoid conflict. 

|וַיָּשֻׁ֙בוּ֙ הַמַּלְאָכִ֔ים אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֖ב לֵאמֹ֑ר בָּ֤אנוּ אֶל־אָחִ֙יךָ֙ אֶל־עֵשָׂ֔ו וְגַם֙ הֹלֵ֣ךְ לִקְרָֽאתְךָ֔ וְאַרְבַּע־מֵא֥וֹת אִ֖ישׁ עִמּֽוֹ׃|7 J|The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We came to your brother Esau; he himself is coming to meet you, and his retinue  numbers four hundred.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov's transformation into Yisrael symbolizes his ability to connect with absolute truth without resorting to trickery, highlighted by his statement "קטנתי - I have become small." Esau's approach with 400 armed men was perceived as threatening, leading Yaakov to fear a confrontation and prepare for defense. Esau's lack of repentance and evil nature is emphasized in Kabbalistic interpretations, while Jacob's fear of being killed by Esau and distress at the thought of killing him are discussed in Midrashic interpretations. The return of the messengers to Jacob in Musar and Targum commentaries further elaborate on the impending encounter between Yaakov and Esau. 

|וַיִּירָ֧א יַעֲקֹ֛ב מְאֹ֖ד וַיֵּ֣צֶר ל֑וֹ וַיַּ֜חַץ אֶת־הָעָ֣ם אֲשֶׁר־אִתּ֗וֹ וְאֶת־הַצֹּ֧אן וְאֶת־הַבָּקָ֛ר וְהַגְּמַלִּ֖ים לִשְׁנֵ֥י מַחֲנֽוֹת׃|8 J|Jacob was greatly frightened; in his anxiety, he divided the people with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Chasidut text emphasizes the importance of always fearing God, even in times of distress, illustrating how seemingly negative occurrences can be for our own good and how Divine blessing can come through loving means. Jacob feared Esau's intentions, divided his camp, and sent gifts to soften him, fearing for his life and his family's safety. Bileam's attempts to curse Israel led to his humiliation, acknowledging his sins. Jacob prayed for his family's well-being and eventual return in peace. Mordechai and Esther used different tactics to counteract the evil decree against the Jews. Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raised a contradiction regarding Jacob's fear despite God's promises, suggesting that sin could still cause suffering. Yaakov's immediate and intense reaction to Esav's approach raised questions about the distinction between fear and distress. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר אִם־יָב֥וֹא עֵשָׂ֛ו אֶל־הַמַּחֲנֶ֥ה הָאַחַ֖ת וְהִכָּ֑הוּ וְהָיָ֛ה הַמַּחֲנֶ֥ה הַנִּשְׁאָ֖ר לִפְלֵיטָֽה׃|9 J|thinking, “If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, the other camp may yet escape.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights Yaakov's establishment of the arvit prayer as a form of constant connection to Hashem, even in distress. Commentary emphasizes the importance of diversifying assets and Jacob's preparation for war, prayer, and giving gifts to escape Esau's wrath. Kabbalah discusses how Jacob repaired the sefirotic connections disrupted by sin, while Midrash illustrates Jacob's actions of dividing his people, sending gifts, and praying as proper conduct. Quoting Commentary provides examples of mixed constructions in the Torah, and Talmud explains how Obadiah merited prophecy for hiding prophets inspired by Jacob's strategy. Targum conveys Jacob's concern for the survival of one camp if Esau attacks. 

|וַיֹּ֘אמֶר֮ יַעֲקֹב֒ אֱלֹהֵי֙ אָבִ֣י אַבְרָהָ֔ם וֵאלֹהֵ֖י אָבִ֣י יִצְחָ֑ק יְהֹוָ֞ה הָאֹמֵ֣ר אֵלַ֗י שׁ֧וּב לְאַרְצְךָ֛ וּלְמוֹלַדְתְּךָ֖ וְאֵיטִ֥יבָה עִמָּֽךְ׃|10 J|Then Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham’s [house] and God of my father Isaac’s [house], O יהוה, who said to me, ‘Return to your native land and I will deal bountifully with you’!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov expressed humility and gratitude towards Hashem, attributing all accomplishments to divine kindness, ensuring merits passed to descendants. Yaakov's prayer structure emphasized reliance on divine promises and mercy, reflecting the 13 attributes of mercy. He prayed for protection from Esau, showing access to a dimension of G–d not available to Gentile nations guided by the attribute אל-הים. Jacob's preparations for his encounter with Esau serve as a model for dealing with adversaries, involving prayer, war readiness, and gifts. God's unchangeability is recognized by Jacob crossing the Jordan with a rod, symbolizing schooling and discipline. 

|קָטֹ֜נְתִּי מִכֹּ֤ל הַחֲסָדִים֙ וּמִכׇּל־הָ֣אֱמֶ֔ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשִׂ֖יתָ אֶת־עַבְדֶּ֑ךָ כִּ֣י בְמַקְלִ֗י עָבַ֙רְתִּי֙ אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֣ן הַזֶּ֔ה וְעַתָּ֥ה הָיִ֖יתִי לִשְׁנֵ֥י מַחֲנֽוֹת׃|11 J|I am unworthy of all the kindness that You have so steadfastly shown Your servant: with my staff alone I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov prays for protection from negative forces within, seeking humility in recognizing his own insignificance compared to God's greatness, expressing unworthiness of the kindness shown to him and fearing potential harm from Esau despite God's promises. Various commentaries emphasize Jacob's humility and pursuit of perfection in religious duties over material gain, with Rabbi Chaim Abulafia suggesting that Jacob decreased his possessions through charity to merit God's salvation. Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Zeira avoided dangerous situations to not rely on miracles and diminish their merits, while Targum highlights Jacob's acknowledgment of unworthiness due to God's kindness and faithfulness. 

|הַצִּילֵ֥נִי נָ֛א מִיַּ֥ד אָחִ֖י מִיַּ֣ד עֵשָׂ֑ו כִּֽי־יָרֵ֤א אָנֹכִי֙ אֹת֔וֹ פֶּן־יָב֣וֹא וְהִכַּ֔נִי אֵ֖ם עַל־בָּנִֽים׃|12 J|Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; else, I fear, he may come and strike me down, mothers and children alike.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov prays for protection from Esau, representing the negative side of emanations, reminding God of His promise for good for himself and his descendants. Various biblical figures prayed in times of need and were answered with miracles, demonstrating the power of prayer in Jewish tradition. The Midrash Tanchuma explains Jacob's fear of Esau and the significance of doubled letters in the Bible, while Musar discusses the consequences of stealing and the importance of choosing words carefully in prayer. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both interpret Jacob's prayer for deliverance from Esau, fearing harm to his family. 

|וְאַתָּ֣ה אָמַ֔רְתָּ הֵיטֵ֥ב אֵיטִ֖יב עִמָּ֑ךְ וְשַׂמְתִּ֤י אֶֽת־זַרְעֲךָ֙ כְּח֣וֹל הַיָּ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־יִסָּפֵ֖ר מֵרֹֽב׃|13 J|Yet You have said, ‘I will deal bountifully with you and make your offspring as the sands of the sea, which are too numerous to count.’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Kedushat Levi explains that God's goodness towards Yaakov will be publicly recognized as a blessing, while Rashi interprets Genesis verses as prohibiting counting Abraham's descendants. The text discusses the fear and reverence of G'd, Midrash compares Israelites to sand, and Musar explains the different types of good God will do for Jacob. Quoting various commentators, the comparison of Israel to sand breaking waves symbolizes their resilience against nations, while Targum emphasizes God's promise to make Abraham's descendants numerous. 

|וַיָּ֥לֶן שָׁ֖ם בַּלַּ֣יְלָה הַה֑וּא וַיִּקַּ֞ח מִן־הַבָּ֧א בְיָד֛וֹ מִנְחָ֖ה לְעֵשָׂ֥ו אָחִֽיו׃|14 E|After spending the night there, he selected from what was at hand these presents for his brother Esau:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob prepared a gift for Esau from his possessions, including flocks and herds, as he had no opportunity to acquire other items, symbolizing his wealth and intended to appease Esau. The High Priest symbolically presented the sins of the Jewish people as a gift to Esau on the Day of Atonement. Rebbi Eliezer and Rebbi Berekhiah used Jacob's gift as an example to prescribe minimal frequencies of intercourse based on occupation and decent sexual behavior, respectively. Jacob stayed the night and took a gift from what he had with him to give to Esau. 

|עִזִּ֣ים מָאתַ֔יִם וּתְיָשִׁ֖ים עֶשְׂרִ֑ים רְחֵלִ֥ים מָאתַ֖יִם וְאֵילִ֥ים עֶשְׂרִֽים׃|15 E|200 she-goats and 20 he-goats; 200 ewes and 20 rams;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob sent a gift of 550 animals to Esau, symbolizing the years preceding the Israelite kingdom. Rabbi Schuck suggests the giraffe may be non-kosher due to crossbreeding. The Midrash discusses protection from evil, Jacob's strategies against Esau, and the importance of seeking mercy from God. Rabbeinu Bahya highlights Jacob's preparations as a model for dealing with hostility. The Talmud discusses minimal frequencies of intercourse based on occupation, while Targum interprets specific numbers of animals sent to Esau. 

|גְּמַלִּ֧ים מֵינִיק֛וֹת וּבְנֵיהֶ֖ם שְׁלֹשִׁ֑ים פָּר֤וֹת אַרְבָּעִים֙ וּפָרִ֣ים עֲשָׂרָ֔ה אֲתֹנֹ֣ת עֶשְׂרִ֔ים וַעְיָרִ֖ם עֲשָׂרָֽה׃|16 E|30 milch camels with their colts; 40 cows and 10 bulls; 20 she-asses and 10 he-asses.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the gift of camels sent by Jacob to Esau, with interpretations varying on the number and gender of the camels. Jacob arrived intact in his body, children, wealth, and studies despite his encounter with Esau, giving an extensive gift to appease him. Rashi explains the discreet nature of camels in mating, while the Midrash highlights Jacob's foresight and commitment to Torah study. Various commentators, such as Rashi, Ramban, Ibn Ezra, and Targum Onkelos, provide insights on different aspects of the text. 

|וַיִּתֵּן֙ בְּיַד־עֲבָדָ֔יו עֵ֥דֶר עֵ֖דֶר לְבַדּ֑וֹ וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֶל־עֲבָדָיו֙ עִבְר֣וּ לְפָנַ֔י וְרֶ֣וַח תָּשִׂ֔ימוּ בֵּ֥ין עֵ֖דֶר וּבֵ֥ין עֵֽדֶר׃|17 E|These he put in the charge of his servants, drove by drove, and he told his servants, “Go on ahead, and keep a distance between droves.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

When approaching God, one must realize that service is meant to provide satisfaction to the Creator, not secure earthly rewards. Jacob strategically separated his gifts to Esau to impress him and request intervals between troubles for his descendants. Jacob sent gifts to Esau to appease him and blind his eyes, showing humility and distress during the encounter. The number 400 is significant in relation to the evil eye, with connections to Avram, Efron, and Esau. In Genesis 32:17, Jacob placed his herds in the hands of his servants, separated and leaving ample space between each herd. 

|וַיְצַ֥ו אֶת־הָרִאשׁ֖וֹן לֵאמֹ֑ר כִּ֣י יִֽפְגׇשְׁךָ֞ עֵשָׂ֣ו אָחִ֗י וּשְׁאֵֽלְךָ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר לְמִי־אַ֙תָּה֙ וְאָ֣נָה תֵלֵ֔ךְ וּלְמִ֖י אֵ֥לֶּה לְפָנֶֽיךָ׃|18 E|He instructed the one in front as follows, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks you, ‘Who’s your master? Where are you going? And whose [animals] are these ahead of you?’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that when approaching God, one should not seek earthly rewards but fulfill their purpose in life, even when the evil urge questions their actions. Commentary on Genesis 32:18 by various scholars provides insights into specific phrases, while Midrash discusses the symbolism of water and dust in testing a woman suspected of adultery. Rabbeinu Bahya, Siftei Chakhamim, and Ramban offer interpretations on verses in Devarim and Genesis 32, respectively. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan detail Jacob's instructions to his messengers on how to respond to Esau's inquiries. 

|וְאָֽמַרְתָּ֙ לְעַבְדְּךָ֣ לְיַעֲקֹ֔ב מִנְחָ֥ה הִוא֙ שְׁלוּחָ֔ה לַֽאדֹנִ֖י לְעֵשָׂ֑ו וְהִנֵּ֥ה גַם־ה֖וּא אַחֲרֵֽינוּ׃|19 E|you shall answer, ‘Your servant Jacob’s; they are a gift sent to my lord Esau; and [Jacob] himself is right behind us.’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov strategically approached Esau with gifts to calm his anger and ensure a peaceful encounter, instructing his messengers to present themselves as servants of Yaakov and answer Esau's questions in a specific order. In Midrash, it is discussed how Jacob prepared for prayer, gift-giving, and war before encountering Esau, who chose to go to Se’ir either due to a promissory note or shame. Additionally, Jacob's gift to Samael symbolizes the transfer of Israel's sins to him, leading to their removal and atonement. Rashi clarifies that "corpse" specifically refers to a human soul and explains the consequences of Aharon and Miriam's haughtiness. Targum describes Yaakov sending a gift to Eisov as he followed behind them. 

|וַיְצַ֞ו גַּ֣ם אֶת־הַשֵּׁנִ֗י גַּ֚ם אֶת־הַשְּׁלִישִׁ֔י גַּ֚ם אֶת־כׇּל־הַהֹ֣לְכִ֔ים אַחֲרֵ֥י הָעֲדָרִ֖ים לֵאמֹ֑ר כַּדָּבָ֤ר הַזֶּה֙ תְּדַבְּר֣וּן אֶל־עֵשָׂ֔ו בְּמֹצַאֲכֶ֖ם אֹתֽוֹ׃|20 E|He gave similar instructions to the second one, and the third, and all the others who followed the droves, namely, “Thus and so shall you say to Esau when you reach him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob instructed his servants to tell Esau that the animals they were bringing were a gift for him, and that Jacob was coming behind them to meet him, using specific vocalizations and lengthening of letters in the word "m'tza'akhem." The Midrash emphasizes Jacob's foresight and planning in dividing his flocks and presenting gifts to Esau to appease him, drawing parallels to contemporary interactions with gentiles. In Leviticus 7:11:1, Kli Yakar explains the significance of peace-offerings to God, while Gevia Kesef 3:8 discusses the differences in belief and perception between Jacob and Laban through the use of "Lord" and "God" in their interactions with the divine. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Jacob instructing his followers on how to speak to Esau in a specific manner in Genesis 32:20. 

|וַאֲמַרְתֶּ֕ם גַּ֗ם הִנֵּ֛ה עַבְדְּךָ֥ יַעֲקֹ֖ב אַחֲרֵ֑ינוּ כִּֽי־אָמַ֞ר אֲכַפְּרָ֣ה פָנָ֗יו בַּמִּנְחָה֙ הַהֹלֶ֣כֶת לְפָנָ֔י וְאַחֲרֵי־כֵן֙ אֶרְאֶ֣ה פָנָ֔יו אוּלַ֖י יִשָּׂ֥א פָנָֽי׃|21 E|And you shall add, ‘And your servant Jacob himself is right behind us.’” For he reasoned, “If I propitiate him with presents in advance, and then face him, perhaps he will show me favor.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The author discusses the spiritual significance of Moses charging the firstborn of Israel with offering sacrifices and the requirement for male Israelites to give a half shekel as ransom for their souls. Jacob strategically sends gifts to Esau to appease him before their meeting, reflecting a common practice to soften the attitude of a high-ranking individual. The term "Yom Kippur" has various meanings related to covering sins, cleansing, and appeasing injured parties. Israel offers a sin offering each New Moon to compensate for the reduction in the moon's size, symbolizing the removal of negative influences and the restoration of holiness. Jacob's preparation and distress in sending gifts to Esau are discussed in various commentaries, highlighting the concept of appeasement and reconciliation. 

|וַתַּעֲבֹ֥ר הַמִּנְחָ֖ה עַל־פָּנָ֑יו וְה֛וּא לָ֥ן בַּלַּֽיְלָה־הַה֖וּא בַּֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃|22 E|And so the gift went on ahead, while he remained in camp that night.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob stayed in the camp with his servants and shepherds to prepare for a potential attack by his brother Esau, dividing his people, arming them, offering gifts, and praying. Ramban warns against idolatry and highlights the uniqueness of Israel as God's treasured possession. Onkelos interprets passages to avoid implying physical properties to God, while Targum Jonathan mentions Jacob sending a present ahead of him before spending the night in the camp. 

|וַיָּ֣קׇם ׀ בַּלַּ֣יְלָה ה֗וּא וַיִּקַּ֞ח אֶת־שְׁתֵּ֤י נָשָׁיו֙ וְאֶת־שְׁתֵּ֣י שִׁפְחֹתָ֔יו וְאֶת־אַחַ֥ד עָשָׂ֖ר יְלָדָ֑יו וַֽיַּעֲבֹ֔ר אֵ֖ת מַעֲבַ֥ר יַבֹּֽק׃|23 E|That same night he arose, and taking his two wives, his two maidservants, and his eleven sons,  he crossed the ford of the Jabbok.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob strategically crossed the Jabbok River with his family, leaving Dinah hidden in a box to protect her from Esau. The mention of Dinah's absence in the text raises questions about Jacob's punishment for hiding her. The crossing of the river was done at night to avoid Esau, similar to David's actions when fleeing from Avshalom. Jacob acted as a bridge, symbolically moving his family across the stream, while also concealing the letter ע from his name. In the Tanakh, Jacob divided his children among his wives and maids upon seeing Esau approaching with four hundred men. In the Targum, Jacob crossed the river with his two wives, two concubines, and eleven children under the cover of night. 

|וַיִּ֨קָּחֵ֔ם וַיַּֽעֲבִרֵ֖ם אֶת־הַנָּ֑חַל וַֽיַּעֲבֵ֖ר אֶת־אֲשֶׁר־לֽוֹ׃|24 E|After taking them across the stream, he sent across all his possessions.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob acted as a bridge for his family and belongings to cross the river before wrestling with an angel in the guise of Esau's guardian angel, ultimately dominating the angel. He then locked his daughter Dina in a chest to protect her from Esau, showing caution and stealth in his approach to resolving his issues with Esav (Shir HaShirim Rabbah 3:6:3, Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 37:3, Bereshit Rabbah 76:9). Jacob also prepared a gift for Esav and encountered messengers of God before facing his brother, as detailed in Genesis 32:2-24 (Fox, Genesis, Part III; Yaakov, Preparations for Esav). 

|וַיִּוָּתֵ֥ר יַעֲקֹ֖ב לְבַדּ֑וֹ וַיֵּאָבֵ֥ק אִישׁ֙ עִמּ֔וֹ עַ֖ד עֲל֥וֹת הַשָּֽׁחַר׃|25 E|Jacob was left alone. And a figure  wrestled with him until the break of dawn.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 32:25, Jacob wrestles with an angel symbolizing the struggle between man and celestial beings, achieving a higher spiritual level and a direct connection to Hashem for Bnei Yisrael. The wrestling match represents a battle between two philosophies, with Jacob ultimately triumphing, and the event is referenced in liturgy, Midrash, and Tanakh. Ramban and other commentators discuss the nature of prophetic visions and the appearance of angels in various stories, while Musar highlights Jacob's spiritual refinement and adherence to Torah laws. 

|וַיַּ֗רְא כִּ֣י לֹ֤א יָכֹל֙ ל֔וֹ וַיִּגַּ֖ע בְּכַף־יְרֵכ֑וֹ וַתֵּ֙קַע֙ כַּף־יֶ֣רֶךְ יַעֲקֹ֔ב בְּהֵאָֽבְק֖וֹ עִמּֽוֹ׃|26 E|When he saw that he had not prevailed against him, he wrenched Jacob’s hip at its socket, so that the socket of his hip was strained as he wrestled with him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Kedushat Levi emphasizes humility in serving God and explores the symbolism of Yaakov's struggle and the significance of the thigh. The Ba'al Shem Tov stresses the purpose of serving God as uplifting sparks of holiness. The angel dislocated Yaakov's thigh as a warning, symbolizing his struggle with material forces. The commandment of remembering the battle between Yaakov and the angel serves as a reminder of redemption by the Messiah. The importance of certain commandments as reminders and the concept of hope in Jewish thought are discussed. Kabbalistic texts explain Samael's failure to overcome Jacob and the significance of the thigh dislocation. Midrashic texts elaborate on Yaakov's encounter with the angel and the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve. Musar discusses the negative effects of the destruction of the Temple. Rabbi Yehuda holds that the sciatic nerve is forbidden due to the wrestling match between Jacob and the angel. Targum translations mention the dislocation of Yaakov's hip joint during the wrestling match. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר שַׁלְּחֵ֔נִי כִּ֥י עָלָ֖ה הַשָּׁ֑חַר וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ לֹ֣א אֲשַֽׁלֵּחֲךָ֔ כִּ֖י אִם־בֵּרַכְתָּֽנִי׃|27 E|Then he said, “Let me go, for dawn is breaking.” But he answered, “I will not let you go, unless you bless me.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The angel wanted to leave Yaakov, but Yaakov refused to let him go until he received a blessing, acknowledging his victory and the legitimacy of the blessings he had received from his father. The angel revealed that Yaakov's name would be changed to Israel, signifying his triumph over Esau, Laban, and angels, and that he had acted truthfully in all his dealings. The angel also explained that he needed to sing praises to God at dawn, a time when destructive forces have no power to harm. Ultimately, Yaakov's request for a blessing from the angel was a way of ensuring peace and acknowledging his victory in the struggle. Esau is symbolized as 'Se'ir' with dominion during the night, weakening as morning approaches, signifying the end of his rule. The Midrash discusses the unity of God's presence in the place where Yaakov found two stones had become one, the significance of angels created daily to praise God, and the angel's refusal to bless Yaakov until completing his task, revealing the angel was sent to test him. Love has the power to transform evil into good, as seen in the relationship between Esau and Jacob, and can even convert pagans to Judaism. The Gemara discusses Jacob wrestling with an angel who needed to ascend to sing songs of praise to God, clarifying that the angel cried to Jacob during their encounter. In Genesis 32:27, the man tells Yaakov to let him go because the dawn is breaking and it is time for the angels to offer praise to the Lord, but Yaakov refuses to let him go until he blesses him. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖יו מַה־שְּׁמֶ֑ךָ וַיֹּ֖אמֶר יַעֲקֹֽב׃|28 E|Said the other, “What is your name?” He replied, “Jacob.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The patriarchs' names reflect their attributes and tasks, with Avraham spreading monotheism, Yitzchok preserving his father's accomplishments, and Yaakov balancing loving kindness and awe of God. The name change to Israel signifies being ennobled before God, reflecting the aspect of Keter (Crown). God fulfills prophecies and changes names to reflect spiritual growth, as seen in Jacob's struggle and victory over God, angels, and men. The Jewish narrative of the Pesaḥ story emphasizes finding meaning in catastrophe and choosing "difficult liberty" over easy necessity. Jacob's transition to Israel symbolizes the shift from learning dependent on hearing to clear vision granted by God. In Genesis 32:28, both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan record Jacob responding with "Yaakov" when asked for his name. 

|וַיֹּ֗אמֶר לֹ֤א יַעֲקֹב֙ יֵאָמֵ֥ר עוֹד֙ שִׁמְךָ֔ כִּ֖י אִם־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל כִּֽי־שָׂרִ֧יתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִ֛ים וְעִם־אֲנָשִׁ֖ים וַתּוּכָֽל׃|29 E|Said he, “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven  with beings divine and human,  and have prevailed.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the significance of name changes in the Bible, such as Abram becoming Abraham and Sarai becoming Sarah, as reflections of changes in their souls. Halakhah discusses the prohibition against clairvoyance and the tradition of reciting a specific phrase after the first verse of the Shema. Kabbalah explains that when Jacob's name was changed to Israel, he was crowned to include all the Patriarchs. Midrash highlights Jacob's fear of producing idolatrous descendants and the significance of name changes in the Bible. Musar explores the spiritual achievements associated with the names Jacob and Israel. Quoting Commentary connects Jacob's wrestling match with God to Moses and Jonah's struggles. Second Temple discusses the impossibility of naming the Existent. Talmud discusses the transgression of calling Jacob by his old name, Jacob becoming master over the angel he wrestled with, and the angel hinting at future events. Tanakh describes Jacob wrestling with an angel and prevailing, leading to a name change to Israel. Targum explains that Jacob's name was changed to Israel because he contended and prevailed with Godly beings and men. 

|וַיִּשְׁאַ֣ל יַעֲקֹ֗ב וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ הַגִּֽידָה־נָּ֣א שְׁמֶ֔ךָ וַיֹּ֕אמֶר לָ֥מָּה זֶּ֖ה תִּשְׁאַ֣ל לִשְׁמִ֑י וַיְבָ֥רֶךְ אֹת֖וֹ שָֽׁם׃|30 E|Jacob asked, “Pray tell me your name.” But he said, “You must not ask my name!” And he took leave of him there.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov named the site of his encounter with God 'Peniel' after seeing the Divine face to face and remaining alive, experiencing direct acknowledgment from God for selfless service. The angel told Yaakov that angels do not have fixed names to prevent being forced to do things, and Yaakov's victory over the angel represented Esau's acceptance of Isaac's blessing. Jacob's strength increased as night turned to day, causing Samael's power to diminish, and he confirmed his blessings before leaving. Jacob's forgetting of his vow led to trouble with Laban and Esau, but an angel reminded him to fulfill it, leading to Simeon and Levi avenging Dinah and Jacob being permitted to go to Bethel. Rabbeinu Bahya discusses the celestial blessings given to Yaakov by Esau's representative, linking it to future redemption, while Rashi explains the mystical nature of certain Torah aspects, and the angel in Judges 13:18 tells Manoah not to ask for his name. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֧א יַעֲקֹ֛ב שֵׁ֥ם הַמָּק֖וֹם פְּנִיאֵ֑ל כִּֽי־רָאִ֤יתִי אֱלֹהִים֙ פָּנִ֣ים אֶל־פָּנִ֔ים וַתִּנָּצֵ֖ל נַפְשִֽׁי׃|31 E|So Jacob named the place Peniel,  meaning, “I have seen a divine being face to face, yet my life has been preserved.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes selfless devotion to God, leading to direct acknowledgment and extraordinary experiences, while Jewish Thought discusses man's free will and interpretations of verses to prevent misunderstandings. Kabbalah recounts Rabbi Shimon's fear and appointment of successors after a powerful encounter, while Midrash warns against turning to idolatrous judges and unnecessary conflict. Quoting Commentary highlights the literal translations of certain verses, and Second Temple uses the "sun" metaphorically. Tanakh mentions Jacob's struggle with an angel and Moses speaking to God face to face, while Targum explains Yaakov naming Peniel after seeing Godly beings face to face and surviving. 

|וַיִּֽזְרַֽח־ל֣וֹ הַשֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר עָבַ֖ר אֶת־פְּנוּאֵ֑ל וְה֥וּא צֹלֵ֖עַ עַל־יְרֵכֽוֹ׃|32 E|The sun rose upon him as he passed Penuel, limping on his hip.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of building words of holiness from sparks, with charity giving strength and healing corresponding to the sun shining for Yaakov. Commentary highlights the healing effect of the sun on Yaakov's injury, while Halakhah discusses the observance of Shabbat and determining its timing based on local sunset. Kabbalah delves into the symbolism of Jacob's limp and his prayer obligations, while Liturgy connects the double reward for enhancing Shabbos with Jacob's battle with Esau's angel. Midrash explores various commandments given to biblical figures, with Musar focusing on Jacob's acceptance of his injury and the mitzvah of not eating the gid hanasheh. Quoting Commentary interprets Jacob's encounter with the angel symbolically, while Talmud discusses interpretations of various Torah verses and the importance of Torah scholars. Targum elaborates on the sun shining for Jacob and his limp as he passed Penuel. 

|עַל־כֵּ֡ן לֹֽא־יֹאכְל֨וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל אֶת־גִּ֣יד הַנָּשֶׁ֗ה אֲשֶׁר֙ עַל־כַּ֣ף הַיָּרֵ֔ךְ עַ֖ד הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה כִּ֤י נָגַע֙ בְּכַף־יֶ֣רֶךְ יַעֲקֹ֔ב בְּגִ֖יד הַנָּשֶֽׁה׃|33 E|That is why the children of Israel to this day do not eat the thigh muscle that is on the socket of the hip, since Jacob’s hip socket was wrenched at the thigh muscle.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against eating the sciatic nerve originates from Jacob wrestling with an angel, symbolizing his struggle and victory, leading to the prohibition of that part of the animal. This prohibition serves as a moral lesson, reminding of the need for divine protection and avoiding defiled elements, with mystical significance linked to the Sefirah of Foundation-Yesod. The prohibition applies to both domesticated and wild animals, even in cases of consecration, and must be removed from both sides of the animal, with severe consequences for consuming even a small amount of the nerve. The prohibition is broader than eating sacrificial animals and applies to descendants of Noah, with differing opinions on its application to non-kosher animals and birds. The Targum explains that the prohibition stems from Jacob's wrestling match with an angel, resulting in the displacement of the tendon on the hip joint, which the children of Israel do not eat as a reminder of that event. 

## Genesis 33

|וַיִּשָּׂ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב עֵינָ֗יו וַיַּרְא֙ וְהִנֵּ֣ה עֵשָׂ֣ו בָּ֔א וְעִמּ֕וֹ אַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת אִ֑ישׁ וַיַּ֣חַץ אֶת־הַיְלָדִ֗ים עַל־לֵאָה֙ וְעַל־רָחֵ֔ל וְעַ֖ל שְׁתֵּ֥י הַשְּׁפָחֽוֹת׃|1 E|Looking up, Jacob saw Esau coming, with a retinue  of four hundred. He divided the children  among Leah, Rachel, and the two maids,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau was not appeased by Jacob's gift, Jacob ensured safety of his children by dividing them between their mothers, Esau did not disarm despite gifts and Jacob's confidence in God's promises, Jacob arranged his camp so each mother could watch over her children as Esau approached with a large military procession. In Kabbalah, circumcision on the eighth day is significant, the righteous are exalted through their eyes, wicked men are degraded through their eyes, and Jacob ultimately found rest despite facing troubles with Esau, Dinah, and Joseph. There is historical tension between the descendants of Esav and Ya'akov, with questions about trust and ongoing conflict. Jacob took his family and crossed the ford of the Jabbok, and when he saw Esau approaching with four hundred men, he divided his children among Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids. 

|וַיָּ֧שֶׂם אֶת־הַשְּׁפָח֛וֹת וְאֶת־יַלְדֵיהֶ֖ן רִֽאשֹׁנָ֑ה וְאֶת־לֵאָ֤ה וִֽילָדֶ֙יהָ֙ אַחֲרֹנִ֔ים וְאֶת־רָחֵ֥ל וְאֶת־יוֹסֵ֖ף אַחֲרֹנִֽים׃|2 E|putting the maids and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Yaakov's divine connection allowed him to draw out G-dly energy, but he was punished for delaying his vow fulfillment. Commentary highlights Jacob's emotional attachment to Rachel and Joseph. Kabbalah shows Jacob's foresight of the last exile and his prayer for protection. Midrash discusses the giving of the Torah, the actions of Jacob towards Esau, and Joseph's association with the sons of Bilhah. Targum explains Jacob's strategic placement of his family to protect them from Esau. 

|וְה֖וּא עָבַ֣ר לִפְנֵיהֶ֑ם וַיִּשְׁתַּ֤חוּ אַ֙רְצָה֙ שֶׁ֣בַע פְּעָמִ֔ים עַד־גִּשְׁתּ֖וֹ עַד־אָחִֽיו׃|3 E|He himself went on ahead and bowed low to the ground seven times until he was near his brother.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob approached Esau with humility, offering himself as a target for Esau's anger to protect his family, symbolized by his prostration seven times. The Hebrew word 'abar refers to motion in space, as seen in various biblical verses. Rabbi Chiyah and Rabbi Berachya compare God's compassion to that of a father, with Jacob prioritizing his maidservants and their children. Benjamin's sanctity was higher due to not bowing to Esau, contrasting with Jacob's actions. Ramban, Rashi, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Or HaChaim use the number seven metaphorically in different contexts. The Talmud uses the word "over" to indicate precedence, and Targum states that Jacob prayed for mercy while prostrating before Esau. 

|וַיָּ֨רׇץ עֵשָׂ֤ו לִקְרָאתוֹ֙ וַֽיְחַבְּקֵ֔הוּ וַיִּפֹּ֥ל עַל־צַוָּארָ֖ו וַׄיִּׄשָּׁׄקֵ֑ׄהׄוּׄ וַיִּבְכּֽוּ׃|4 E|Esau ran to greet him. He embraced him and, falling on his neck, he kissed him; and they wept.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators offer interpretations of Esau's actions towards Jacob in Genesis 33:4, with Ibn Ezra suggesting insincerity, Sforno emphasizing humility and gifts, Radak and Haamek Davar highlighting the emotional moment, Shadal questioning the necessity of mentioning the kiss, Rabbeinu Bahya and Siftei Chakhamim suggesting insincerity indicated by dots, Rav Hirsch seeing genuine emotion in Esau's tears, and Rashi noting Esau's pity for Jacob. Midrash discusses instances of divine protection, Musar delves into the significance of the dots in the Torah, and quoting commentary explores reconciliations and interpretations of relationships in Genesis. The Talmud discusses Jacob's concern for Joseph's purity, the use of dots in the Torah to indicate nuances, and further examples of hidden meanings in words marked with dots. In the Tanakh, Joseph mourns Jacob with embraces, weeping, and kisses, while the Targum depicts Esau and Jacob embracing, kissing, and weeping for different reasons. 

|וַיִּשָּׂ֣א אֶת־עֵינָ֗יו וַיַּ֤רְא אֶת־הַנָּשִׁים֙ וְאֶת־הַיְלָדִ֔ים וַיֹּ֖אמֶר מִי־אֵ֣לֶּה לָּ֑ךְ וַיֹּאמַ֕ר הַיְלָדִ֕ים אֲשֶׁר־חָנַ֥ן אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־עַבְדֶּֽךָ׃|5 E|Looking about, he saw the women and the children. “Who,” he asked, “are these with you?” He answered, “The children with whom God has favored your servant.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Yaakov Avinu prayed for his journey after understanding the concept of tithing, as seen in the Gemara, following a dream where God appeared to him in mercy. Moses prayed for knowledge of God's attributes and actions, not His essence, emphasizing that God's actions, described in terms of human emotions, are for the benefit of His creation and not driven by feelings. In the Midrash, the importance of Torah study, respect for elders, and blessings are highlighted. Ibn Ezra and other commentators offer interpretations on various biblical passages, such as Isaiah 7:14 and Genesis 43:29. The Second Temple text discusses the zeal of those who practice devotion to cultivate spiritual children. Finally, the Targum recounts how Yaakov modestly referred to his wives as children given to him by God when questioned by Eisov. 

|וַתִּגַּ֧שְׁןָ הַשְּׁפָח֛וֹת הֵ֥נָּה וְיַלְדֵיהֶ֖ן וַתִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶֽיןָ׃|6 E|Then the maids, with their children, came forward and bowed low;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The maidservants and their children prostrated themselves before Esau, following Jacob's lead. The children initially hesitated but eventually followed suit. Esau did not insist on their prostration, emphasizing the actions of the servant maids. Joseph obscured Rachel from Esau, and his name Tzafenat Paane’aḥ is significant. Mordekhai justified his actions with Torah teachings. Ibn Ezra criticizes translations and discusses word usage. Korah and his followers were swallowed up, with Moses and Hannah praying for them. The concubines and their children also prostrated themselves before Jacob. 

|וַתִּגַּ֧שׁ גַּם־לֵאָ֛ה וִילָדֶ֖יהָ וַיִּֽשְׁתַּחֲו֑וּ וְאַחַ֗ר נִגַּ֥שׁ יוֹסֵ֛ף וְרָחֵ֖ל וַיִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוֽוּ׃|7 E|next Leah, with her children, came forward and bowed low; and last, Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed low.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Joseph approached Esau before Rachel to shield his attractive mother from inquisitive eyes, earning him a blessing associated with protection. The Temple was constructed with wisdom, understanding, and skill, attributes seen in Joshua and Othniel. Esau's influence on Amalek, who in turn influenced Israel, will result in Esau falling at the hands of Joseph and Benjamin. Leah's decision to have a daughter named Dinah symbolizing Justice, ultimately led to Dinah's tragic fate at the hands of Shechem. In Genesis 33:7, both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Leah and her children bowing before Esau, with Joseph standing before Rachel to hide her and they both bowed. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר מִ֥י לְךָ֛ כׇּל־הַמַּחֲנֶ֥ה הַזֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר פָּגָ֑שְׁתִּי וַיֹּ֕אמֶר לִמְצֹא־חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽי׃|8 E|And he asked, “What do you mean by all this company which I have met?” He answered, “To gain my lord’s favor.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau questioned Jacob about the purpose of the camp he encountered, which Jacob explained was a gift to find favor in Esau's eyes. The Midrash suggests that angels stopped attacking Esau's men when they mentioned being related to Jacob, leading to Esau finding favor in Jacob's eyes. Abraham advanced spiritually and morally, transitioning to a prophet in his community and achieving visions beyond the natural realm. In various Midrashim, angels confronted Esau's people throughout the night, leading to a miscommunication with Jacob. Rashi explains Hebrew words that can be treated as both masculine and feminine, while Ramban interprets Jacob's announcement to Esau as a gesture of goodwill. Targum states that Jacob sent a gift to Eisov to gain favor in his eyes. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר עֵשָׂ֖ו יֶשׁ־לִ֣י רָ֑ב אָחִ֕י יְהִ֥י לְךָ֖ אֲשֶׁר־לָֽךְ׃|9 E|Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let what you have remain yours.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the wicked receive their ruach from a RaV of the kelipah, corresponding to Esav, who is considered the RaV of the husks. Esau admitted he has much but not everything, indicating that the wicked always feel something is missing, while the righteous are content with what they have. Jacob serves Laban for seven years to marry Rachel but is tricked into marrying Leah first. Esau plans to confront Jacob, but Jacob prepares gifts to appease him, and they are eventually reconciled. Esau tells Jacob to keep his possessions and wishes him success in Genesis 33:9 according to both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֗ב אַל־נָא֙ אִם־נָ֨א מָצָ֤אתִי חֵן֙ בְּעֵינֶ֔יךָ וְלָקַחְתָּ֥ מִנְחָתִ֖י מִיָּדִ֑י כִּ֣י עַל־כֵּ֞ן רָאִ֣יתִי פָנֶ֗יךָ כִּרְאֹ֛ת פְּנֵ֥י אֱלֹהִ֖ים וַתִּרְצֵֽנִי׃|10 E|But Jacob said, “No, I pray you; if you would do me this favor, accept from me this gift; for to see your face is like seeing the face of God, and you have received me favorably.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov sought Esav's favor by comparing his face to that of a Divine being, showing his respect and admiration for his brother. Jacob asked Esau to accept his gift because he saw his face as one sees the sight of an angel, indicating that Esau was pleased with him and had forgiven him, similar to how God accepts offerings from those who fear Him. The determination of the onset and conclusion of Shabbat is to be done locally, except in extreme polar regions where a person must conduct themselves as if lost in the desert. Man has freedom of will, while angels do not, and various interpretations are provided to prevent the impression that G-d is speaking to Himself or non-existent partners. Aaron used incense to call upon the Shekhinah, Nachshon ben Aminadav sanctified God's name by jumping into the sea, and flattery of King Agrippa led to corruption. Rashi explains that the phrase "כי על כן" is used in the Bible to convey the reason or cause behind a particular action or request. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish compares seeing Esau to seeing a divine vision, and the Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 33:10 also compare Esau's face to that of a godly being. 

|קַח־נָ֤א אֶת־בִּרְכָתִי֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הֻבָ֣את לָ֔ךְ כִּֽי־חַנַּ֥נִי אֱלֹהִ֖ים וְכִ֣י יֶשׁ־לִי־כֹ֑ל וַיִּפְצַר־בּ֖וֹ וַיִּקָּֽח׃|11 E|Please accept my present which has been brought to you, for God has favored me and I have plenty.” And when he urged him, he accepted.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes righteousness and contentment with God's blessings, symbolized by Avraham and Yaakov. In Kabbalah, the quality of "All-Kol" is passed down through the forefathers. Liturgy calls for blessings similar to those received by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Midrash explains Jacob's gift to Esau as a symbol of future tribute to the messianic king. Musar highlights Jacob's vitality and purity, contrasting him with Esau's association with death. The Talmud teaches that repentance from arrogance leads to a peaceful death like the patriarchs. The Second Temple period reflects on Abel's righteousness and divine favor. Jacob's gesture of peace towards Esau in Targum emphasizes that the gift was from God and that he had plenty. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר נִסְעָ֣ה וְנֵלֵ֑כָה וְאֵלְכָ֖ה לְנֶגְדֶּֽךָ׃|12 E|And [Esau] said, “Let us start on our journey, and I will proceed at your pace.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Rashi, and Radak explain that Esau's proposal to travel together with Jacob in Genesis 33:12 was an attempt to restore brotherhood and equality between them. Midrash highlights Jacob's refusal to journey with Esau as a sign that Esau would not share in the world to come. The Talmud discusses the rise and fall of nations, with neither the Jewish people nor the nations having an advantage. Targum notes that Esau agreed to travel with Jacob until they reached Jacob's home. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֗יו אֲדֹנִ֤י יֹדֵ֙עַ֙ כִּֽי־הַיְלָדִ֣ים רַכִּ֔ים וְהַצֹּ֥אן וְהַבָּקָ֖ר עָל֣וֹת עָלָ֑י וּדְפָקוּם֙ י֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד וָמֵ֖תוּ כׇּל־הַצֹּֽאן׃|13 E|But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children are frail and that the flocks and herds, which are nursing, are a care to me; if they are driven hard a single day, all the flocks will die.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prophet Isaiah teaches that conducting oneself in a holy spirit brings holiness to daily experiences, despite the division between Yaakov and Esau, G'd can provide material blessings. Jacob emphasizes the need for gentle care for his children and flocks, with specific language in the Torah indicating the importance of avoiding overexertion. The temple was to be erected in Benjamin's territory, descendants of Benjamin like Saul and Mordechai inflicted defeats on Esau's descendants. In Bereshit Rabbah 78:13, it is explained that Moses and Aaron are referred to as tender children, while Israel is likened to nursing flocks and cattle. Yaakov tells Esav that his children are not ready to withstand his influence, remaining a distinctive nation in Egypt. Targum translations reiterate the importance of not overdriving the flocks due to their delicate nature. 

|יַעֲבׇר־נָ֥א אֲדֹנִ֖י לִפְנֵ֣י עַבְדּ֑וֹ וַאֲנִ֞י אֶֽתְנָהֲלָ֣ה לְאִטִּ֗י לְרֶ֨גֶל הַמְּלָאכָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר־לְפָנַי֙ וּלְרֶ֣גֶל הַיְלָדִ֔ים עַ֛ד אֲשֶׁר־אָבֹ֥א אֶל־אֲדֹנִ֖י שֵׂעִֽירָה׃|14 E|Let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I travel slowly, at the pace of the cattle before me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes acting solely for God, purifying motives to avoid transgressions, and receiving strength from God. Commentary discusses Jacob's intentions with Esau, linking to future redemption. Halakhah advises misleading answers to gentiles. Jewish Thought discusses rewards for good deeds, collective and individual. Midrash explores Jacob's interactions with Esau and the sons' actions in Shekhem. Musar highlights repentance, prayer, and charity for survival in exile. Quoting Commentary delves into the concept of "mlachah" and ethical behavior. Talmud advises Jews to position themselves higher than Gentiles and extend the journey when asked about their destination. Targum explains Jacob's interactions with Esau. Tosefta outlines interactions with Samaritans and idol worshipers. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר עֵשָׂ֔ו אַצִּֽיגָה־נָּ֣א עִמְּךָ֔ מִן־הָעָ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִתִּ֑י וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ לָ֣מָּה זֶּ֔ה אֶמְצָא־חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽי׃|15 E|Then Esau said, “Let me assign to you some of the people who are with me.” But he said, “Oh no, my lord is too kind to me!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob declined Esau's offer to accompany him, emphasizing the importance of finding favor in Esau's eyes over accepting an escort. Esau's men later abandoned him on the way to Seir, with only four hundred lads surviving, a repayment from God. Jacob's response to Esau's proposal hints at a reluctance to accept converts seeking to benefit from the Jewish people's good fortune, as seen in the word חן. Ramban explains that the angels who met Jacob were a vision to reassure him in enemy territory, signifying divine protection. 

|וַיָּ֩שׇׁב֩ בַּיּ֨וֹם הַה֥וּא עֵשָׂ֛ו לְדַרְכּ֖וֹ שֵׂעִֽירָה׃|16 E|So Esau started back that day on his way to Seir.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau returned alone as his men had left him, leading to Yaakov refraining from visiting him in Seir. After Yom Kippur, Jews build a sukkah to emulate Yaakov traveling to Sukkos after Esau went to Se'ir. Esau went to Seir, a well-watered land, adjacent to Israel. The Talmud discusses angels, honoring teachers, and interpretations of biblical texts. God warns the Israelites not to provoke Esau's descendants in Seir. On the day Jacob and Esau parted, Esau returned home to Seir, while Jacob continued to Gabla through a miracle. 

|וְיַעֲקֹב֙ נָסַ֣ע סֻכֹּ֔תָה וַיִּ֥בֶן ל֖וֹ בָּ֑יִת וּלְמִקְנֵ֙הוּ֙ עָשָׂ֣ה סֻכֹּ֔ת עַל־כֵּ֛ן קָרָ֥א שֵׁם־הַמָּק֖וֹם סֻכּֽוֹת׃|17 E|But Jacob journeyed on to Succoth, and built a house for himself and made stalls for his cattle; that is why the place was called Succoth. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the impermanence of possessions in this world and the importance of rejoicing in God during Sukkot, connecting the blemish of the sukkah to one's spiritual fall [Chasidut]. Jacob built a permanent house in Sukkot for Hashem while establishing temporary shelters for worldly matters, beyond the Jordan, outside of Canaan [Commentary]. King David composed songs to clear the path for prayers, Jacob rolled a stone off a well symbolizing the removal of obstacles, and the completion of the Middle Pillar joins with the Shekhinah [Kabbalah]. Liturgy in Selichot Nusach Lita Linear, Nusach Ashkenaz Lita, and Nusach Polin references the redemption of Isaac with a ram caught in a thicket, asking for mercy and forgiveness in Jacob's merit [Liturgy]. Jacob selected a gift for Esau, wrestled with a man, blessed by him, and settled in Canaan, staying in Sukot for 18 months, building a house, and establishing booths for his livestock [Midrash]. After Yom Kippur, Jews engage in building the sukkah, symbolizing the completion and fulfillment of Sukkot, representing peace and wholeness for Israel [Musar]. Jacob was faulted for being away from his father for twenty-two years, and House of Shammai permit co-wives to brothers based on the interpretation of the widow who is outside the family of the levir [Talmud]. Yaakov traveled to Sukkos, built a house and shelters for his livestock, and named the place Sukkos, staying there for twelve months [Targum]. 

|וַיָּבֹא֩ יַעֲקֹ֨ב שָׁלֵ֜ם עִ֣יר שְׁכֶ֗ם אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן בְּבֹא֖וֹ מִפַּדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם וַיִּ֖חַן אֶת־פְּנֵ֥י הָעִֽיר׃|18 E R|Jacob arrived safe in the city of Shechem which is in the land of Canaan—having come thus from Paddan-aram—and he encamped before the city.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov's arrival in Shekhem symbolizes faith and peace restoration, leading to spiritual elevation and preparation for future challenges. He established ownership in Shechem, hinting at future conquests, and earned the right to call Babylonia "life" by observing Shabbat. The Vilna Gaon believed his name hinted at his role in saving Israel, while in Kabbalah, Jacob represents the Middle Pillar and completion of the tabernacle. Midrash discusses Jacob observing Shabbat and inheriting the world without limits, while Musar highlights Jacob's perfection in serving God. Ramban sees divine protection in Jacob's encounter with angels, and Talmud emphasizes performing acts of kindness as Jacob did for Shechem. 

|וַיִּ֜קֶן אֶת־חֶלְקַ֣ת הַשָּׂדֶ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֤ר נָֽטָה־שָׁם֙ אׇהֳל֔וֹ מִיַּ֥ד בְּנֵֽי־חֲמ֖וֹר אֲבִ֣י שְׁכֶ֑ם בְּמֵאָ֖ה קְשִׂיטָֽה׃|19 E|The parcel of land where he pitched his tent he purchased from the kin of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred kesitahs. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries discuss Jacob's purchase of a portion of land in Shechem, with interpretations of the payment ranging from valuable coins to sheep. This purchase, along with acquisitions like the Cave of Machpelah and the Temple Mount, solidifies Israel's claim to these historic sites. The Midrash emphasizes the passing down of the land from Abraham to Jacob, highlighting their worthiness and the significance of legal acquisitions in specific locations in Canaan. In the Talmud, Rabbi Akiva explains the term "kesita" as a ma'a coin, clarifying the purchase made by Jacob. Additionally, the Tanakh mentions the burial of Joseph in Shechem, on the land bought by Jacob, becoming a heritage of the Josephites. Targum Jonathan specifies the payment for the land as pearls, emphasizing the value of Jacob's purchase. 

|וַיַּצֶּב־שָׁ֖ם מִזְבֵּ֑חַ וַיִּ֨קְרָא־ל֔וֹ אֵ֖ל אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|20 E|He set up an altar there, and called it El-elohe-yisrael. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the association of El with strength and truth in prayer, emphasizing the ability to connect with God and nullify His decrees. In commentary, altars were named to honor God's presence and protection, reflecting the Divine Presence in the Land of Israel. Jewish Thought explores the significance of different names for God, while Kabbalah delves into the distinctions between lower and upper grades in relation to God's names. Midrash highlights God's interactions with Jacob and the people, emphasizing gratitude and acceptance of His kingdom. Musar discusses Jacob's spiritual journey and achievements, including prevailing over evil and achieving spiritual perfection. Quoting commentary further expands on the naming of altars and the significance of God's involvement, while Talmud and Targum focus on the naming of altars by Jacob as a tribute to God. 

## Genesis 34

|וַתֵּצֵ֤א דִינָה֙ בַּת־לֵאָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָלְדָ֖ה לְיַעֲקֹ֑ב לִרְא֖וֹת בִּבְנ֥וֹת הָאָֽרֶץ׃|1 J|Now Dinah, the daughter whom Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Dinah, daughter of Leah, went out alone, intending to convert daughters of the land for the sake of Heaven, reflecting the righteousness of her ancestors. Maternal identity is debated based on parturition in Halakhah, while Maimonides believed women's seclusion was for honor and control. The incident of Dinah teaches the importance of women staying within the home for safety, as even illustrious daughters like her were not immune to harm. Yose from Maon interpreted Hos. 5 in Tiberias, and Targum explains that Dinah went out to observe the behavior of local girls. 

|וַיַּ֨רְא אֹתָ֜הּ שְׁכֶ֧ם בֶּן־חֲמ֛וֹר הַֽחִוִּ֖י נְשִׂ֣יא הָאָ֑רֶץ וַיִּקַּ֥ח אֹתָ֛הּ וַיִּשְׁכַּ֥ב אֹתָ֖הּ וַיְעַנֶּֽהָ׃|2 J|Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, chief of the country, saw her, and took her and lay with her and disgraced her. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various interpretations of the phrase "and he afflicted her" in Genesis 34:2 include suggestions that Shechem sodomized Dinah, caused her physical pain as a virgin during intercourse, or deprived her of relations. The story of Dinah serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of immodesty and the importance of modesty in behavior, with Shechem representing a breach in the area of licentiousness. In the Talmud, various rabbis interpret different verses to discuss topics such as licentiousness, affliction, and curses. The Targum states that Shechem forcibly lay with and afflicted Dinah. 

|וַתִּדְבַּ֣ק נַפְשׁ֔וֹ בְּדִינָ֖ה בַּֽת־יַעֲקֹ֑ב וַיֶּֽאֱהַב֙ אֶת־הַֽנַּעֲרָ֔ וַיְדַבֵּ֖ר עַל־לֵ֥ב הַֽנַּעֲרָֽ׃|3 J|Being strongly drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and in love with the maiden, he spoke to the maiden tenderly.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Shechem desired to marry Dinah despite causing her pain, expressing his love for her and seeking her consent, paralleled with God's love for Israel in various Midrashim. The name "Israel" signifies a future exalted status, reflecting eternal value and superiority over angels through Torah observance. Rabbi Chaninah ben Tradyon's soul was attached to Shechem's before departing after he raped Dinah, highlighting the ability of holy souls to positively influence others. Shechem's love for Dinah is compared to God's love for Israel, expressed in three different ways in the Torah (Targum Jonathan on Genesis 34:3). 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר שְׁכֶ֔ם אֶל־חֲמ֥וֹר אָבִ֖יו לֵאמֹ֑ר קַֽח־לִ֛י אֶת־הַיַּלְדָּ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|4 J|So Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as a wife.”|

Shechem urgently wanted his father to speak to Yaakov about marrying Dinah, showing a sense of entitlement. The Midrash discusses God showing Moses the past and future of Israel, reassuring the Israelites when the spies brought negative reports. Bible scholars analyze the story of Jacob and his sons with conflicting views on moral ambiguity. The Talmud explains phrases from the text, and the Targum states that Shechem asked his father Chamor to take Dinah as his wife. 

|וְיַעֲקֹ֣ב שָׁמַ֗ע כִּ֤י טִמֵּא֙ אֶת־דִּינָ֣ה בִתּ֔וֹ וּבָנָ֛יו הָי֥וּ אֶת־מִקְנֵ֖הוּ בַּשָּׂדֶ֑ה וְהֶחֱרִ֥שׁ יַעֲקֹ֖ב עַד־בֹּאָֽם׃|5 J|Jacob heard that he had defiled his daughter Dinah; but since his sons were in the field with his cattle, Jacob kept silent until they came home.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob chose to remain silent and refrain from addressing the situation with Shechem until his sons returned home and were informed of what had happened with Dinah, showing his preference to wait for their presence before taking action. Despite the defilement of Dinah, Jacob stayed quiet, while his sons were saddened and angered by the incident. The Talmud explains that children may be born with disabilities as a form of divine punishment for specific sinful actions committed by the parents, such as being lame from overturned tables, blind from gazing inappropriately, dumb from kissing inappropriately, or deaf from conversing during cohabitation. 

|וַיֵּצֵ֛א חֲמ֥וֹר אֲבִֽי־שְׁכֶ֖ם אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֑ב לְדַבֵּ֖ר אִתּֽוֹ׃|6 J|Then Shechem’s father Hamor came out to Jacob to speak to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Midrash Tanchuma, Moses is punished and not mentioned in the song of praise, the well in the desert symbolizes the removal of distractions for Torah scholars and corresponds to different courts in Jerusalem, and the well that accompanied the Israelites was eventually hidden in the Sea of Tiberias. Hamor approached Jacob to discuss marriage (Onkelos Genesis 34:6; Targum Jonathan on Genesis 34:6). 

|וּבְנֵ֨י יַעֲקֹ֜ב בָּ֤אוּ מִן־הַשָּׂדֶה֙ כְּשׇׁמְעָ֔ם וַיִּֽתְעַצְּבוּ֙ הָֽאֲנָשִׁ֔ים וַיִּ֥חַר לָהֶ֖ם מְאֹ֑ד כִּֽי־נְבָלָ֞ה עָשָׂ֣ה בְיִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל לִשְׁכַּב֙ אֶת־בַּֽת־יַעֲקֹ֔ב וְכֵ֖ן לֹ֥א יֵעָשֶֽׂה׃|7 J|Meanwhile Jacob’s sons, having heard the news, came in from the field. The men  were distressed and very angry, because he had committed an outrage in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter—a thing not to be done.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text describes the distress and anger of Jacob's sons upon learning of the rape of Dinah by Shechem, emphasizing the heinousness of the act as a violation of moral standards even among the Canaanites. The prohibition against intermarriage predates the Sinaitic covenant, as seen in the narratives of Dinah and Tamar in the Torah, with the Brisker Rav explaining that the Court of Shem decreed against intermarriage. Moral perfection requires constant refinement and purification of one's personality, as virtues must be acquired and not just natural traits, exemplified by Abraham's acquisition of higher values through prophetic insight. In Midrash Tanchuma, it is explained that Joshua lived ten years less than Moses because he spoke ten words before his master, and in Bereshit Rabbah, Job is said to have lived during the days of Abraham, Jacob, and the Tribes. Dinah's brothers, especially Simeon and Levi, took revenge by killing the unprotected male citizens of the city after the rape, reflecting the different resolution from the recommendations in Deuteronomy. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר חֲמ֖וֹר אִתָּ֣ם לֵאמֹ֑ר שְׁכֶ֣ם בְּנִ֗י חָֽשְׁקָ֤ה נַפְשׁוֹ֙ בְּבִתְּכֶ֔ם תְּנ֨וּ נָ֥א אֹתָ֛הּ ל֖וֹ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|8 J|And Hamor spoke with them, saying, “My son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him in marriage.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the vowels in Hebrew letters symbolize different aspects of God's essence, with "cholem" representing Hashem's essence, sh'va symbolizing restrictions God has imposed on Himself, and kametz symbolizing largesse after imposing restrictions. Commentary suggests Chamor may have been willing to pay damages for Dinah or marry her to disclaim responsibility for damages, while Midrash discusses expressions of affection towards Israel using examples from the story of Dinah and Shechem, emphasizing understanding and silence in interactions with others. Targum states that Chamor asks for Dinah to be given to his son Shechem as a wife. 

|וְהִֽתְחַתְּנ֖וּ אֹתָ֑נוּ בְּנֹֽתֵיכֶם֙ תִּתְּנוּ־לָ֔נוּ וְאֶת־בְּנֹתֵ֖ינוּ תִּקְח֥וּ לָכֶֽם׃|9 J|Intermarry with us: give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The intermarriage proposal in Genesis 34 was initiated by the sons of Yaakov as an honor, but Shechem and Chamor reversed the proposal to persuade their townsfolk to submit to circumcision. Hamor also suggested a political union along with the marriage proposal. Rashi explains that the proposition was made to emphasize the importance of Jacob's sons, allowing them to choose daughters of Shechem for themselves. The Talmud discusses differences in pronunciation between Rav and Samuel, leading to interpretations related to biblical verses. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan convey the message of intermarriage between two groups in Genesis 34:9. 

|וְאִתָּ֖נוּ תֵּשֵׁ֑בוּ וְהָאָ֙רֶץ֙ תִּהְיֶ֣ה לִפְנֵיכֶ֔ם שְׁבוּ֙ וּסְחָר֔וּהָ וְהֵֽאָחֲז֖וּ בָּֽהּ׃|10 J|You will dwell among us, and the land will be open before you; settle, move about, and acquire holdings in it.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashbam explains that the letter ח in וסחרוה saved the Torah from needing to write the word בה. Sforno discusses the principle of newcomers not being allowed to compete with local inhabitants in commerce or artisanship. Radak emphasizes the importance of trading within the land and buying freehold property to become equal to the prominent people of the town. Steinsaltz describes the offer of permanent residency, trade, and social unification in the land, despite the previous violent incident. Ramban explains that Joseph's brothers altered their words to Jacob for the sake of peace, implying they would be free to trade in the land to convince him to send Benjamin. Abarbanel recounts a historical event where the King of Spain forced Jews to convert, leading to great suffering and exile, with only a few surviving. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both emphasize the benefits of living with the people of the land for trading and possessing property. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר שְׁכֶם֙ אֶל־אָבִ֣יהָ וְאֶל־אַחֶ֔יהָ אֶמְצָא־חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינֵיכֶ֑ם וַאֲשֶׁ֥ר תֹּאמְר֛וּ אֵלַ֖י אֶתֵּֽן׃|11 J|Then Shechem said to her father and brothers, “Do me this favor, and I will pay whatever you tell me.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Shechem approached Rachel's father and brothers, offering to give whatever they asked for in order to find favor in their eyes, showing passion unlike Hamor [Onkelos Genesis 34:11; Targum Jonathan on Genesis 34:11]. 

|הַרְבּ֨וּ עָלַ֤י מְאֹד֙ מֹ֣הַר וּמַתָּ֔ן וְאֶ֨תְּנָ֔ה כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר תֹּאמְר֖וּ אֵלָ֑י וּתְנוּ־לִ֥י אֶת־הַֽנַּעֲרָ֖ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|12 J|Ask of me a bride-price ever so high, as well as gifts, and I will pay what you tell me; only give me the maiden for a wife.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses Dinah's situation with Shechem, highlighting the importance of her consent in marriage and Shechem's attempts to make amends through a larger dowry. The Rabbis differ on what happened to Dinah after her rescue, with a feasible opinion being that Simeon took her and buried her in the Land of Israel. The Talmud explains the obligations of the seducer in marriage, with Rav Ḥisda stating that the seducer must give a divorce if he does not want to keep the woman, while Rebbi Ismael argues for a bride-price. The commentary and Targum mention the tradition of increasing the bridal dowry and gifts for marriage. 

|וַיַּעֲנ֨וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֜ב אֶת־שְׁכֶ֨ם וְאֶת־חֲמ֥וֹר אָבִ֛יו בְּמִרְמָ֖ה וַיְדַבֵּ֑רוּ אֲשֶׁ֣ר טִמֵּ֔א אֵ֖ת דִּינָ֥ה אֲחֹתָֽם׃|13 J|Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor—speaking with guile because he had defiled their sister Dinah—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob's sons used subtlety to respond to Shechem and Hamor, devising a plan to weaken the city through circumcision, leading to Simeon and Levi's violent actions. The Ramban disagrees with the Rambam on the killing of the males of Shechem, while the Midrash recounts various versions of Jacob and Esau's battle. In the Second Temple text, Dina was violated by Shechem, leading to the violent retaliation by Simeon and Levi. The Targum highlights the defilement of Dina by Shechem as the catalyst for the events that unfolded. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֲלֵיהֶ֗ם לֹ֤א נוּכַל֙ לַעֲשׂוֹת֙ הַדָּבָ֣ר הַזֶּ֔ה לָתֵת֙ אֶת־אֲחֹתֵ֔נוּ לְאִ֖ישׁ אֲשֶׁר־ל֣וֹ עׇרְלָ֑ה כִּֽי־חֶרְפָּ֥ה הִ֖וא לָֽנוּ׃|14 J|and said to them, “We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for that is a disgrace among us.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the association of disgrace with the foreskin and the breaking of the covenant of peace, while the Commentary emphasizes the shame and disgrace of intermarrying with uncircumcised individuals. Jewish Thought highlights the significance of circumcision in preventing Jews from being consigned to purgatory, while the Midrash discusses the actions of Jacob's sons to prevent Dina from marrying a man with a foreskin. Musar defines a pious person by their sense of shame and reverence for God, and the Quoting Commentary mentions Jacob's sons' deceitful plan involving circumcision to avenge Dinah's defilement. Targum emphasizes the refusal to allow their sister to marry an uncircumcised man to avoid disgrace. 

|אַךְ־בְּזֹ֖את נֵא֣וֹת לָכֶ֑ם אִ֚ם תִּהְי֣וּ כָמֹ֔נוּ לְהִמֹּ֥ל לָכֶ֖ם כׇּל־זָכָֽר׃|15 J|Only on this condition will we agree with you; that you will become like us in that every male among you is circumcised.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that "נאות" in Genesis 34:15:1 means "we will consent unto you" and "להמול" means "to be circumcised" in the passive form. Rav Hirsch discusses the concept of "נאות" as a spiritual tool for understanding and the need for all males to be circumcised for reconciliation. In the Midrash, Isaac circumcised Jacob and Esau, with Esau despising the covenant, while in the Talmud, Rav and Samuel disagree on various matters, including the pronunciation of words and interpretation of verses. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention in the Targum that all males must be circumcised for consent. 

|וְנָתַ֤נּוּ אֶת־בְּנֹתֵ֙ינוּ֙ לָכֶ֔ם וְאֶת־בְּנֹתֵיכֶ֖ם נִֽקַּֽח־לָ֑נוּ וְיָשַׁ֣בְנוּ אִתְּכֶ֔ם וְהָיִ֖ינוּ לְעַ֥ם אֶחָֽד׃|16 J|Then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to ourselves; and we will dwell among you and become as one kindred.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 34:16, the brothers showed astuteness by offering their daughters in marriage to remove doubt of trickery, while Hamor and his son proposed intermarriage between the sons of Jacob and the men of Shechem to induce consent for circumcision and unity among the people. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan discuss the idea of intermarriage leading to unity and becoming one people. 

|וְאִם־לֹ֧א תִשְׁמְע֛וּ אֵלֵ֖ינוּ לְהִמּ֑וֹל וְלָקַ֥חְנוּ אֶת־בִּתֵּ֖נוּ וְהָלָֽכְנוּ׃|17 J|But if you will not listen to us and become circumcised, we will take our daughter and go.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The brothers threatened to take Dinah and leave if their conditions were not met, seeking a peaceful resolution through circumcision as a sign of respect for their laws and customs, while also concealing their desire for revenge and convincing Shechem that this was the only way to acquire Dinah. The Targum translations emphasize that they will take their daughter by force if necessary. 

|וַיִּֽיטְב֥וּ דִבְרֵיהֶ֖ם בְּעֵינֵ֣י חֲמ֑וֹר וּבְעֵינֵ֖י שְׁכֶ֥ם בֶּן־חֲמֽוֹר׃|18 J|Their words pleased Hamor and Hamor’s son Shechem.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 34:18 agree that the sons of Jacob's proposal for intermarriage with the men of Shechem on the condition of circumcision was pleasing to Hamor and Shechem. 

|וְלֹֽא־אֵחַ֤ר הַנַּ֙עַר֙ לַעֲשׂ֣וֹת הַדָּבָ֔ר כִּ֥י חָפֵ֖ץ בְּבַֽת־יַעֲקֹ֑ב וְה֣וּא נִכְבָּ֔ד מִכֹּ֖ל בֵּ֥ית אָבִֽיו׃|19 J|And the youth lost no time in doing the thing, for he wanted Jacob’s daughter. Now he was the most respected in his father’s house.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Sforno, Radak, Rav Hirsch, Steinsaltz, and Chizkuni offer various insights into the story of Shekhem and Dinah, highlighting Shekhem's respect, leadership, and motivations. Moses' belief in natural law is challenged, leading to the composition of a song emphasizing gratitude to God. The Midrash discusses expressions of love from God towards Israel and the significance of intermarriage. Radak explains the concept of God hearing the cries of His people in Psalms and Genesis. The Talmud lists seven types of false Pharisees, and the Targum highlights Shekhem's quick marriage to Dinah due to his desire for her and his high status. 

|וַיָּבֹ֥א חֲמ֛וֹר וּשְׁכֶ֥ם בְּנ֖וֹ אֶל־שַׁ֣עַר עִירָ֑ם וַֽיְדַבְּר֛וּ אֶל־אַנְשֵׁ֥י עִירָ֖ם לֵאמֹֽר׃|20 J|So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the public place  of their town and spoke to their town council,  saying,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 34:20, Hamor and Shekhem convene with the elders at the city gate, a customary meeting place for important matters. The Talmud permits washing a baby on Shabbat before and after circumcision, with Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya allowing it even on the third day. In Ruth 3:11, Boaz reassures Ruth based on her reputation with the elders, while in Genesis 26:7, Isaac lies to protect his wife from the local leaders. The Targum simply states that Chamor and Shechem spoke with the men of their city at the gate. 

|הָאֲנָשִׁ֨ים הָאֵ֜לֶּה שְֽׁלֵמִ֧ים הֵ֣ם אִתָּ֗נוּ וְיֵשְׁב֤וּ בָאָ֙רֶץ֙ וְיִסְחֲר֣וּ אֹתָ֔הּ וְהָאָ֛רֶץ הִנֵּ֥ה רַֽחֲבַת־יָדַ֖יִם לִפְנֵיהֶ֑ם אֶת־בְּנֹתָם֙ נִקַּֽח־לָ֣נוּ לְנָשִׁ֔ים וְאֶת־בְּנֹתֵ֖ינוּ נִתֵּ֥ן לָהֶֽם׃|21 J|“These people  are our friends; let them settle in the land and move about in it, for the land is large enough for them; we will take their daughters to ourselves as wives and give our daughters to them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the completion of the Talmud is celebrated with a benediction, emphasizing the importance of Torah study and the strength it provides. In the Commentary, the residents of Shechem initially believed Jacob's family was hostile, but a proposal for intermarriage was a ploy to show harmony. Jewish Thought highlights the significance of observing the shemittah legislation for spiritual development, while Midrash discusses the creation of the earth for humanity and the eternal existence of Israel and the Torah. In Musar, Adam and Eve's actions led to purification processes, and the earth is compared to a human body with different functions. Or HaChaim emphasizes the Jewish people's role in rescuing holy souls, while Zevach Pesach discusses the Israelites' distinctiveness and growth in Egypt. Targum mentions the proposal for intermarriage to promote living and trading in the land. 

|אַךְ־בְּ֠זֹ֠את יֵאֹ֨תוּ לָ֤נוּ הָאֲנָשִׁים֙ לָשֶׁ֣בֶת אִתָּ֔נוּ לִהְי֖וֹת לְעַ֣ם אֶחָ֑ד בְּהִמּ֥וֹל לָ֙נוּ֙ כׇּל־זָכָ֔ר כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר הֵ֥ם נִמֹּלִֽים׃|22 J|But only on this condition will their representatives  agree with us to dwell among us and be as one kindred: that all our males become circumcised as they are circumcised.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes engaging in mundane affairs to vivify souls and show kindness, reflecting the continuous chesed of God, with Torah prioritizing family except for saints and the Land of Israel. Ibn Ezra and Rashi discuss the root of "consent" and the significance of circumcision in Genesis 34:22, while Midrash highlights the importance of upholding the covenant through generations, even in the face of oppressive decrees. The priests' use of circumcision skin is mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud, and Targum explains the condition for unity in Genesis 34:22. 

|מִקְנֵהֶ֤ם וְקִנְיָנָם֙ וְכׇל־בְּהֶמְתָּ֔ם הֲל֥וֹא לָ֖נוּ הֵ֑ם אַ֚ךְ נֵא֣וֹתָה לָהֶ֔ם וְיֵשְׁב֖וּ אִתָּֽנוּ׃|23 J|Their cattle and substance and all their beasts will be ours, if we only agree to their terms, so that they will settle among us.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The term "mikneh" and "behemoth" emphasize the large number of livestock belonging to Yaakov's family, with the people of Shechem seeing them as potential property. The sons of Yaakov sought consent to live with the people of Shechem, who believed merging with Yaakov's family would enrich themselves. Jacob's sons used cunning to manipulate Shechem and Hamor into circumcision, ultimately leading to their downfall. God instructs Moses to teach the Israelites the Torah with understanding, likening it to a fully set table. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Genesis 34:23 as a desire to acquire possessions and livestock through living in harmony. 

|וַיִּשְׁמְע֤וּ אֶל־חֲמוֹר֙ וְאֶל־שְׁכֶ֣ם בְּנ֔וֹ כׇּל־יֹצְאֵ֖י שַׁ֣עַר עִיר֑וֹ וַיִּמֹּ֙לוּ֙ כׇּל־זָכָ֔ר כׇּל־יֹצְאֵ֖י שַׁ֥עַר עִירֽוֹ׃|24 J|All his fellow townsmen  heeded Hamor and his son Shechem, and all males, all his fellow townsmen,  were circumcised.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 34:24, the men in the city were forcibly circumcised by Hamor and Shechem, unlike those who entered the city to pay respects. Tamar was accused of lewdness and sentenced to be burned, not killed, due to her lineage. Jacob's sons used deceit to avoid giving their sister to a man with a foreskin, leading to the circumcision of the city's men. Radak explains the interchangeability of terms for entering and leaving the gate, Ramban discusses age requirements for military service, and Rabbeinu Bahya highlights Bileam's divine vision. In the Targum, all males who passed through the city gate were circumcised. 

|וַיְהִי֩ בַיּ֨וֹם הַשְּׁלִישִׁ֜י בִּֽהְיוֹתָ֣ם כֹּֽאֲבִ֗ים וַיִּקְח֣וּ שְׁנֵֽי־בְנֵי־יַ֠עֲקֹ֠ב שִׁמְע֨וֹן וְלֵוִ֜י אֲחֵ֤י דִינָה֙ אִ֣ישׁ חַרְבּ֔וֹ וַיָּבֹ֥אוּ עַל־הָעִ֖יר בֶּ֑טַח וַיַּֽהַרְג֖וּ כׇּל־זָכָֽר׃|25 J|On the third day, when they were in pain, Simeon and Levi, two of Jacob’s sons, brothers of Dinah, took each his sword, came upon the city unmolested, and slew all the males.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Simeon and Levi avenged their sister Dinah's defilement by killing the men of Shechem after their circumcision, acting with zeal and strength but also facing criticism for their actions. The third day after circumcision is significant in determining practices like bathing and medical care, with the Talmud discussing various halakhot based on biblical allusions. Yosef favored Shimeon due to his association with strict judgment, as seen in previous events like the attack on Shechem. Pinchas' lineage as a descendant of Cohein and Levi is highlighted in the Midrash to justify his actions, emphasizing the significance of each tribe's role and actions in Israel's history. The Mishnah discusses practices like washing a baby on the third day after circumcision, tying a scarlet strip of wool to a scapegoat, and fasting practices of the non-priestly watch. 

|וְאֶת־חֲמוֹר֙ וְאֶת־שְׁכֶ֣ם בְּנ֔וֹ הָרְג֖וּ לְפִי־חָ֑רֶב וַיִּקְח֧וּ אֶת־דִּינָ֛ה מִבֵּ֥ית שְׁכֶ֖ם וַיֵּצֵֽאוּ׃|26 J|They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword, took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went away.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno and Radak suggest Dinah stayed with Shechem until Shimon promised to marry her, while Steinsaltz mentions Hamor and Shekhem were killed conspicuously, possibly beheaded, and Dina was taken from Shechem's house as a future bride. Chizkuni suggests Dinah had to be dragged as she was unwilling to leave. In Jewish Thought, Dinah's brothers did not speak with her after she was abused by Shekhem, concerned about the family's reputation. In Midrash, the killing of Shekhem and his father is analyzed, with different interpretations offered. The Givonim felt justified in deceiving the Israelites due to the trickery of Yaakov's sons towards their Chivite relatives. Hamor and Shechem were killed by the sword, and Dinah was taken from Shechem's house in the Targum. 

|בְּנֵ֣י יַעֲקֹ֗ב בָּ֚אוּ עַל־הַ֣חֲלָלִ֔ים וַיָּבֹ֖זּוּ הָעִ֑יר אֲשֶׁ֥ר טִמְּא֖וּ אֲחוֹתָֽם׃|27 J|The other sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the town, because their sister had been defiled.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno, Or HaChaim, Radak, Rashi, and Steinsaltz all explain that Jacob's sons took revenge on the city of Shechem for defiling their sister Dinah by stripping the slain, looting the city, and demonstrating the consequences of their actions. Gevia Kesef also discusses the morality of their actions, implicating all the male inhabitants of Shechem for the defilement of Dinah. 

|אֶת־צֹאנָ֥ם וְאֶת־בְּקָרָ֖ם וְאֶת־חֲמֹרֵיהֶ֑ם וְאֵ֧ת אֲשֶׁר־בָּעִ֛יר וְאֶת־אֲשֶׁ֥ר בַּשָּׂדֶ֖ה לָקָֽחוּ׃|28 J|They seized their flocks and herds and asses, all that was inside the town and outside;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The people of Shechem were plundered by Jacob's sons, taking livestock such as sheep, cattle, and donkeys from the city and the field [Steinsaltz on Genesis 34:28; Targum]. 

|וְאֶת־כׇּל־חֵילָ֤ם וְאֶת־כׇּל־טַפָּם֙ וְאֶת־נְשֵׁיהֶ֔ם שָׁב֖וּ וַיָּבֹ֑זּוּ וְאֵ֖ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר בַּבָּֽיִת׃|29 J|all their wealth, all their children, and their wives, all that was in the houses, they took as captives and booty.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Genesis 34:29 discusses the plundering of wealth and captives from the house of Shechem or Hamor, with Rashi explaining the terms "חילם" and "שבו" as wealth and captives, respectively. Ibn Ezra notes the change in meaning if "שבייה" is accented differently. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention that the invaders took wealth, children, wives, and possessions from the plundered people and their houses. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֜ב אֶל־שִׁמְע֣וֹן וְאֶל־לֵוִי֮ עֲכַרְתֶּ֣ם אֹתִי֒ לְהַבְאִישֵׁ֙נִי֙ בְּיֹשֵׁ֣ב הָאָ֔רֶץ בַּֽכְּנַעֲנִ֖י וּבַפְּרִזִּ֑י וַאֲנִי֙ מְתֵ֣י מִסְפָּ֔ר וְנֶאֶסְפ֤וּ עָלַי֙ וְהִכּ֔וּנִי וְנִשְׁמַדְתִּ֖י אֲנִ֥י וּבֵיתִֽי׃|30 J|Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me, making me odious among the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites; my fighters  are few in number, so that if they unite against me and attack me, I and my house will be destroyed.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob was concerned that Simeon and Levi's actions in Shechem would lead to retaliation from the Canaanites due to their few numbers. The Ramban supports Jacob's criticism, while the Rambam notes Shimon and Levi's response to Jacob. Akeidat Yitzchak emphasizes the value of life and the duty to preserve it faithfully, while discussing Moses' blessings and the roles of the tribes. Kabbalah warns against turning away from HaShem to seek stagnant waters. The Midrash recounts the brothers' deception of Jacob regarding Joseph's fate. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, Sforno, Or HaChaim, Ibn Ezra, Gevia Kesef, and Chizkuni provide insights into Moses' blessing, Simeon and Levi's actions, and Jacob's reaction. Isaiah, Deuteronomy, and Targum highlight the consequences of violence and the importance of avoiding unnecessary conflict. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֑וּ הַכְזוֹנָ֕ה יַעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֶת־אֲחוֹתֵֽנוּ׃|31 J|But they answered, “Should our sister be treated like a whore?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Simeon and Levi seek vengeance for the violation of their sister Dinah by Shechem, arguing that she was not willingly involved and should not be treated as a harlot. The brothers' actions instill fear in other nations, justifying their brutal response according to the Midrash and Targum commentaries. Dinah's brothers are criticized for their lack of communication and support after the incident, highlighting the importance of listening to and standing by those who have been wronged according to the Dirshuni II commentary. The Akeidat Yitzchak commentary emphasizes the role of intermediaries like Moses in repairing the relationship between G-d and His people, while the Musar commentary suggests that Jacob's punishment for a minor impropriety led to the events involving Dinah and Reuben and Bilhah. The complexity of right and wrong is further explored in the Quoting Commentary, where Simeon and Levi's violent actions lead to condemnation from Jacob, questioning the morality of their actions. 

## Genesis 35

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֔ב ק֛וּם עֲלֵ֥ה בֵֽית־אֵ֖ל וְשֶׁב־שָׁ֑ם וַעֲשֵׂה־שָׁ֣ם מִזְבֵּ֔חַ לָאֵל֙ הַנִּרְאֶ֣ה אֵלֶ֔יךָ בְּבׇ֨רְחֲךָ֔ מִפְּנֵ֖י עֵשָׂ֥ו אָחִֽיךָ׃|1 E|God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and remain there; and build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob was commanded to go to Beth-el to settle and build an altar to purify the camp from idols and defilement, express gratitude for God's protection, and fulfill a vow made years earlier. Prophets receive messages through dreams or visions, influenced by the Active Intellect, and Jacob's encounter with angels symbolized victory over idolatrous influences. In Midrash, Jacob's actions affect his fortunes, and God instructs him to fulfill his vow at Beth-El. Rashi, Torah Temimah, Ramban, and Gevia Kesef provide interpretations of Jacob's actions and interactions with God. In Tanakh, Abram builds an altar to worship God after receiving a promise about his descendants, while in Targum, Elohim instructs Jacob to build an altar in Beth-El as a fulfillment of a previous encounter with God. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל־בֵּית֔וֹ וְאֶ֖ל כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר עִמּ֑וֹ הָסִ֜רוּ אֶת־אֱלֹהֵ֤י הַנֵּכָר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּתֹכְכֶ֔ם וְהִֽטַּהֲר֔וּ וְהַחֲלִ֖יפוּ שִׂמְלֹתֵיכֶֽם׃|2 E|So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Rid yourselves of the alien gods in your midst, purify yourselves, and change your clothes.|

Chasidut explains how Avraham and Yitzchak converted people, while Yaakov warned against idolatry; Halakhah discusses the ritual impurity of false deities; Jewish Thought emphasizes fulfilling vows and objective valuations; Midrash highlights the consequences of not fulfilling vows and the importance of loving one another; Musar stresses the need to remove forbidden objects to maintain purity; Quoting Commentary discusses the importance of moral standards in the Land of Israel; Second Temple commentary contrasts Laban's demand for a search with Jacob's instructions to remove idols; Targum describes Yaakov's instructions to remove foreign idols, purify, and change garments. 

|וְנָק֥וּמָה וְנַעֲלֶ֖ה בֵּֽית־אֵ֑ל וְאֶֽעֱשֶׂה־שָּׁ֣ם מִזְבֵּ֗חַ לָאֵ֞ל הָעֹנֶ֤ה אֹתִי֙ בְּי֣וֹם צָֽרָתִ֔י וַיְהִי֙ עִמָּדִ֔י בַּדֶּ֖רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָלָֽכְתִּי׃|3 E|Come, let us go up to Bethel, and I will build an altar there to the God who answered me when I was in distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob's decision to build an altar in Beit El reflects his gratitude and faith in God's protection during times of trouble. Jacob's uncertainty about the significance of his dream of the ladder contrasts with Abraham's certainty in Divine instructions, highlighting his journey towards understanding. The Midrash emphasizes that troubles signal impending redemption, discusses the importance of praying towards Jerusalem, and compares the strength needed in times of trouble to different weights of chains. Rabbi Yoḥanan argues against heretics using verses to support multiple gods, providing responses affirming belief in one God. The Targum also highlights Jacob's gratitude towards God for answering his prayers and providing support during his journey. 

|וַיִּתְּנ֣וּ אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֗ב אֵ֣ת כׇּל־אֱלֹהֵ֤י הַנֵּכָר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּיָדָ֔ם וְאֶת־הַנְּזָמִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּאׇזְנֵיהֶ֑ם וַיִּטְמֹ֤ן אֹתָם֙ יַעֲקֹ֔ב תַּ֥חַת הָאֵלָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר עִם־שְׁכֶֽם׃|4 E|They gave to Jacob all the alien gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the terebinth that was near Shechem.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the concept of rectification through hands, illustrated by Jacob receiving idolatrous artifacts from his household members in Genesis 35:4. Commentary discusses Jacob burying the idols under a terebinth tree near Shechem to prevent idolatrous use, fulfilling a vow and avoiding detection. Midrash highlights various biblical figures fulfilling Torah aspects before receiving it, with Jacob commended for removing foreign gods. Mishnah distinguishes between vows prohibiting benefit from a person or their food, while Talmud recounts Rebbi Ismael ben Rebbi Yose warning Samaritans of idol worship. Second Temple commentary emphasizes Jacob's rejection of wealth through evil means. Targum mentions Jacob burying foreign gods and earrings under an oak tree near Shechem. 

|וַיִּסָּ֑עוּ וַיְהִ֣י ׀ חִתַּ֣ת אֱלֹהִ֗ים עַל־הֶֽעָרִים֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ סְבִיב֣וֹתֵיהֶ֔ם וְלֹ֣א רָֽדְפ֔וּ אַחֲרֵ֖י בְּנֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב׃|5 E|As they set out, a terror from God fell on the cities round about, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob's departure from Shechem caused fear among the surrounding cities, preventing them from pursuing his family. Midrash Vayisu highlights the bravery of Jacob's sons in battles against the Amorite kings and Esau, with Judah's courage standing out. Radak suggests that Abram may have briefly lived in locations mentioned in Genesis 12:6, praying for Jacob's family after a prophetic vision of Dinah's rape. Ibn Ezra and Chizkuni provide interpretations of Jacob's words in Genesis 49:6 and 48:22, respectively. The Targum mentions the sons of Jacob praising and praying to the Lord during their journey, with the surrounding cities struck with fear and not pursuing them. 

|וַיָּבֹ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב ל֗וּזָה אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן הִ֖וא בֵּֽית־אֵ֑ל ה֖וּא וְכׇל־הָעָ֥ם אֲשֶׁר־עִמּֽוֹ׃|6 E|Thus Jacob came to Luz—that is, Bethel—in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Chizkuni mention a second town called Luz in Canaan where Yaakov and his entourage were spared casualties during attacks by the Canaanites due to fear of God. The Midrash describes three battles in Shechem where idolaters gathered to wage war with Jacob's children but were prevented by God. Ramban explains how Jacob's sons dealt with the people of Shechem, with Simeon and Levi acting independently to kill the men of the city, leading Jacob to curse them. Additionally, Rabbeinu Bahya discusses the significance of the names Yaakov and Yisrael in relation to spiritual and physical concerns. Finally, the Targum states that Jacob arrived at Luz in Canaan, also known as Bethel, with all his companions. 

|וַיִּ֤בֶן שָׁם֙ מִזְבֵּ֔חַ וַיִּקְרָא֙ לַמָּק֔וֹם אֵ֖ל בֵּֽית־אֵ֑ל כִּ֣י שָׁ֗ם נִגְל֤וּ אֵלָיו֙ הָֽאֱלֹהִ֔ים בְּבׇרְח֖וֹ מִפְּנֵ֥י אָחִֽיו׃|7 E|There he built an altar and named the site El-bethel,  for it was there that God had been revealed to him when he was fleeing from his brother.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 35:7, Jacob named the place El Bet El to signify God's association with the site where angels were revealed to him. The presence of God was revealed in Bethel, emphasizing His singular power and presence. Midrash discusses Leah's behavior, the creation of women to be modest, Jacob's altar connected to Dina's punishment, and Shekhem's actions towards Dina. Rabbeinu Bahya sees Yaakov's blessing as an allusion to the ten emanations, Rashi notes the building of altars by the patriarchs, Ramban highlights Yaakov's spiritual journey to Beth-El, Gevia Kesef discusses the significance of divine terms, and Chizkuni explains the renaming of Luz to Beth-El. In the Talmud, Rabbi Yoḥanan refutes heretics' claims of multiple gods by emphasizing the oneness of God through examples in the Bible. According to Targum, Jacob built an altar at Bethel where God was revealed to him while fleeing from Esau. 

|וַתָּ֤מׇת דְּבֹרָה֙ מֵינֶ֣קֶת רִבְקָ֔ה וַתִּקָּבֵ֛ר מִתַּ֥חַת לְבֵֽית־אֵ֖ל תַּ֣חַת הָֽאַלּ֑וֹן וַיִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖וֹ אַלּ֥וֹן בָּכֽוּת׃|8 E|Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and was buried under the oak below Bethel; so it was named Allon-bacuth. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried beneath an oak tree, leading Jacob to learn of Rebekah's death indirectly to avoid dishonor in her burial, as Esau's evil nature could bring curses. The eternal existence and special status of the Jewish people is intrinsic, not solely dependent on observance of the covenant, with Torah being a natural part of Jewish identity. Jacob mourned the deaths of Deborah, Rebekah, Laban, Rachel, and experienced a Divine vision during a time of mourning, with God showing compassion to those mourning. The deaths of significant women in the Torah are only mentioned in relation to significant events or deeds. 

|וַיֵּרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹב֙ ע֔וֹד בְּבֹא֖וֹ מִפַּדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם וַיְבָ֖רֶךְ אֹתֽוֹ׃|9 P|God appeared again to Jacob on his arrival from Paddan-aram. God blessed him,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God appeared directly to Jacob in Bet El, blessing him with consolation after his mourning, surrounded by angels once he left Laban's idol worship. The humble person connects with Hashem, exemplified in various actions, while the Midrash discusses the consequences of iniquity. Rabbeinu Bahya, Gevia Kesef, Rashi, and Da'at Zekenim explore different aspects of the patriarchs, beliefs, promises, blessings, and conditions in the stories of Jacob and his family. The Tanakh highlights God's covenant with Abraham, the promise of a son through Sarah, and Abraham's intercession for Sodom, revealing God's mercy and justice. The Targum emphasizes God's teachings on marriage, visiting the afflicted, and comforting mourners through examples from Adam, Abraham, and Jacob. 

|וַיֹּֽאמֶר־ל֥וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים שִׁמְךָ֣ יַעֲקֹ֑ב לֹֽא־יִקָּרֵא֩ שִׁמְךָ֨ ע֜וֹד יַעֲקֹ֗ב כִּ֤י אִם־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ יִהְיֶ֣ה שְׁמֶ֔ךָ וַיִּקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|10 P|saying to him, “You whose name is Jacob, You shall be called Jacob no more, But Israel shall be your name.” Thus he was named Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the significance of Jacob's name change to Israel, symbolizing his victory, leadership, and spiritual growth. The prohibition against clairvoyance applies to both genders, with transgressors liable for lashes. The power of the constellations can be nullified by God's kindness, and Israelites are considered ministers over celestial ministers. The concept of building a tabernacle for God is symbolic, emphasizing the importance of attaining holiness. Jacob's qualities and name change to Israel are discussed in various Midrash texts. Ben Zoma predicts a future time when Israel will no longer mention the Exodus, similar to the transition from Jacob to Israel. Yaakov's name change to Yisrael signifies his struggle with God and men. Rebbi Elazar Ben Azaryah introduced the practice of mentioning the Exodus from Egypt at night, and the Tosefta emphasizes specific guidelines for blessings. 

|וַיֹּ֩אמֶר֩ ל֨וֹ אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֲנִ֨י אֵ֤ל שַׁדַּי֙ פְּרֵ֣ה וּרְבֵ֔ה גּ֛וֹי וּקְהַ֥ל גּוֹיִ֖ם יִהְיֶ֣ה מִמֶּ֑ךָּ וּמְלָכִ֖ים מֵחֲלָצֶ֥יךָ יֵצֵֽאוּ׃|11 P|And God said to him, “I am El Shaddai.   Be fertile and increase; A nation, yea an assembly of nations, Shall descend from you. Kings shall issue from your loins. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains Yaakov penalized Reuven by depriving him of firstborn rights, emphasizing the importance of guarding the brit to avoid blemishing the Name Shadai and receive blessings through the mezuzah. Kabbalah emphasizes reverence when entering the presence of God, while Midrash highlights promises to Jacob's descendants and special events like the fifteenth of Av. Musar delves into G-d's love for Israel and hidden light, while Commentary discusses anointing and the significance of biblical figures like Abraham. Second Temple texts explain how God is referred to based on individual spiritual states, and Talmudic discussions cover various interpretations and debates on community errors and celebrations. Tanakh and Targum passages detail God's interactions with Jacob and promises of offspring and kings descending from him. 

|וְאֶת־הָאָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֛תִּי לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם וּלְיִצְחָ֖ק לְךָ֣ אֶתְּנֶ֑נָּה וּֽלְזַרְעֲךָ֥ אַחֲרֶ֖יךָ אֶתֵּ֥ן אֶת־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|12 P|The land that I assigned to Abraham and Isaac I assign to you; And to your offspring to come Will I assign the land.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God promised Jacob the same land given to Abraham and Isaac, assuring him that it would be a personal possession for him and his descendants. This promise is seen as irrevocable, ensuring that Jacob and his future offspring will ultimately inherit and settle the land, with a nation, assembly of nations, and kings descending from him. Avner understood that two kings would come from Benjamin, as Rashi explains, while Ramban emphasizes the worthiness of each patriarch to receive a covenant. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos both confirm God's promise to Jacob regarding the land. 

|וַיַּ֥עַל מֵעָלָ֖יו אֱלֹהִ֑ים בַּמָּק֖וֹם אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּ֥ר אִתּֽוֹ׃|13 P|God parted from him at the spot where [God] had spoken to him;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The patriarchs, including Yaakov, are seen as a Divine Chariot, with God's presence resting upon them in specific locations. The departure of the Divine Presence after communicating with individuals, as seen in the cases of Avraham and Yaakov, highlights the significance of these encounters. The use of verbs like "ascend" and "go up" in biblical verses emphasizes the divine nature of these interactions and the communication between God and humanity. The concept of the righteous serving as vessels through which God's presence can dwell and be elevated is also discussed, with the idea that prayers must be focused on HaShem's title related to the prayer for them to be effective. The arrival of the Messiah and the exact date of redemption are deemed unknowable by humans, with calculations discouraged to avoid confusion and disappointment. Astrology and predictions based on planetary conjunctions are dismissed as inaccurate indicators of the Messiah's coming, while prophecies point to the restoration of prophecy in Israel as a sign of the Messianic era. 

|וַיַּצֵּ֨ב יַעֲקֹ֜ב מַצֵּבָ֗ה בַּמָּק֛וֹם אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּ֥ר אִתּ֖וֹ מַצֶּ֣בֶת אָ֑בֶן וַיַּסֵּ֤ךְ עָלֶ֙יהָ֙ נֶ֔סֶךְ וַיִּצֹ֥ק עָלֶ֖יהָ שָֽׁמֶן׃|14 P|and Jacob set up a pillar at the site where [God] had spoken to him, a pillar of stone, and he offered a libation on it and poured oil upon it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses allusions in a story, including references to tefillin, tzitzit, laughter of the bull and ram, anointed king on Mount Zion, pouring and molding, advice, nations as inheritance, serving with awe, and rejoicing upon the trembling of the wicked. Commentary explains Jacob's act of setting up a pillar at Beth-el, pouring out a drink offering and anointing it with oil to sanctify it, symbolizing completion of his vow and preparation for a house of God. Kabbalah mentions the renewal of the moon and restoration of youth like an eagle. Midrash describes the patriarchs as the Divine Chariot, with Jacob pouring oil on the monument where God spoke to him. Quoting Commentary highlights the sanctification of the stone as an altar and setting up a pillar to honor God. Targum recounts Yaakov setting up a stone monument, pouring wine, water, and oil on it in the customs of the Feast of Tabernacles. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב אֶת־שֵׁ֣ם הַמָּק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁר֩ דִּבֶּ֨ר אִתּ֥וֹ שָׁ֛ם אֱלֹהִ֖ים בֵּֽית־אֵֽל׃|15 P|Jacob gave the site, where God had spoken to him, the name of Bethel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob named the place where God spoke to him Beth-El to emphasize its significance as a House of God and confirm the authenticity of his vision, distinguishing it from a mere dream. The use of "Lord" in Jacob's interactions and visions highlights his connection to the divine, while Laban's confused belief led him to use both "God" and "Lord" in his interactions with Jacob. Hagar called the messenger of God "El-roi" after he spoke to her, signifying that she had seen God, and God departed from Jacob at the spot where he had spoken to him. 

|וַיִּסְעוּ֙ מִבֵּ֣ית אֵ֔ל וַֽיְהִי־ע֥וֹד כִּבְרַת־הָאָ֖רֶץ לָב֣וֹא אֶפְרָ֑תָה וַתֵּ֥לֶד רָחֵ֖ל וַתְּקַ֥שׁ בְּלִדְתָּֽהּ׃|16 E|They set out from Bethel; but when they were still some distance short of Ephrath, Rachel was in childbirth, and she had hard labor.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rachel had a difficult childbirth and died after giving birth, along with Pinḥas's wife and Mikhal daughter of Shaul. The timing of Rachel's labor is debated, with Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov suggesting the end of summer and the Rabbis suggesting after the rainy season. A pregnant woman experiencing labor pains for three consecutive days within eleven days of menstruation is considered a zava if the pains subside for a full day and night before giving birth, according to Rabbi Yehoshua. The Sanhedrin in Beit Lechem was significant during the time of Megillat Ruth, and the location of Kever Rachel is debated. The mother of vainglory is represented as dying in childbirth, symbolizing the death of the soul when giving birth to vainglory. The people at the gate and elders wished for Ruth to be like Rachel and Leah in building up the House of Israel. 

|וַיְהִ֥י בְהַקְשֹׁתָ֖הּ בְּלִדְתָּ֑הּ וַתֹּ֨אמֶר לָ֤הּ הַמְיַלֶּ֙דֶת֙ אַל־תִּ֣ירְאִ֔י כִּֽי־גַם־זֶ֥ה לָ֖ךְ בֵּֽן׃|17 E|When her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, “Have no fear, for it is another boy for you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The midwife assured Rachel that she was giving birth to a son, alleviating her fears of dying during childbirth. Midrashic texts discuss the concept of additions from God being greater than the original, using examples like Abraham, Rachel, and King Hezekiah. The Mishnah outlines the criteria for determining if a pregnant woman is considered a zava based on labor pains and blood discharge. The German commentary on Mishnah Chullin 4:1:1 compares the difficulty of childbirth to Genesis 35:17, while another commentary suggests supplementing the term "המקשה" with "לילד." Targum Jonathan confirms that Rachel gave birth to a son during her difficult labor. 

|וַיְהִ֞י בְּצֵ֤את נַפְשָׁהּ֙ כִּ֣י מֵ֔תָה וַתִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖וֹ בֶּן־אוֹנִ֑י וְאָבִ֖יו קָֽרָא־ל֥וֹ בִנְיָמִֽין׃|18 E|But as she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named him Ben-oni;  but his father called him Benjamin. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The name Binyamin indicates prominence as it is derived from "BeN YaMIN" meaning the Land of Israel, considered higher than all other lands. Rachel named her son Ben-Oni, meaning "son of my sorrow," but Jacob renamed him Benjamin, symbolizing strength and a shift in power towards a nascent nation. Aninut is the period between death and burial, during which the onen is exempt from mitzvot and certain activities. The Mishnah discusses scenarios where a son may or may not be considered a firstborn with regard to inheritance and redemption from a priest, detailing cases of uncertain paternity and unusual forms of miscarriage. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak argues that Joseph's name was written with a second yod on the ephod to reflect his birth name. 

|וַתָּ֖מׇת רָחֵ֑ל וַתִּקָּבֵר֙ בְּדֶ֣רֶךְ אֶפְרָ֔תָה הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם׃|19 E|Thus Rachel died. She was buried on the road to Ephrath—now Bethlehem.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rachel died and was buried on the road to Bethlehem due to complications during childbirth, with Jacob naming his son Benjamin after her death. The Land of Israel is considered holy and cannot tolerate sinners, as seen in the punishment of the Canaanites. Rachel's burial place is mentioned in various texts, with the Tosefta mentioning Saul meeting two men near her tomb at Zelzah. 

|וַיַּצֵּ֧ב יַעֲקֹ֛ב מַצֵּבָ֖ה עַל־קְבֻרָתָ֑הּ הִ֛וא מַצֶּ֥בֶת קְבֻֽרַת־רָחֵ֖ל עַד־הַיּֽוֹם׃|20 E|Over her grave Jacob set up a pillar; it is the pillar at Rachel’s grave to this day.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra suggests "kivrah" should have been used instead of "kevuratah" for Jacob's monument over Rachel's grave, while Rashbam references Samuel I 10:2. Sforno explains the monument was for protection at a crossroads. Steinsaltz notes the monument lasted for generations. Midrash teaches Jacob used leftover money for the monument, and Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel says righteous individuals do not need physical memorials. Jacob buried Rachel at a location where exiles would pass, hoping for mercy. Targum states Jacob's monument remains on Rachel's grave. 

|וַיִּסַּ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וַיֵּ֣ט אׇֽהֳלֹ֔ה מֵהָ֖לְאָה לְמִגְדַּל־עֵֽדֶר׃|21 J|Israel journeyed on, and pitched his tent beyond Migdal-eder.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov Avinu pitched his tent near Migdal Eder after Rachel's death, symbolizing the completion of the twelve tribes with the birth of Binyamin. Esau's claim to be buried where Rachel was buried led Yaakov to choose a different burial place, but after their reconciliation, Esau renounced his claim. Migdal Eder is mentioned in various texts, but its exact location near Jerusalem is unknown. Rabbi Shimon emphasizes the importance of a good name over other crowns, highlighting the accessibility of Torah study to all. Micah 4:8 describes the restoration of the monarchy in Fair Jerusalem, symbolized by Migdal-eder near Bethlehem, indicating the return of kingship to the House of Israel. Yisrael continued his journey and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder, believed to be where the Messiah will be revealed in the future. 

|וַיְהִ֗י בִּשְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ רְאוּבֵ֗֔ן וַיִּשְׁכַּ֕ב֙ אֶת־בִּלְהָ֖ה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֑֔יו וַיִּשְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑͏ֽל וַיִּֽהְי֥וּ בְנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁנֵ֥ים עָשָֽׂר׃|22 J|While Israel stayed in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine; and Israel found out. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve in number.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Leah named her son Issachar as a reward for giving her maid-servant to Yaakov, showing her selflessness and desire for him to father more founding fathers of the Jewish people (Chasidut). Jacob did not disown Reuben for disturbing Bilhah's bed, and despite losing his status as firstborn, Reuben was still counted among Jacob's sons (Commentary). Certain Torah passages should be read but not translated in public, while in the time of Ezra, a translator was used during Torah readings to help people understand the text (Halakhah). The severity of punishments for transgressions not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, the importance of protecting vital elements, and Moses' expectations of the Jewish people's faith are discussed in Jewish Thought. Reuben's act of sleeping with Bilhah was seen as a major sin of treason and rebellion, contrasting with Judah's confession and repentance (Quoting Commentary). The Talmud clarifies that Reuben's act of rearranging Jacob's bed was actually a demonstration of righteousness, not sin, and it was not translated to avoid shaming Reuben, while the story of Tamar was translated (Talmud). Moses blessed Reuben for his survival despite his small population in Deuteronomy 33:6 (Tanakh). Reuben's actions near Bilhah caused distress to Jacob, but the Spirit of Holiness reassured Jacob that all his sons were righteous (Targum). Specific scriptural passages are publicly read and translated during public readings, including the incident of Reuben and Bilhah, while the account of David and Bathsheba is neither read nor translated (Tosefta). 

|בְּנֵ֣י לֵאָ֔ה בְּכ֥וֹר יַעֲקֹ֖ב רְאוּבֵ֑ן וְשִׁמְעוֹן֙ וְלֵוִ֣י וִֽיהוּדָ֔ה וְיִשָּׂשכָ֖ר וּזְבֻלֽוּן׃|23 P|The sons of Leah: Reuben—Jacob’s first-born—Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reuben repented for his sin with Bilhah and retained his status as firstborn in genealogy and Divine Service, although he lost material benefits. Various commentaries discuss Reuben's primacy within the family and his offerings in relation to his repentance and restoration among his brothers. In Genesis 35:23, Reuben is listed first among Jacob's sons, emphasizing his status as the firstborn despite his sin. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan list Reuben, Shimon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun as the sons of Leah. 

|בְּנֵ֣י רָחֵ֔ל יוֹסֵ֖ף וּבִנְיָמִֽן׃|24 P|The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin, as stated in both the Targum and a commentary on Genesis 35:24. The Midrash mentions seven barren women from the Bible, including Sarah, Rivka, Rachel, Leah, Manoach's wife, Chana, and Zion, who is described as a barren woman who will become a happy mother of children. 

|וּבְנֵ֤י בִלְהָה֙ שִׁפְחַ֣ת רָחֵ֔ל דָּ֖ן וְנַפְתָּלִֽי׃|25 P|The sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maid: Dan and Naphtali.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sons of Bilha, Rachel's maidservant, were Dan and Naftali, according to Steinsaltz on Genesis 35:25. Rachel is remembered by God as a symbol of His kindness and faithfulness to the house of Israel, as emphasized in Midrash. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 35:25 also list Dan and Naphtali as Rachel's sons. 

|וּבְנֵ֥י זִלְפָּ֛ה שִׁפְחַ֥ת לֵאָ֖ה גָּ֣ד וְאָשֵׁ֑ר אֵ֚לֶּה בְּנֵ֣י יַעֲקֹ֔ב אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֻלַּד־ל֖וֹ בְּפַדַּ֥ן אֲרָֽם׃|26 P|And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The majority of Jacob's sons were born in Paddan-aram, but Benjamin was born in Canaan. God remembered Rachel because of her importance in the lineage of the patriarchs. Ramban explains the difference between "Tabernacle" and "Tabernacle of the Testimony," while Ibn Ezra discusses poetic license in Isaiah 14:11. The Targum mentions that Gad and Asher were born to Jacob in Padan Aram. 

|וַיָּבֹ֤א יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל־יִצְחָ֣ק אָבִ֔יו מַמְרֵ֖א קִרְיַ֣ת הָֽאַרְבַּ֑ע הִ֣וא חֶבְר֔וֹן אֲשֶׁר־גָּֽר־שָׁ֥ם אַבְרָהָ֖ם וְיִצְחָֽק׃|27 P|And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, at Kiriath-arba—now Hebron—where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary discusses the significance of Mamre and Kiryat Arba in Genesis 35:27, highlighting the importance of being buried where ancestors lived. The Midrash explains the significance of Beersheba and Eretz Yisrael. Rashi clarifies the 430 years in Exodus 12:40, grammatical rules in I Samuel 16:1, promise of Canaan in I Chronicles 16:19, and patriarchs as signs in Genesis 12:6. Ramban discusses the ladder vision and significance of locations in Genesis 28:17, while Chizkuni explains spiritual value in Genesis 23:17. The Talmud discusses Esau preventing Jacob's burial at the Cave of Machpelah, and Targum mentions Jacob visiting Isaac in Mamre at Kiryat Arba. 

|וַיִּֽהְי֖וּ יְמֵ֣י יִצְחָ֑ק מְאַ֥ת שָׁנָ֖ה וּשְׁמֹנִ֥ים שָׁנָֽה׃|28 P|Isaac was a hundred and eighty years old|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac lived to be 180 years old, with the Torah not mentioning "which he lived" possibly due to the lack of a wife until his binding on the altar, causing him to lose his eyesight. The delay in reporting Isaac's death was to show he lived to a ripe old age, with Esau returning to take part in his funeral, burying him near the cave of Machpelah. The Midrash discusses the importance of old age in achieving a high level of prayer, as exemplified by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and highlights the five ways in which each patriarch merited their sons. The Torah lists Jacob's years of life in reverse order compared to Abraham and Isaac, possibly to emphasize that his last 17 years were the most significant. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos confirm that Isaac lived for 180 years. 

|וַיִּגְוַ֨ע יִצְחָ֤ק וַיָּ֙מׇת֙ וַיֵּאָ֣סֶף אֶל־עַמָּ֔יו זָקֵ֖ן וּשְׂבַ֣ע יָמִ֑ים וַיִּקְבְּר֣וּ אֹת֔וֹ עֵשָׂ֥ו וְיַעֲקֹ֖ב בָּנָֽיו׃|29 P|when he breathed his last and died. He  was gathered to his kin  in ripe old age; and he was buried by his sons Esau and Jacob.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Avram's unwavering faith in God and the importance of his descendants in God's plan. Commentary highlights the non-chronological order of events in the Torah, while Midrash discusses the aftermath of Simeon and Levi's actions. Musar delves into the significance of honoring parents, and Quoting Commentary reflects on Yaakov's return to Canaan. Second Temple commentary discusses Isaac's unique status, and Talmud and Targum focus on Ishmael's repentance and Yitzchok's burial. 

## Genesis 36

|וְאֵ֛לֶּה תֹּלְד֥וֹת עֵשָׂ֖ו ה֥וּא אֱדֽוֹם׃|1 R|This is the line of Esau—that is, Edom.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that Esau is the father of Edom, Sforno suggests "these are the names of Esau's sons" refers to his grandchildren, Or HaChaim emphasizes Esau and Edom are interchangeable, Radak highlights the distinction between Esau's descendants in Canaan and Seir, Steinsaltz notes Esau was nicknamed Edom due to his red hair, and Chizkuni explains the introduction of Esau's descendants. In Kabbalah, Satan is Samael associated with the liver, the goat symbolizes carrying sins to an uninhabited land, and darkness is represented by red, green, and black. The Midrash discusses God's engagement in establishing nations and families, the power of the House of Joseph against Esau, and the strength of Joseph. The Edomites, descendants of Esau, have been plundered. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan identify Esau's descendants as Edom. 

|עֵשָׂ֛ו לָקַ֥ח אֶת־נָשָׁ֖יו מִבְּנ֣וֹת כְּנָ֑עַן אֶת־עָדָ֗ה בַּת־אֵילוֹן֙ הַֽחִתִּ֔י וְאֶת־אׇהֳלִֽיבָמָה֙ בַּת־עֲנָ֔ה בַּת־צִבְע֖וֹן הַֽחִוִּֽי׃|2 P|Esau took his wives from among the Canaanite women—Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of Anah daughter of Zibeon the Hivite  —|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In the commentary, Ramban identifies Adah as Basmath and Oholibamah as Judith, while Ibn Ezra discusses Oholibamah's lineage. Rashbam explains the name changes of Esau's wives, Sforno highlights Oholibamah's role in Esau's settlement, Radak notes the dual names of Esau's wives, and Chizkuni discusses the identities of Esau's wives and their children. In Kabbalah, apostates deny fundamental truths of Judaism, leading to severe consequences. In the Midrash, Esau's genealogy is discussed to expose mamzerim, and in Musar, the negative influence of Egypt and Esau's choice to settle in Seir are explored. The Talmud discusses the expertise of early settlers in planting crops, and the Targum mentions the lineage of Esau's wives. 

|וְאֶת־בָּשְׂמַ֥ת בַּת־יִשְׁמָעֵ֖אל אֲח֥וֹת נְבָיֽוֹת׃|3 P|and also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau's sins were forgiven when he married Basmat/Mahalat, Ishmael's daughter, in accordance with his parents' wishes to marry within the family. The name Mahalat signifies forgiveness, but Esau should have divorced his wives before marrying her, which added to his troubles. Esau's marriage to Basmat is mentioned in Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan as marrying Bosmas, Nebayoth's sister. 

|וַתֵּ֧לֶד עָדָ֛ה לְעֵשָׂ֖ו אֶת־אֱלִיפָ֑ז וּבָ֣שְׂמַ֔ת יָלְדָ֖ה אֶת־רְעוּאֵֽל׃|4 P|Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz; Basemath bore Reuel;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text mentions that Ada bore Elifaz, Esau's firstborn son, and Basmat bore Re'uel. The importance of making peace with others before seeking atonement from God is discussed, using examples from the story of Job and his companions. The concept of retribution against wicked nations, such as Egypt, Assyria, and Edom, with a focus on the punishment of Esau's descendants, is emphasized. The need for humility and mercy in seeking forgiveness and the consequences of failing to do so are highlighted. 

|וְאׇהֳלִֽיבָמָה֙ יָֽלְדָ֔ה אֶת־ וְאֶת־יַעְלָ֖ם וְאֶת־קֹ֑רַח אֵ֚לֶּה בְּנֵ֣י עֵשָׂ֔ו אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֻלְּדוּ־ל֖וֹ בְּאֶ֥רֶץ כְּנָֽעַן׃|5 P|and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. Those were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ada, possibly identical to Bosmas, was the daughter of the Hittite Eylon who burned incense to an idol, while Korach, considered illegitimate as he was fathered by Eliphaz, was among the sons of Oholibamah who bore Yeush, Ya’elam, and Korah to Esau in Canaan. Esau's genealogical records in Midrash reveal secrets, including identifying mamzerim among his descendants, with differing opinions on the number of mamzerim. Rashbam explains that the phrase "אלה תולדות" introduces the names of the grandsons of the individual, leading to a detailed account of the descendants of Noach, Esau, and Yaakov, culminating in Yaakov's grandchildren totaling 70 before their descent to Egypt. Targum mentions Oholivomoh bearing Yeush, Yalom, and Korach to Esau in Canaan. 

|וַיִּקַּ֣ח עֵשָׂ֡ו אֶת־נָ֠שָׁ֠יו וְאֶת־בָּנָ֣יו וְאֶת־בְּנֹתָיו֮ וְאֶת־כׇּל־נַפְשׁ֣וֹת בֵּיתוֹ֒ וְאֶת־מִקְנֵ֣הוּ וְאֶת־כׇּל־בְּהֶמְתּ֗וֹ וְאֵת֙ כׇּל־קִנְיָנ֔וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר רָכַ֖שׁ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ אֶל־אֶ֔רֶץ מִפְּנֵ֖י יַעֲקֹ֥ב אָחִֽיו׃|6 P|Esau took his wives, his sons and daughters, and all the members of his household, his cattle and all his livestock, and all the property that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and went to another land because of his brother Jacob.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the influence of a tzaddik on others spiritually, Esau's origins in the "left side" of emanations, and the eternal connection between the Jewish people and God. Commentary explains Esau's migration to Se'ir due to Jacob's inheritance in Canaan and the need for space. Midrash compares Israel to sheep and discusses the impact of one person's actions on the community. Musar highlights the implications of Esau's impurity and Isaac's sanctification. Quoting Commentary clarifies Jacob's actions and precedence over Esau, while Targum mentions Esau's move out of fear of Jacob. 

|כִּֽי־הָיָ֧ה רְכוּשָׁ֛ם רָ֖ב מִשֶּׁ֣בֶת יַחְדָּ֑ו וְלֹ֨א יָֽכְלָ֜ה אֶ֤רֶץ מְגֽוּרֵיהֶם֙ לָשֵׂ֣את אֹתָ֔ם מִפְּנֵ֖י מִקְנֵיהֶֽם׃|7 P|For their possessions were too many for them to dwell together, and the land where they sojourned could not support them because of their livestock.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau and Jacob's wealth of livestock in Hebron forced Esau to leave due to economic reasons and shame over selling his birthright, as the Torah implies the inadequacy of the specific city of Chevron. Jacob was protected by angels when leaving Israel and Esau's jealousy led him to depart. The Targum explains that their combined wealth became too much for them to live together in the land they were temporarily residing in. 

|וַיֵּ֤שֶׁב עֵשָׂו֙ בְּהַ֣ר שֵׂעִ֔יר עֵשָׂ֖ו ה֥וּא אֱדֽוֹם׃|8 P|So Esau settled in the hill country of Seir—Esau being Edom.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau settled in Seir, leading to his descendants being known as Edomites. The Israelites' acceptance of the Torah at Sinai distinguished them as the chosen people, despite God's fondness for other nations. Jacob settled in the Land of Israel through prayer, while Esau settled elsewhere voluntarily. Moses emphasized the brotherly connection between Edom and Israel to remind Edom of their shared ancestry and the prophecy of exile. Esau settled in Mount Se’ir, while Yaakov settled in the land promised to Abraham after Esau settled as an alien. 

|וְאֵ֛לֶּה תֹּלְד֥וֹת עֵשָׂ֖ו אֲבִ֣י אֱד֑וֹם בְּהַ֖ר שֵׂעִֽיר׃|9 P|This, then, is the line of Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites, in the hill country of Seir.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the generations of Esau, mentioning his children and grandchildren, including those born in Se'ir and Canaan. Joseph's role in Egypt was to transfer the pollution of the serpent from Jacob's descendants to their surroundings, thus purifying them, contrasting with Esau's descendants being labeled as bastards. The Targum specifies that Esau was the prince of the Edomites and lived in the mountain of Gabal. 

|אֵ֖לֶּה שְׁמ֣וֹת בְּנֵֽי־עֵשָׂ֑ו אֱלִיפַ֗ז בֶּן־עָדָה֙ אֵ֣שֶׁת עֵשָׂ֔ו רְעוּאֵ֕ל בֶּן־בָּשְׂמַ֖ת אֵ֥שֶׁת עֵשָֽׂו׃|10 P|These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Esau’s wife Adah; Reuel, the son of Esau’s wife Basemath.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah lists Esau's sons and grandsons, with a focus on the Alufim, men of authority, born in Canaan and Se'ir. Oholvamah's grandchildren are not mentioned, and Esau's sons were born to different wives. The Midrash discusses Joseph's statement about being sent to Egypt by God, citing various verses to emphasize legal judgments and specific events. The Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan list Esau's sons as Eliphaz and Reuel. 

|וַיִּהְי֖וּ בְּנֵ֣י אֱלִיפָ֑ז תֵּימָ֣ן אוֹמָ֔ר צְפ֥וֹ וְגַעְתָּ֖ם וּקְנַֽז׃|11 P|The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Tzefo, Gatam, and Kenaz. Ibn Ezra interprets references to Seir and Paran in Deuteronomy as God's glory in Israel, Rabbeinu Bahya discusses Joseph's military escort for Jacob's burial, and Radak notes a spelling discrepancy in Eliphaz's son Zephi/Zepho. In Tractate Soferim 5:11, it is mentioned that certain names, including Yisra’el, Ga’tham, Poṭifar, and Nebukadneẓẓar, should not be broken up. The Targum lists the sons of Eliphaz as Teiman, Omar, Tzepho, Gatam, Kenaz, and Timna. 

|וְתִמְנַ֣ע ׀ הָיְתָ֣ה פִילֶ֗גֶשׁ לֶֽאֱלִיפַז֙ בֶּן־עֵשָׂ֔ו וַתֵּ֥לֶד לֶאֱלִיפַ֖ז אֶת־עֲמָלֵ֑ק אֵ֕לֶּה בְּנֵ֥י עָדָ֖ה אֵ֥שֶׁת עֵשָֽׂו׃|12 P|Timna was a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz; she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. Those were the descendants of Esau’s wife Adah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the Torah contains hidden meanings beyond the peshat level, with Itzchak symbolizing Gevurah successfully bringing judgments to their source. Commentary reveals that Timna, a concubine of Eliphaz, bore Amalek, not considered a true descendant of Esau, leading to the command to blot out Amalek. Halakhah emphasizes the importance of patience and wisdom in guiding converts, citing examples of outstanding batei din. Jewish Thought discusses repentance beginning where the sin occurred, symbolized by Adam and Eve's realization and atonement with fig leaves. Kabbalah explains the battle against Amalek and its connection to the Name HaShem. Midrash reveals the genealogy of Esau's sons, including Elephaz's incestuous relations with Timna. Musar highlights the significance of studying every part of the Torah, even seemingly insignificant details. Quoting Commentary provides various interpretations of the story of Timna as a concubine. Second Temple discusses how the wicked adopt doctrines as concubines, using Timna bearing Amalek as an example. Talmud emphasizes the significance of every detail in the Torah, as questioned by Manasseh. Targum mentions Timna as a concubine of Eliphaz who bore Amalek. 

|וְאֵ֙לֶּה֙ בְּנֵ֣י רְעוּאֵ֔ל נַ֥חַת וָזֶ֖רַח שַׁמָּ֣ה וּמִזָּ֑ה אֵ֣לֶּה הָי֔וּ בְּנֵ֥י בָשְׂמַ֖ת אֵ֥שֶׁת עֵשָֽׂו׃|13 P|And these were the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. Those were the descendants of Esau’s wife Basemath.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text mentions the sons of Re'uel: Nahat, Zerah, Shama, and Mitza, born to Basmat, the wife of Esau. The Midrash discusses interpretations of the phrase "leaping upon the heights" in relation to the redemption of Israel. The Targum lists the sons of Re'uel as Nachas, Zerach, Shamoh, and Mizzoh, sons of Bosmas or Basemath, the wife of Esau. 

|וְאֵ֣לֶּה הָי֗וּ בְּנֵ֨י אׇהֳלִיבָמָ֧ה בַת־עֲנָ֛ה בַּת־צִבְע֖וֹן אֵ֣שֶׁת עֵשָׂ֑ו וַתֵּ֣לֶד לְעֵשָׂ֔ו אֶת־ וְאֶת־יַעְלָ֖ם וְאֶת־קֹֽרַח׃|14 P|And these were the sons of Esau’s wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah daughter of Zibeon: she bore to Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Oholivama, daughter of Ana and Tzivon, was Esau's wife from Se'ir and bore him three sons. The Midrash discusses the degeneracy of Seir's descendants, while Musar questions the accuracy of certain claims in the Torah. The Targum provides variations in the names of Oholivama's sons. 

|אֵ֖לֶּה אַלּוּפֵ֣י בְנֵֽי־עֵשָׂ֑ו בְּנֵ֤י אֱלִיפַז֙ בְּכ֣וֹר עֵשָׂ֔ו אַלּ֤וּף תֵּימָן֙ אַלּ֣וּף אוֹמָ֔ר אַלּ֥וּף צְפ֖וֹ אַלּ֥וּף קְנַֽז׃|15 P|These are the clans of the sons of Esau. The descendants of Esau’s first-born Eliphaz: the clans Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Alufim mentioned in Genesis 36 were leaders of families, not creators, maintaining their status even after the kingdom of Edom was established. In various Midrash texts, Jacob is reassured by God that Joseph will rise against Esau's lords, Rebecca's descendants are linked to chieftains, and the prince of Asher confirms judgment through offerings. The connection between Tzefo, the first king of Poland, and the sin of Adam and Chava is discussed in Musar, highlighting the blemish caused by Adam's sin on the twenty-two letters of the Torah. The Targum lists the chiefs of the sons of Esau as Teiman, Omar, Tzepho, and Kenaz. 

|אַלּֽוּף־קֹ֛רַח אַלּ֥וּף גַּעְתָּ֖ם אַלּ֣וּף עֲמָלֵ֑ק אֵ֣לֶּה אַלּוּפֵ֤י אֱלִיפַז֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ אֱד֔וֹם אֵ֖לֶּה בְּנֵ֥י עָדָֽה׃|16 P|Korah, Gatam, and Amalek; these are the clans of Eliphaz in the land of Edom. Those are the descendants of Adah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Korach and Amalek are mentioned as chieftains in the land of Edom, with some suggesting there were multiple individuals named Korach and Amalek due to their status as chieftains. Esau's genealogical records were listed to expose mamzerim, with Koraḥ considered a mamzer because he was the illegitimate child of Esau's wife Oholivama and his son Elifaz. The Targum states that Korach, Gatam, and Amaleik were chiefs of Eliphaz in Edom. 

|וְאֵ֗לֶּה בְּנֵ֤י רְעוּאֵל֙ בֶּן־עֵשָׂ֔ו אַלּ֥וּף נַ֙חַת֙ אַלּ֣וּף זֶ֔רַח אַלּ֥וּף שַׁמָּ֖ה אַלּ֣וּף מִזָּ֑ה אֵ֣לֶּה אַלּוּפֵ֤י רְעוּאֵל֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ אֱד֔וֹם אֵ֕לֶּה בְּנֵ֥י בָשְׂמַ֖ת אֵ֥שֶׁת עֵשָֽׂו׃|17 P|And these are the descendants of Esau’s son Reuel: the clans Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah; these are the clans of Reuel in the land of Edom. Those are the descendants of Esau’s wife Basemath.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Re'uel, son of Esau, had four chieftains in Edom: Nahat, Zerah, Shama, and Mitza, who were born to Basmat, Esau's wife. 

|וְאֵ֗לֶּה בְּנֵ֤י אׇהֳלִֽיבָמָה֙ אֵ֣שֶׁת עֵשָׂ֔ו אַלּ֥וּף יְע֛וּשׁ אַלּ֥וּף יַעְלָ֖ם אַלּ֣וּף קֹ֑רַח אֵ֣לֶּה אַלּוּפֵ֞י אׇהֳלִֽיבָמָ֛ה בַּת־עֲנָ֖ה אֵ֥שֶׁת עֵשָֽׂו׃|18 P|And these are the descendants of Esau’s wife Oholibamah: the clans Jeush, Jalam, and Korah; these are the clans of Esau’s wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse lists the sons of Oholivama, Esau's wife, including the chieftains of Yeush, Ya'elam, and Korah, all of whom were descendants of Ana. The Targum translations provide the same information, listing the sons as Chief Ye'ush, Chief Yalom, and Chief Korach, with slight variations in the names. 

|אֵ֧לֶּה בְנֵי־עֵשָׂ֛ו וְאֵ֥לֶּה אַלּוּפֵיהֶ֖ם ה֥וּא אֱדֽוֹם׃|19 P|Those were the sons of Esau—that is, Edom—and those are their clans.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Midrash lists the sons of Jacob and Esau, as well as the descendants of Seir the Horite. It also mentions Timna becoming a concubine to Eliphaz and bearing Amalek, as well as an event involving animals with human-like lower halves and bear or ape-like upper halves. The Commentary discusses the chiefs that came to Esau, explaining they were chieftains who later attained sovereignty but were not formally crowned as kings. The Targum identifies the sons of Esau as the father of the Edomites. 

|אֵ֤לֶּה בְנֵֽי־שֵׂעִיר֙ הַחֹרִ֔י יֹשְׁבֵ֖י הָאָ֑רֶץ לוֹטָ֥ן וְשׁוֹבָ֖ל וְצִבְע֥וֹן וַעֲנָֽה׃|20 P|These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were settled in the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Se'ir Hachori was the father of an ancient nation distinct from Esau's lineage, with the Torah listing his sons to show Esau's conquest of them. The Horite nobles were associated with white color symbolizing nobility, while the Midrash discusses the degeneracy of Seir's descendants. The defeat of the Chori took place on a mountain where they lived, with Rashi emphasizing the importance of studying the Torah. The Talmud explains that early generations established parameters for planting based on tradition, with the Horites being experts in determining suitable crops. The descendants of Seir were Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan according to I Chronicles 1:37-38. 

|וְדִשׁ֥וֹן וְאֵ֖צֶר וְדִישָׁ֑ן אֵ֣לֶּה אַלּוּפֵ֧י הַחֹרִ֛י בְּנֵ֥י שֵׂעִ֖יר בְּאֶ֥רֶץ אֱדֽוֹם׃|21 P|Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. Those are the clans of the Horites, the descendants of Seir, in the land of Edom.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The chieftains of the Horites in the land of Edom may have been actual Horite chieftains or Edomite chieftains who adopted the title. The Midrash Tanchuma discusses instances of incest within the descendants of Seir, emphasizing the immoral nature of their lineage. Rabbeinu Bahya explains that the first city of refuge was in Reuven as a reward for attempting to save Joseph's life, while Radak clarifies the difference between Dishon and Dishan. The Targum states that Dishon, Eitzer, and Dishan were chiefs of the Horites in Edom and chieftains of the sons of Gebal living in the land of the Edomites. 

|וַיִּהְי֥וּ בְנֵי־לוֹטָ֖ן חֹרִ֣י וְהֵימָ֑ם וַאֲח֥וֹת לוֹטָ֖ן תִּמְנָֽע׃|22 P|The sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister was Timna.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Timna, mentioned in Genesis 36:22, was the concubine of Elifaz, son of Esau, and the mother of Amalek. The Torah mentions Timna as Lotan's sister to emphasize her connection to Eliphaz and the desire to marry into Abraham's family. The Talmud and Jewish Thought emphasize the importance of all verses in the Torah, even seemingly trivial details like genealogies and lists of kings. Kabbalah delves into the deeper secrets of the Torah, discussing the blemish caused by Amalek and the need to repair it through Torah recitation and adherence to HaShem's voice. The Midrash explores Timna's desire to convert and the eventual birth of Amalek as punishment for rejecting her. 

|וְאֵ֙לֶּה֙ בְּנֵ֣י שׁוֹבָ֔ל עַלְוָ֥ן וּמָנַ֖חַת וְעֵיבָ֑ל שְׁפ֖וֹ וְאוֹנָֽם׃|23 P|The sons of Shobal were these: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Shoval's descendants are listed as Alvan, Manahat, Eval, Shepho, and Onam in Genesis 36:23, with a discrepancy in the spelling of Alvan noted by Radak. Targum Jonathan on Genesis 36:23 also lists the sons of Shobal as Alvan, Manachoth, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 

|וְאֵ֥לֶּה בְנֵֽי־צִבְע֖וֹן וְאַיָּ֣ה וַעֲנָ֑ה ה֣וּא עֲנָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר מָצָ֤א אֶת־הַיֵּמִם֙ בַּמִּדְבָּ֔ר בִּרְעֹת֥וֹ אֶת־הַחֲמֹרִ֖ים לְצִבְע֥וֹן אָבִֽיו׃|24 P|The sons of Zibeon were these: Aiah  and Anah—that was the Anah who discovered the hot springs  in the wilderness while pasturing the asses of his father Zibeon.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The descendants of Zibeon, particularly his son Anah, are credited with discovering mules through crossbreeding horses and donkeys, with interpretations suggesting bravery or innovation in the face of attackers. Anah's actions are seen as transgressive or innovative, leading to his distinction in the text, with various commentators discussing the linguistic feature of the redundant letter "vav" in the names of Zibeon's children. The Midrash Tanchuma and Bereshit Rabbah discuss incestuous relations among the descendants of Seir, with Anah having relations with his daughter-in-law. The text from Kav HaYashar, Zohar, and Shenei Luchot HaBerit discuss the creation of mules and destructive spirits, cautioning against certain practices. The Talmud debates the origins of mules, the creation of hell and fire, and the danger of white mules, while the Tanakh and Targum mention the descendants and actions of Zibeon and Anah. 

|וְאֵ֥לֶּה בְנֵֽי־עֲנָ֖ה דִּשֹׁ֑ן וְאׇהֳלִיבָמָ֖ה בַּת־עֲנָֽה׃|25 P|The children of Anah were these: Dishon and Anah’s daughter Oholibamah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Anah, son of Se'ir the Horite, had a daughter named Oholibamah. Interpretations differ on Anah's lineage, with some suggesting he was also the son of Zibeon through incest. Ibn Ezra clarifies Oholibamah was Zibeon's granddaughter, Tur HaArokh states she was the daughter of the Anah who discovered mules, not Se'ir's son. Rashi proposes Anah had Oholibamah through incest with Zibeon's wife. Chizkuni believes Anah and his daughter are the same person. The Targum mentions Anoh's children were Dishon and Oholivomoh, with Targum Jonathan specifying the daughter's name as Ahalibama. 

|וְאֵ֖לֶּה בְּנֵ֣י דִישָׁ֑ן חֶמְדָּ֥ן וְאֶשְׁבָּ֖ן וְיִתְרָ֥ן וּכְרָֽן׃|26 P|The sons of Dishon  were these: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Dishan and Dishon are the same person, differentiated by spelling to avoid confusion with other similar names (Kings 1:7:40, Genesis 36:26). Confession of sins is necessary for atonement, with communal recitation during synagogue rituals and individual confession before fasting (Halakhah). Judah is likened to a lion's whelp in Midrash Tanchuma, Vayechi 10:9. Radak clarifies the difference between Dishon and Dishan, while Targum lists the sons of Dishon as Chemdan, Eshban, Yisran, and Keran (I Chronicles 1:41, Onkelos Genesis 36:26, Targum Jonathan Genesis 36:26). 

|אֵ֖לֶּה בְּנֵי־אֵ֑צֶר בִּלְהָ֥ן וְזַעֲוָ֖ן וַעֲקָֽן׃|27 P|The sons of Ezer were these: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse from Genesis suggests enduring afflictions in this world for enduring riches in the Hereafter. The names of the sons of Ezer are Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. Radak notes a discrepancy in the spelling of Zaavan and Jaakan in I Chronicles 1:42:1 compared to Genesis 36:27. Yehudah's motivation for suggesting to sell Joseph is unclear, with potential reasons being to spare Joseph's life or for material gain. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the sons of Eitzer as Bilhan, Za'avan, and Akan in Genesis 36:27. 

|אֵ֥לֶּה בְנֵֽי־דִישָׁ֖ן ע֥וּץ וַאֲרָֽן׃|28 P|And the sons of Dishan were these: Uz and Aran.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The children of Dishan are Utz and Aran, with uncertainty about whether the land of Utz belonged to the Arameans or Edomites. Radak explains that the distinction between Dishon and Dishan was not considered important, as Ezra uses the name "Dishon" for both in Chronicles 1:41:1. Targum Onkelos names them as Utz and Aran, while Targum Jonathan names them as Hutz and Aram. 

|אֵ֖לֶּה אַלּוּפֵ֣י הַחֹרִ֑י אַלּ֤וּף לוֹטָן֙ אַלּ֣וּף שׁוֹבָ֔ל אַלּ֥וּף צִבְע֖וֹן אַלּ֥וּף עֲנָֽה׃|29 P|These are the clans of the Horites: the clans Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse lists the chieftains of the Horites, including Lotan, Shoval, Tzivon, and Ana. Timna, a princess who desired to convert to Judaism, became the concubine of Eliphaz, son of Esau, and bore Amalek, demonstrating the praiseworthiness of the household of Abraham. Despite being the sister of Lotan, Timna is not listed among his children because she shared a mother with him, not a father. The Talmud emphasizes the significance of the phrase "And Lotan’s sister was Timna" by highlighting Timna's royal lineage. The Targum translations of Genesis 36:29 also list the chiefs of the Horites as Rabba Lotan, Rabba Shobal, Rabba Sebeon, and Rabba Anah. 

|אַלּ֥וּף דִּשֹׁ֛ן אַלּ֥וּף אֵ֖צֶר אַלּ֣וּף דִּישָׁ֑ן אֵ֣לֶּה אַלּוּפֵ֧י הַחֹרִ֛י לְאַלֻּפֵיהֶ֖ם בְּאֶ֥רֶץ שֵׂעִֽיר׃|30 P|Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. Those are the clans of the Horites, clan by clan, in the land of Seir.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse in Genesis 36:30 lists the chieftains of the Horites in the land of Se'ir, including Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. The Targum clarifies that these chiefs were leaders of the Chorites who lived in the Land of Se'ir, also known as Gabla. 

|וְאֵ֙לֶּה֙ הַמְּלָכִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר מָלְכ֖וּ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ אֱד֑וֹם לִפְנֵ֥י מְלׇךְ־מֶ֖לֶךְ לִבְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|31 J|These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the distinction between Israel and the nations, focusing on Yaakov and Eisav, fallen sparks, and overcoming negative forces. Commentary contrasts Edomite and Israelite kings, hinting at ultimate redemption. Jewish Thought explores the fate of Edomites and foreign kings, while Kabbalah delves into the destruction of Edomite kings and the repair of Chaos. Midrash highlights Israel's redemption through forefathers, while Musar discusses the Romans' perception of Israel's decline. Quoting Commentary explains priestly garments' atonement and interprets Israel as the Shechinah. Targum lists the kings of Edom before Israel's kings. 

|וַיִּמְלֹ֣ךְ בֶּאֱד֔וֹם בֶּ֖לַע בֶּן־בְּע֑וֹר וְשֵׁ֥ם עִיר֖וֹ דִּנְהָֽבָה׃|32 J|Bela son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra distinguishes Bela from Balaam and Jobab from Job, emphasizing that the kings mentioned did not inherit their thrones dynastically. The Midrash discusses the selection of important figures in Israel, highlighting the significance of Torah study and action. Rashi illustrates the rewards of studying the Torah through the example of Timna's desire to be connected to Abraham's descendants. Targum sources identify Bela son of Beor as ruling in Edom, with different spellings for his city. 

|וַיָּ֖מׇת בָּ֑לַע וַיִּמְלֹ֣ךְ תַּחְתָּ֔יו יוֹבָ֥ב בֶּן־זֶ֖רַח מִבׇּצְרָֽה׃|33 J|When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah, from Bozrah, succeeded him as king.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

After Bela's death, Yovav from Bozrah became the new king of Edom, as explained by Rashi and supported by Genesis Rabbah 83:3 and Isaiah 34:6. Rabbi Abahu elaborates on the significance of offerings from Asher, Pagiel, and Israel, symbolizing redemption, acceptance of the Torah, and greatness bestowed upon Israel for receiving the Torah. Bozrah's role in providing kings for Edom is highlighted, leading to its punishment and desolation according to the Rabbis. The Targum also confirms Yovav's succession to the throne after Bela's death. 

|וַיָּ֖מׇת יוֹבָ֑ב וַיִּמְלֹ֣ךְ תַּחְתָּ֔יו חֻשָׁ֖ם מֵאֶ֥רֶץ הַתֵּימָנִֽי׃|34 J|When Jobab died, Husham of the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yovav was succeeded by Husham of the Temanites, as mentioned in the Midrash Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael and Bamidbar Rabbah commentaries, which also discuss the reactions of the people to the events surrounding Pharaoh and Israel, as well as the significance of the offerings made by the princes of Asher and Dan. In the Targum, it is simply stated that Chusham became king of the Teimanites after Yovav's death. 

|וַיָּ֖מׇת חֻשָׁ֑ם וַיִּמְלֹ֨ךְ תַּחְתָּ֜יו הֲדַ֣ד בֶּן־בְּדַ֗ד הַמַּכֶּ֤ה אֶת־מִדְיָן֙ בִּשְׂדֵ֣ה מוֹאָ֔ב וְשֵׁ֥ם עִיר֖וֹ עֲוִֽית׃|35 J|When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated the Midianites in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king; the name of his city was Avith.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Hadad defeated the Midianites, leading to his reign in Avit; Moab and Midian united against Israel during Balaam's time; Hadad's name changes to reflect his kingship. Moab and Midian formed an alliance against Israel due to fear of Moses' power in prayer; Balak, a former prince of Midian, became king of Moab, leading the alliance. Chusham died, Hadad succeeded him as king, defeating the Midianites in Moab, establishing Avith as his capital. 

|וַיָּ֖מׇת הֲדָ֑ד וַיִּמְלֹ֣ךְ תַּחְתָּ֔יו שַׂמְלָ֖ה מִמַּשְׂרֵקָֽה׃|36 J|When Hadad died, Samlah of Masrekah succeeded him as king.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

After Hadad died, Samla of Masreka became the new ruler of Edom. The kings of Edom were appointed from various locations, similar to how idolaters are made from materials gathered from different places. In contrast, Israel will eventually judge and destroy Edom, as indicated in the verse "saviors will ascend Mount Zion [to judge the mountain of Esau]." 

|וַיָּ֖מׇת שַׂמְלָ֑ה וַיִּמְלֹ֣ךְ תַּחְתָּ֔יו שָׁא֖וּל מֵרְחֹב֥וֹת הַנָּהָֽר׃|37 J|When Samlah died, Saul  of Rehoboth-on-the-river succeeded him as king.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, daat unites chochmah and binah by radiating from keter, extending into the lower sefirot through daat tachton. In Halakhah, corrupted choice can darken the light of wisdom, symbolized by "broad spaces by the river," but cannot destroy Israel's natural excellence. Kabbalah discusses the connection between Understanding-Binah and Kingship-Malchut, with Understanding-Binah providing blessings to Kingship-Malchut. In Midrash, idolaters are likened to a ship, similar to kings appointed from different locations in Edom before Israel. Targum mentions that Samlah died and was succeeded by Sha'ul from Rechovos-by-the-river according to Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. 

|וַיָּ֖מׇת שָׁא֑וּל וַיִּמְלֹ֣ךְ תַּחְתָּ֔יו בַּ֥עַל חָנָ֖ן בֶּן־עַכְבּֽוֹר׃|38 J|When Saul died, Baal-hanan son of Achbor succeeded him as king.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Baal Hanan son of Akhbor succeeded Sha-ul as king after his death, ruling over the city of Chanan with no other cities mentioned in connection with him (Targum). 

|וַיָּ֘מׇת֮ בַּ֣עַל חָנָ֣ן בֶּן־עַכְבּוֹר֒ וַיִּמְלֹ֤ךְ תַּחְתָּיו֙ הֲדַ֔ר וְשֵׁ֥ם עִיר֖וֹ פָּ֑עוּ וְשֵׁ֨ם אִשְׁתּ֤וֹ מְהֵֽיטַבְאֵל֙ בַּת־מַטְרֵ֔ד בַּ֖ת מֵ֥י זָהָֽב׃|39 J|And when Baal-hanan son of Achbor died, Hadar succeeded him as king; the name of his city was Pau, and his wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred daughter of Me-zahab.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra suggests Mehetabel listed two fathers could refer to her mother and father, while Me-Zahab may be a goldsmith or a proper name. Radak questions the mention of Hadar's wife and her father's name. Rabbeinu Bahya sees Hadar and his wife's names as reflecting character traits, Rashi views Me-Zahab's name as indicating great wealth, and Steinsaltz notes Me-Zahab's wealth may have stabilized Hadar's reign. Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai derived 300 legal decisions from Bereshit 36:39, showing the depth of wisdom in the Torah. Midrash discusses Hadar's rule, with Elijah warning a Roman ruler in a dream to replenish his father's treasures. The Arizal explains the killing of the Canaanite nations, while the defeat of their kings symbolizes the union between Israel and its land. Rashbam, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rambam, and Radak offer interpretations of different aspects of the text. Targum describes Hadar's succession to the throne of Pa'u, his wife Meheitaveil, and his focus on material wealth. 

|וְ֠אֵ֠לֶּה שְׁמ֞וֹת אַלּוּפֵ֤י עֵשָׂו֙ לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתָ֔ם לִמְקֹמֹתָ֖ם בִּשְׁמֹתָ֑ם אַלּ֥וּף תִּמְנָ֛ע אַלּ֥וּף עַֽלְוָ֖ה אַלּ֥וּף יְתֵֽת׃|40 J|These are the names of the clans of Esau, each with its families and locality, name by name: the clans Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that wicked individuals who speak arrogantly of tzaddikim receive their ruach from a RaV of the kelipah, corresponding to Esav who is described as having much and being the RaV of the husks. The Midrash discusses Menasseh b. Hezekiah's fault-finding lectures, Thimna's role in the birth of Amalek, and the symbolism of offerings. Rabbeinu Bahya and Ramban explain the ongoing war against Amalek and his lineage, while Ibn Ezra suggests that Timna bore Amalek. The Talmud highlights Manasseh's mockery of verses and Targum lists the chiefs of Esau as Chief Timna, Chief Alvoh, and Chief Yeseis. 

|אַלּ֧וּף אׇהֳלִיבָמָ֛ה אַלּ֥וּף אֵלָ֖ה אַלּ֥וּף פִּינֹֽן׃|41 J|Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Oholivamah is a male mentioned in Genesis 36, despite having a typically female name ending in ה. It is suggested that the tribe or its chieftain was named after Esau's wife Oholivama. The Targum translations differ in the names of the chiefs mentioned in the same chapter, with Onkelos using Chief Oholivomoh, Chief Eilah, Chief Pinon, while Targum Jonathan refers to them as Rabba Aholibama, Rabba Elah, and Rabba Phinon. 

|אַלּ֥וּף קְנַ֛ז אַלּ֥וּף תֵּימָ֖ן אַלּ֥וּף מִבְצָֽר׃|42 J|Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Steinsaltz emphasizes the significance of the chieftains mentioned in Genesis 36:42 within Esau's genealogy. In Targum Jonathan, Onkelos translates Chief Kenaz, Chief Teimon, Chief Mivtzar as Rabba Kenaz, Rabba Teman, Rabba Mibzar. 

|אַלּ֥וּף מַגְדִּיאֵ֖ל אַלּ֣וּף עִירָ֑ם אֵ֣לֶּה ׀ אַלּוּפֵ֣י אֱד֗וֹם לְמֹֽשְׁבֹתָם֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ אֲחֻזָּתָ֔ם ה֥וּא עֵשָׂ֖ו אֲבִ֥י אֱדֽוֹם׃|43 J|Magdiel, and Iram. Those are the clans of Edom—that is, of Esau, father of the Edomites—by their settlements in the land which they hold.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teaches that speaking slander can be elevated by studying Torah with the twenty-two letters, with the letter aleph being closest to G-d. Ramban, Gur Aryeh, and Rashi identify Magdiel as representing Rome, with Gur Aryeh adding that Rome will be humbled by Hashem. The Book of Concealment is described as a balanced book, referencing the kings of Edom. Jacob receives a vision from God at Mount Moriah and later meets Laban in Haran. Yitzhak is portrayed as a stabilizing force in Genesis, while Rivka emerges as a dynamic figure bridging dreams and reality. The Gemara discusses individuals who remain wicked from beginning to end, such as Ahasuerus and Esau. The verse in Tanakh lists the kings of Edom before any king reigned over Israel, mentioning Bela son of Beor. The chiefs of Edom, Magdiel and Iram, were known for their strong cities and were descendants of Esau.
