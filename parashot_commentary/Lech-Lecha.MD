## Genesis 12

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־אַבְרָ֔ם לֶךְ־לְךָ֛ מֵאַרְצְךָ֥ וּמִמּֽוֹלַדְתְּךָ֖ וּמִבֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑יךָ אֶל־הָאָ֖רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר אַרְאֶֽךָּ׃|1 J|יהוה said to Abram, “Go forth from your native land and from your father’s house to the land that I will show you. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avram's decision to move to Egypt with Sarai was based on a vague instruction from God to go to the land that would be shown to him, indicating he should move to any suitable destination to break negative traits and raise his soul's level. Avraham Avinu's wisdom led him to seek deeper truths, separate from negative influences, and continually seek new paths, symbolizing a return to one's roots, unity, and the ultimate redemption. The Mishneh Torah discusses idol worship during Enosh's time, exempting Abraham from honoring his parents to settle in the Holy Land, emphasizing direct divine beneficence in the Land of Israel. David defends his lineage, expressing gratitude for being accepted into the congregation despite his Moavite ancestry, fulfilling the messianic prophecy. Abraham was tested with ten trials, demonstrating his great love and faithfulness. The Talmud discusses how a change of residence can cancel an evil judgment and details the ten trials Abraham faced, leading to miracles for his descendants during the Exodus from Egypt. In Genesis 22:2, God instructs Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, ultimately providing a ram for the sacrifice instead. Adonoy instructs Avram to leave his land, birthplace, and father's house to go to a land that will be shown to him. 

|וְאֶֽעֶשְׂךָ֙ לְג֣וֹי גָּד֔וֹל וַאֲבָ֣רֶכְךָ֔ וַאֲגַדְּלָ֖ה שְׁמֶ֑ךָ וֶהְיֵ֖ה בְּרָכָֽה׃|2 J|I will make of you a great nation, And I will bless you; I will make your name great, And you shall be a blessing.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how Abraham's attributes of love, power, and harmony are employed by God in His relations with the universe, with love being the primary attribute personified by Avraham. Abraham is promised by God to become the founding father of a great nation, despite his wife's barrenness, and to be a source of blessings for all nations. Judaism is inseparable from Jewish peoplehood, with philosophers debating God's foreknowledge and power in relation to events in Jewish history. The patriarchs were seen as sources of blessings, with Abraham being the first to receive this gift from God, passing it on to Isaac, who then passed it on to Jacob. The fourth gift given to Abraham is a great name, which is important for both reputation and reality. Israel will be a blessing alongside Egypt and Assyria on earth, but will also become a curse to all kingdoms as a result of their actions. God promises Abraham that he will become a great nation, be blessed, have a great name, and be a blessing to others. 

|וַאֲבָֽרְכָה֙ מְבָ֣רְכֶ֔יךָ וּמְקַלֶּלְךָ֖ אָאֹ֑ר וְנִבְרְכ֣וּ בְךָ֔ כֹּ֖ל מִשְׁפְּחֹ֥ת הָאֲדָמָֽה׃|3 J|I will bless those who bless you And curse the one who curses you; And all the families of the earth Shall bless themselves by you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of good intentions in noble deeds, as seen in Avraham's blessings and the impact of curses being neutralized by blessings. Halakhah discusses the violation of three positive commandments by neglecting to recite the priestly blessing, leading to a lack of blessings for the priest. Jewish Thought highlights Avraham's role as a model for the Jewish people and the authority to bestow blessings. Kabbalah emphasizes the flow of blessings through the Jewish people and the interconnectedness of blessings. Midrash discusses the hatred of God towards those who curse others, while Musar elaborates on the distribution of blessings through the Temple. Quoting Commentary emphasizes the promise of blessings and curses through Avraham. Responsa states that neglecting blessings implies a lack of caring for the blessing of God. Second Temple highlights the blessings bestowed upon the wise through Avraham's actions. Talmud discusses the Priestly Benediction and the blessings for those who bless the Jewish people. Tanakh emphasizes Israel's holiness and the consequences for harming them. Targum reiterates the promise of blessings and curses through Avraham's righteousness. 

|וַיֵּ֣לֶךְ אַבְרָ֗ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבֶּ֤ר אֵלָיו֙ יְהֹוָ֔ה וַיֵּ֥לֶךְ אִתּ֖וֹ ל֑וֹט וְאַבְרָ֗ם בֶּן־חָמֵ֤שׁ שָׁנִים֙ וְשִׁבְעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה בְּצֵאת֖וֹ מֵחָרָֽן׃|4 J P|Abram went forth as יהוה had commanded him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avram served God out of awe before leaving Charan, but upon reaching holy soil, he was able to serve out of love, receiving promises from God that he would be blessed and his name great. Despite these assurances, Avram's decision to follow God's instructions without expecting the rewards demonstrated a greater ethical achievement than serving altruistically with the promise of a reward, as seen in his journey to a new land being considered one of his "ten trials." Abraham immediately obeyed God's command to leave his home and journey to Canaan without questioning or hesitation, demonstrating his unwavering faith in God's promises, leaving behind his father and departing from Charan twice. The Torah emphasizes that Abraham's departure was solely based on God's command, not on the promises of rewards that God had made to him. The importance of submitting to divine will during difficult times is highlighted in various texts, praising Abraham's fear of the Lord and his obedience to divine commands. The Torah's reporting of events does not always follow chronological order, as seen with the covenant between the pieces in Genesis 15 occurring when Abraham was seventy years old, despite being mentioned later. Abraham's departure from Haran is seen as a rejection of his father's ways and a turning point towards righteousness, with Lot accompanying him. Abram obeyed the Lord's command and left Haran at the age of seventy-five, with his nephew Lot accompanying him. 

|וַיִּקַּ֣ח אַבְרָם֩ אֶת־שָׂרַ֨י אִשְׁתּ֜וֹ וְאֶת־ל֣וֹט בֶּן־אָחִ֗יו וְאֶת־כׇּל־רְכוּשָׁם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָכָ֔שׁוּ וְאֶת־הַנֶּ֖פֶשׁ אֲשֶׁר־עָשׂ֣וּ בְחָרָ֑ן וַיֵּצְא֗וּ לָלֶ֙כֶת֙ אַ֣רְצָה כְּנַ֔עַן וַיָּבֹ֖אוּ אַ֥רְצָה כְּנָֽעַן׃|5 P|Abram took his wife Sarai and his brother’s son Lot, and all the wealth that they had amassed, and the persons that they had acquired in Haran; and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they arrived in the land of Canaan,|

The text discusses how righteous individuals like Noach and Avraham can lead others to the Creator, emphasizing the importance of living by spiritual values to pass them on to offspring. Avraham and Sarah converted people to monotheism, creating souls through their actions and intentions. The Midrashic story of Avraham breaking idols helps explain the motivations behind Terah's migration to Canaan, Avraham taking Lot with him, and God's choice of Avraham. Abraham displayed generosity with money, body, and wisdom, beginning the period of Torah and symbolizing different types of perfection. Reish Lakish teaches that anyone who teaches Torah to another is credited as though they formed that student, emphasizing the importance of bringing others closer to Torah. Proverbs 11:30 states that the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and a wise man captivates people. Abram, Sarai, Lot, and the people they had converted in Haran journeyed to the land of Canaan. 

|וַיַּעֲבֹ֤ר אַבְרָם֙ בָּאָ֔רֶץ עַ֚ד מְק֣וֹם שְׁכֶ֔ם עַ֖ד אֵל֣וֹן מוֹרֶ֑ה וְהַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֖י אָ֥ז בָּאָֽרֶץ׃|6 J|Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, at the terebinth of Moreh. The Canaanites were then in the land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban explains that the journeys of the patriarchs serve as lessons for their descendants, as seen in Abraham's passage through Shechem and his fear of the Canaanites. Shulchan Shel Arba discusses prayer interruptions during meals and the significance of the mouth for praising God. The Mishnah details the ceremony of blessings and curses at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. Nachmanides emphasizes the symbolic acts of the patriarchs and prophets, while Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and other commentators clarify the locations and events in the text. The Talmud criticizes the Samaritans for altering the Torah, and the Targum translations highlight the presence of the Canaanites in Shechem during Abraham's time. 

|וַיֵּרָ֤א יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־אַבְרָ֔ם וַיֹּ֕אמֶר לְזַ֨רְעֲךָ֔ אֶתֵּ֖ן אֶת־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֑את וַיִּ֤בֶן שָׁם֙ מִזְבֵּ֔חַ לַיהֹוָ֖ה הַנִּרְאֶ֥ה אֵלָֽיו׃|7 J|יהוה appeared to Abram and said, “I will assign this land to your offspring.” And he built an altar there to יהוה who had appeared to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains how Abraham and King David reached the upper worlds through holiness, with Abraham guided to Canaan by wisdom and connection to the powers governing the earth. Commentary highlights how Abram built an altar in Canaan to give thanks for God's appearance and the promise of descendants inheriting the land. Jewish Thought discusses the importance of choosing a suitable life partner based on genetic, environmental factors, and merit. Midrash emphasizes God's reassurance to Moses and the significance of Abraham's altars. Musar questions the deeper significance of Abram's physical transplantation to Canaan. Quoting Commentary delves into interpretations by Rashi, Rashbam, Sforno, Rashbam, Rabbeinu Bahya, Siftei Chakhamim, Gevia Kesef, and Chizkuni. Second Temple and Tanakh highlight Abraham forsaking earthly attachments to encounter the divine and the importance of worship and faithfulness to God. Targum recounts how Adonoy appeared to Avram and promised the land to his descendants. 

|וַיַּעְתֵּ֨ק מִשָּׁ֜ם הָהָ֗רָה מִקֶּ֛דֶם לְבֵֽית־אֵ֖ל וַיֵּ֣ט אׇהֳלֹ֑ה בֵּֽית־אֵ֤ל מִיָּם֙ וְהָעַ֣י מִקֶּ֔דֶם וַיִּֽבֶן־שָׁ֤ם מִזְבֵּ֙חַ֙ לַֽיהֹוָ֔ה וַיִּקְרָ֖א בְּשֵׁ֥ם יְהֹוָֽה׃|8 J|From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and he built there an altar to יהוה and invoked יהוה by name.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Avraham's gratitude through building altars, Lot's attachment to wealth, and Avraham's focus on improving his relationship with God. Commentary highlights Avraham's prophetic actions and symbolic movements, while Jewish Thought raises questions about the Parshah text. Kabbalah discusses the qualities represented by the forefathers, Liturgy details various biblical events and rituals, and Midrash delves into different interpretations of biblical verses. Musar compares the Tabernacle construction to rejuvenating the universe and Aaron's role to Adam's, while Quoting Commentary references Rashi, Rashbam, and other commentators. The Talmud discusses name division and the importance of judgment and understanding texts, while Tanakh recounts the consequences of Achan's sin and Joshua's actions. Targum describes Abraham's movements and actions in relation to Beis-Eil and Ai. 

|וַיִּסַּ֣ע אַבְרָ֔ם הָל֥וֹךְ וְנָס֖וֹעַ הַנֶּֽגְבָּה׃|9 J|Then Abram journeyed by stages toward the Negeb.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avram's journey southward symbolizes his ability to blend service to God with serving others, embodying loving kindness and reaching a level of complete self-negation to evoke reciprocal love from God. The journey towards the Negev and Judah in the land of Israel represents a spiritual ascent to higher levels, with periodic stops for camping in the unwelcoming southern region. The forefathers represent qualities of kindness, fear, and beauty, forming the chariot upon which the Creator is affixed. Abram's command to leave his homeland for Canaan, the significance of the Land of Israel to the patriarchs, and the building of altars by Abraham are discussed in the Midrash. Abraham's constant spiritual journey southward symbolizes his strive to achieve a position on the right side of God, leading to the eventual accomplishments of the Messiah. The Avraham cycle emphasizes blessing through land and seed, with Avram's journey symbolizing a deeper kabbalistic journey towards perfection and atonement. 

|וַיְהִ֥י רָעָ֖ב בָּאָ֑רֶץ וַיֵּ֨רֶד אַבְרָ֤ם מִצְרַ֙יְמָה֙ לָג֣וּר שָׁ֔ם כִּֽי־כָבֵ֥ד הָרָעָ֖ב בָּאָֽרֶץ׃|10 J|There was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the aspect of "famine in the Land" symbolizes fasting and spiritual ascent, as seen in the example of Avram descending to Egypt but later ascending from there. Commentary highlights Abraham's descent to Egypt during a famine and his lack of faith, which led to the Israelites' exile in Egypt. Jewish Thought explores the concept of fear and reverence, while Kabbalah discusses Abraham's elevation in wisdom and return from Egypt. Midrash mentions ten famines in the world, and Musar connects Abraham and Jacob's experiences in Egypt to the enslavement of the Israelites. Quoting Commentary notes the parallels between Isaac and Abraham's journeys to Egypt due to famine, and Second Temple discusses the challenges of emigration during a famine. Talmud explains the significance of words with lamed at the beginning and heh at the end, and Targum mentions Abram moving to Egypt during a severe famine. 

|וַיְהִ֕י כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר הִקְרִ֖יב לָב֣וֹא מִצְרָ֑יְמָה וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־שָׂרַ֣י אִשְׁתּ֔וֹ הִנֵּה־נָ֣א יָדַ֔עְתִּי כִּ֛י אִשָּׁ֥ה יְפַת־מַרְאֶ֖ה אָֽתְּ׃|11 J|As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I  know what a beautiful woman you are.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains impure thoughts of righteous individuals as a sign of impending punishment, illustrating with Abraham and Isaac's experiences. Commentary details Abraham's fear for Sarah's safety in Egypt due to her beauty. Jewish Thought discusses the equitable treatment of bad habits in divine Law and the purpose of circumcision. Kabbalah connects vision with Chesed and Abraham's focus on beauty. Midrash compares Sarah's actions to Abraham's and highlights their mirrored experiences. Musar emphasizes Abraham's devotion through circumcision and chastity. Quoting Commentary references various commentators discussing Abraham's actions and traits. Talmud offers advice on etiquette and criticizes Job's behavior. Tanakh speaks of deliverance through Deborah and Israel's rebellion. Targum mentions Abram's first recognition of Sarai's beauty as they approached Egypt. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה כִּֽי־יִרְא֤וּ אֹתָךְ֙ הַמִּצְרִ֔ים וְאָמְר֖וּ אִשְׁתּ֣וֹ זֹ֑את וְהָרְג֥וּ אֹתִ֖י וְאֹתָ֥ךְ יְחַיּֽוּ׃|12 J|If the Egyptians see you, and think, ‘She is his wife,’ they will kill me and let you live.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 12:1, Sforno explains the Egyptians did not expect Abraham to agree to give Sarah to them, while Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim notes they wished for Abraham to live long to receive gifts. Or HaChaim describes Abraham's fear of being killed and Sarah taken advantage of, Radak points out the Egyptians were morally corrupt and less attractive than the Canaanites, leading to Abraham's concerns for Sarah's safety. Tur HaArokh explains the Egyptians would kill Abraham to have Sarah, considering murder less sinful than adultery, and Chizkuni adds that Egyptian laws respected a man's wife, requiring them to kill the husband to take her. In a Midrash, Rabbi Pinḥas connects events in Abraham's life to future events of his descendants, highlighting similarities between Abraham's experiences in Egypt and the Israelites' later experiences, while Rabbi Ze'eira explains Abraham's sudden realization of Sarai's beauty upon approaching Egypt, emphasizing her exceptional beauty. The Targum translations of Genesis 12:12 highlight the Egyptians' potential reaction to Abraham and Sarah, fearing for their lives. 

|אִמְרִי־נָ֖א אֲחֹ֣תִי אָ֑תְּ לְמַ֙עַן֙ יִֽיטַב־לִ֣י בַעֲבוּרֵ֔ךְ וְחָיְתָ֥ה נַפְשִׁ֖י בִּגְלָלֵֽךְ׃|13 J|Please say that you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that I may remain alive thanks to you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators offer different interpretations of Abraham's request for Sarah to say she is his sister in Genesis 12:13, with some seeing it as a strategy for survival and benefit, while others view it as a sin or a way to avoid danger. Midrashic texts highlight Abraham's trust in Sarah, the need to flatter those in power, the importance of designated places for sacrifices, the significance of Torah study after the Temple's destruction, and praise for Sarah's qualities. Rabbi Hirsch emphasizes the Torah's transparency in depicting the faults of great men, while Rashi, Bahya, and Imre Noam offer explanations for Abraham's actions towards Sarah in Egypt. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both agree that Abraham's request was to protect himself and spare his life. 

|וַיְהִ֕י כְּב֥וֹא אַבְרָ֖ם מִצְרָ֑יְמָה וַיִּרְא֤וּ הַמִּצְרִים֙ אֶת־הָ֣אִשָּׁ֔ה כִּֽי־יָפָ֥ה הִ֖וא מְאֹֽד׃|14 J|When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw how very beautiful the woman was.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Midrash texts discuss parallels between Abraham and his descendants, divine counsel being revealed to prophets, and comparisons between the actions of the righteous and the wicked. Ramban clarifies the timeline of the Israelites' stay in Egypt and interprets the symbolism in Pharaoh's dream. The Talmud debates the beauty of Sarah compared to Abishag and the praise of Obadiah compared to Abraham. The Targum emphasizes Sarai's beauty when entering Egypt with Abram. 

|וַיִּרְא֤וּ אֹתָהּ֙ שָׂרֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה וַיְהַֽלְל֥וּ אֹתָ֖הּ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה וַתֻּקַּ֥ח הָאִשָּׁ֖ה בֵּ֥ית פַּרְעֹֽה׃|15 J|Pharaoh’s courtiers saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s palace.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh's officers admired Sarah's beauty and recommended her to Pharaoh, leading to her being taken into his possession against her will. The text discusses the combination of judgment and mercy in creation, illustrated by a convert seeking guidance from Shammai and Hillel. Midrash highlights Sarah's virtues, Aaron's righteousness, and the importance of following God's commandments. The commentary explores the complex dilemmas faced by Biblical heroes and the association between Egypt and immorality. In the Talmud, Rabbi Ḥelbo and Rava emphasize the importance of honoring and respecting one's wife for blessings and prosperity. The Targum reiterates the account of Pharaoh's officials praising Sarah and taking her to his palace. 

|וּלְאַבְרָ֥ם הֵיטִ֖יב בַּעֲבוּרָ֑הּ וַֽיְהִי־ל֤וֹ צֹאן־וּבָקָר֙ וַחֲמֹרִ֔ים וַעֲבָדִים֙ וּשְׁפָחֹ֔ת וַאֲתֹנֹ֖ת וּגְמַלִּֽים׃|16 J|And because of her, it went well with Abram; he acquired sheep, oxen, asses, male and female slaves, she-asses, and camels.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh gave Abram gifts and livestock after taking Sarai, believing she was only his sister, not his wife. Abram had to accept the gifts to avoid revealing their true relationship, with blessings coming into the house for the sake of the wife. The importance of honoring one's wife is emphasized in various commentaries and Talmudic teachings, with parallels drawn between Abraham's life and events in Israel's history. Additionally, the Torah does not mention sheep first in Yaakov's wealth to avoid hurting Esau, and the promise to multiply Avraham's descendants is interpreted as their willingness to sacrifice for God's name. In Deuteronomy, God commands the Israelites not to provoke the Moabites to war, as He had given the land to the descendants of Lot. 

|וַיְנַגַּ֨ע יְהֹוָ֧ה ׀ אֶת־פַּרְעֹ֛ה נְגָעִ֥ים גְּדֹלִ֖ים וְאֶת־בֵּית֑וֹ עַל־דְּבַ֥ר שָׂרַ֖י אֵ֥שֶׁת אַבְרָֽם׃|17 J|But יהוה afflicted Pharaoh and his household with mighty plagues on account of Sarai, the wife of Abram.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the concept of "raav" or famine in the Land, linking it to fasting and the back of holiness, as the numerical value of the achorayim of the Names YHVH and ELoHYM equals 272, which is the same as "raav." This is illustrated through the story of Avram and Sarai in Egypt, where God afflicted Pharaoh due to Avram's wife. The afflictions were a result of violating Sarai's rights, with Pharaoh eventually recognizing the connection to her abduction, serving as a warning to prevent harm from coming to God's people. The affliction of leprosy is discussed for various transgressions, with examples including Goliath, Miriam, and Pharaoh, highlighting the consequences of being miserly and the public exposure of possessions due to leprosy. Rabbeinu Bahya explains Yehudah's speech to Joseph as a confrontation between the lion and the ox, comparing Joseph to Pharaoh, and discussing instances where God afflicted Pharaoh and Abimelech. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel discusses different kinds of boils, connecting them to the afflictions of Pharaoh, and Rebbi Berekhia suggests Pharaoh was afflicted for touching a matron. God protected the Israelites from oppression and rebuked kings who tried to harm them, while Adonoy afflicted Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֤א פַרְעֹה֙ לְאַבְרָ֔ם וַיֹּ֕אמֶר מַה־זֹּ֖את עָשִׂ֣יתָ לִּ֑י לָ֚מָּה לֹא־הִגַּ֣דְתָּ לִּ֔י כִּ֥י אִשְׁתְּךָ֖ הִֽוא׃|18 J|Pharaoh sent for Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me! Why did you not tell me that she was your wife?|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh suspected Sarah was Abram's wife, leading to affliction and Sarah's prayer for protection, ultimately resulting in Pharaoh letting them go. Abram's silence was out of fear of being killed. Lot remained silent when Abram lied about Sarah, leading to God remembering Abraham and saving Lot from the cities of the plain. Pharaoh confronted Abram for not revealing that Sarai was his wife. 

|לָמָ֤ה אָמַ֙רְתָּ֙ אֲחֹ֣תִי הִ֔וא וָאֶקַּ֥ח אֹתָ֛הּ לִ֖י לְאִשָּׁ֑ה וְעַתָּ֕ה הִנֵּ֥ה אִשְׁתְּךָ֖ קַ֥ח וָלֵֽךְ׃|19 J|Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her as my wife? Now, here is your wife; take her and begone!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the completion of Divine service on Rosh Hashanah is fulfilled on Succot, with the moon gradually receiving more light from the sun, symbolizing the progression from restraint and afflictions on Yom Kippur to active service and joy on Succot. Commentary notes that Pharaoh intended to take Sarah as his regal wife, but God intervened to prevent it, while Jewish Thought highlights Abraham's devotion to God and the importance of obligatory commandments in relationships. Midrash discusses various interpretations of Pharaoh's actions towards Sarah, including giving her his wealth in a marriage contract. Quoting Commentary mentions the affliction of Pharaoh by an angel due to keeping Sarah, and Targum translates God telling Pharaoh to take Sarai as his wife instead of his sister, with plagues sent when he tried to take her as his wife. 

|וַיְצַ֥ו עָלָ֛יו פַּרְעֹ֖ה אֲנָשִׁ֑ים וַֽיְשַׁלְּח֥וּ אֹת֛וֹ וְאֶת־אִשְׁתּ֖וֹ וְאֶת־כׇּל־אֲשֶׁר־לֽוֹ׃|20 J|And Pharaoh put agents  in charge of him, and they sent him off with his wife and all that he possessed.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains how Yaakov's messengers symbolize a tzadik's connection to the Blessed One through prayer, creating angels that elevate the soul and transform relationships. Commentary highlights Pharaoh's protection of Abraham and Sarah, leading to Israel's exile in Egypt for four hundred years. Jewish Thought discusses Abraham's spiritual growth through struggles, prioritizing spiritual values over material possessions. Midrash emphasizes humility and compassion in divine interactions, paving the way for future generations. Quoting Commentary shows examples of God's protection and divine favor for Abraham's family. Talmud discusses the benefits of Torah study and safety in companionship. Tanakh mentions Joshua's command regarding guarding a cave, while Targum describes Pharaoh's escort of Abraham and his possessions. 

## Genesis 13

|וַיַּ֩עַל֩ אַבְרָ֨ם מִמִּצְרַ֜יִם ה֠וּא וְאִשְׁתּ֧וֹ וְכׇל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֛וֹ וְל֥וֹט עִמּ֖וֹ הַנֶּֽגְבָּה׃|1 J|From Egypt, Abram went up into the Negeb, with his wife and all that he possessed, together with Lot.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the tzaddik can descend into negative qualities to destroy them without being affected, while sometimes a spiritual fall can lead to greater levels. The Baal Shem Tov's story illustrates the importance of awareness. Liturgy includes a Post Meal Blessing allowing for personal prayers, while Midrash discusses Abraham's aging after Sarah's death. Mishnah excludes certain groups from the World-to-Come, while Musar emphasizes spiritual wholeness. Quoting Commentary highlights Pharaoh's actions towards Abraham, and Talmud discusses Hebrew words. Targum notes Abram's departure from Egypt to the south. 

|וְאַבְרָ֖ם כָּבֵ֣ד מְאֹ֑ד בַּמִּקְנֶ֕ה בַּכֶּ֖סֶף וּבַזָּהָֽב׃|2 J|Now Abram was very rich in cattle, silver, and gold.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Kabbalists believe that the tzaddik must remain attached to the negation of physical reality to draw blessings from the celestial domain to the physical universe, as seen with Avraham becoming rich after returning from Egypt. Abram's great wealth made him move slowly due to the weight of his possessions, emphasizing the weightiness of his wealth. Korach's rebellion against Moses and Aaron involved key figures and a test of incense to ensure fairness. Abraham's failure to chastise Ishmael led to depravity, emphasizing the importance of discipline in raising children. Despite his material wealth, Abraham continued to advance spiritually. Rebbi Nehorai prioritizes teaching Torah over trades, exemplified by Abraham who kept the Torah before it came into the world and was blessed throughout his life. Abram was very wealthy in livestock, silver, and gold according to Targum. 

|וַיֵּ֙לֶךְ֙ לְמַסָּעָ֔יו מִנֶּ֖גֶב וְעַד־בֵּֽית־אֵ֑ל עַד־הַמָּק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁר־הָ֨יָה שָׁ֤ם אׇֽהֳלֹה֙ בַּתְּחִלָּ֔ה בֵּ֥ין בֵּֽית־אֵ֖ל וּבֵ֥ין הָעָֽי׃|3 J|And he proceeded by stages from the Negeb as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been formerly, between Bethel and Ai,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham retraced his steps on his journey from Egypt to Canaan, stopping at the same inns to pay his debts and give thanks to God for his safe return, with his experiences foreshadowing those of his descendants. The Divine Presence accompanied him on his journey, symbolizing the importance of faith and balance in male and female energies. The Talmud and Targum emphasize the significance of maintaining stability in one's lodging while traveling, with Abraham serving as an example of righteousness and proper manners. 

|אֶל־מְקוֹם֙ הַמִּזְבֵּ֔חַ אֲשֶׁר־עָ֥שָׂה שָׁ֖ם בָּרִאשֹׁנָ֑ה וַיִּקְרָ֥א שָׁ֛ם אַבְרָ֖ם בְּשֵׁ֥ם יְהֹוָֽה׃|4 J|the site of the altar that he had built there at first; and there Abram invoked יהוה by name.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avram emphasized the importance of appointing a definitive spot for prayer by returning to the exact place where he had previously prayed, preaching in the name of the Lord. Moses argues with God about grace, leading to a covenant for forgiveness of Israel. Liturgical texts call for compassion and mercy towards Zion and the return of captives. The Israelites turned to the examples of their forefathers in prayer during the crossing of the Red Sea. Abraham's love aimed to teach all to serve the Creator and proclaim His name, as seen in his calling on the Lord and building altars. Various commentators discuss the meanings of words related to prayer, sacrifice, and teaching about God in the Torah. Abram prayed at the altar he had made at the beginning, calling upon the Name of the Lord in the Targum. 

|וְגַ֨ם־לְל֔וֹט הַהֹלֵ֖ךְ אֶת־אַבְרָ֑ם הָיָ֥ה צֹאן־וּבָקָ֖ר וְאֹהָלִֽים׃|5 J|Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra suggests two possible vocalizations for the Hebrew word for tent. Radak notes that Lot gained wealth by traveling with Abram. Siftei Chakhamim questions the repetition of Lot's possessions. Rashi attributes Lot's possessions to his companionship with Abram. Midrash discusses the consequences of being joined to the wicked and the punishment of the nations of Ammon and Moav. Musar interprets Lot's possessions as a reference to Ruth and Naomi. Talmud emphasizes the importance of helping a wealthy man, citing Genesis 13:5. Targum states that Lot was blessed because of Abram's righteousness. 

|וְלֹא־נָשָׂ֥א אֹתָ֛ם הָאָ֖רֶץ לָשֶׁ֣בֶת יַחְדָּ֑ו כִּֽי־הָיָ֤ה רְכוּשָׁם֙ רָ֔ב וְלֹ֥א יָֽכְל֖וּ לָשֶׁ֥בֶת יַחְדָּֽו׃|6 P|so that the land could not support them staying together; for their possessions were so great that they could not remain together.|

Abraham and Lot's separation was due to their excessive wealth and livestock, leading to conflict among their herdsmen over the land's inability to support their possessions. God's role in "carrying" the universe is a spiritual concept, seen in the relationship between Abraham and Lot where the land could not "carry" them together. The term "foreign" in reference to the gods of the land refers to those foreign to the specific land, while various commentators delve into the grammatical aspects of different terms in biblical verses. The Midrash of Philo highlights the significance of the word "first" in relation to the timing of the flood and Noah's character, emphasizing his righteousness and role in a new generation. The Targum versions explain that the land could not support Abram and Lot together due to their great wealth and possessions. 

|וַֽיְהִי־רִ֗יב בֵּ֚ין רֹעֵ֣י מִקְנֵֽה־אַבְרָ֔ם וּבֵ֖ין רֹעֵ֣י מִקְנֵה־ל֑וֹט וְהַֽכְּנַעֲנִי֙ וְהַפְּרִזִּ֔י אָ֖ז יֹשֵׁ֥ב בָּאָֽרֶץ׃|7 J|And there was quarreling between the herders of Abram’s cattle and those of Lot’s cattle.—The Canaanites and Perizzites were then dwelling in the land.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that business activity arises from conflict, as seen in the dispute between Abram and Lot's shepherds due to grazing land scarcity. Halakhah links commandment fulfillment to the sanctification of Erez Yisra'el through conquest, while Jewish Thought stresses the importance of reconciliation and restitution between individuals. Kabbalah illustrates the soul's battle against the Evil Inclination, as depicted in Abram's and Lot's herdsmen's strife. Liturgy praises God's power and deliverance of Israel, instilling fear in surrounding nations. Midrash recounts Abraham's pursuit of Lot's captors and his refusal of earthly rewards, leading to God's promise of blessings. Musar highlights Lot's spiritual connection to Abraham and the importance of resolving conflicts promptly. Quoting Commentary emphasizes the negative consequences of quarrels and the significance of faith in God's creation narrative, while Targum explains the conflict between Abram and Lot's shepherds over grazing land. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אַבְרָ֜ם אֶל־ל֗וֹט אַל־נָ֨א תְהִ֤י מְרִיבָה֙ בֵּינִ֣י וּבֵינֶ֔ךָ וּבֵ֥ין רֹעַ֖י וּבֵ֣ין רֹעֶ֑יךָ כִּֽי־אֲנָשִׁ֥ים אַחִ֖ים אֲנָֽחְנוּ׃|8 J|Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, between my herders and yours, for we are kin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham referred to Lot as his brother to prevent conflicts among their shepherds due to disputes over grazing land, despite not being biological brothers. Lot's immoral actions led to his choice of Sodom, resulting in his daughters committing incest. Abraham's pursuit of kings with a righteous servant and avoidance of deceitful people in Sodom demonstrated his commitment to peace and righteousness. The Talmud clarifies that the term "brothers" in halakha refers to relatives, not necessarily biological brothers, using the example of Jacob's children. 

|הֲלֹ֤א כׇל־הָאָ֙רֶץ֙ לְפָנֶ֔יךָ הִפָּ֥רֶד נָ֖א מֵעָלָ֑י אִם־הַשְּׂמֹ֣אל וְאֵימִ֔נָה וְאִם־הַיָּמִ֖ין וְאַשְׂמְאִֽילָה׃|9 J|Is not the whole land before you? Let us separate:  if you go north, I will go south; and if you go south, I will go north.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abram and Lot peacefully resolve a land dispute by choosing to part ways, with Lot choosing the Jordan Valley while Abram remains in Canaan to ensure enough space for their herds to graze. Midrash highlights Abraham's righteousness in the decision, with the right symbolizing wisdom and the left representing foolishness. Musar explains Abraham's advice to Lot to wait for the time when he will have the entire land to choose from. Second Temple commentary emphasizes the need for separation from materialistic influences, represented by Lot. Targums on Genesis 13:9 also show Abraham offering Lot the choice of direction. 

|וַיִּשָּׂא־ל֣וֹט אֶת־עֵינָ֗יו וַיַּרְא֙ אֶת־כׇּל־כִּכַּ֣ר הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן כִּ֥י כֻלָּ֖הּ מַשְׁקֶ֑ה לִפְנֵ֣י ׀ שַׁחֵ֣ת יְהֹוָ֗ה אֶת־סְדֹם֙ וְאֶת־עֲמֹרָ֔ה כְּגַן־יְהֹוָה֙ כְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם בֹּאֲכָ֖ה צֹֽעַר׃|10 J|Lot looked about him and saw how well watered was the whole plain of the Jordan, all of it—this was before יהוה had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah—all the way to Zoar, like the garden of יהוה, like the land of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Lot chose the well-irrigated Jordan Valley, likened to the garden of God and Egypt, for its lushness and protection against drought. Abraham allowed Lot to choose first to avoid conflict over grazing land, maintaining his loyalty to God. The Talmud discusses Lot's sinful motivations in choosing the fertile region, contrasting it with the rocky terrain of Hebron. Lot's actions were not driven by a desire to fulfill a mitzva, as evidenced by his lustful nature. 

|וַיִּבְחַר־ל֣וֹ ל֗וֹט אֵ֚ת כׇּל־כִּכַּ֣ר הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן וַיִּסַּ֥ע ל֖וֹט מִקֶּ֑דֶם וַיִּפָּ֣רְד֔וּ אִ֖ישׁ מֵעַ֥ל אָחִֽיו׃|11 J P|So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed eastward. Thus they parted from each other;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the name of God, הויה, represents His present activity, while אהיה signifies His future activity, as demonstrated in Moses' desire to fulfill commandments in the Holy Land. Commentary from various sources like Ibn Ezra, Sforno, and Rashi discuss Lot's journey eastward towards Sodom, emphasizing his separation from Abram and God. Kabbalah interprets Lot's journey as a symbolic separation from his brother. Midrash texts like Sifrei Devarim and Bereshit Rabbah discuss the consequences of Lot choosing Sodom and the importance of separating from wicked individuals to receive divine blessings. Quoting Commentary from Rashi connects Lot's separation from Abram to his eventual disgrace among the wise. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos describe Lot choosing the Jordan Plain for himself in Genesis 13:11. 

|אַבְרָ֖ם יָשַׁ֣ב בְּאֶֽרֶץ־כְּנָ֑עַן וְל֗וֹט יָשַׁב֙ בְּעָרֵ֣י הַכִּכָּ֔ר וַיֶּאֱהַ֖ל עַד־סְדֹֽם׃|12 J P|Abram remained in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the Plain, pitching his tents near Sodom.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Lot chose to settle near Sodom, known for its wicked inhabitants engaging in idolatry and immorality, symbolizing his rejection of Abram and God. The text emphasizes the consequences of choosing material wealth over spiritual values and the immorality of Sodom. Lot's decision to live near Sodom led to his separation from Abram and distancing himself from God. 

|וְאַנְשֵׁ֣י סְדֹ֔ם רָעִ֖ים וְחַטָּאִ֑ים לַיהֹוָ֖ה מְאֹֽד׃|13 J|Now the inhabitants of Sodom were very wicked sinners against יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The men of Sodom were extremely wicked and sinful, mistreating others and displaying a lack of moral principles, leading to their eventual downfall. Lot's decision to live among them reflected his alignment with evildoers, resulting in his association with wickedness and refusal to separate from them. The people of Sodom were known for their pride, exploitation of the weak, cruelty, and engaging in forbidden relations against God, ultimately leading to their exclusion from the World-to-Come. 

|וַֽיהֹוָ֞ה אָמַ֣ר אֶל־אַבְרָ֗ם אַחֲרֵי֙ הִפָּֽרֶד־ל֣וֹט מֵֽעִמּ֔וֹ שָׂ֣א נָ֤א עֵינֶ֙יךָ֙ וּרְאֵ֔ה מִן־הַמָּק֖וֹם אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֣ה שָׁ֑ם צָפֹ֥נָה וָנֶ֖גְבָּה וָקֵ֥דְמָה וָיָֽמָּה׃|14 J|And יהוה said to Abram, after Lot had parted from him, “Raise your eyes and look out from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 13:14, God promises Avraham that he will see three patriarchs symbolizing Chesed, Gevurah, and Tiferet, while Malki Tzedek blesses Avram with bread and wine representing wisdom. The Talmud discusses oaths demanded from exiled Jews, and by toiling in Torah, one can enter into God. Lot's separation from Avram was necessary to ensure the promise of the land was exclusively for Avram and his descendants. Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer have different interpretations of Moses' vision of the land of Israel, with the Midrash emphasizing the importance of maintaining a pure environment free of idolatry. Rashi explains Jacob's blessings extending to the everlasting hills, while the Talmud teaches that a blessing for the righteous can be inferred from the curse of the wicked, as seen in the case of Abram after Lot separated from him. Adonoy instructs Avram to look in all directions after Lot separates from him (Onkelos Genesis 13:14; Targum Jonathan on Genesis 13:14). 

|כִּ֧י אֶת־כׇּל־הָאָ֛רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה רֹאֶ֖ה לְךָ֣ אֶתְּנֶ֑נָּה וּֽלְזַרְעֲךָ֖ עַד־עוֹלָֽם׃|15 J|for I give all the land that you see to you and your offspring forever.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God corrected Avram's misinterpretation of astrology charts by teaching him that prayer and repentance can change decrees, making constellations irrelevant to the fate of the Jewish people. God promised Abraham and his descendants the land they could see, symbolically taking possession of it, with the promise of inheritance. Yaakov's inheritance is unlimited as he ascends to the Crown-Keter, while Avraham and Yitzchak's portions have measure and limitation. The Midrash discusses the process of examining witnesses for sin, Abraham's observance of God's commandments, consequences of not following mitzvot, and God's promise of the Land to Abraham's descendants. God's promise of the land is reiterated multiple times, symbolizing future inheritance, and both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that God promises to give Abraham and his descendants the land they see forever. 

|וְשַׂמְתִּ֥י אֶֽת־זַרְעֲךָ֖ כַּעֲפַ֣ר הָאָ֑רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֣ר ׀ אִם־יוּכַ֣ל אִ֗ישׁ לִמְנוֹת֙ אֶת־עֲפַ֣ר הָאָ֔רֶץ גַּֽם־זַרְעֲךָ֖ יִמָּנֶֽה׃|16 J|I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring too can be counted.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Jewish fate cannot be predicted through astrology, as prayers and repentance have the power to change God's decrees. Commentary highlights the eternal significance of the Jewish people, likening them to dust and stars. Halakhah emphasizes the mitzva to procreate and the prohibition against counting the descendants of Abraham. Jewish Thought discusses the endurance of the Jewish people and the relationship between terrestrial and celestial elements. Midrash connects the concept of being bowed down to the dust with Abraham's descendants and discusses the order of punishment and reward. Quoting Commentary emphasizes the comparison of the Israelites to the dust of the earth and stars. Talmud interprets the rise and fall of the Jewish nation as descending to the dust and rising to the stars. Tanakh mentions the vast number of Jacob's descendants and the promise to make Abraham's descendants as numerous as the dust of the earth. Targum reiterates God's promise to Abraham about his descendants being as numerous as the dust of the earth. 

|ק֚וּם הִתְהַלֵּ֣ךְ בָּאָ֔רֶץ לְאׇרְכָּ֖הּ וּלְרׇחְבָּ֑הּ כִּ֥י לְךָ֖ אֶתְּנֶֽנָּה׃|17 J|Up, walk about the land, through its length and its breadth, for I give it to you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Jacob's ability to extract sparks from the Land of Israel through Torah study without traveling, contrasting with Abraham's need to physically travel. Halakhah distinguishes successful residence based on Torah, tithes, or honoring Sabbaths and holidays. Jewish Thought explores how Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob perceived the temple concept differently. Kabbalah discusses the inheritance differences among the patriarchs, with Yaakov's portion being unlimited. Liturgy emphasizes giving thanks to God and remembering His wonders. Midrash discusses how the patriarchs improved the land and did not question God's ways. Musar connects the spies' sin to Joshua's leadership and G-d's ongoing war with Amalek. Quoting Commentary highlights the repetition of God's promises to Abraham and Abraham's faithfulness. Responsa affirms that proselytes should recite blessings as natural-born Jews. Talmud discusses the rewards of observing Shabbat and the significance of walking in the land. Targum emphasizes God's promise of the land to Abraham and the idea of journeying and occupying the land. 

|וַיֶּאֱהַ֣ל אַבְרָ֗ם וַיָּבֹ֛א וַיֵּ֛שֶׁב בְּאֵלֹנֵ֥י מַמְרֵ֖א אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּחֶבְר֑וֹן וַיִּֽבֶן־שָׁ֥ם מִזְבֵּ֖חַ לַֽיהֹוָֽה׃|18 J|And Abram moved his tent, and came to dwell at the terebinths of Mamre, which are in Hebron; and he built an altar there to יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abram built altars and preached in the name of the Lord as he moved his tent from place to place, settling in Eloney Mamre in Hebron. He promoted peace by allowing Lot to choose his land first, showing loyalty to God by maintaining his distance from evil inhabitants. Abram's unwavering faith was demonstrated when he survived being thrown into a fiery furnace by Nimrod. Lot chose the sinful land of Sedom and Amora, while Abram settled in the promised land of Canaan, receiving a clear promise of descendants from God. In the Plains of Mamre in Hebron, Abram built an altar before the Lord and set up his tent for oxen and sheep. 

## Genesis 14

|וַיְהִ֗י בִּימֵי֙ אַמְרָפֶ֣ל מֶֽלֶךְ־שִׁנְעָ֔ר אַרְי֖וֹךְ מֶ֣לֶךְ אֶלָּסָ֑ר כְּדׇרְלָעֹ֙מֶר֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ עֵילָ֔ם וְתִדְעָ֖ל מֶ֥לֶךְ גּוֹיִֽם׃|1 J|Now, when King Amraphel of Shinar, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Chedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham's victory over the four kings in Genesis 14 symbolizes the future triumphs of his descendants over Babylon, Media, Greece, and Rome, with the last king representing the Roman Empire. Names should not be split unless naturally divided, and Torah emphasizes overcoming challenges with righteousness. Nachmanides explains the four kings as foretelling the rule of empires and the ultimate victory of Abraham's descendants. The Talmud discusses various events marked by "vayhi" and characteristics of wise disciples, while the Targum identifies the kings in Genesis 14 and links Amraphel to Nimrod. 

|עָשׂ֣וּ מִלְחָמָ֗ה אֶת־בֶּ֙רַע֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ סְדֹ֔ם וְאֶת־בִּרְשַׁ֖ע מֶ֣לֶךְ עֲמֹרָ֑ה שִׁנְאָ֣ב ׀ מֶ֣לֶךְ אַדְמָ֗ה וְשֶׁמְאֵ֙בֶר֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ וּמֶ֥לֶךְ בֶּ֖לַע הִיא־צֹֽעַר׃|2 J|made war on King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The kings mentioned in Genesis 14:2 were engaged in a deliberate battle in a strategically chosen location, with the city of Bela later known as Tzoar. The Midrash provides insights into the significance of specific names, the use of certain terms like "vayhi" and "ehad," and the indication of trouble in certain phrases. The Talmud discusses deeper meanings in Torah verses, the qualities of a wise disciple, and the Divine Presence descending to the world at various times. The Targum explains the wickedness and evil deeds of the kings mentioned in the text. 

|כׇּל־אֵ֙לֶּה֙ חָֽבְר֔וּ אֶל־עֵ֖מֶק הַשִּׂדִּ֑ים ה֖וּא יָ֥ם הַמֶּֽלַח׃|3 J|all the latter joined forces at the Valley of Siddim, now the Dead Sea. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that "Siddim" means plaster or lime, and the valley of Siddim is identified as the Salt Sea. The Midrash describes how the valley nourished its inhabitants before turning into the Salt Sea. The Second Temple commentary notes that the confederacy in the valley of Siddim was destroyed by Abraham. The Targum describes the valley as a fertile region that eventually became the Salt Sea. 

|שְׁתֵּ֤ים עֶשְׂרֵה֙ שָׁנָ֔ה עָבְד֖וּ אֶת־כְּדׇרְלָעֹ֑מֶר וּשְׁלֹשׁ־עֶשְׂרֵ֥ה שָׁנָ֖ה מָרָֽדוּ׃|4 J|Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The kings rebelled against Kedorlaomer after serving him for twelve years, with interpretations varying on the duration of the rebellion and the significance of the battle against the Amalekites and Emorites. Ramban emphasizes the importance of treating women with respect in marriage, while the Talmud discusses the chronology of events surrounding the rebellion against Kedorlaomer. The Targum and Onkelos agree that the rebellion began in the thirteenth year. 

|וּבְאַרְבַּע֩ עֶשְׂרֵ֨ה שָׁנָ֜ה בָּ֣א כְדׇרְלָעֹ֗מֶר וְהַמְּלָכִים֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִתּ֔וֹ וַיַּכּ֤וּ אֶת־רְפָאִים֙ בְּעַשְׁתְּרֹ֣ת קַרְנַ֔יִם וְאֶת־הַזּוּזִ֖ים בְּהָ֑ם וְאֵת֙ הָֽאֵימִ֔ים בְּשָׁוֵ֖ה קִרְיָתָֽיִם׃|5 J|In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim at Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim at Ham, the Emim at Shaveh-kiriathaim,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Rephaim and Emim were terrifying giants defeated by kings like Amrafel, with Avram's victory over four kings showcasing his selfless love and God's mercy. Og, a remnant of the Rephaim, instilled fear in the righteous like Jacob and Moses, but was defeated as divine justice. The Israelites spent twenty-six sinful years serving and rebelling against Chedorlaomer, with Jair of Manasseh capturing villages and King Og having a large iron bed. Kedorlaomer and other kings defeated the Rephaim, Zuzim, and Aimim in various cities, with giants and formidable inhabitants mentioned in different Targums. 

|וְאֶת־הַחֹרִ֖י בְּהַרְרָ֣ם שֵׂעִ֑יר עַ֚ד אֵ֣יל פָּארָ֔ן אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־הַמִּדְבָּֽר׃|6 J|and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran, which is by the wilderness.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban explains Eil, Eilonei, Kikar, and Abel as specific names for lowland areas, with different meanings. Midrash discusses the content of the ordinary Hallel and interpretations of Genesis 14:4 by Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel. Quoting Commentary includes discussions on Seir's genealogy, the Chori, and interpretations of "fiery law" in Deuteronomy. Targum mentions the Chorites living in the mountains of Seir and Gebala. 

|וַ֠יָּשֻׁ֠בוּ וַיָּבֹ֜אוּ אֶל־עֵ֤ין מִשְׁפָּט֙ הִ֣וא קָדֵ֔שׁ וַיַּכּ֕וּ אֶֽת־כׇּל־שְׂדֵ֖ה הָעֲמָלֵקִ֑י וְגַם֙ אֶת־הָ֣אֱמֹרִ֔י הַיֹּשֵׁ֖ב בְּחַֽצְצֹ֥ן תָּמָֽר׃|7 J|On their way back they came to En-mishpat, which is Kadesh, and subdued all the territory of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes focusing on one's relationship with God over personal feelings, while Likutei Moharan connects foreign thoughts to corrupting mishpat. The commentary discusses the prophetic nature of naming locations in Genesis 14, while the Midrash explores troubles faced in different eras and significant figures like Abraham and Aḥaz. Rabbeinu Bahya explains the significance of the rock in Bamidbar 20 and the punishment of Moses at Kadesh, while Rashi identifies the Ammonites as disguised Amalekites. The Second Temple text symbolizes the sacred spring in Genesis as representing God's wisdom, and the Tanakh mentions the Israelites arriving at Kadesh where Miriam died. Targum accounts Onkelos and Targum Jonathan recount the armies turning back to strike Amaleik and the Emorites at Ein Mishpat. 

|וַיֵּצֵ֨א מֶֽלֶךְ־סְדֹ֜ם וּמֶ֣לֶךְ עֲמֹרָ֗ה וּמֶ֤לֶךְ אַדְמָה֙ וּמֶ֣לֶךְ וּמֶ֥לֶךְ בֶּ֖לַע הִוא־צֹ֑עַר וַיַּֽעַרְכ֤וּ אִתָּם֙ מִלְחָמָ֔ה בְּעֵ֖מֶק הַשִּׂדִּֽים׃|8 J|Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar, went forth and engaged them in battle in the Valley of Siddim:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The rebellion of the five kings against Kedorleomer was orchestrated by God to fulfill His promise to Avram, resulting in their defeat in the valley of Sidim. Various interpretations in the Midrash discuss God's attributes, human superiority over beasts, Abraham's role in establishing prayer, battles against the Amalekites and Emorites, and the rescue of Lot by the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah. The city of בלע was renamed קרא after Genesis 19:22:2, and during the Assyrian dominion, the Sodomites were defeated by the Assyrians in the Slime Pits, leading to the formation of the Lake Asphaltites. The Targum mentions battles between the kings of Sedom, Amorah, Admah, Zeboim, and Zoar in the Valley of Siddim and the Valley of the Gardens. 

|אֵ֣ת כְּדׇרְלָעֹ֜מֶר מֶ֣לֶךְ עֵילָ֗ם וְתִדְעָל֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ גּוֹיִ֔ם וְאַמְרָפֶל֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ שִׁנְעָ֔ר וְאַרְי֖וֹךְ מֶ֣לֶךְ אֶלָּסָ֑ר אַרְבָּעָ֥ה מְלָכִ֖ים אֶת־הַחֲמִשָּֽׁה׃|9 J|King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar—four kings against those five.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The battle in Genesis 14:9 between four powerful kings led by Chedorlaomer and five local kings emphasizes Abraham's persistence in pursuing them, with the actual fighting done by spearhead forces while the kings themselves did not participate. Chedorlaomer was the main instigator of the war, and Tzaddikim receive special hashgachah from G-d, with personal intervention occurring through the merit of ancestors leading to redemption. In Midrash, it is mentioned that man starts and ends with four kingdoms, and various texts discuss how God helped Abraham defeat his enemies and the importance of helping Israel. The Targum also mentions the four kings who fought against five kings in Genesis 14:9. 

|וְעֵ֣מֶק הַשִּׂדִּ֗ים בֶּֽאֱרֹ֤ת בֶּאֱרֹת֙ חֵמָ֔ר וַיָּנֻ֛סוּ מֶֽלֶךְ־סְדֹ֥ם וַעֲמֹרָ֖ה וַיִּפְּלוּ־שָׁ֑מָּה וְהַנִּשְׁאָרִ֖ים הֶ֥רָה נָּֽסוּ׃|10 J|Now the Valley of Siddim was dotted with bitumen pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, in their flight, threw themselves into them, while the rest escaped to the hill country.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The valley of Siddim was full of clay pits where the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fell during battle, with the king of Sodom miraculously escaping. The Sodomites were punished for their sins, leading to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Targum mentions that the pits were filled with bitumen, not clay. 

|וַ֠יִּקְח֠וּ אֶת־כׇּל־רְכֻ֨שׁ סְדֹ֧ם וַעֲמֹרָ֛ה וְאֶת־כׇּל־אׇכְלָ֖ם וַיֵּלֵֽכוּ׃|11 J|[The invaders] seized all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their provisions, and went their way.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The armies conquered Sodom, Gomorrah, Adma, Tzevoyim, and Tzoar, taking all their property and inhabitants, with Abraham facing a trial when kings came against him to slay him and taking Lot and the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah. The plundering included tools of work and dates, and Lot was harshly treated and taken to Sodom, with his fate linked to the proverb about walking with the wise or foolish. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan recount how the victors took the wealth and provisions of Sodom and Gomorrah. 

|וַיִּקְח֨וּ אֶת־ל֧וֹט וְאֶת־רְכֻשׁ֛וֹ בֶּן־אֲחִ֥י אַבְרָ֖ם וַיֵּלֵ֑כוּ וְה֥וּא יֹשֵׁ֖ב בִּסְדֹֽם׃|12 J|They also took Lot, the son of Abram’s brother, and his possessions, and departed; for he had settled in Sodom.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Lot's decision to dwell in Sodom left him vulnerable to capture by the four kings, resulting in the plundering of his possessions, harsh treatment, and his subsequent rescue by Abraham, who saw his importance in the context of Messianic prophecy. This event was part of the ten tests faced by Abraham, highlighting the consequences of Lot's choice to reside in Sodom. 

|וַיָּבֹא֙ הַפָּלִ֔יט וַיַּגֵּ֖ד לְאַבְרָ֣ם הָעִבְרִ֑י וְהוּא֩ שֹׁכֵ֨ן בְּאֵֽלֹנֵ֜י מַמְרֵ֣א הָאֱמֹרִ֗י אֲחִ֤י אֶשְׁכֹּל֙ וַאֲחִ֣י עָנֵ֔ר וְהֵ֖ם בַּעֲלֵ֥י בְרִית־אַבְרָֽם׃|13 J|A fugitive brought the news to Abram the Hebrew, who was dwelling at the terebinths of Mamre the Amorite, kinsman of Eshkol and Aner, these being Abram’s allies.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Og, King of Bashan, is referred to as a "refugee" who escaped judgment for a long time before being dealt with by God, as identified in Genesis 14:13. The tzadik, like Avraham, can connect the lower and higher worlds through their thoughts and actions, illuminating the Higher Worlds with their Torah and holiness. Intertextuality in the Torah connects promises made to Avraham in chapters 14 and 15, with God vowing to stand by his descendants and provide for them. In Pesikta Rabbati 33:1, it is taught that during prayer, one should direct their heart towards the Holy of Holies, and if praying outside of Israel, towards Israel, and if in Israel, towards Jerusalem. The Talmud and Torah narratives discuss the concept of fear and confidence in figures like Jacob, Moses, and Og, highlighting the importance of adopting a posture of confidence. 

|וַיִּשְׁמַ֣ע אַבְרָ֔ם כִּ֥י נִשְׁבָּ֖ה אָחִ֑יו וַיָּ֨רֶק אֶת־חֲנִיכָ֜יו יְלִידֵ֣י בֵית֗וֹ שְׁמֹנָ֤ה עָשָׂר֙ וּשְׁלֹ֣שׁ מֵא֔וֹת וַיִּרְדֹּ֖ף עַד־דָּֽן׃|14 J|When Abram heard that his kinsman’s [household] had been taken captive, he mustered his retainers,  born into his household, numbering three hundred and eighteen, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Avram's victory over armies by uttering God's name is symbolized by the number 318 representing speech, with Eliezer playing a key role despite Abraham's lack of trust in him. Commentary explains that the 318 men were trained by Abraham for battle, with Eliezer being equivalent in merit to the others. Jewish Thought emphasizes the importance of self-defense for the Jewish people to maintain honor and independence, shifting towards reliance on divine protection. Midrash discusses instances where biblical figures used prayer for victory, highlighting Abraham's pursuit of Lot's captors and his humility. Quoting Commentary provides insights from Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and Divrei Negidim on various biblical passages, connecting them to themes of armed defense and divine intervention. In Talmud, Rabbi Yoḥanan explains the significance of Og, Lot's role in causing contention, and Abraham's punishment for drafting Torah scholars into war. Targum recounts Avram's pursuit of his kinsman's captors with his trained servants and Eliezer to Dan. 

|וַיֵּחָלֵ֨ק עֲלֵיהֶ֧ם ׀ לַ֛יְלָה ה֥וּא וַעֲבָדָ֖יו וַיַּכֵּ֑ם וַֽיִּרְדְּפֵם֙ עַד־חוֹבָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר מִשְּׂמֹ֖אל לְדַמָּֽשֶׂק׃|15 J|At night, he and his servants deployed against them and defeated them; and he pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Avram's journey as a process of serving God through awe and love, Likutei Halakhot explains the significance of midnight in Exodus and Abraham's ability to divide the night, Kabbalah links Avraham's battle to Divine protection, Liturgy references Abraham's battle won at midnight, Midrash illustrates God's revelation to Balaam at night, Musar tells of an old man studying at midnight, Quoting Commentary mentions various miracles at midnight in Jewish history, Talmud debates whether an angel or stars assisted Abraham in his war, and Targum describes Abram's pursuit of his enemies at night. 

|וַיָּ֕שֶׁב אֵ֖ת כׇּל־הָרְכֻ֑שׁ וְגַם֩ אֶת־ל֨וֹט אָחִ֤יו וּרְכֻשׁוֹ֙ הֵשִׁ֔יב וְגַ֥ם אֶת־הַנָּשִׁ֖ים וְאֶת־הָעָֽם׃|16 J|He brought back all the possessions; he also brought back his kinsman Lot and his possessions, and the women and the rest of the people.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abram liberated Lot, the ordinary people of Sodom, and all captives taken by the kings, restoring them to the kings of Sodom as a gesture of recognition. Abraham prioritized the well-being of the captives, returning them to show they were unharmed. Abraham defeated sixteen kings to rescue Lot and the goods, leading to the King of Sodom offering him the goods, but Abraham only accepted the people. The Moabites and Edomites were banned from the congregation of Israel for not meeting the Israelites with bread and water, despite being beneficiaries of Abraham's kindness. Abraham's pursuit of the kings extended to Dan, where he received a promise for his children. Abraham brought back all the property, including Lot, his possessions, the women, and the people. 

|וַיֵּצֵ֣א מֶֽלֶךְ־סְדֹם֮ לִקְרָאתוֹ֒ אַחֲרֵ֣י שׁוּב֗וֹ מֵֽהַכּוֹת֙ אֶת־כְּדׇרְלָעֹ֔מֶר וְאֶת־הַמְּלָכִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִתּ֑וֹ אֶל־עֵ֣מֶק שָׁוֵ֔ה ה֖וּא עֵ֥מֶק הַמֶּֽלֶךְ׃|17 J|When he returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh, which is the Valley of the King.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The valley of Shaveh was used for horse racing, contrasting the righteousness of Malkizedek with the selfishness of the king of Sodom. Abraham, Moses, and Joseph became kings through their fear of God. Abraham's influence extended to the nations, and disparaging Torah scholars is particularly harmful. Abram saved the Sodomites and was blessed by Melchisedec, highlighting his superiority. 

|וּמַלְכִּי־צֶ֙דֶק֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ שָׁלֵ֔ם הוֹצִ֖יא לֶ֣חֶם וָיָ֑יִן וְה֥וּא כֹהֵ֖ן לְאֵ֥ל עֶלְיֽוֹן׃|18 J|And King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was a priest of God Most High. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses Malki Tzedek, identified as Shem, who transfers the priesthood to Avraham, symbolizing wisdom and righteousness. Jerusalem is associated with righteousness and peace, contrasting with the King of Sodom's behavior. The verse "They shall blossom like the vine" connects David and Jerusalem to bread and wine. The Moabites' refusal to help the Israelites contrasts deeds done for their own sake versus as a means to an end. The true candles within the garments of truth symbolize righteousness and justice. The significance of Malki Tzedek in relation to repentance is explored, connecting him to Aaron and the future roles of Elijah and the Messiah. Melchizedek is depicted as a king of peace and a priest of God, symbolizing righteousness and divine intoxication. Rabbi Zekharya explains the priesthood's transfer from Shem to Avraham, and Job is described as a pure and righteous man. The covenant with ungrateful Israelites is contrasted with the behavior of other devoted peoples. 

|וַֽיְבָרְכֵ֖הוּ וַיֹּאמַ֑ר בָּר֤וּךְ אַבְרָם֙ לְאֵ֣ל עֶלְי֔וֹן קֹנֵ֖ה שָׁמַ֥יִם וָאָֽרֶץ׃|19 J|He blessed him, saying, “Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Malki Zedek's blessing of Abram before blessing the Lord led to him losing his position as High Priest; in Amidah 16, God's beneficent kindness, role as creator, and remembrance of the Patriarchs are referenced, along with the promise of a redeemer to Zion; the Ariza”l in Nefesh HaChayim makes distinctions between the worlds regarding God's knowledge of man's actions, while in Kabbalah, the form of the banner of kindness-Chessed is associated with Avraham; the Mishnah in Pirkei Avot 6:10 states that God possesses the Torah, Heaven and earth, Abraham, Israel, and the Temple, with the Talmud adding Abraham as a fifth acquisition. 

|וּבָרוּךְ֙ אֵ֣ל עֶלְי֔וֹן אֲשֶׁר־מִגֵּ֥ן צָרֶ֖יךָ בְּיָדֶ֑ךָ וַיִּתֶּן־ל֥וֹ מַעֲשֵׂ֖ר מִכֹּֽל׃|20 J|And blessed be God Most High, Who has delivered your foes into your hand.” And [Abram] gave him a tenth of everything.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that God's undeserved gifts are signs of favor, as seen in Malki Tzedek's blessing to Avram for bravery in warfare. The Me'or Einayim highlights tithing to invoke compassion and abundance. Halakhah references God's sovereignty in Amidah 15, and Jewish Thought explores God's use of possessions to elevate mankind. Kabbalah discusses Avraham's pursuit of kindness, Midrash mentions angels protecting Israel, Musar connects Abraham to all patriarchs, and Second Temple texts discuss tithing traditions. Tanakh references tithes as holy to God, and Targum notes Avram giving a tenth to the Most High Almighty. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר מֶֽלֶךְ־סְדֹ֖ם אֶל־אַבְרָ֑ם תֶּן־לִ֣י הַנֶּ֔פֶשׁ וְהָרְכֻ֖שׁ קַֽח־לָֽךְ׃|21 J|Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, and take the possessions for yourself.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham did not despair when Lot was taken prisoner, acquiring possessions through a change of ownership and girding himself with 318 servants to chase after the four kings, symbolizing that God can help even after despair. Abraham refused to take spoils from the king of Sodom, leading God to promise blessings to his descendants. The King of Sodom tried to prevent righteous souls from praying for the wicked in Gehinnom, arguing that those who did not heed authority do not deserve to be saved. The text from Da'at Zekenim and Divrei Negidim explains that the Jewish people suffered for four hundred years due to Abraham's transgressions. Abraham was rewarded for examining the characteristics of God, but also punished for not bringing people under the Divine Presence when he refused goods from the king of Sodom. Abraham's actions were seen as distancing people from God. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אַבְרָ֖ם אֶל־מֶ֣לֶךְ סְדֹ֑ם הֲרִמֹ֨תִי יָדִ֤י אֶל־יְהֹוָה֙ אֵ֣ל עֶלְי֔וֹן קֹנֵ֖ה שָׁמַ֥יִם וָאָֽרֶץ׃|22 J|But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I swear  to יהוה, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham's refusal to benefit from the king of Sodom was a birrur to clarify his intentions and make all things sacred to God, similar to King David's refusal of war spoils against the Torah's judgment. Various interpretations of Abraham's vow include rendering spoils as teruma, subjecting them to an oath, or a song of praise, with references to mitzvot. Those possessing traits of Abraham are considered his disciples and enjoy both this world and the world to come, while those resembling Balaam inherit Gehinnom. The Gemara emphasizes that engaging in adultery will result in punishment, even for the righteous like Abraham. Abram's declaration to the King of Sodom in Targum highlights his oath to the Lord God, the Most High. 

|אִם־מִחוּט֙ וְעַ֣ד שְׂרֽוֹךְ־נַ֔עַל וְאִם־אֶקַּ֖ח מִכׇּל־אֲשֶׁר־לָ֑ךְ וְלֹ֣א תֹאמַ֔ר אֲנִ֖י הֶעֱשַׁ֥רְתִּי אֶת־אַבְרָֽם׃|23 J|I will not take so much as a thread or a sandal strap of what is yours; you shall not say, ‘It is I who made Abram rich.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham's refusal to accept any spoils of war from the king of Sodom, even a thread or shoelace, demonstrates his generosity, detachment from material possessions, and desire to credit all wealth to God. This act is seen as a sign of sufficiency and humility, leading to blessings and protection for Abraham and his descendants, as well as meriting two mitzvot: the sky-blue thread on ritual fringes and the strap of phylacteries. The importance of returning lost or stolen property, ethical considerations in wealth distribution, and the focus on good deeds, devotion to God, and proper intent in offerings are also emphasized in various commentaries and interpretations. 

|בִּלְעָדַ֗י רַ֚ק אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָֽכְל֣וּ הַנְּעָרִ֔ים וְחֵ֙לֶק֙ הָֽאֲנָשִׁ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָלְכ֖וּ אִתִּ֑י עָנֵר֙ אֶשְׁכֹּ֣ל וּמַמְרֵ֔א הֵ֖ם יִקְח֥וּ חֶלְקָֽם׃|24 J|For me, nothing but what my servants have used up; as for the share of the parties who went with me—Aner, Eshkol, and Mamre—let them take their share.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham distributed the spoils of war to his allies, refusing to take any portion for himself, as seen in Genesis 14:24. This practice of distributing spoils to those who stayed behind continued in biblical stories and was debated by scholars as both historical and symbolic, potentially establishing Abraham as a powerful local figure. Abraham's refusal to accept property that did not belong to him, as explained by Rabbi Abba in the Talmud, highlights the difficulty of returning consumed theft even for the perfectly righteous. Additionally, in the Tanakh, God's people willingly join Him in battle on His appointed day. 

## Genesis 15

|אַחַ֣ר ׀ הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֗לֶּה הָיָ֤ה דְבַר־יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־אַבְרָ֔ם בַּֽמַּחֲזֶ֖ה לֵאמֹ֑ר אַל־תִּירָ֣א אַבְרָ֗ם אָנֹכִי֙ מָגֵ֣ן לָ֔ךְ שְׂכָרְךָ֖ הַרְבֵּ֥ה מְאֹֽד׃|1 J|Some time later, the word of יהוה came to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram, I am a shield to you; Your reward shall be very great.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Avram's reassurance by G'd during mitzvot, linking them to G'd's protection and reputation repair. Halakhah discusses the use of another Seifer Torah for serious errors, while Jewish Thought explores prophetic visions and divine Providence. Kabbalah highlights Hashem's humility, Liturgy praises God as the Shield of Abraham, and Midrash details Abraham's chosen status and protection. Musar delves into the selfless love of the pious for G'd, and Quoting Commentary provides interpretations of Divine communication, protection, and reassurance to Abraham. Tanakh mentions the eternal priesthood of Melchizedek, and Targum reassures Abram of his reward and protection after victory in battle. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָ֗ם אֲדֹנָ֤י יֱהֹוִה֙ מַה־תִּתֶּן־לִ֔י וְאָנֹכִ֖י הוֹלֵ֣ךְ עֲרִירִ֑י וּבֶן־מֶ֣שֶׁק בֵּיתִ֔י ה֖וּא דַּמֶּ֥שֶׂק אֱלִיעֶֽזֶר׃|2 J|But Abram said, “O lord יהוה,  what can You give me, seeing that I shall die childless, and the one in charge of my household is Dammesek Eliezer!” |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights Yaakov's fear of sin invalidating G'd's promise, emphasizing the importance of prayer for needs and self-reliance. Commentary discusses Abram's concern about being childless and the significance of biological heirs. Kabbalah stresses the importance of divine names, Avraham's connection to HaShem, and the yearning for spiritual growth. Midrash references Abraham and Jacob asking God for things, with Abraham seeking children and Eliezer considering giving his daughter to marry Isaac. Musar discusses Abraham's fear of Eliezer inheriting him and God showing him future events. Quoting Commentary clarifies the meaning of "childless" in Leviticus and discusses biblical figures' concerns about leaving descendants. Second Temple highlights Abraham's confidence and caution in seeking blessings. Talmud mentions Abraham's concern for the Jewish people and the Israelites reading Creation for the existence of heaven and earth. Targum translations of Genesis 15:2 mention Avram's concern about being childless and Eliezer of Damascus as a potential heir. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָ֔ם הֵ֣ן לִ֔י לֹ֥א נָתַ֖תָּה זָ֑רַע וְהִנֵּ֥ה בֶן־בֵּיתִ֖י יוֹרֵ֥שׁ אֹתִֽי׃|3 J|Abram said further, “Since You have granted me no offspring, my steward will be my heir.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham desired divine service to be revealed through his progeny, not his servant Eliezar, expressing concern about the fulfillment of God's promise of offspring. Isaac prayed specifically for his wife's fertility, not knowing from whom Jacob would descend. The Mishnah states that a father transmits traits to his son, with each generation having an appointed end. Yitzchak's proactive approach in praying for children contrasts with Avraham's passivity, highlighting the importance of beseeching God for blessings. Rav holds that there is no constellation for the Jewish people, as seen in God's promise to Abraham of offspring from his own lineage. 

|וְהִנֵּ֨ה דְבַר־יְהֹוָ֤ה אֵלָיו֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר לֹ֥א יִֽירָשְׁךָ֖ זֶ֑ה כִּי־אִם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֵצֵ֣א מִמֵּעֶ֔יךָ ה֖וּא יִֽירָשֶֽׁךָ׃|4 J|The word of יהוה came to him in reply, “That one shall not be your heir; none but your very own issue shall be your heir.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses how Avram's questioning led to a change in a heavenly decree, highlighting the power of prayer to influence G'd's decisions. Commentary from Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Radak, Tur HaArokh, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz provide various interpretations of the conversation between G'd and Avram. Jewish Thought mentions how prophets hear words in prophetic visions, while Liturgy references Abraham's vision in Selichot prayers. Midrash texts Vayikra Rabbah, Midrash Tanchuma, Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer, Bereshit Rabbah, and Devarim Rabbah explore interactions between G'd and Abraham or Moses. Musar texts from Shenei Luchot HaBerit interpret G'd's reassurance to Abraham regarding his heir. Quoting Commentary cites interpretations from Ramban, Kli Yakar, and Chizkuni. Second Temple texts explain that Abraham's heir will be from the realm of intellectual and spiritual beings. Talmud mentions Rav's view on the constellation for the Jewish people, derived from the story of Abraham. Targum translations by Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize that Abraham's heir will be his biological son. 

|וַיּוֹצֵ֨א אֹת֜וֹ הַח֗וּצָה וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ הַבֶּט־נָ֣א הַשָּׁמַ֗יְמָה וּסְפֹר֙ הַכּ֣וֹכָבִ֔ים אִם־תּוּכַ֖ל לִסְפֹּ֣ר אֹתָ֑ם וַיֹּ֣אמֶר ל֔וֹ כֹּ֥ה יִהְיֶ֖ה זַרְעֶֽךָ׃|5 J|[Then in the vision, God] took him outside and said, “Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them”—continuing, “So shall your offspring be.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the significance of G'd's promises and the ability to rise above astrological limitations through faith and Torah study, linking faith and having children. Halakhah discusses the hierarchy of the righteous in the world to come based on Torah knowledge, while Jewish Thought explores escaping negative influences through mitzvot. Kabbalah delves into the transformative power of prayer and intention, while Liturgy references prayers for compassion and deliverance. Midrash highlights the connections between celestial and earthly realms, and Musar reflects on Abraham's piety and humility. Quoting Commentary explains the exclusion of males under twenty from military service, and Second Temple discusses divine blessings for those who seek God. Talmud asserts that the Jewish people are not subject to astrology, and Tanakh and Targum emphasize the fulfillment of G'd's promise to Abraham regarding his descendants being as numerous as the stars. 

|וְהֶאֱמִ֖ן בַּֽיהֹוָ֑ה וַיַּחְשְׁבֶ֥הָ לּ֖וֹ צְדָקָֽה׃|6 J|And he put his trust in יהוה, who reckoned it to his merit.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes faith in God through the example of Avraham, charity's light on Shabbat, and mindfulness as simple belief in God. Various commentaries discuss Abraham's belief in God's promise, the significance of his righteousness, and the reward for his faith. In Jewish Thought, Moses at Mount Chorev and the concept of belief in God, righteousness, and trust are explored. Kabbalah highlights Abraham's success in creation and the covenant with God, while Midrash discusses themes such as faith in God, punishment for sins, and the praise of Abraham. Musar emphasizes the centrality of faith in Torah, the importance of charity, and the merit of Israel's redemption through song. The Second Temple texts praise Abraham's faith, Talmud discusses believers' faith in God and consequences for lack of belief, and Tanakh highlights God's power over human understanding. Targum translations of Genesis 15:6 emphasize Abraham's belief in God's word and his righteousness. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אֵלָ֑יו אֲנִ֣י יְהֹוָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֤ר הוֹצֵאתִ֙יךָ֙ מֵא֣וּר כַּשְׂדִּ֔ים לָ֧תֶת לְךָ֛ אֶת־הָאָ֥רֶץ הַזֹּ֖את לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|7 J|Then [God] said to him, “I am יהוה who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to assign this land to you as a possession.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham questioned the conditions of the promise of inheriting the land, but God reassured him that it was unconditional (Chizkuni). Israel claims the Land of Israel as its historic homeland through legitimate purchases, preventing accusations of theft (Halakhah). Noach's faith was seen as acceptance, while Abraham's was characterized by inquiry and rewarded by God (Jewish Thought). The Amorites were described as bees and scorpions in their pursuit of the Israelites (Midrash). Abraham's descendants were foretold to undergo four exiles, with each corresponding to a different word in the covenant (Musar). Moses asked God how the Israelites would identify him as a prophet, rooted in God's identification as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Quoting Commentary). The expression in Genesis 15:7 symbolically refers to rejecting astrological beliefs and granting wisdom by God (Second Temple). Nehemiah 9:6 acknowledges God as creator, 9:7 highlights Abram's renaming to Abraham, and Exodus 20:2 identifies God as the one who brought the Israelites out of Egypt (Tanakh). The Targum adds that God brought Abraham out of Ur Kasdim to inherit the land, specifying it was from the fiery furnace of the Kasdai (Targum). 

|וַיֹּאמַ֑ר אֲדֹנָ֣י יֱהֹוִ֔ה בַּמָּ֥ה אֵדַ֖ע כִּ֥י אִֽירָשֶֽׁנָּה׃|8 J|And he said, “O lord יהוה, how shall I know that I am to possess it?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham questioned God about inheriting the land of Canaan, seeking confirmation of the promise and a covenant to secure his descendants' inheritance, leading to the need for divine service to fix his blemish in faith. The Name HaShem is associated with two qualities, Elohi”m and Adona”y, representing Understanding and Kingship respectively. Abraham's lack of faith in God's promise led to Israel's exile in Egypt for 400 years, seen as a punishment for his sins. Abraham's questioning of God's promise and minor errors in speech and actions emphasize the importance of meticulous observance of Torah to combat the evil inclination. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֗יו קְחָ֥ה לִי֙ עֶגְלָ֣ה מְשֻׁלֶּ֔שֶׁת וְעֵ֥ז מְשֻׁלֶּ֖שֶׁת וְאַ֣יִל מְשֻׁלָּ֑שׁ וְתֹ֖ר וְגוֹזָֽל׃|9 J|Came the reply, “Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old she-goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young bird.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The animals Abraham was instructed to sacrifice represent different offerings and symbolize the future exiles and returns of the Jewish people, with the heifer representing the Babylonian exile, the she-goat the Greek exile, and the ram the Persian-Medes exile. Abraham's humility and faith led him to greatness, as he was shown visions of the future of his descendants and their relationship with God. The Talmud discusses how reading verses of the Torah pertaining to offerings can serve as atonement for sins in the absence of the Temple, ensuring forgiveness and divine protection for the Jewish people and the world. The animals mentioned in Genesis 15:9 symbolize different aspects of human nature and creation, emphasizing the importance of understanding scripture as a whole to grasp their true meaning and symbolism. 

|וַיִּֽקַּֽח־ל֣וֹ אֶת־כׇּל־אֵ֗לֶּה וַיְבַתֵּ֤ר אֹתָם֙ בַּתָּ֔וֶךְ וַיִּתֵּ֥ן אִישׁ־בִּתְר֖וֹ לִקְרַ֣את רֵעֵ֑הוּ וְאֶת־הַצִּפֹּ֖ר לֹ֥א בָתָֽר׃|10 J|He brought all these and cut them in two, placing each half opposite the other; but he did not cut up the bird.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham divided sacrificial animals to symbolize the covenant with God and signify future sacrifices would be of the same species; birds were not split to represent the eternal Jewish people. The Torah specified that only the bird Sin-offering should not be separated, influenced by Abraham's choice of a pigeon. Midrash discusses confession and repentance, while Musar highlights Abraham's humility leading to greatness and God showing him various visions. In Targum, Abram split all animals for sacrifice except the bird. 

|וַיֵּ֥רֶד הָעַ֖יִט עַל־הַפְּגָרִ֑ים וַיַּשֵּׁ֥ב אֹתָ֖ם אַבְרָֽם׃|11 J|Birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abram drove away birds of prey from carcasses symbolizing future enemies trying to prevent Israelites from sacrificing, representing the preservation of the Jewish people against attempts to annihilate them. Abraham's humility led to greatness as the first asked by God, shown visions of various events and the revival of the dead. The covenant involving sacrifices symbolized by cutting animals in half and walking between them represents Israel's eternal existence, with nations disappearing in the days of the Messiah. The prophet's role is to interpret divine messages, highlighting the soul's journey towards freedom and virtue. In Genesis 15:9, God instructs Abraham to bring specific animals for a sacrifice, and various Targums expand on the symbolism of Abram driving away birds of prey from the carcasses. 

|וַיְהִ֤י הַשֶּׁ֙מֶשׁ֙ לָב֔וֹא וְתַרְדֵּמָ֖ה נָפְלָ֣ה עַל־אַבְרָ֑ם וְהִנֵּ֥ה אֵימָ֛ה חֲשֵׁכָ֥ה גְדֹלָ֖ה נֹפֶ֥לֶת עָלָֽיו׃|12 J|As the sun was about to set, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great dark dread descended upon him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham's experience of dread and darkness symbolizes the four exiles of the Jewish people, with each element representing a specific kingdom that would subjugate them if they strayed from the Torah. Prophets receive visions through dreams or during the day, leading to physical reactions like trembling and weakened senses. The promise of the land of Israel to Abraham hints at the four exiles of the Jewish people and the arrival of the Messiah. The Covenant of the Pieces shows Abraham not only Israel's exile in Egypt but also future exiles, including Babylonia, Assyria, Greece, and Edom. The trance experienced by Abraham at sunset allowed him to receive divine inspiration and knowledge of prophecy. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר לְאַבְרָ֗ם יָדֹ֨עַ תֵּדַ֜ע כִּי־גֵ֣ר ׀ יִהְיֶ֣ה זַרְעֲךָ֗ בְּאֶ֙רֶץ֙ לֹ֣א לָהֶ֔ם וַעֲבָד֖וּם וְעִנּ֣וּ אֹתָ֑ם אַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָֽה׃|13 J|And [God] said to Abram, “Know well that your offspring shall be strangers in a land not theirs, and they shall be enslaved and oppressed four hundred years;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the spiritual influence of parents' thoughts during conception on the child, Avraham's spiritual connection to God enabling him to become the first patriarch, the prophecy of the Israelite exile starting from the birth of Isaac, the importance of belief in God's omnipotence, the significance of the Jewish people's development in Egypt, and the transmission of traits from father to son. It also examines the spiritual purification process undergone by Abraham's descendants in Egypt, the acceptance of Edomites and Egyptians into the Jewish nation, and the impossibility of determining the exact date of the Redemption and the Messiah's advent. Rabbi Akiba and the Sages debate whether merit adds or subtracts years to one's lifespan, with Rabbi Akiba emphasizing individual merit and the Sages believing in the impact of ancestors' merit. 

|וְגַ֧ם אֶת־הַגּ֛וֹי אֲשֶׁ֥ר יַעֲבֹ֖דוּ דָּ֣ן אָנֹ֑כִי וְאַחֲרֵי־כֵ֥ן יֵצְא֖וּ בִּרְכֻ֥שׁ גָּדֽוֹל׃|14 J|but I will execute judgment on the nation they shall serve, and in the end they shall go free with great wealth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avram believed his ancestors would face 400 years of Justice, but God assured him that his descendants would not be singled out for this fate, with the nation that enslaved them also facing retribution. The text emphasizes divine judgment on nations that enslaved Israel, with various commentators discussing the punishment due to excessive cruelty. The Torah of the Mothers highlights God's promise to judge the enslaving nation and ensure the Israelites leave with great wealth, analyzing Pharaoh's sins and punishments. In Kabbalah, the Israelites were granted freedom through the fifty gates of Judgment during the exodus, emphasizing mercy and greatness in the last redemption. God fulfilled His promise to Israel by delivering them from slavery in Egypt, allowing them to leave with great wealth. The Talmud discusses how Abraham did much for the angels who serve God after saying little, contrasting the actions of the righteous and the wicked. Additionally, good things are brought about through the agency of good men, exemplified by Moses and Aaron in Jewish history. 

|וְאַתָּ֛ה תָּב֥וֹא אֶל־אֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ בְּשָׁל֑וֹם תִּקָּבֵ֖ר בְּשֵׂיבָ֥ה טוֹבָֽה׃|15 J|As for you, You shall go to your ancestors in peace; You shall be buried at a ripe old age.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the spiritual influence of parents' thoughts during conception, with Avraham absorbing spiritual values through his semen and G'd contributing spiritual characteristics. The Torah highlights Yitzchok as Avraham's descendant, not Terach's, emphasizing the spiritual input from G'd. Halakhah details the burial process and mourning customs, while Musar discusses the importance of living as a stranger in the land of Israel to merit a place in the World to Come. Quoting Commentary reflects on Terach's idolatry and repentance, and Second Temple texts explore the soul's immortality and the importance of peace and virtue. Talmud emphasizes the blessing of peace for the living and the deceased, supported by biblical references, and Targum agrees that Abraham will join his fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age. 

|וְד֥וֹר רְבִיעִ֖י יָשׁ֣וּבוּ הֵ֑נָּה כִּ֧י לֹא־שָׁלֵ֛ם עֲוֺ֥ן הָאֱמֹרִ֖י עַד־הֵֽנָּה׃|16 J|And they shall return here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the wine offerings given by God to Israel after the spies incident, emphasizing the joy it brought to God and the unique ability of Israel to bring a wine offering. Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, and other commentators interpret the "fourth generation" in Genesis 15:16 differently, with a focus on the completion of the Amorites' sin before Israel can return to the land. The relation of Israel to the Divine Influence, the balance between spiritual pursuits and economic goals, and the consequences of neglecting spiritual matters are discussed in Jewish Thought. In Kabbalah, joy and grief before God are linked to judgment on the wicked based on the completion of their sins. Midrash highlights Esau and Jacob's contrasting fates, while the Mishnah and Tosefta discuss the transmission of traits and the impact of generations on lifespan. Musar examines the spies' devious tactics and the delay in the conquest of the land due to the Emorites' iniquity needing completion. The fulfillment of the promise to Abraham in the fourth generation, the preparation of the Israelites through wandering in the desert, and the interpretation of Moses' fate in Second Temple texts are also explored. 

|וַיְהִ֤י הַשֶּׁ֙מֶשׁ֙ בָּ֔אָה וַעֲלָטָ֖ה הָיָ֑ה וְהִנֵּ֨ה תַנּ֤וּר עָשָׁן֙ וְלַפִּ֣יד אֵ֔שׁ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָבַ֔ר בֵּ֖ין הַגְּזָרִ֥ים הָאֵֽלֶּה׃|17 J|When the sun set and it was very dark, there appeared a smoking oven, and a flaming torch which passed between those pieces.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 15:17, the Shechinah passed between sacrifices before making a covenant with Avraham, symbolizing Divine Presence and prophetic visions. The covenant with fire is represented by a smoking furnace and flaming torch, indicating a special relationship with the tribes of Israel. Abraham was shown the Torah, sacrifices, Gehinnom, and exiles by God, ultimately choosing the kingdoms over Gehinnom. The Lord uses parables to inform prophets of future events, as seen in interactions with Jacob, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Amos. In the Second Temple period, animal sacrifices symbolized purification of the soul by divine light, with the smoking furnace and torches representing the late emergence of virtue in life. The Targum describes Abram witnessing darkness, Gehinnam, and judgment for the wicked as God passed between divisions. 

|בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֗וּא כָּרַ֧ת יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת־אַבְרָ֖ם בְּרִ֣ית לֵאמֹ֑ר לְזַרְעֲךָ֗ נָתַ֙תִּי֙ אֶת־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֔את מִנְּהַ֣ר מִצְרַ֔יִם עַד־הַנָּהָ֥ר הַגָּדֹ֖ל נְהַר־פְּרָֽת׃|18 J|On that day יהוה made a covenant with Abram: “To your offspring I assign this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates—|

God considers himself as Avram's "father" when granting the land of Canaan to the Israelites, with the covenant ensuring perpetual inheritance. The sanctity of Eretz Yisrael was nullified after the Babylonian conquest and reconsecrated by Ezra, with disputed sanctity in liberated territories. The Rabbi emphasizes the importance of accents and vowel signs in Hebrew for grammatical accuracy. Rabbi Abba explains five covenants with Abraham, including a covenant of fire symbolized by "Bereishit." The Talmud discusses divine covenants with seven patriarchs, the generation of the Wilderness's share in the World to Come, and specific lands excluded from tithing based on the Covenant between the Pieces. The Targum describes God's covenant with Abram for his descendants to inherit the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates. 

|אֶת־הַקֵּינִי֙ וְאֶת־הַקְּנִזִּ֔י וְאֵ֖ת הַקַּדְמֹנִֽי׃|19 J|the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The descendants of Canaan, including the Kenite, Kenizzite, and Kadmonite tribes, are mentioned in various commentaries and texts, with interpretations ranging from their future possession to their exclusion from tithe obligations. The promise of land to Abraham's descendants, the expansion of Israel's borders, and the spiritual significance of the Canaanite nations are also discussed, highlighting themes of inheritance, holiness, and divine possession. The covenant between God and Abraham includes the promise of land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, while future generations are expected to inherit more lands than their forefathers, ultimately not being subjugated again once redeemed. 

|וְאֶת־הַחִתִּ֥י וְאֶת־הַפְּרִזִּ֖י וְאֶת־הָרְפָאִֽים׃|20 J|the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that the Rephaim in Genesis 15:20 refers to the land of Rephaim, not the Rephaim themselves. Radak suggests that the Chivites may be identical with the Rephaim. Rashi notes that the Rephaim refers to the land of Og, King of Bashan. Chizkuni states that the Rephaim are another word for the Chivvi tribe, one of the seven Canaanite tribes. The Midrash discusses the nations promised to Abraham by God, including the Kenites, Kenizites, and Kadmonites. Rashbam explains that the Jewish people should have no problem dispossessing those who came to the land by conquest rather than ancestral right. Or HaChaim connects the lands promised to Abraham in Genesis with the lands of the Rephaim. Chizkuni highlights the command not to harass Moav, Seir, and Edom, as their territories were not to be violated. The Second Temple text discusses how God promised Abraham to destroy ten nations and give their land to his descendants. Deuteronomy 2:10 describes the land previously inhabited by the Emim, a people as tall as the Anakites. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the Chittites, Perizites, Refa'im, and Gibaraee in Genesis 15:20. 

|וְאֶת־הָֽאֱמֹרִי֙ וְאֶת־הַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֔י וְאֶת־הַגִּרְגָּשִׁ֖י וְאֶת־הַיְבוּסִֽי׃|21 J|the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak explains that the land of the Philistines is considered part of the Canaanite territory, as mentioned in Joshua 13:3. Liturgy reflects prayers invoking the Covenant between the divided pieces and calling on God for mercy and protection for Israel. In Midrash, Abram returns all property of Sodom and Lot, refusing to take anything for himself, and instructs his servant to find a wife for Isaac without returning him to Haran. Quoting Commentary discusses the covenant between God and Pinchas/Elijah as a fulfillment of the promise to Abraham in Genesis 15, emphasizing the eradication of idol worship. Tanakh includes Moses instructing the Israelites to travel to various regions and Isaiah prophesizing a ruler who will bring justice and defeat enemies. Targum translations mention the tribes of the Canaanite territory. 

## Genesis 16

|וְשָׂרַי֙ אֵ֣שֶׁת אַבְרָ֔ם לֹ֥א יָלְדָ֖ה ל֑וֹ וְלָ֛הּ שִׁפְחָ֥ה מִצְרִ֖ית וּשְׁמָ֥הּ הָגָֽר׃|1 J|Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. She had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sarah, the wife of Abraham, had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar, who was talkative and initially worshipped both God and idols but later repented. Hagar was given to Sarah by Pharaoh as a reward for miracles performed for her, highlighting Pharaoh's admiration for Sarah. Sarah's barrenness was intentional to emphasize the miraculous nature of her son's birth, and her suggestion to Abraham to have children with Hagar reflected her desire for offspring despite her own inability to conceive. 

|וַתֹּ֨אמֶר שָׂרַ֜י אֶל־אַבְרָ֗ם הִנֵּה־נָ֞א עֲצָרַ֤נִי יְהֹוָה֙ מִלֶּ֔דֶת בֹּא־נָא֙ אֶל־שִׁפְחָתִ֔י אוּלַ֥י אִבָּנֶ֖ה מִמֶּ֑נָּה וַיִּשְׁמַ֥ע אַבְרָ֖ם לְק֥וֹל שָׂרָֽי׃|2 J|And Sarai said to Abram, “Look, יהוה has kept me from bearing. Consort with my maid; perhaps I shall have a child  through her.” And Abram heeded Sarai’s request.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abram hearkened to Sarai's voice to take Hagar as a wife out of respect for her wishes and concern for his social standing, not motivated by lust. Sarah and Rachel were rewarded for their actions, with Sarah being blessed with a son and the ability to nurse him. The Mishnah clarifies that a vow to be a nazirite when having a child still stands even if a daughter is born. The patriarchs and matriarchs, like Abraham and Sarah, demonstrated traits of humility, generosity, and lack of jealousy, repairing the damage caused by Adam's sin. Sarah's suggestion to Abraham to have a child with Hagar was due to her belief that he could not beget seed out of perfect virtue, and Abraham complied with her advice as a way of learning and studying before achieving perfect virtue. 

|וַתִּקַּ֞ח שָׂרַ֣י אֵֽשֶׁת־אַבְרָ֗ם אֶת־הָגָ֤ר הַמִּצְרִית֙ שִׁפְחָתָ֔הּ מִקֵּץ֙ עֶ֣שֶׂר שָׁנִ֔ים לְשֶׁ֥בֶת אַבְרָ֖ם בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וַתִּתֵּ֥ן אֹתָ֛הּ לְאַבְרָ֥ם אִישָׁ֖הּ ל֥וֹ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|3 P|So Sarai, Abram’s wife, took her maid, Hagar the Egyptian—after Abram had dwelt in the land of Canaan ten years—and gave her to her husband Abram as concubine.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

After ten years of marriage in Canaan, Sarah gave her maid Hagar to Abraham to have children, following the law that a man must divorce a barren wife after a decade without offspring. This decision led to complications, as discussed in various commentaries, Talmudic texts, and Midrashim. The concept of polygamy for infertility, the significance of the ten-year period for conception, and the importance of virtue in relationships are highlighted in these sources, emphasizing the complexities of marriage and childbearing within Jewish law and tradition. 

|וַיָּבֹ֥א אֶל־הָגָ֖ר וַתַּ֑הַר וַתֵּ֙רֶא֙ כִּ֣י הָרָ֔תָה וַתֵּקַ֥ל גְּבִרְתָּ֖הּ בְּעֵינֶֽיהָ׃|4 J|He cohabited with Hagar and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was lowered in her esteem.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Hagar's pregnancy led to her feeling superior to the barren Sarai, causing contempt and conflict between them. Sarah accused Abraham of injustice for not praying for children together. The matriarchs' barrenness was intended by God to elicit prayers, shorten enslavement, and increase their husbands' love. Sarah's beauty during barren years, specific negative traits of women, and accusations against Abraham are also discussed. Sarah's actions are criticized for causing conflict and Hagar's miscarriage. In the Second Temple text, Sarah is emphasized as the mistress to highlight the importance of wisdom over rank. The Targum also mentions Hagar's pregnancy leading to her looking down on Sarai. 

|וַתֹּ֨אמֶר שָׂרַ֣י אֶל־אַבְרָם֮ חֲמָסִ֣י עָלֶ֒יךָ֒ אָנֹכִ֗י נָתַ֤תִּי שִׁפְחָתִי֙ בְּחֵיקֶ֔ךָ וַתֵּ֙רֶא֙ כִּ֣י הָרָ֔תָה וָאֵקַ֖ל בְּעֵינֶ֑יהָ יִשְׁפֹּ֥ט יְהֹוָ֖ה בֵּינִ֥י וּבֵינֶֽיׄךָ׃|5 J|And Sarai said to Abram, “The wrong done me is your fault! I myself put my maid in your bosom; now that she sees that she is pregnant, I am lowered in her esteem. יהוה decide between you and me!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno suggests Sarah should have rebuked Hagar for mistreating her, Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim connects Sarah's complaint to Isaiah 10:32, Or HaChaim questions Sarah's focus on Abraham, Radak explains Sarah's accusation of Abraham not disciplining Hagar, Rabbeinu Bahya links Sarah's words to invoking Justice, Tze'enah Ure'enah discusses the consequences of Sarah's actions towards Hagar. The Midrash compares Sarah's situation to prisoners and discusses negative traits of women. The Midrash of Philo discusses Sarah's regret over giving Hagar to Abraham. Rabbi Yitzḥak lists sins including passing judgment to God, Targum portrays Sarai blaming Abram for her affliction. Sarah asked Abraham to expel Hagar and Ishmael due to Ishmael's idolatrous behavior, with God ultimately siding with Sarah. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אַבְרָ֜ם אֶל־שָׂרַ֗י הִנֵּ֤ה שִׁפְחָתֵךְ֙ בְּיָדֵ֔ךְ עֲשִׂי־לָ֖הּ הַטּ֣וֹב בְּעֵינָ֑יִךְ וַתְּעַנֶּ֣הָ שָׂרַ֔י וַתִּבְרַ֖ח מִפָּנֶֽיהָ׃|6 J|Abram said to Sarai, “Your maid is in your hands. Deal with her as you think right.” Then Sarai treated her harshly, and she ran away from her.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Baal Shem Tov teaches to let light flow into prayer to draw sustenance to the Shechinah; Sarai mistreated Hagar, leading to the birth of a son who would afflict Abraham and Sarah's descendants; Akeidat Yitzchak discusses listening to one's wife, while Dirshuni I highlights Sarah's challenges; Abram allowed Sarai to mistreat Hagar, causing her to flee; Sarah gives Hagar to Avram, leading to tension and Hagar's eventual expulsion; Abraham's response to Hagar's situation is analyzed; Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state Avram allowed Sarai to mistreat Hagar, causing her to run away. 

|וַֽיִּמְצָאָ֞הּ מַלְאַ֧ךְ יְהֹוָ֛ה עַל־עֵ֥ין הַמַּ֖יִם בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר עַל־הָעַ֖יִן בְּדֶ֥רֶךְ שֽׁוּר׃|7 J|A messenger of יהוה found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the road to Shur,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators, including Ibn Ezra, Sforno, and Radak, discuss the significance of Hagar being found by an angel at a spring of water, with interpretations ranging from a place of prayer to a junction of roads. The Midrash and Second Temple texts further explore the spiritual growth and prophetic preparation of Hagar, while Targum translations provide additional details about the location and context of the encounter. Rashbam, Sforno, and Tur HaArokh offer insights into the locations and actions of other biblical figures, such as Yitzchok supervising workers in the Negev and Rachel's certainty about Bilhah having a son. 

|וַיֹּאמַ֗ר הָגָ֞ר שִׁפְחַ֥ת שָׂרַ֛י אֵֽי־מִזֶּ֥ה בָ֖את וְאָ֣נָה תֵלֵ֑כִי וַתֹּ֕אמֶר מִפְּנֵי֙ שָׂרַ֣י גְּבִרְתִּ֔י אָנֹכִ֖י בֹּרַֽחַת׃|8 J|and said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” And she said, “I am running away from my mistress Sarai.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 16:8, Hagar did not fear the angel because she expected his appearance, symbolizing separation from the mixed multitude when accepting the Kingdom of Heaven. The angel addressed Hagar by name and status as Sarai's maidservant, emphasizing her role and loyalty. The comparison is made between Hagar's treatment by Sarai and Jerusalem's suffering at the hands of enemies. The Midrash explains the origin of the saying "If thy neighbor calls thee an ass, put a saddle on" from Hagar's self-identification as a maidservant. The angel urges Hagar to return to Sarah and submit to her authority, as fleeing from wisdom and virtue is not the right path. The Sages' statement to not contest if called a donkey is sourced from Hagar's response to being called a maidservant. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe Hagar's conversation with the angel in Genesis 16:8, where she states she is running away from Sarai. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר לָהּ֙ מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהֹוָ֔ה שׁ֖וּבִי אֶל־גְּבִרְתֵּ֑ךְ וְהִתְעַנִּ֖י תַּ֥חַת יָדֶֽיהָ׃|9 J|And the messenger of יהוה said to her, “Go back to your mistress, and submit to her harsh treatment.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The angel commanded Hagar to return to Sarah and submit to her authority, indicating Sarah's descendants will always rule over Hagar's, with the repetition of "ויאמר" possibly signifying messages from different angels or highlighting Hagar's interactions with angels. In Kabbalah, non-prophets like Hagar and Manoach can communicate with angels. Midrash emphasizes the importance of incense in halting a plague, with angels judging Israel's fate. Rashi clarifies that "לענות" in Exodus 10:3 means humility, not servitude. In the Second Temple period, the angel found Hagar in the wilderness, instructing her to return to Sarai and be humble, while the Targum emphasizes submission to Sarah's authority. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר לָהּ֙ מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהֹוָ֔ה הַרְבָּ֥ה אַרְבֶּ֖ה אֶת־זַרְעֵ֑ךְ וְלֹ֥א יִסָּפֵ֖ר מֵרֹֽב׃|10 J|And the messenger of יהוה said to her, “I will greatly increase your offspring, And they shall be too many to count.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teaches that all souls were contained in Adam, divided into 613 parts representing organs and sinews, with innumerable sparks being the souls of Israel until the Messiah. The Midrash discusses God's judgment based on current actions, Hagar's encounters with angels, and Isaac being chosen over Ishmael. Commentary highlights the exaggeration of Hagar's descendants being uncountable, Rashi's explanation of multiple angels speaking to Hagar, Ramban's interpretation of the return mentioned in Genesis 18:10, and Gevia Kesef's exploration of the use of past tense to refer to the future in Hebrew. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both affirm the promise of Hagar's descendants being too numerous to count in Genesis 16:10. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר לָהּ֙ מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהֹוָ֔ה הִנָּ֥ךְ הָרָ֖ה וְיֹלַ֣דְתְּ בֵּ֑ן וְקָרָ֤את שְׁמוֹ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֔אל כִּֽי־שָׁמַ֥ע יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־עׇנְיֵֽךְ׃|11 J|The messenger of יהוה said to her further, “Behold, you are pregnant And shall bear a son; You shall call him Ishmael,   For יהוה has paid heed to your suffering. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explores the significance of the angel's appearance to Hagar, the naming of Ishmael, and the impact of prayer on the righteous. Commentary delves into the meaning of Ishmael's name, the angel's message to Hagar, and the symbolism behind names in relation to G-d's providence. Midrash discusses the dynamics between Abraham, Sarah, and Hagar, while Musar explores the rejection of the Torah by Ishmael's guardian angel in favor of Isaac's descendants. Second Temple texts emphasize humility and diligence in seeking truth, and Talmudic commentary contrasts the assistance given to Hagar by angels with the lack of help for the Jewish people. Targum highlights the connection between Ishmael's name and G-d hearing Hagar's prayer. 

|וְה֤וּא יִהְיֶה֙ פֶּ֣רֶא אָדָ֔ם יָד֣וֹ בַכֹּ֔ל וְיַ֥ד כֹּ֖ל בּ֑וֹ וְעַל־פְּנֵ֥י כׇל־אֶחָ֖יו יִשְׁכֹּֽן׃|12 J|He shall be a wild ass of a person;   His hand against everyone, And everyone’s hand against him; He shall dwell alongside of all his kin.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Ishmael's covenant with God and power are discussed, with a hint that Israel will eventually overcome Ishmael. Commentary explores Ishmael's wild nature and conflicts, while Jewish Thought connects leadership emerging from the wilderness with Ishmael. Liturgy mentions Hashem's foretelling of the Egyptian exile to Avraham, and Midrash delves into the significance of angels and the traits of Ishmael and Esau. Musar emphasizes self-control, circumcision, and Torah study, while Quoting Commentary discusses repentance and the actions of individuals. Tanakh contrasts deliberate thinking with impulsive behavior using examples like Isaac and Ishmael. Targum describes a wild man in conflict with others in Genesis 16:12. 

|וַתִּקְרָ֤א שֵׁם־יְהֹוָה֙ הַדֹּבֵ֣ר אֵלֶ֔יהָ אַתָּ֖ה אֵ֣ל רֳאִ֑י כִּ֣י אָֽמְרָ֗ה הֲגַ֥ם הֲלֹ֛ם רָאִ֖יתִי אַחֲרֵ֥י רֹאִֽי׃|13 J|And she called יהוה  who spoke to her, “You Are El-roi,”  by which she meant, “Have I not gone on seeing after my being seen!” |
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, a spark of the Shechinah's illumination is referred to as Shechinah, as seen with the example of a created angel being called G-d in the Torah. Hagar, in the commentary, expresses surprise at seeing a revelation in the wilderness after experiencing them in Abram's house. The Midrash suggests that Hagar and Keturah were the same person based on a connection to Isaac's origins. Rabbi Eliyah Mizrachi explains Hagar's doubts about her vision and connects Abraham's building of an altar to moving away from his original philosophies. Hagar prayed and gave thanks to the Lord for appearing to her in the Targum. 

|עַל־כֵּן֙ קָרָ֣א לַבְּאֵ֔ר בְּאֵ֥ר לַחַ֖י רֹאִ֑י הִנֵּ֥ה בֵין־קָדֵ֖שׁ וּבֵ֥ין בָּֽרֶד׃|14 J|Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi;  it is between Kadesh and Bered.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The well at Beer-lahai-roi symbolizes life and divine presence, associated with Ishmaelite gatherings and the angel's appearance to Hagar. It is located between Kadesh and Bered, serving as a reminder of God's eternal presence and providence. Isaac's return from Be'er Lahai Roi shows respect for Hagar, even after Abraham's death, suggesting a sort of death and rebirth through his marriage to Rebecca. 

|וַתֵּ֧לֶד הָגָ֛ר לְאַבְרָ֖ם בֵּ֑ן וַיִּקְרָ֨א אַבְרָ֧ם שֶׁם־בְּנ֛וֹ אֲשֶׁר־יָלְדָ֥ה הָגָ֖ר יִשְׁמָעֵֽאל׃|15 P|Hagar bore a son to Abram, and Abram gave the son that Hagar bore him the name Ishmael.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avram and Hagar both named their son Ishmael as instructed by the angel, with Avram praying for him and the spirit of prophecy resting upon him. Isaac was the crown of Abraham, magnified through his righteousness and dedication to the Torah, as seen in his descendants Jacob and Isaac. The longer expression used to describe the birth of Isaac affirmed his paternity, while Sarah's request to send Hagar and Ishmael away stemmed from her desire to distance herself from Hagar's status as a maidservant. The prophecy of Ishmael's future as a wild man who will be in conflict with others was fulfilled when Abraham named him as instructed by the angel. The concept that possessions or habits are not for themselves, but for the one who possesses them is discussed, emphasizing that the habit is a part of the possessor and gives a portion of participation to those who approach it. Hagar gave birth to a son for Abram, and Abram named him Ishmael. 

|וְאַבְרָ֕ם בֶּן־שְׁמֹנִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה וְשֵׁ֣שׁ שָׁנִ֑ים בְּלֶֽדֶת־הָגָ֥ר אֶת־יִשְׁמָעֵ֖אל לְאַבְרָֽם׃|16 P|Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avram was 86 years old when Ishmael was born, and Ishmael was 13 when circumcised. The Midrash mentions Sarai's barrenness leading to Hagar bearing children for Avram, and the Talmud notes Ishmael's age to calculate Jacob's years. Additionally, the Torah mentions Ishmael's age at death out of respect for Avraham. 

## Genesis 17

|וַיְהִ֣י אַבְרָ֔ם בֶּן־תִּשְׁעִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה וְתֵ֣שַׁע שָׁנִ֑ים וַיֵּרָ֨א יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־אַבְרָ֗ם וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָיו֙ אֲנִי־אֵ֣ל שַׁדַּ֔י הִתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ לְפָנַ֖י וֶהְיֵ֥ה תָמִֽים׃|1 P|When Abram was ninety-nine years old, יהוה appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am El Shaddai.  Walk in My ways and be blameless.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the importance of guarding the brit to avoid idolatry and attain perfection through prayer and following in the ways of Avraham, with a link between the completion of the brit milah and connecting physical and spiritual powers. Ramban explains that the Divine Name "Shaddai" signifies God's sufficiency and power over creation, demonstrated through hidden miracles and Abraham's obedience to circumcision. Halakhah praises circumcision as a sign of perfection and covenant with God, stating that those who do not follow it do not have a portion in the world to come. Jewish Thought discusses the concept of "walking" with God to move closer to Him, while Kabbalah connects the red heifer and circumcision to spiritual symbolism. Liturgy emphasizes the exaltation of Shadai and God's attributes in prayers, while Midrash and Mishnah highlight the significance of circumcision in Jewish tradition. Musar compares Noach and Avraham's relationship with God, while Second Temple and Talmud discuss the importance and symbolism of circumcision in spiritual life. Tanakh and Targum mention God's appearance to Abraham as Almighty Shaddai, instructing him to be perfect. 

|וְאֶתְּנָ֥ה בְרִיתִ֖י בֵּינִ֣י וּבֵינֶ֑ךָ וְאַרְבֶּ֥ה אוֹתְךָ֖ בִּמְאֹ֥ד מְאֹֽד׃|2 P|I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will make you exceedingly numerous.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The covenant between God and Abraham involves obligations on both sides, symbolized by circumcision, with the promise of multiplying descendants greatly. Circumcision is highly valued in Judaism, forming a covenant with God and defining the Jewish people's relationship with Him. Through circumcision, Abraham was connected to the divine and promised descendants and the Torah. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi emphasizes the importance of circumcision in making Abraham complete, and King Ptolemy requested changes to the Torah text, which were not accepted. The covenant between God and man represents the grace bestowed upon the worthy, with blessings promised for those who please God and keep themselves free from sin. 

|וַיִּפֹּ֥ל אַבְרָ֖ם עַל־פָּנָ֑יו וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר אִתּ֛וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים לֵאמֹֽר׃|3 P|Abram threw himself on his face; and God spoke to him further,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham's act of falling on his face showed his gratitude, readiness to receive prophetic communication, submission to the covenant, and fear of the Divine Presence. Circumcision symbolized a change in his relationship with God, leading to a covenant between them, allowing for divine revelations and aligning with God's desire for faultless individuals. The Talmud discusses the introduction of new biblical commandments and the provision of a house of assembly for scholars seeking refuge. In Targum, Avram's act of falling on his face before Elohim is explained as a result of his uncircumcision. 

|אֲנִ֕י הִנֵּ֥ה בְרִיתִ֖י אִתָּ֑ךְ וְהָיִ֕יתָ לְאַ֖ב הֲמ֥וֹן גּוֹיִֽם׃|4 P|“As for Me, this is My covenant with you: You shall be the father of a multitude of nations.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the tzaddik's spiritual mission to elevate humanity, with God's covenant protecting them. Halakhah discusses the significance of circumcision and its connection to Abraham's role as the father of many nations. The Midrash explores the use of acronyms in the Torah, linking Abraham to the covenant through circumcision. Quoting Commentary provides various interpretations of biblical texts, including Rashi and Ramban. The Second Temple commentary views God's covenant with Abraham as a spiritual guide towards virtue. In the Talmud, Rabbi Hoshaya and others discuss the importance of acting wholeheartedly like Abraham. Targum confirms God's covenant with Abraham as the father of many nations. 

|וְלֹא־יִקָּרֵ֥א ע֛וֹד אֶת־שִׁמְךָ֖ אַבְרָ֑ם וְהָיָ֤ה שִׁמְךָ֙ אַבְרָהָ֔ם כִּ֛י אַב־הֲמ֥וֹן גּוֹיִ֖ם נְתַתִּֽיךָ׃|5 P|And you shall no longer be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham,  for I make you the father of a multitude of nations.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Torah study elevates Israel above the influence of the stars, seen in Avraham's name change and the creation condition for Israel to accept the Torah. Commentary highlights the significance of name changes for Abraham and Sarah, linking them to prophecies and holy offspring. Halakhah allows converts to bring first fruits like descendants of Abraham, and Jewish Thought discusses Abraham's moral and spiritual growth. Kabbalah emphasizes connecting circumcision names with God's name and constellations. Liturgy references the kindness to Abraham's children and prayers for salvation. Midrash explores name changes, prayer, and divine revelation. Mishnah discusses vows and the importance of circumcision. Musar praises Abraham's spiritual impact and higher level, while Quoting Commentary ties conversion power to the letter hey. Second Temple discusses the significance of adding a letter to Abraham's name. Talmud debates liability for writing abbreviations and the significance of Abraham's name change. Tanakh acknowledges God's choice of Abram and his name change to Abraham. Targum explains God's appointment of Abraham as the father of nations through his name change. Tosefta discusses the symbolic shift in names from Sarai to Sarah and Avram to Avraham, indicating broader roles and love from God. 

|וְהִפְרֵתִ֤י אֹֽתְךָ֙ בִּמְאֹ֣ד מְאֹ֔ד וּנְתַתִּ֖יךָ לְגוֹיִ֑ם וּמְלָכִ֖ים מִמְּךָ֥ יֵצֵֽאוּ׃|6 P|I will make you exceedingly fertile, and make nations of you; and kings shall come forth from you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators offer different interpretations of God's promise to Abraham in Genesis 17:6, with Ramban focusing on the Jewish people, Radak including Ishmael and Keturah's sons, Tur HaArokh and Rav Hirsch mentioning Israel and Edom, and Rashi excluding Ishmael. The Midrash teaches that Moses saw the past and future, including the land's division among the tribes as a beautiful inheritance in the merit of Torah. Musar discusses the promises of an eternal kingdom, possession of the land of Israel, and the Presence of God. The Quoting Commentary highlights Abraham's name change, symbolizing his role as the father of many nations, and the Second Temple text describes the wise man as a foundation for all peoples. The Tanakh and Targum emphasize the promise of Abraham becoming fruitful and forming nations and kings. 

|וַהֲקִמֹתִ֨י אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֜י בֵּינִ֣י וּבֵינֶ֗ךָ וּבֵ֨ין זַרְעֲךָ֧ אַחֲרֶ֛יךָ לְדֹרֹתָ֖ם לִבְרִ֣ית עוֹלָ֑ם לִהְי֤וֹת לְךָ֙ לֵֽאלֹהִ֔ים וּֽלְזַרְעֲךָ֖ אַחֲרֶֽיךָ׃|7 P|I will maintain My covenant between Me and you, and your offspring to come, as an everlasting covenant throughout the ages, to be God to you and to your offspring to come.|

Various commentaries, halakhic sources, Jewish thoughts, Midrashim, and Talmudic discussions emphasize the significance of circumcision as a covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, symbolizing Jewish identity and the presence of the Shechina among the Israelites. The covenant is seen as a central symbol of Jewish identity, with adherence to it being crucial for maintaining God's blessings and presence. The Talmud also stresses the importance of lineage in determining the validity of marriages and the need to procreate to ensure the Divine Presence rests with future generations. Additionally, the covenant is described as eternal, establishing God as the deity for Abraham and his descendants. 

|וְנָתַתִּ֣י לְ֠ךָ֠ וּלְזַרְעֲךָ֨ אַחֲרֶ֜יךָ אֵ֣ת ׀ אֶ֣רֶץ מְגֻרֶ֗יךָ אֵ֚ת כׇּל־אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן לַאֲחֻזַּ֖ת עוֹלָ֑ם וְהָיִ֥יתִי לָהֶ֖ם לֵאלֹהִֽים׃|8 P|I assign the land you sojourn in to you and your offspring to come, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting holding. I will be their God.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The covenant promises the Jewish people eternal possession of the land of Canaan, symbolically significant through the tabernacle and strict halachot. The Midrash connects mitzvot like the omer, circumcision, Shabbat observance, and refraining from adultery to maintaining a holy camp for God's presence. The commandment of circumcision is closely tied to Israel's possession of the Holy Land, with promises of an eternal kingdom, permanent possession of the land, and God's visible presence. The promises of the land to Abraham's descendants are acts of loving kindness, with the Land of Israel being called the Land of God and the Holy Land. The text refutes claims that verses in Scripture allude to Mohammed, emphasizing the exclusivity of the promises and blessings to the descendants of Isaac and Jacob. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֔ם וְאַתָּ֖ה אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֣י תִשְׁמֹ֑ר אַתָּ֛ה וְזַרְעֲךָ֥ אַֽחֲרֶ֖יךָ לְדֹרֹתָֽם׃|9 P|God further said to Abraham, “As for you, you and your offspring to come throughout the ages shall keep My covenant.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God instructs Abraham to keep His covenant, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and observance. Circumcision serves as a reminder to use the organ of lust only when necessary and permissible, signifying the covenant between God and Abraham, to be passed down to his offspring for future generations. The covenant is crucial for the existence and spiritual destiny of Abraham's descendants, with their very being tied to this obligation. Only descendants of Abraham are obligated in circumcision, as evidenced by thirteen covenants with Abraham, defining the nature of the Jewish people. Abraham's obedience to God's commandments is highlighted in Genesis 26:5, with Elohim instructing him to maintain the covenant with his descendants throughout generations in Genesis 17:9. 

|זֹ֣את בְּרִיתִ֞י אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּשְׁמְר֗וּ בֵּינִי֙ וּבֵ֣ינֵיכֶ֔ם וּבֵ֥ין זַרְעֲךָ֖ אַחֲרֶ֑יךָ הִמּ֥וֹל לָכֶ֖ם כׇּל־זָכָֽר׃|10 P|Such shall be the covenant between Me and you and your offspring to follow which you shall keep: every male among you shall be circumcised.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that the covenant of circumcision in Genesis 17 is between God and the Jewish people, with every male required to be circumcised, even if the baby has no father. Rav Hirsch emphasizes that circumcision symbolizes the obligation to live according to God's laws, while Rashi clarifies that the covenant extends to both living descendants of Abraham and those yet to be born. In the Mishnah, it is permitted to wash a baby on Shabbat before and after circumcision, with Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya allowing washing on the third day after circumcision if it falls on Shabbat. The Talmud underscores the importance of circumcision for males of all ages as a covenant between God and the Jewish people, even overriding other laws. 

|וּנְמַלְתֶּ֕ם אֵ֖ת בְּשַׂ֣ר עׇרְלַתְכֶ֑ם וְהָיָה֙ לְא֣וֹת בְּרִ֔ית בֵּינִ֖י וּבֵינֵיכֶֽם׃|11 P|You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and that shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that "u-nemaltem" means "and ye shall circumcise," Sforno sees circumcision as a reminder to follow God's path, Radak emphasizes it as a commandment for fathers and a symbol of the covenant, Rav Hirsch sees it as obedience and rejection of impurity, Rashi clarifies the term, Steinsaltz sees it as a symbol of the covenant, Tze'enah Ure'enah highlights it as a testimony of faith, Bekhor Shor sees it as a private symbol of the covenant, Chizkuni emphasizes it as a symbol of being God's servants. The covenant of circumcision signifies unity with God, Halakhah connects it to the covenant with Abraham, Kabbalah sees it as a sign of protection, Midrash discusses its significance for Abraham, and Talmud discusses the obligations of fathers towards their sons in relation to circumcision. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret it as a sign of the covenant with Abraham. 

|וּבֶן־שְׁמֹנַ֣ת יָמִ֗ים יִמּ֥וֹל לָכֶ֛ם כׇּל־זָכָ֖ר לְדֹרֹתֵיכֶ֑ם יְלִ֣יד בָּ֔יִת וּמִקְנַת־כֶּ֙סֶף֙ מִכֹּ֣ל בֶּן־נֵכָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹ֥א מִֽזַּרְעֲךָ֖ הֽוּא׃|12 P|And throughout the generations, every male among you shall be circumcised at the age of eight days. As for the homeborn slave and the one bought from an outsider who is not of your offspring,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the symbolic significance of circumcision as emulating God's attribute, while Halakhah outlines the commandment for fathers to circumcise their sons on the eighth day after birth. Kabbalah sees circumcision as a way to enter into a covenant with God and remove spiritual barriers, while Midrash discusses the timing and importance of circumcision in relation to Abraham's role as a High Priest. Musar highlights the Torah's teachings on not denigrating strangers and the importance of sanctity in Jacob's life, while Talmud specifies the requirements for circumcision to be performed during the day and not before the eighth day. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan stress the necessity of male circumcision on the eighth day, including house-born and purchased individuals. 

|הִמּ֧וֹל ׀ יִמּ֛וֹל יְלִ֥יד בֵּֽיתְךָ֖ וּמִקְנַ֣ת כַּסְפֶּ֑ךָ וְהָיְתָ֧ה בְרִיתִ֛י בִּבְשַׂרְכֶ֖ם לִבְרִ֥ית עוֹלָֽם׃|13 P|they must be circumcised, homeborn and purchased alike. Thus shall My covenant be marked in your flesh as an everlasting pact.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Circumcision symbolizes the eternal relationship between God and the Jewish people, with the covenant including all male members of a household, including slaves, to ensure unity in observing God's laws. It is seen as a form of self-sacrifice and atonement, with the blood shed during the procedure serving as a means of redemption. The act is interpreted as weakening physical desires and strengthening spiritual connections to God, with various covenants established, including the covenant of the flesh and the covenant of the tongue. The necessity of circumcision is discussed in the Talmud, with different opinions on specific intentions required for the procedure, and the importance of having an expert physician perform it for the safety of the child. 

|וְעָרֵ֣ל ׀ זָכָ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא־יִמּוֹל֙ אֶת־בְּשַׂ֣ר עׇרְלָת֔וֹ וְנִכְרְתָ֛ה הַנֶּ֥פֶשׁ הַהִ֖וא מֵעַמֶּ֑יהָ אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֖י הֵפַֽר׃|14 P|And if any male who is uncircumcised fails to circumcise the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from kin; he has broken My covenant.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Circumcision is a crucial aspect of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, with failure to perform it leading to being cut off from the community and breaking the covenant. The act of circumcision symbolizes spiritual perfection and is a positive mitzvah punishable by karet if not fulfilled, with specific guidelines on who is fit to perform it and when it should be done. The removal of the foreskin during circumcision is seen as a way to cut off obstacles between oneself and God, signifying a return to purity and understanding. The covenant of circumcision is emphasized throughout various texts, highlighting its significance in maintaining the connection between individuals and God. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֔ם שָׂרַ֣י אִשְׁתְּךָ֔ לֹא־תִקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמָ֖הּ שָׂרָ֑י כִּ֥י שָׂרָ֖ה שְׁמָֽהּ׃|15 P|And God said to Abraham, “As for your wife Sarai, you shall not call her Sarai, but her name shall be Sarah. |

|וּבֵרַכְתִּ֣י אֹתָ֔הּ וְגַ֨ם נָתַ֧תִּי מִמֶּ֛נָּה לְךָ֖ בֵּ֑ן וּבֵֽרַכְתִּ֙יהָ֙ וְהָֽיְתָ֣ה לְגוֹיִ֔ם מַלְכֵ֥י עַמִּ֖ים מִמֶּ֥נָּה יִהְיֽוּ׃|16 P|I will bless her; indeed, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she shall give rise to nations; rulers of peoples shall issue from her.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses God's promise of a son to Abraham and Sarah before the commandment of circumcision, ensuring rewards for future commandments. The Midrash explores the concept of similar fates for the righteous and wicked, while Ramban, Rashi, and Kli Yakar provide insights on blessings, vowelization, and God's care for Sarah. Philo highlights the importance of Isaac's birth, and Rabbi Yitzhak discusses how charity, prayer, name change, and good deeds can alter a person's sentence. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret God's promise to bless Sarah with a son who will become a leader of nations and kings. 

|וַיִּפֹּ֧ל אַבְרָהָ֛ם עַל־פָּנָ֖יו וַיִּצְחָ֑ק וַיֹּ֣אמֶר בְּלִבּ֗וֹ הַלְּבֶ֤ן מֵאָֽה־שָׁנָה֙ יִוָּלֵ֔ד וְאִ֨ם־שָׂרָ֔ה הֲבַת־תִּשְׁעִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה תֵּלֵֽד׃|17 P|Abraham threw himself on his face and laughed, as he said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man a hundred years old, or can Sarah bear a child at ninety?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains Sarah's comment about her husband's old age as reflecting her own doubts, leading to a "white lie" to spare Avraham's feelings. Commentary contrasts Abraham's joy and faith with Sarah's disbelief and mockery at the news of having a child. Jewish Thought emphasizes God's choice of the Jewish people based on a more encompassing choice, not their deeds. Midrash details various events in the lives of Abraham, Sarah, and their descendants, highlighting miraculous occurrences. Musar discusses the Israelites' doubts during the Exodus and their questioning of Moses' leadership. Quoting Commentary delves into different interpretations of biblical events by various commentators. Second Temple depicts Abraham's laughter as a symbol of divine ecstasy and humility, acknowledging God's power. Talmud explains the alteration of the text to show God's criticism of Sarah's laughter shared with others. Targum mentions Abraham's laughter and wonder at the possibility of having children at their old age. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אַבְרָהָ֖ם אֶל־הָֽאֱלֹהִ֑ים ל֥וּ יִשְׁמָעֵ֖אל יִחְיֶ֥ה לְפָנֶֽיךָ׃|18 P|And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live by Your favor!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Yishmael is considered more significant than Avraham's other children because he was born before Avraham's spiritual perfection, leading to elevated status for Yishmaelite converts. Abraham prayed for Ishmael's righteousness and existence, but God insisted on Sarah bearing Isaac to uphold the eternal covenant. This contrast highlights the importance of fulfilling one's potential with God's help and personal effort, as seen in Jewish Thought. The Kabbalistic perspective emphasizes Abraham's concern for Ishmael over the Jewish people, while the Midrash and Quoting Commentary illustrate God's ultimate choice of Isaac as the covenant bearer. Abraham's plea for Ishmael to live before God is echoed in Second Temple and Targum texts. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים אֲבָל֙ שָׂרָ֣ה אִשְׁתְּךָ֗ יֹלֶ֤דֶת לְךָ֙ בֵּ֔ן וְקָרָ֥אתָ אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ יִצְחָ֑ק וַהֲקִמֹתִ֨י אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֥י אִתּ֛וֹ לִבְרִ֥ית עוֹלָ֖ם לְזַרְע֥וֹ אַחֲרָֽיו׃|19 P|God said, “Nevertheless, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac;  and I will maintain My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring to come.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Parshat Lech Lecha, God promises Avram a son from Sarah before commanding him to circumcise himself to ensure that the miracles performed for him do not offset the rewards for his future commandments. The covenant of circumcision is established through Isaac's descendants, emphasizing the importance of Isaac's pure lineage and the fulfillment of promises made to Abraham and Sarah. Thirteen covenants regarding circumcision were established with Abraham, defining the nature of the Jewish people. The names of the Israelites were assigned by God, with Abraham's son Isaac's name reflecting the years the Israelites were in Egypt. Ramban explains the significance of names given before birth, while the Second Temple text emphasizes Abraham's unwavering faith and God's fulfillment of his wishes. The Talmud discusses the naming of Abraham, Jacob, and Isaac, with Isaac's name given by God. In Genesis 17:19, Elohim promises Abraham a son named Yitzchok, establishing a covenant with him and his descendants. 

|וּֽלְיִשְׁמָעֵאל֮ שְׁמַעְתִּ֒יךָ֒ הִנֵּ֣ה ׀ בֵּרַ֣כְתִּי אֹת֗וֹ וְהִפְרֵיתִ֥י אֹת֛וֹ וְהִרְבֵּיתִ֥י אֹת֖וֹ בִּמְאֹ֣ד מְאֹ֑ד שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֤ר נְשִׂיאִם֙ יוֹלִ֔יד וּנְתַתִּ֖יו לְג֥וֹי גָּדֽוֹל׃|20 P|As for Ishmael, I have heeded you.  I hereby bless him. I will make him fertile and exceedingly numerous. He shall be the father of twelve chieftains, and I will make of him a great nation.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the spiritual significance of Yishmael as the son of Avraham born before his spiritual perfection, with Yitzchak holding the main holiness. God's covenant with Abraham is maintained through Isaac, not Ishmael, despite the latter's eventual greatness. The Midrash explores the importance of the number twelve in relation to the tribes of Israel and the blessings given to Ishmael and Isaac, highlighting the covenant with Isaac as primary. Commentary clarifies that the covenant is only with Isaac, excluding Ishmael and his descendants, with the fulfillment of prophecies, like Ishmael's greatness, taking time to come true. The Targum reflects God's acceptance of Abraham's prayer for Ishmael's prosperity and future greatness as the father of a great nation. 

|וְאֶת־בְּרִיתִ֖י אָקִ֣ים אֶת־יִצְחָ֑ק אֲשֶׁר֩ תֵּלֵ֨ד לְךָ֤ שָׂרָה֙ לַמּוֹעֵ֣ד הַזֶּ֔ה בַּשָּׁנָ֖ה הָאַחֶֽרֶת׃|21 P|But My covenant I will maintain with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this season next year.”|

|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Avraham resisted the temptation to refuse circumcision, leading to a greater reward, while Yaakov's return to Israel qualified him to support God's chariot. In Commentary, the departure of God from the patriarchs is seen as an act of respect, emphasizing their role as carriers of God's glory. In Jewish Thought, the Patriarchs' service involved constant attachment to God's will, leading to miracles, while Avraham's plea to spare Sodom showed compassion. In Kabbalah, Avraham, Moshe, and Solomon played roles in establishing the dwelling of God's presence, with Avraham symbolizing Kingship. In Midrash, the forefathers had a unique relationship with God, serving as divine chariots. In Musar, Abraham prioritized fulfilling God's commandments and drew God's presence back towards Earth. In Quoting Commentary, precision in understanding profound matters is emphasized. In Second Temple, independence in learning is highlighted. In Talmud, honoring the Divine Presence is prioritized, and in Tanakh, God blessed Jacob upon his return. 

|וַיִּקַּ֨ח אַבְרָהָ֜ם אֶת־יִשְׁמָעֵ֣אל בְּנ֗וֹ וְאֵ֨ת כׇּל־יְלִידֵ֤י בֵיתוֹ֙ וְאֵת֙ כׇּל־מִקְנַ֣ת כַּסְפּ֔וֹ כׇּל־זָכָ֕ר בְּאַנְשֵׁ֖י בֵּ֣ית אַבְרָהָ֑ם וַיָּ֜מׇל אֶת־בְּשַׂ֣ר עׇרְלָתָ֗ם בְּעֶ֙צֶם֙ הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר דִּבֶּ֥ר אִתּ֖וֹ אֱלֹהִֽים׃|23 P|Then Abraham took his son Ishmael, and all his homeborn slaves and all those he had bought, every male in Abraham’s household, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that very day, as God had spoken to him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Likutei Moharan 22:5:11, circumcision symbolizes breaking through the physical to receive spiritual enlightenment, connecting one with God's essence. Abraham's immediate and complete compliance with God's command to circumcise himself and his household exemplifies obedience and ensures the fulfillment of the covenant. The Midrash emphasizes Abraham's fear of the Lord, joy in fulfilling mitzvot, and the pleasing aroma of foreskins as a symbol of mercy towards his descendants. Musar highlights Abraham's humility in serving the messengers of the Lord, leading to divine repayment. Additionally, the importance of promptness in fulfilling religious duties, setting an example for others, is underscored in the commentary. Abraham's obedience and adherence to the law of circumcision are further emphasized in Targum. 

|וְאַ֨בְרָהָ֔ם בֶּן־תִּשְׁעִ֥ים וָתֵ֖שַׁע שָׁנָ֑ה בְּהִמֹּל֖וֹ בְּשַׂ֥ר עׇרְלָתֽוֹ׃|24 P|Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham was circumcised at age 99 as a prompt act of faith, with circumcision serving as a crucial sign of the covenant with God alongside the Sabbath and tefillin. The covenant with Abraham promises a lasting dynasty, the land of Israel, and God's presence with the Jewish people. Circumcision is considered a great commandment that saves individuals from Gehenna, while Ishmael was circumcised at age 13 as a partial inclusion in the covenant. Abraham delayed his circumcision to allow for more proselytes to join, as proselytes are beloved by God and are considered equal to Israel in Scripture. 

|וְיִשְׁמָעֵ֣אל בְּנ֔וֹ בֶּן־שְׁלֹ֥שׁ עֶשְׂרֵ֖ה שָׁנָ֑ה בְּהִ֨מֹּל֔וֹ אֵ֖ת בְּשַׂ֥ר עׇרְלָתֽוֹ׃|25 P|and his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ishmael was circumcised at the age of thirteen, with both the foreskin and remaining membrane removed, in contrast to Avraham who only had his foreskin removed due to his sexual experiences. Avraham and Ishmael were circumcised on the same day, showing their immediate obedience to God's command. The significance of their ages at circumcision is highlighted in various commentaries, Midrash, Second Temple texts, and Targum translations. 

|בְּעֶ֙צֶם֙ הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה נִמּ֖וֹל אַבְרָהָ֑ם וְיִשְׁמָעֵ֖אל בְּנֽוֹ׃|26 P|Thus Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on that very day;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham and his household, including Ishmael, were all circumcised on the same day in a prompt and zealous manner, with Abraham circumcising himself last to ensure the commandment was carried out effectively. The Imrei Yosher argues that Abraham suffered pain during brit milah to receive a reward from Hashem, while Rav Weinberg counters that this does not imply an obligation to inflict pain on baby boys. The timing of Abraham's circumcision at 99 years old and Hagar's encounters with an angel are discussed to show the purity of Isaac's conception and Hagar's spiritual growth. Abraham's circumcision created a hill of foreskins that pleased God, who promised mercy to his descendants. The Mishnah states that widows are sustained from the property of orphans, but her heirs are responsible for her burial. Ramban, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Rav Hirsch offer interpretations on the significance of certain days and practices, while Targum Jonathan states that Abraham and Ishmael were circumcised on the same day. 

|וְכׇל־אַנְשֵׁ֤י בֵיתוֹ֙ יְלִ֣יד בָּ֔יִת וּמִקְנַת־כֶּ֖סֶף מֵאֵ֣ת בֶּן־נֵכָ֑ר נִמֹּ֖לוּ אִתּֽוֹ׃|27 P|and all [men of] his household, his homeborn slaves and those that had been bought from outsiders, were circumcised with him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 17:27, Ibn Ezra explains the word "nimmolu" as a nifal verb, Radak states its root is "nimol," and Chizkuni notes that all males in Abraham's household, including slaves, were willingly circumcised. Halakhah dictates circumcision as a positive mitzvah, with failure punishable by karet, while the Midrash discusses the legal status of women with ruptured hymens, Rebecca's purity, and the importance of circumcision for slaves and idolaters. The Targum emphasizes that all males in Abraham's household were circumcised, whether born or purchased.
