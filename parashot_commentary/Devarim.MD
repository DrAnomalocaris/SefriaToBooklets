## Deuteronomy 1

|אֵ֣לֶּה הַדְּבָרִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבֶּ֤ר מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶל־כׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּעֵ֖בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּ֑ן בַּמִּדְבָּ֡ר בָּֽעֲרָבָה֩ מ֨וֹל ס֜וּף בֵּֽין־פָּארָ֧ן וּבֵֽין־תֹּ֛פֶל וְלָבָ֥ן וַחֲצֵרֹ֖ת וְדִ֥י זָהָֽב׃|1|These are the words that Moses addressed to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan.—Through the wilderness, in the Arabah near Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab,|

Chasidut emphasizes the hidden moral lessons in Torah stories, with Moses admonishing Israel discreetly for past sins. Halakhah explains the recitation of Amen after blessings, Jewish Thought highlights the power of unity, Midrash discusses rebuke and the importance of language, Mishnah describes the Torah reading by the king, and Talmud delves into specific sections read by the king and Moses' rebuke. Tanakh recounts Israelites' complaints in the wilderness, Targum mentions Moses reproving Israel for sins, Tosefta details the king's Torah reading and the significance of studying Torah. 

|אַחַ֨ד עָשָׂ֥ר יוֹם֙ מֵֽחֹרֵ֔ב דֶּ֖רֶךְ הַר־שֵׂעִ֑יר עַ֖ד קָדֵ֥שׁ בַּרְנֵֽעַ׃|2|it is eleven days from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea by the Mount Seir route.  —|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the Israelites' journey from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea taking eleven days, symbolizing purification from evil forces, with commentators like Ramban, Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Rabbeinu Bahya, Siftei Chakhamim, Rav Hirsch, Steinsaltz, Tze'enah Ure'enah, and Chizkuni offering interpretations. It refutes the notion of the Israelites being lost in the desert, emphasizes God's guidance, and contrasts Spinoza's approach to biblical texts. The Midrash explores deviations from God's path, complaints in the wilderness, and consequences like leprosy. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai challenges interpretations in the Talmud, while the Tanakh recounts the rebellion of the Israelites, their doubts, and defeat by the Amalekites and Canaanites. The Targum highlights the delay in the journey due to sin and provocation of the Lord. 

|וַֽיְהִי֙ בְּאַרְבָּעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה בְּעַשְׁתֵּֽי־עָשָׂ֥ר חֹ֖דֶשׁ בְּאֶחָ֣ד לַחֹ֑דֶשׁ דִּבֶּ֤ר מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל כְּ֠כֹ֠ל אֲשֶׁ֨ר צִוָּ֧ה יְהֹוָ֛ה אֹת֖וֹ אֲלֵהֶֽם׃|3|It was in the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, that Moses addressed the Israelites in accordance with the instructions that יהוה had given him for them,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes hidden aspects and moral lessons in the Torah, with the Book of Deuteronomy addressing a higher spiritual level and the importance of Torah study. Moses reproved the Israelites before his death, focusing on reverence for God and Jewish traditions. Rashi highlights the democratic nature of allowing all of Israel to hear Moses' words, emphasizing the importance of narratives in the Torah. Moshe taught the pilpul method to derive new laws, gathering the people to clarify any doubts about the Torah. The Talmud discusses how to count kings' reigns and debates about the new year, while the Targum states that Moses spoke to the Israelites as commanded by the Lord in the eleventh month of the fortieth year. 

|אַחֲרֵ֣י הַכֹּת֗וֹ אֵ֚ת סִיחֹן֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ הָֽאֱמֹרִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּחֶשְׁבּ֑וֹן וְאֵ֗ת ע֚וֹג מֶ֣לֶךְ הַבָּשָׁ֔ן אֲשֶׁר־יוֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּעַשְׁתָּרֹ֖ת בְּאֶדְרֶֽעִי׃|4|after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who dwelt at Ashtaroth [and]  Edrei.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Likutei Moharan 55:10:9, Og is called a "refugee" for his wicked intentions towards Avraham and Sarah. Ramban explains Sihon and Og's territories, while Rashi interprets Ashtaroth as a place of strength. Midrash compares Moses to a king in battle, praising the defeat of Sihon and Og. The Talmud discusses the timing of kings' reigns and rejects arguments about Sihon and Aaron. In Tanakh, Israel defeats Sihon and Og, settling in their lands, and in Targum, God defeats Sihon and Og in battle. 

|בְּעֵ֥בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּ֖ן בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מוֹאָ֑ב הוֹאִ֣יל מֹשֶׁ֔ה בֵּאֵ֛ר אֶת־הַתּוֹרָ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את לֵאמֹֽר׃|5|On the other side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to expound this Teaching. He said:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses translated the Torah into 70 languages in the land of Moab to provide comfort to Jews in exile, emphasizing the importance of living as righteous individuals. The Torah was explained in different languages to ensure understanding before entering the Promised Land and prevent sinful behavior, with non-Jews allowed to study the Written Law but not the Oral Law. Deuteronomy represents a covenant between God and Israel, emphasizing the perspective of the receiver. The Midrash discusses the significance of stones and circumcision in relation to divine knowledge, while the Talmud mentions the stones erected in Eretz Yisrael. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain Moses teaching the Torah in the land of Moab. 

|יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֵ֛ינוּ דִּבֶּ֥ר אֵלֵ֖ינוּ בְּחֹרֵ֣ב לֵאמֹ֑ר רַב־לָכֶ֥ם שֶׁ֖בֶת בָּהָ֥ר הַזֶּֽה׃|6|Our God יהוה spoke to us at Horeb, saying: You have stayed long enough at this mountain.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Horeb near Mount Sinai is where the Israelites dwelled after the exodus, with some interpreting Horeb as a region and others as an alternate name for Mount Sinai. Rabbi Hanina warns the court to judge righteously, G-d reassures Moses of his mission and provides Aaron as a spokesman, and Hashem puts effort into learning for students. Abraham is told to remain seated by God as a sign for his children, and God corrects the scribes by waiting for them. Ramban explains that all commandments were told to Moses on Mount Sinai, Jethro arrived before the Giving of the Torah, and the ark contained only the stone tablets of the covenant made at Horeb. Adonoy tells the Israelites at Choreiv that they have spent enough time at the mountain and it is time to move on. 

|פְּנ֣וּ ׀ וּסְע֣וּ לָכֶ֗ם וּבֹ֨אוּ הַ֥ר הָֽאֱמֹרִי֮ וְאֶל־כׇּל־שְׁכֵנָיו֒ בָּעֲרָבָ֥ה בָהָ֛ר וּבַשְּׁפֵלָ֥ה וּבַנֶּ֖גֶב וּבְח֣וֹף הַיָּ֑ם אֶ֤רֶץ הַֽכְּנַעֲנִי֙ וְהַלְּבָנ֔וֹן עַד־הַנָּהָ֥ר הַגָּדֹ֖ל נְהַר־פְּרָֽת׃|7|Start out and make your way to the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, the hill country, the Shephelah,  the Negeb, the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites,  and the Lebanon, as far as the Great River, the river Euphrates.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban emphasizes the command for the Israelites to conquer the Land of Israel as a mitzvah, while Rashi details specific locations they are to journey to. Ibn Ezra explains the style of Scripture in using the phrase "and take your journey," while other commentators provide additional geographical and historical context. In the Halakhah, the great gate leading into the Sanctuary is described in detail. Derashot HaRan highlights the Torah's focus on demonstrable phenomena, while Akeidat Yitzchak explains Yitro's role in reuniting Moses and Tzipporah. The Sifrei Devarim describes the Israelites' journey to various locations, while Bereshit Rabbah discusses the significance of rivers mentioned in Genesis. Metzudat Zion explains the term "bank of the sea" in Judges 5:17:3, Rabbeinu Bahya discusses references to the term "great" in relation to God's name, and Tze'enah Ure'enah emphasizes the importance of being connected to something significant. The Talmud discusses punishments in the afterlife, including those of Balaam and Jesus, as well as the destruction of the King's Mountain and Beitar. In Tanakh, the Tigris and Euphrates rivers are mentioned in Genesis, and the Targum translations of Deuteronomy 1:7 by Onkelos and Targum Jonathan detail the Israelites' journey to various regions. 

|רְאֵ֛ה נָתַ֥תִּי לִפְנֵיכֶ֖ם אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ בֹּ֚אוּ וּרְשׁ֣וּ אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נִשְׁבַּ֣ע יְ֠הֹוָ֠ה לַאֲבֹ֨תֵיכֶ֜ם לְאַבְרָהָ֨ם לְיִצְחָ֤ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹב֙ לָתֵ֣ת לָהֶ֔ם וּלְזַרְעָ֖ם אַחֲרֵיהֶֽם׃|8|See, I place the land at your disposal. Go, take possession of the land that יהוה swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to assign to them and to their heirs after them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how God promised to give the land to the Israelites without them needing to wage war, with the inhabitants being described as fearful and unlikely to resist. The commandment is for the people to dwell in and inherit the Land that God has given to them, reiterating the importance of settling in the Land of Israel. The land was promised to the Israelites by God, with each forefather being worthy of the promise individually, emphasizing the enduring covenant with the tribes. The Targum states that God has given up the land's inhabitants, allowing the Israelites to enter and possess the land as promised to the patriarchs. 

|וָאֹמַ֣ר אֲלֵכֶ֔ם בָּעֵ֥ת הַהִ֖וא לֵאמֹ֑ר לֹא־אוּכַ֥ל לְבַדִּ֖י שְׂאֵ֥ת אֶתְכֶֽם׃|9|Thereupon I said to you, “I cannot bear the burden of you by myself.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses acknowledges his inability to judge the Israelites alone, as instructed by God, leading to the need for new leaders due to the growth of the people and the burden of their wrongdoings. The Midrash emphasizes the importance of having judges with specific attributes to handle the needs of the congregation, while Ramban clarifies the timing of events and Moses' struggle with leadership responsibilities. Targum Jonathan adds that the people will not be left with only one judge, as Moses cannot bear the burden alone. 

|יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֖ם הִרְבָּ֣ה אֶתְכֶ֑ם וְהִנְּכֶ֣ם הַיּ֔וֹם כְּכוֹכְבֵ֥י הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם לָרֹֽב׃|10|Your God יהוה has multiplied you until you are today as numerous as the stars in the sky.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries explore the eternal existence and greatness of the Jewish people, emphasizing the importance of invoking God's name, moral refinement, and the role of Torah in achieving perfection. The text from liturgy is a prayer for God's blessing at the conclusion of Shabbos, while the Midrash discusses the qualities required for judges and the burden of leadership. Rabbenu Bachyah compares creation with the construction of the Tabernacle, and Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan highlight the multiplication of the Jewish people compared to the stars in the sky. 

|יְהֹוָ֞ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֽוֹתֵכֶ֗ם יֹסֵ֧ף עֲלֵיכֶ֛ם כָּכֶ֖ם אֶ֣לֶף פְּעָמִ֑ים וִיבָרֵ֣ךְ אֶתְכֶ֔ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר לָכֶֽם׃|11|May יהוה, the God of your ancestors, increase your numbers a thousandfold, and bless you as promised.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Prayer is seen as a vessel for receiving blessings from God, with the quality of words determining the amount of blessing one can receive. Moses' blessing of the Israelites in Deuteronomy is contrasted with God's unlimited blessings, highlighting the importance of mentioning God's name and the conditional nature of blessings from humans versus unconditional blessings from God. The Priestly Blessing is emphasized in Halakhah as a command to be fruitful and multiply, with the value of life and fertility as promises from God. In the Midrash, Moses' blessings to Israel are connected to Yom Kippur and the acceptance of rebuke, with the Holy One's blessings being more significant than those from intermediaries. The Talmud discusses the prohibition of adding blessings to those already commanded by God, while in Tanakh and Targum, the promise of numerous descendants is highlighted as a blessing from God. 

|אֵיכָ֥ה אֶשָּׂ֖א לְבַדִּ֑י טׇרְחֲכֶ֥ם וּמַֽשַּׂאֲכֶ֖ם וְרִֽיבְכֶֽם׃|12|How can I bear unaided the trouble of you, and the burden, and the bickering!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Moses' efforts to influence Israel through relationships with other tzadikim, as seen in Noam Elimelekh's commentary on Numbers 30:2. Halakhah discusses Rabbi Ritter's argument against women holding public office based on Sifre's interpretation of Deuteronomy 1:12. Jewish Thought explores the metaphorical use of "eychah" by Moses, Isaiah, and Jeremiah to describe Israel's spiritual decline. Midrash reflects Moses' concern about bearing the burden of the quarrelsome Israelites alone, as seen in Sifrei Devarim 12:1. Musar delves into themes of cleanliness, intention in serving God, Adam's sin, Levites' exile, and Israel's exile. Quoting Commentary highlights Rashi's explanation of Moses' instruction to Joshua and Yitro's advice to select competent people for assistance. Tanakh contrasts the once righteous city in Isaiah 1:21 with its current corrupt state, and the desolation of the once great city in Lamentations 1:1. Targum presents Onkelos and Targum Jonathan's questions on how Moses can bear the burdens and contentions of the people alone. 

|הָב֣וּ לָ֠כֶ֠ם אֲנָשִׁ֨ים חֲכָמִ֧ים וּנְבֹנִ֛ים וִידֻעִ֖ים לְשִׁבְטֵיכֶ֑ם וַאֲשִׂימֵ֖ם בְּרָאשֵׁיכֶֽם׃|13|Pick from each of your tribes candidates  who are wise, discerning, and experienced, and I will appoint them as your heads.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that chabad is the source of all attributes, with chochmah leading to intellect and binah resulting in attributes of love and awe. Judges should embody qualities such as fearing God, being men of truth, and hating unjust gain, as emphasized by Ramban and Rashi. Halakhah outlines seven attributes judges must possess, including wisdom, humility, and fear of God. Kabbalah warns against those who exert power over a congregation, especially orphans. Liturgy involves giving thanks and praise to God through songs and hymns. Midrash discusses the qualities judges should possess and the consequences of not judging wisely. Mishnah details the priority of payment in the case of a man married to two women. Musar emphasizes the heavy burden of leadership and the importance of humility and avoiding flattery. Talmud discusses the benefits of fulfilling conjugal mitzvot. Targum mentions the selection of wise and understanding men as chiefs. 

|וַֽתַּעֲנ֖וּ אֹתִ֑י וַתֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ טֽוֹב־הַדָּבָ֥ר אֲשֶׁר־דִּבַּ֖רְתָּ לַעֲשֽׂוֹת׃|14|You answered me and said, “What you propose to do is good.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that the Israelites agreed to Moses' proposal despite their preference to learn directly from him, while Or HaChaim suggests they were willing to learn from Moses' disciples to ease his burden. Tur HaArokh emphasizes the need for judges with outstanding qualities, and Siftei Chakhamim clarifies that the Israelites responded with determination for their own benefit. The Midrash highlights the Israelites' questions about Torah learning and the appointment of judges, while the Musar teaches not to fear man in judgment. In Deuteronomy 1:14, the people consented to Moses appointing deputies, similar to their agreement to send spies in Deuteronomy 1:23, showing involvement in controlling their destiny. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan convey the response to Moses' proposal as good and right in Deuteronomy 1:14. 

|וָאֶקַּ֞ח אֶת־רָאשֵׁ֣י שִׁבְטֵיכֶ֗ם אֲנָשִׁ֤ים חֲכָמִים֙ וִֽידֻעִ֔ים וָאֶתֵּ֥ן אוֹתָ֛ם רָאשִׁ֖ים עֲלֵיכֶ֑ם שָׂרֵ֨י אֲלָפִ֜ים וְשָׂרֵ֣י מֵא֗וֹת וְשָׂרֵ֤י חֲמִשִּׁים֙ וְשָׂרֵ֣י עֲשָׂרֹ֔ת וְשֹׁטְרִ֖ים לְשִׁבְטֵיכֶֽם׃|15|So I took your tribal leaders, wise and experienced men,  and appointed them heads over you: chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens, and officials for your tribes.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses appointed leaders over tribes based on wisdom, righteousness, and renown, setting the precedent for judicial authority. Judges must possess good character traits, wisdom, and valiance, as detailed in Sanhedrin. The concept of Chukkim emphasizes respecting all beings and using resources wisely. Showing respect to elders and Torah scholars is crucial, with consequences for failing to do so. Josephus established a system of governance in Galilee, delegating power to local leaders. The Talmud discusses the importance of fulfilling conjugal mitzvot for exceptional offspring. Leaders were appointed based on wisdom, knowledge, and prudence, with guidelines for showing respect to elders in the Tosefta. 

|וָאֲצַוֶּה֙ אֶת־שֹׁ֣פְטֵיכֶ֔ם בָּעֵ֥ת הַהִ֖וא לֵאמֹ֑ר שָׁמֹ֤עַ בֵּין־אֲחֵיכֶם֙ וּשְׁפַטְתֶּ֣ם צֶ֔דֶק בֵּֽין־אִ֥ישׁ וּבֵין־אָחִ֖יו וּבֵ֥ין גֵּרֽוֹ׃|16|I charged your magistrates at that time as follows, “Hear out your fellow Israelites, and decide justly between one party and the other—be it a fellow Israelite or a stranger.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy, judges are instructed to be patient, listen to both sides, judge fairly, and avoid favoritism, ensuring justice for all parties involved. Judges must not show bias, treat all people fairly, and aim for righteous judgment reflecting the truth. It is crucial for judges to be impartial, deliberate, respectful towards the community, and bear patiently with them, ensuring thorough investigation before announcing a verdict. Additionally, flattery is condemned as it diminishes true worship, and judges must ensure both sides are present before hearing arguments, judge each case on its merits, and make prompt judgments. The Torah emphasizes the importance of fair judgment, compassion towards strangers, and the urgency of upholding justice. 

|לֹֽא־תַכִּ֨ירוּ פָנִ֜ים בַּמִּשְׁפָּ֗ט כַּקָּטֹ֤ן כַּגָּדֹל֙ תִּשְׁמָע֔וּן לֹ֤א תָג֙וּרוּ֙ מִפְּנֵי־אִ֔ישׁ כִּ֥י הַמִּשְׁפָּ֖ט לֵאלֹהִ֣ים ה֑וּא וְהַדָּבָר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִקְשֶׁ֣ה מִכֶּ֔ם תַּקְרִב֥וּן אֵלַ֖י וּשְׁמַעְתִּֽיו׃|17|You shall not be partial in judgment: hear out low and high alike. Fear neither party,  for judgment is God’s. And any matter that is too difficult for you, you shall bring to me and I will hear it.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes self-reflection on Rosh HaShanah to hear the Supernal Voice, while the commentary warns judges against favoritism and fear in their rulings. Halakhah prohibits appointing unlearned judges and recusing due to fear, stressing the importance of fair judgment. Jewish Thought explores the ethical considerations for judges and the significance of character traits in justice. Kabbalah discusses the role of judges in executing divine judgment, while Midrash highlights the need for fairness and integrity in courts. Musar emphasizes honesty and fairness in judgment, cautioning against appointing unqualified judges. Quoting Commentary praises God's eternal kindness, while Responsa and Second Temple texts underscore the accountability of judges to God. Talmud stresses the importance of unbiased judgment, and Tanakh and Targum emphasize impartiality in hearing all matters. Tosefta discusses the sins that led to the decline of Torah honor and the departure of the Shekhinah from Israel. 

|וָאֲצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם בָּעֵ֣ת הַהִ֑וא אֵ֥ת כׇּל־הַדְּבָרִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּעֲשֽׂוּן׃|18|Thus I instructed you, at that time, about the various things that you should do.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the importance of identifying oneself according to paternal lineage, contrasting Israelites and gentiles. Moses taught the people the statutes and laws personally, appointing judges with consultation from God. Me'iri states that it is permitted to give instruction to a prospective convert, and a non-Jew may observe the Sabbath once he has decided to convert. Derashot HaRan emphasizes Torah study as a life-saving drug. The Midrash stresses treating all cases with respect and the need for judges and the community to bear with each other. The Talmud outlines differences between cases of monetary and capital law, including the requirement for inquiry and interrogation of witnesses. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan highlight God's commandments related to judgments of money and life. 

|וַנִּסַּ֣ע מֵחֹרֵ֗ב וַנֵּ֡לֶךְ אֵ֣ת כׇּל־הַמִּדְבָּ֣ר הַגָּדוֹל֩ וְהַנּוֹרָ֨א הַה֜וּא אֲשֶׁ֣ר רְאִיתֶ֗ם דֶּ֚רֶךְ הַ֣ר הָֽאֱמֹרִ֔י כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוָּ֛ה יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ אֹתָ֑נוּ וַנָּבֹ֕א עַ֖ד קָדֵ֥שׁ בַּרְנֵֽעַ׃|19|We set out from Horeb and traveled the great and terrible wilderness that you saw, along the road to the hill country of the Amorites, as our God יהוה had commanded us. When we reached Kadesh-barnea,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The wilderness the Israelites traveled through was described as great and fearful due to the presence of large snakes and scorpions, a necessary test of faith in God's protection. The Holy Land was significant in prophecy, with various biblical figures tied to the land and significant events occurring there. Various commentators provide interpretations of specific locations and events in the journey of the Israelites through the wilderness towards Kadesh Barnea. 

|וָאֹמַ֖ר אֲלֵכֶ֑ם בָּאתֶם֙ עַד־הַ֣ר הָאֱמֹרִ֔י אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ נֹתֵ֥ן לָֽנוּ׃|20|I said to you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which our God יהוה is giving to us.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses reminds the Israelites they have reached the Emorite highlands, as instructed by God, and appoints judges to enforce laws and teach Torah, possibly avoiding mention of Jethro's advice due to humility or personal reasons. The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 1:20 also confirm the arrival at the Emorite hill region given by God. 

|רְ֠אֵ֠ה נָתַ֨ן יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ לְפָנֶ֖יךָ אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ עֲלֵ֣ה רֵ֗שׁ כַּאֲשֶׁר֩ דִּבֶּ֨ר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֱלֹהֵ֤י אֲבֹתֶ֙יךָ֙ לָ֔ךְ אַל־תִּירָ֖א וְאַל־תֵּחָֽת׃|21|See, your God יהוה has placed the land at your disposal. Go up, take possession, as יהוה, the God of your fathers, promised you. Fear not and be not dismayed.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra connects "resh" to "yerushah" and "techat" to "yiddal," Sforno states no opposition for Israelites, Rabbeinu Bahya mentions the protective angel of the Canaanites was dealt with, Rav Hirsch interprets "techat" as broken or dismayed, Steinsaltz urges Israelites to ascend without fear, Tze'enah Ure'enah notes the Canaanite angel thrown before Israel. Midrash discusses Israelites' lack of faith leading to delay in entering Promised Land, Ramban explains God's initial forbidding of Balaam to curse Israel, Talmud explains slaughter from the neck, Tanakh promises a messenger for Israelites' protection, and Targums encourage Israelites to possess the land without fear. 

|וַתִּקְרְב֣וּן אֵלַי֮ כֻּלְּכֶם֒ וַתֹּאמְר֗וּ נִשְׁלְחָ֤ה אֲנָשִׁים֙ לְפָנֵ֔ינוּ וְיַחְפְּרוּ־לָ֖נוּ אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ וְיָשִׁ֤בוּ אֹתָ֙נוּ֙ דָּבָ֔ר אֶת־הַדֶּ֙רֶךְ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נַעֲלֶה־בָּ֔הּ וְאֵת֙ הֶֽעָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָבֹ֖א אֲלֵיהֶֽן׃|22|Then all of you came to me and said, “Let us send agents  ahead to reconnoiter the land for us and bring back word on the route we shall follow and the cities we shall come to.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Moses praying for Joshua's protection from the spies' evil influence during the mission to Canaan, emphasizing the importance of Torah observance in establishing a relationship with the land. Commentary from Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Tur HaArokh, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Siftei Chakhamim provides insights into the Israelites' approach to sending spies and the strategic aspects involved. Jewish Thought raises questions about Moses' actions, the consequences of lack of faith, and the significance of sending spies. Midrash highlights the Israelites' lack of faith, punishment for not entering the land, and the unnecessary sending of spies. Musar discusses the Israelites' sin in requesting spies, the wisdom of sending only two spies, and the importance of humility in approaching Moses. Quoting Commentary presents various perspectives on God's covenant with Noah, Moses sending spies, and the long-lasting repercussions of the spies' mission. Talmud explores the motivations behind the Israelites' request for spies, the attribution of actions to individuals and the people, and the significance of the golden calf incident. Tanakh instructs Moses to send scouts to Canaan, while Targum discusses the Israelites collectively approaching Moses to send men to spy out the land. 

|וַיִּיטַ֥ב בְּעֵינַ֖י הַדָּבָ֑ר וָאֶקַּ֤ח מִכֶּם֙ שְׁנֵ֣ים עָשָׂ֣ר אֲנָשִׁ֔ים אִ֥ישׁ אֶחָ֖ד לַשָּֽׁבֶט׃|23|I approved of the plan, and so I selected from among you twelve participants, one representative from each tribe.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how Bnei Yisrael's request to send spies to Eretz Yisrael, which seemed good in Moshe's eyes, was actually a reason for rebuke as it reflected poorly on their behavior and impacted their leaders. Moses did not praise the twelve spies for their leadership roles as they acted wickedly, with Rashi explaining that Moses consented to their request to send spies, thinking they would reconsider but they did not. The spies were chosen by Moses and God, but they turned against them and caused trouble for the generation, despite initially being considered righteous. Moses agreed to the request from the people to send spies, believing it was a tactical move to ensure success in conquering the land, reflecting his desire to involve the people in shaping their destiny and military strategy. 

|וַיִּפְנוּ֙ וַיַּעֲל֣וּ הָהָ֔רָה וַיָּבֹ֖אוּ עַד־נַ֣חַל אֶשְׁכֹּ֑ל וַֽיְרַגְּל֖וּ אֹתָֽהּ׃|24|They made for the hill country, came to the wadi Eshcol, and spied it out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The spies explored the land from the Brook of Eshcol, deviating from their righteous path towards the mountain, investigating the nature of the land and its people instead of just searching for hidden valuables. Spies typically go up mountains, as seen with Rachav warning Joshua's spies to hide on a mountain to avoid pursuers, demonstrating the holy spirit upon her. The word "spies" is significant in the Bible, appearing multiple times in certain chapters like Genesis 42 and Deuteronomy 1:22-24, using the verbs laḥpor and leragel. The Israelite spies scouted the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob at Lebo-hamath using these verbs, exploring Wadi Eshkol, also known as the stream of Ethkela or the stream of the Grapes in different versions of the Targum on Deuteronomy 1:24. 

|וַיִּקְח֤וּ בְיָדָם֙ מִפְּרִ֣י הָאָ֔רֶץ וַיּוֹרִ֖דוּ אֵלֵ֑ינוּ וַיָּשִׁ֨בוּ אֹתָ֤נוּ דָבָר֙ וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ טוֹבָ֣ה הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ נֹתֵ֥ן לָֽנוּ׃|25|They took some of the fruit of the land with them and brought it down to us. And they gave us this report: “It is a good land that our God יהוה is giving to us.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses sent spies to Canaan who brought back a positive report about the land, but only Joshua and Caleb spoke positively about it while the others spread fear. The people should have believed the positive reports, as the negative comments were not part of their mission. The spies hid their negative report from Moses, who had firsthand knowledge of the land. The people's lack of faith, not God's shortcomings, led to their refusal to enter the land, but they repented and offered to conquer it. Moses was disappointed with the spies' focus on physical aspects of the land instead of recognizing its spiritual significance. Despite the promise of a good land, the Israelites were hesitant to proceed. 

|וְלֹ֥א אֲבִיתֶ֖ם לַעֲלֹ֑ת וַתַּמְר֕וּ אֶת־פִּ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶֽם׃|26|Yet you refused to go up, and flouted the command of your God יהוה.|

The Israelites showed disbelief in God's promise to conquer Canaan as a gift, leading to their refusal to enter the land despite a positive report from the spies. This betrayal resulted in a plague in the wilderness, angering God and preventing Moses from entering the promised land (Deut. 1:26, 28). The Midrash discusses interpretations related to lending, borrowing, legal judgments, and the importance of the Torah, while Rashi explains the term "אֲבִיּוֹנָה" in Ecclesiastes 12:5 as a reference to the desire for women. Shaphat, son of Hori, represented the tribe of Simeon in scouting Canaan (Numbers 13:5), and the Targum highlights the Israelites' rebellion against God's command by believing the negative report of the spies (Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 1:26). 

|וַתֵּרָגְנ֤וּ בְאׇהֳלֵיכֶם֙ וַתֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ בְּשִׂנְאַ֤ת יְהֹוָה֙ אֹתָ֔נוּ הוֹצִיאָ֖נוּ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם לָתֵ֥ת אֹתָ֛נוּ בְּיַ֥ד הָאֱמֹרִ֖י לְהַשְׁמִידֵֽנוּ׃|27|You sulked  in your tents and said, “It is out of hatred for us that יהוה brought us out of the land of Egypt, to hand us over to the Amorites to wipe us out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that the Israelites interpreted God's actions as stemming from hatred because they themselves hated Him, while Sforno suggests they believed God was delivering them to the Emorites as an act of revenge. The Midrash texts discuss the consequences of the Israelites' lack of faith and murmuring, leading to punishment and exile. The Musar text highlights how speaking negatively about others can stem from a tendency to complain and criticize, resulting in misinterpreting others' actions as malicious. The Talmud records Shimon ben Tarfon's interpretation of the Jewish people's response to the spies' slander as a combination of exploring and disparaging the land in the tent of the Omnipresent, while Targum translations depict the Israelites grumbling in fear and questioning God's intentions. 

|אָנָ֣ה ׀ אֲנַ֣חְנוּ עֹלִ֗ים אַחֵ֩ינוּ֩ הֵמַ֨סּוּ אֶת־לְבָבֵ֜נוּ לֵאמֹ֗ר עַ֣ם גָּד֤וֹל וָרָם֙ מִמֶּ֔נּוּ עָרִ֛ים גְּדֹלֹ֥ת וּבְצוּרֹ֖ת בַּשָּׁמָ֑יִם וְגַם־בְּנֵ֥י עֲנָקִ֖ים רָאִ֥ינוּ שָֽׁם׃|28|What kind of place  are we going to? Our brothers have taken the heart out of us, saying, ‘We saw there a people stronger and taller than we, large cities with walls sky-high, and even Anakites.’”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The exaggerated descriptions of the fortified cities in Canaan caused the Israelites to lose heart and desire to return to Egypt, leading to punishments and exile. Prophecies in Scripture are often given in exaggerated language that requires interpretation, such as in the description of the Third Beit HaMikdash's side-chambers. The sin of the spies was not in describing the land negatively but in undermining Jewish morale, contrasting with Moses' later similar description of the inhabitants. The Talmud discusses examples of exaggerated language in the Torah and Prophets, while the Tanakh lists the descendants of Adam and highlights Noah as the one who will provide relief from humanity's toil. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the Israelites feeling discouraged by reports of powerful people and giants in the land they were supposed to conquer. 

|וָאֹמַ֖ר אֲלֵכֶ֑ם לֹא־תַעַרְצ֥וּן וְלֹא־תִֽירְא֖וּן מֵהֶֽם׃|29|I said to you, “Have no dread or fear of them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz interpret "לא תערצון" as a command not to be broken by fear or dread, to gather strength and not be intimidated. Sforno, Rabbeinu Bahya, Redeeming Relevance, and Chizkuni discuss Moses' response to the people's fear, his fear of Og, lack of leadership during the spies incident, and Caleb's support of Moses. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan convey the message in Deuteronomy 1:29 to not be broken-hearted or fearful when facing challenges. 

|יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶם֙ הַהֹלֵ֣ךְ לִפְנֵיכֶ֔ם ה֖וּא יִלָּחֵ֣ם לָכֶ֑ם כְּ֠כֹ֠ל אֲשֶׁ֨ר עָשָׂ֧ה אִתְּכֶ֛ם בְּמִצְרַ֖יִם לְעֵינֵיכֶֽם׃|30|None other than your God יהוה, who goes before you, will fight for you, just as [God] did for you in Egypt before your very eyes,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Haamek Davar, and Steinsaltz explain that "ילחם לכם" means God will fight on behalf of the Israelites, emphasizing His intention to help them in battle. The Mishnah states that the priest anointed for war addresses soldiers in Hebrew before battle, reminding them not to fear their enemies and to trust in God's protection. The Targum reiterates that Adonoy will lead and fight for the Israelites, as He did in Egypt. 

|וּבַמִּדְבָּר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָאִ֔יתָ אֲשֶׁ֤ר נְשָׂאֲךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר יִשָּׂא־אִ֖ישׁ אֶת־בְּנ֑וֹ בְּכׇל־הַדֶּ֙רֶךְ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הֲלַכְתֶּ֔ם עַד־בֹּאֲכֶ֖ם עַד־הַמָּק֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|31|and in the wilderness, where you saw how your God יהוה carried you, as a householder  carries his son,  all the way that you traveled until you came to this place.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi connects Deuteronomy 1:31 to God's kindness in Egypt and the wilderness, Sforno emphasizes God's protection from predators, Siftei Chakhamim mentions God's acts of war and love for the Jewish people, Steinsaltz likens God's care in the wilderness to a father's love. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai discusses God's revelation in a thorn bush symbolizing compassion, humility, and protection for Israel. The Second Temple text contrasts God's unchangeable nature with human mortality, emphasizing gender-specific traits. Tanakh verses highlight God's protection over Israel and Moses' trustworthiness. Targums explain God carrying Israel like a father, protecting and guiding them in the wilderness. 

|וּבַדָּבָ֖ר הַזֶּ֑ה אֵֽינְכֶם֙ מַאֲמִינִ֔ם בַּיהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶֽם׃|32|Yet for all that, you have no faith in your God יהוה,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites lacked faith in God's promise and doubted His miracles despite witnessing them, leading to a lack of reliance on Him and disobedience to His commandments and covenant, as highlighted in Deuteronomy 1:32 and other verses. This lack of faith resulted in punishment for Moses and the Israelites, as emphasized in various commentaries and translations of the text. 

|הַהֹלֵ֨ךְ לִפְנֵיכֶ֜ם בַּדֶּ֗רֶךְ לָת֥וּר לָכֶ֛ם מָק֖וֹם לַחֲנֹֽתְכֶ֑ם בָּאֵ֣שׁ ׀ לַ֗יְלָה לַרְאֹֽתְכֶם֙ בַּדֶּ֙רֶךְ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תֵּֽלְכוּ־בָ֔הּ וּבֶעָנָ֖ן יוֹמָֽם׃|33|who goes before you on your journeys—to scout the place where you are to encamp—in fire by night and in cloud by day, in order to guide you on the route you are to follow.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains the similarity between "לראתכם" and "לְהַרְאֹתְכֶם," Ibn Ezra clarifies "לחנותכם" as a non-transitive verb, Sforno links seeking a place to pitch tents with seeking rest in the desert, and Steinsaltz describes God leading the Israelites. The Torah's order of events is intentional, the spies' lack of faith led to slander, G'd's punishment was individualized, the forty-year delay was due to disloyalty, and the ark symbolized divine protection. The presence of clouds above the Israelites in the desert provided protection, guidance, and assistance. The Israelites did not need spies as God guided them with a pillar of cloud and fire, leading them throughout their journey. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain that God went ahead of the Israelites, providing guidance with a pillar of fire at night and a pillar of cloud by day. 

|וַיִּשְׁמַ֥ע יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶת־ק֣וֹל דִּבְרֵיכֶ֑ם וַיִּקְצֹ֖ף וַיִּשָּׁבַ֥ע לֵאמֹֽר׃|34|יהוה heard your loud complaint and, becoming angry, vowed:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary highlights the distinction between Moses' unintentional sin and the people's deliberate sin, leading to their punishment. The Midrash emphasizes the power of speech and the consequences of speaking ill of others, including God. Musar warns against gossip and evil speech, stating that Torah study does not protect those engaged in such sins. The Targum states that God heard the Israelites' intentions and swore to punish them for their complaints. 

|אִם־יִרְאֶ֥ה אִישׁ֙ בָּאֲנָשִׁ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה הַדּ֥וֹר הָרָ֖ע הַזֶּ֑ה אֵ֚ת הָאָ֣רֶץ הַטּוֹבָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר נִשְׁבַּ֔עְתִּי לָתֵ֖ת לַאֲבֹתֵיכֶֽם׃|35|Not one of those involved, this evil generation, shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The generation in Deuteronomy 1:35 is described as wicked, with some believing Hashem was unable to help them or not wanting His providence. Despite an oath to give the land to their fathers, none of the wicked generation will see the good land. Moses is rebuked by God for not entering the Promised Land due to his anger towards the Israelites, strikes a rock to provide water, and is concerned for Israel's wealth. Death at age 60 is seen as a punishment, with the word "bklḥ" in Job having a numerical value of 60. The Targum states that none of the wicked generation will see the good land promised to their forefathers. 

|זֽוּלָתִ֞י כָּלֵ֤ב בֶּן־יְפֻנֶּה֙ ה֣וּא יִרְאֶ֔נָּה וְלֽוֹ־אֶתֵּ֧ן אֶת־הָאָ֛רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר דָּֽרַךְ־בָּ֖הּ וּלְבָנָ֑יו יַ֕עַן אֲשֶׁ֥ר מִלֵּ֖א אַחֲרֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|36|none except Caleb son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and his descendants will I give the land on which he set foot, because he remained loyal to יהוה.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Caleb receives Hebron as his portion of the land for his courage and loyalty, standing against the majority report of the spies. In the Mishnah, Beit Shammai allows a husband to prevent marital relations for up to two weeks before divorce, while Beit Hillel requires divorce after one week. The Tanakh mentions Caleb encouraging the people to conquer the land despite challenges, and in the Targum, Caleb is praised for his fear of the Lord and integrity. 

|גַּם־בִּי֙ הִתְאַנַּ֣ף יְהֹוָ֔ה בִּגְלַלְכֶ֖ם לֵאמֹ֑ר גַּם־אַתָּ֖ה לֹא־תָבֹ֥א שָֽׁם׃|37|Because of you יהוה was incensed with me too, saying: You shall not enter it either.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses was denied entry into the Promised Land as a consequence of the sins of the Israelites, with Rabbis suggesting that this punishment was ultimately for their benefit. The penalty for Moses and Aaron's errors included denial of leadership, entry into the holy land, and premature death due to rebellion against God. Moses' inability to enter the land was attributed to the unworthiness of the generation, as he desired to be closest to the Temple. The sin of Moses and Aaron at the waters of Meribah involved Moses hitting the rock instead of speaking to it as instructed by God, with various commentators offering different interpretations. Adonoy's anger towards Moses was due to the actions of the Israelites, leading to his exclusion from the Promised Land. 

|יְהוֹשֻׁ֤עַ בִּן־נוּן֙ הָעֹמֵ֣ד לְפָנֶ֔יךָ ה֖וּא יָ֣בֹא שָׁ֑מָּה אֹת֣וֹ חַזֵּ֔ק כִּי־ה֖וּא יַנְחִלֶ֥נָּה אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|38|Joshua son of Nun, who attends you, he shall enter it. Imbue him with strength, for he shall allot it to Israel.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Steinsaltz explain that Joshua will inherit leadership from Moses and should be strengthened for this role. The spies' fear of the people of Canaan reflected a lack of spiritual elevation, contrasting with Caleb's call to go up, which was praised by God. Moses was not allowed to enter the Promised Land, but Joshua was chosen to lead instead. Moshe tells the Israelites that Yehoshua will lead them into the Promised Land and instructs them to strengthen him for this role, as stated in Deuteronomy 1:37-38 in the Tanakh and Targum. 

|וְטַפְּכֶם֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֲמַרְתֶּ֜ם לָבַ֣ז יִהְיֶ֗ה וּ֠בְנֵיכֶ֠ם אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹא־יָדְע֤וּ הַיּוֹם֙ ט֣וֹב וָרָ֔ע הֵ֖מָּה יָבֹ֣אוּ שָׁ֑מָּה וְלָהֶ֣ם אֶתְּנֶ֔נָּה וְהֵ֖ם יִירָשֽׁוּהָ׃|39|Moreover, your little ones who you said would be carried off, your children who do not yet know good from bad, they shall enter it; to them will I give it and they shall possess it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains "this day" as a reference to God punishing the generation that left Egypt, not Moses reviewing the Torah. Rav Hirsch interprets "children" as reaching moral responsibility when they can distinguish good from evil. Steinsaltz highlights God's promise that children who do not yet know good and evil will inherit Canaan. The text from Genesis 1:1 states that God began creating heaven and earth. The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 1:39 emphasize that the young children of Israel who do not understand good and evil will inherit the promised land. 

|וְאַתֶּ֖ם פְּנ֣וּ לָכֶ֑ם וּסְע֥וּ הַמִּדְבָּ֖רָה דֶּ֥רֶךְ יַם־סֽוּף׃|40|As for you, turn about and march into the wilderness by the way of the Sea of Reeds.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites were supposed to pass through Edom but were instructed to turn back and travel through the wilderness towards the Red Sea due to their degeneracy, leading to their wandering until death. In Numbers 21, the Israelites were taken captive after a war with the king of Canaan, changing course to the Reed Sea where they were punished for their reaction to the scouts. After Aaron's death, the Israelites turned back on the way to the Red Sea, mourning for him at Moserah even though he died at Mount Hor. The Israelites grew restless on the journey towards Edom, but God split the sea for them to pass through on dry ground, leading to their gaining faith in God and Moses. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan provide different translations for Deuteronomy 1:40, emphasizing the command to turn back into the wilderness. 

|וַֽתַּעֲנ֣וּ ׀ וַתֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלַ֗י חָטָ֘אנוּ֮ לַיהֹוָה֒ אֲנַ֤חְנוּ נַעֲלֶה֙ וְנִלְחַ֔מְנוּ כְּכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֖נוּ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֑ינוּ וַֽתַּחְגְּר֗וּ אִ֚ישׁ אֶת־כְּלֵ֣י מִלְחַמְתּ֔וֹ וַתָּהִ֖ינוּ לַעֲלֹ֥ת הָהָֽרָה׃|41|You replied to me, saying, “We stand guilty before יהוה. We will go up now and fight, just as our God יהוה commanded us.” And [the men among] you each girded yourselves with war gear and recklessly  started for the hill country.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 1:41, the Israelites are emphasized to go up and fight themselves, ready and willing to ascend the mountain. Midrash texts discuss the Israelites' conflicting beliefs, disobedience, lack of faith, fear, and punishment for not trusting in God. Ramban, Sforno, Malbim, and Chizkuni provide interpretations of the Israelites' transgressions and disobedience. In Habakkuk 2:5, the defiant and treacherous will face punishment for their arrogance and insatiability. The Targum highlights the Israelites admitting their sin, deciding to fight as commanded, and arming themselves to ascend the mountain. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֵלַ֗י אֱמֹ֤ר לָהֶם֙ לֹ֤א תַֽעֲלוּ֙ וְלֹא־תִלָּ֣חֲמ֔וּ כִּ֥י אֵינֶ֖נִּי בְּקִרְבְּכֶ֑ם וְלֹא֙ תִּנָּ֣גְפ֔וּ לִפְנֵ֖י אֹיְבֵיכֶֽם׃|42|But יהוה said to me, “Warn them: Do not go up and do not fight, since I am not in your midst; else you will be routed by your enemies.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that "do not go up" in Deuteronomy 1:42 means there will be no victory, only defeat, while Siftei Chakhamim suggests not going up will prevent war and going up will lead to downfall. Steinsaltz emphasizes that not going up and making war is because God is not with them, and obedience will prevent defeat. The Midrash discusses the significance of the land of Canaan, the consequences of Israel's disobedience, and the importance of faith and perseverance. In Song of Songs 3:1:2, Rashi links the inability to find the beloved to past sins. In Deuteronomy 1:42, both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain that God instructed the Israelites not to go up and wage war because His presence was not with them, to prevent defeat. 

|וָאֲדַבֵּ֥ר אֲלֵיכֶ֖ם וְלֹ֣א שְׁמַעְתֶּ֑ם וַתַּמְרוּ֙ אֶת־פִּ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה וַתָּזִ֖דוּ וַתַּעֲל֥וּ הָהָֽרָה׃|43|I spoke to you, but you would not listen; you flouted יהוה’s command and willfully marched into the hill country.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses rebuked the Israelites for disobeying God's command not to ascend the mountain, emphasizing their lack of fear of violating God's command over their fear of enemies. The text discusses the Israelites' doubts and fears when approaching the land of Canaan, highlighting their belief that God hated them. The consequences of their disobedience and lack of faith led to their inability to enter the Promised Land. The Israelites erred in thinking that ascending the mountain would demonstrate their faith in God and save them, but God was not impressed as their punishment continued. Some people went up violently into the mountain, where the Amorites came out and wounded them, highlighting their rebellion and disobedience. 

|וַיֵּצֵ֨א הָאֱמֹרִ֜י הַיֹּשֵׁ֨ב בָּהָ֤ר הַהוּא֙ לִקְרַאתְכֶ֔ם וַיִּרְדְּפ֣וּ אֶתְכֶ֔ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּעֲשֶׂ֖ינָה הַדְּבֹרִ֑ים וַֽיַּכְּת֥וּ אֶתְכֶ֛ם בְּשֵׂעִ֖יר עַד־חׇרְמָֽה׃|44|Then the Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you like so many bees and chased you, and they crushed you at Hormah in Seir.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Amorites attacked the Israelites like bees, inflicting wounds but not killing them, leading to their own demise shortly after. The pursuit of the Amorites was compared to bees chasing after someone who touches their hives, resulting in their own deaths. Israel's lack of faith led to punishment by not being allowed to enter the Promised Land. The Amorites are referred to as Canaanites in Numbers 14:25:1, with the Amalekites not mentioned because the Amorites were more important. The sweetness of the honeycomb ceased when the First Temple was destroyed, with different opinions on what "nofet tzufim" refers to. The Amalekites and Canaanites attacked the Israelites at Hormah in Numbers 14:45, while in Numbers 21:3, God delivered up the Canaanites and their cities were proscribed, leading to the naming of the place Hormah. The Emorites living in the hills pursued and crushed the Israelites in Se’ir, driving them away like hornets from Gebal to Hormah. 

|וַתָּשֻׁ֥בוּ וַתִּבְכּ֖וּ לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה וְלֹֽא־שָׁמַ֤ע יְהֹוָה֙ בְּקֹ֣לְכֶ֔ם וְלֹ֥א הֶאֱזִ֖ין אֲלֵיכֶֽם׃|45|Again you wept before יהוה; but יהוה would not heed your cry or give ear to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites wept before the Lord in regret for their sins, but their tears did not reverse the punishment as God did not listen to their prayers. The verb "shama" in reference to God can mean perceiving or responding to prayers. Midrash discusses how God's presence and response to prayers are based on the actions of individuals or the Israelites as a whole. Sforno explains that atonement for blasphemy against God can only be achieved through the death of the guilty person. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe how the Israelites' prayers were not accepted despite their weeping before the Lord. 

|וַתֵּשְׁב֥וּ בְקָדֵ֖שׁ יָמִ֣ים רַבִּ֑ים כַּיָּמִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְשַׁבְתֶּֽם׃|46|Thus, after you had remained at Kadesh all that long time,  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites spent 38 years in the wilderness, with 19 years in Kadesh and 19 wandering aimlessly before returning. Abudarham explains God waits for Israel's praises before angels, as seen in Psalms 22:4. The Midrash emphasizes standing while reading Torah and changes in Torah study. Sefer HaYirah 13 stresses rising early for prayer and learning Torah portions for blessings. The Gemara discusses Moses sitting or standing while learning. God instructs Moses and Aaron to purify themselves and take a red heifer for a sin offering. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan paraphrase Deuteronomy 1:46 about Israelites in Kodeish for an extended period.

## Deuteronomy 2

|וַנֵּ֜פֶן וַנִּסַּ֤ע הַמִּדְבָּ֙רָה֙ דֶּ֣רֶךְ יַם־ס֔וּף כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֵלָ֑י וַנָּ֥סׇב אֶת־הַר־שֵׂעִ֖יר יָמִ֥ים רַבִּֽים׃|1|we marched back into the wilderness by the way of the Sea of Reeds, as יהוה had spoken to me, and skirted the hill country of Seir a long time.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The significance of the number eleven in contrast to ten is highlighted in Chasidut, as the Israelites' journey from Chorev to Kadesh Barnea symbolizes a transition towards spiritually negative forces represented by Mount Seir. The Israelites' detour around Edom, Moab, and Mount Seir during their journey is detailed in the commentary, explaining the long time taken to reach their destination due to sin and other factors. The Midrash discusses how events affect both the righteous and the wicked, drawing parallels between various figures in history and highlighting the interconnectedness of actions and consequences. Targum translations confirm the Israelites' lengthy journey through the wilderness, circling Mount Seir and other locations for an extended period. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֵלַ֥י לֵאמֹֽר׃|2|Then יהוה said to me:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Lord spoke to Moses after forty years at Kadesh, with prophecy involving the Active Intellect influencing the rational and imaginative faculties, often conveyed through a dream or prophetic vision. The struggles of Joab with various nations highlight the importance of the Sanhedrin and Torah in achieving justice and vindication. The Divine presence returned to the Israelites after leaving Sinai, with Moses receiving new commands after the incident with the spies. Moses reasoned an a fortiori inference when deciding to wage war with the Midianites. 

|רַב־לָכֶ֕ם סֹ֖ב אֶת־הָהָ֣ר הַזֶּ֑ה פְּנ֥וּ לָכֶ֖ם צָפֹֽנָה׃|3|You have been skirting this hill country long enough; now turn north.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 2:3:1 discusses the Israelites turning northward along the eastern side of Moab, with interpretations including hiding from Esau in exile, a warning against making common cause with those who will destroy the Temple, and a command to turn to the north after circling Mount Se'ir, emphasizing the importance of honoring parents. The Midrash highlights the importance of seeking counsel before engaging in warfare, using examples from Dama ben Netina, Esau, and David's victories over Edom and Moab. The Targum instructions in Deuteronomy 2:3 from Onkelos and Targum Jonathan convey a similar message of turning northward after circling the mountain. 

|וְאֶת־הָעָם֮ צַ֣ו לֵאמֹר֒ אַתֶּ֣ם עֹֽבְרִ֗ים בִּגְבוּל֙ אֲחֵיכֶ֣ם בְּנֵי־עֵשָׂ֔ו הַיֹּשְׁבִ֖ים בְּשֵׂעִ֑יר וְיִֽירְא֣וּ מִכֶּ֔ם וְנִשְׁמַרְתֶּ֖ם מְאֹֽד׃|4|And charge the people as follows: You will be passing through the territory of your kin, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. Though they will be afraid of you, be very careful|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The descendants of Esau are considered "brothers" to the Israelites due to their shared descent from Abraham through Isaac, in contrast to Ishmael and Midian who are excluded from this brotherhood. The Israelites are instructed to pass through the territory of the Edomites peacefully, as they will fear the Israelites due to their size and strength, and the Israelites are warned to be cautious in their interactions with them. The Law aims to balance indulgence and self-denial, cultivating virtues like generosity and patience. The Midrash discusses passing through Edom, highlighting the role of Joab and Torah in achieving vindication, emphasizing the need to eradicate Edom gradually, and exploring the covenant and elevation of Israel through Torah. Ramban and Radak provide interpretations related to Israel's interactions with Esau's descendants, while Targum emphasizes caution as the Israelites pass through the territory of their brethren, the children of Esau. 

|אַל־תִּתְגָּר֣וּ בָ֔ם כִּ֠י לֹֽא־אֶתֵּ֤ן לָכֶם֙ מֵֽאַרְצָ֔ם עַ֖ד מִדְרַ֣ךְ כַּף־רָ֑גֶל כִּֽי־יְרֻשָּׁ֣ה לְעֵשָׂ֔ו נָתַ֖תִּי אֶת־הַ֥ר שֵׂעִֽיר׃|5|not to provoke them. For I will not give you of their land so much as a foot can tread on; I have given the hill country of Seir as a possession to Esau.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that the Israelites needed permission to enter the land of Edom, as it was given to Esau's descendants as an inheritance. The Hivites and Refa'im are interchangeable terms in the list of nations in Canaan. The Torah warns against harassing the Edomites, who are considered brothers to the Israelites. Gentiles inherit from their fathers by Torah law, as seen with Esau and Lot's descendants. Jacob and Esau part ways peacefully, with Esau heading to Seir. 

|אֹ֣כֶל תִּשְׁבְּר֧וּ מֵֽאִתָּ֛ם בַּכֶּ֖סֶף וַאֲכַלְתֶּ֑ם וְגַם־מַ֜יִם תִּכְר֧וּ מֵאִתָּ֛ם בַּכֶּ֖סֶף וּשְׁתִיתֶֽם׃|6|What food you eat you shall obtain from them for money; even the water you drink you shall procure from them for money.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 2:6:1 emphasizes obtaining food and water from neighboring nations with consent and for a full price, not by force, with some suggesting the Israelites did not actually need to purchase provisions. Admonishment is crucial for Teshuvah, with five deeds locking the paths of repentance, and congregations should appoint a sage for this purpose. Arrogance is equated to idolatry in Kabbalah, with those exhibiting it not being resurrected. The fifteenth of Ab was a joyous festival allowing intermarriage between tribes, and Moses sought passage through Edom and Moav, following traditions. The Talmud discusses buying food and water from Gentiles, with certain foods permitted and exceptions for bread. Targum Jonathan states that food and water should be purchased for consumption. 

|כִּי֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ בֵּֽרַכְךָ֗ בְּכֹל֙ מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יָדֶ֔ךָ יָדַ֣ע לֶכְתְּךָ֔ אֶת־הַמִּדְבָּ֥ר הַגָּדֹ֖ל הַזֶּ֑ה זֶ֣ה ׀ אַרְבָּעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֗ה יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ עִמָּ֔ךְ לֹ֥א חָסַ֖רְתָּ דָּבָֽר׃|7|Indeed, your God יהוה has blessed you in all your undertakings. [God] has watched over your wanderings through this great wilderness; your God יהוה has been with you these past forty years: you have lacked nothing.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses Divine providence upon individuals when they concentrate on God, as seen in the story of Rabbi Yossi. God blessed the Israelites with wealth and provisions in the wilderness, providing for their every need. The Torah promises rewards and punishments based on observance, with the ultimate reward being the world to come. The relationship between Israel and God is explored through comparisons, including the temples and the complaints of the Israelites in the desert. The Midrash texts discuss the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, emphasizing God's provision and the consequences of ingratitude. The Tosefta discusses Divine punishment and beneficence, comparing Abraham's actions to God's care for his descendants and describing visions of healing waters flowing from Jerusalem. 

|וַֽנַּעֲבֹ֞ר מֵאֵ֧ת אַחֵ֣ינוּ בְנֵי־עֵשָׂ֗ו הַיֹּֽשְׁבִים֙ בְּשֵׂעִ֔יר מִדֶּ֙רֶךְ֙ הָֽעֲרָבָ֔ה מֵאֵילַ֖ת וּמֵעֶצְיֹ֣ן גָּ֑בֶר וַנֵּ֙פֶן֙ וַֽנַּעֲבֹ֔ר דֶּ֖רֶךְ מִדְבַּ֥ר מוֹאָֽב׃|8|We then moved on, away from our kin, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the road of the Arabah, away from Elath and Ezion-geber; and we marched on in the direction of the wilderness of Moab.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites maintained brotherly relations with the children of Esau while avoiding conflict, despite turning away from the paths of the Lord and Torah, resulting in a smaller Eretz Yisrael. The Torah prohibits Moabite converts due to their lack of hospitality, contrasting with the positive relationship with Edom. Jacob sent a tithe to Esau to appease him, leading to reciprocal honor, but God reminded Jacob of the prophecy that Esau would ultimately rule over him. Esau resided in the land of Seir, not Greece, and the Israelites changed direction towards the land in Deuteronomy 2:8. The Targum commentaries on Deuteronomy 2:8 mention the Israelites passing by the descendants of Esau in various locations before continuing through the wilderness of Moab. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֵלַ֗י אַל־תָּ֙צַר֙ אֶת־מוֹאָ֔ב וְאַל־תִּתְגָּ֥ר בָּ֖ם מִלְחָמָ֑ה כִּ֠י לֹֽא־אֶתֵּ֨ן לְךָ֤ מֵֽאַרְצוֹ֙ יְרֻשָּׁ֔ה כִּ֣י לִבְנֵי־ל֔וֹט נָתַ֥תִּי אֶת־עָ֖ר יְרֻשָּֽׁה׃|9|And יהוה said to me: Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war. For I will not give you any of their land as a possession; I have assigned Ar as a possession to the descendants of Lot.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains Balak's fear of the Israelites as a concern that the Moabites would willingly allow themselves to be conquered, making it permissible for Israel to take over their cities. Halakhah states that the number of 613 commandments practiced for all generations does not include temporary commandments, blessings and curses at Gerizim and Eval, building the altar upon entering the Land of Canaan, and sacrificing animals as peace-offerings. Midrash discusses the consequences of Lot's daughters' actions, the importance of peace, and how Israel's actions towards the Moavites and Amonites were justified. Musar highlights the transformation of curses into words of the covenant, the extermination of the Canaanite nations due to their spiritual decline, and the symbolic union between Israel and their land. Talmud explains that a gentile inherits from his father by Torah law, Moab was not allowed to be besieged by the Jews, and Sihon was allowed to conquer Moab's land, making it permissible for Israel to conquer. Tanakh mentions Heshbon as the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Lot's daughters bearing sons by their father, giving rise to the Moabites and Ammonites. Targum instructs not to besiege or intimidate Moav in war, as their land is not to be inherited. 

|הָאֵמִ֥ים לְפָנִ֖ים יָ֣שְׁבוּ בָ֑הּ עַ֣ם גָּד֥וֹל וְרַ֛ב וָרָ֖ם כָּעֲנָקִֽים׃|10|It was formerly inhabited by the Emim, a people great and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses is warned not to take the lands of the Moabites, Ammonites, and Edomites by force, as these territories were promised to the descendants of Lot and Esau through miraculous events. The scouts sent to Canaan reported that the land was inhabited by powerful people, including the Anakites, causing fear among the Israelites. The Eimim, also known as the Emthanaia, were described as powerful giants who lived in the land. 

|רְפָאִ֛ים יֵחָשְׁב֥וּ אַף־הֵ֖ם כָּעֲנָקִ֑ים וְהַמֹּ֣אָבִ֔ים יִקְרְא֥וּ לָהֶ֖ם אֵמִֽים׃|11|Like the Anakites, they are counted as Rephaim; but the Moabites call them Emim.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Rephaim, Emim, and Horim were all considered as part of a race of giants, with the Rephaim also known as Anakim and feared by the Moabites as Emim. The Anakim are linked to chaos and the destruction of the Temple in Kabbalistic teachings, while the defeat of Og by Moses and the Israelites is seen as a reward for acting justly in the Midrash. The Zamzumim are identified as the Zuzim, with variations in spelling explained by different commentators like Radak and Ramban. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also mention the giants known as Refaim or Anokim being called Eimim or Emethanee by the Moabites. 

|וּבְשֵׂעִ֞יר יָשְׁב֣וּ הַחֹרִים֮ לְפָנִים֒ וּבְנֵ֧י עֵשָׂ֣ו יִֽירָשׁ֗וּם וַיַּשְׁמִידוּם֙ מִפְּנֵיהֶ֔ם וַיֵּשְׁב֖וּ תַּחְתָּ֑ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֧ר עָשָׂ֣ה יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל לְאֶ֙רֶץ֙ יְרֻשָּׁת֔וֹ אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֥ן יְהֹוָ֖ה לָהֶֽם׃|12|Similarly, Seir was formerly inhabited by the Horites; but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them, wiping them out and settling in their place, just as Israel did in the land they were to possess, which יהוה had given to them.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Horites were descendants of Seir, the Israelites were given the lands of Sichon and Og by God, Esau's children intermingled with the Horites, the Hivites were known for their expertise in land settlement, and the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years until the disobedient generation perished [1.6]. 

|עַתָּ֗ה קֻ֛מוּ וְעִבְר֥וּ לָכֶ֖ם אֶת־נַ֣חַל זָ֑רֶד וַֽנַּעֲבֹ֖ר אֶת־נַ֥חַל זָֽרֶד׃|13|Up now! Cross the wadi Zered! So we crossed the wadi Zered.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites cross the Zered Ravine as they approach the Promised Land, symbolizing their transition. In the desert, they grumble and are punished with fiery serpents, but through repentance and prayer, they are healed by a bronze serpent. Various commentators discuss the significance of the Israelites' journeys and encampments, with interpretations ranging from G'd's anger and forgiveness to the Israelites' relationship with God. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the crossing of Wadi Zered in Deuteronomy 2:13. 

|וְהַיָּמִ֞ים אֲשֶׁר־הָלַ֣כְנוּ ׀ מִקָּדֵ֣שׁ בַּרְנֵ֗עַ עַ֤ד אֲשֶׁר־עָבַ֙רְנוּ֙ אֶת־נַ֣חַל זֶ֔רֶד שְׁלֹשִׁ֥ים וּשְׁמֹנֶ֖ה שָׁנָ֑ה עַד־תֹּ֨ם כׇּל־הַדּ֜וֹר אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַמִּלְחָמָה֙ מִקֶּ֣רֶב הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר נִשְׁבַּ֥ע יְהֹוָ֖ה לָהֶֽם׃|14|The time that we spent in travel from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the wadi Zered was thirty-eight years, until that whole generation of warriors had perished from the camp, as יהוה had sworn concerning them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites spent 38 years wandering from Kadesh Barnea to the Wadi Zered, waiting for the generation of men of military age at the time of the Exodus to pass away before entering the land of Canaan, as they had shied away from conquering the land out of fear and forgetfulness of God's promises. The laws in Numbers were given during the second year after the Exodus, with divine communication with Moses ceasing for a period of thirty-eight years. Ramban explains that the Israelites dwelt in Egypt for a total of 430 years, with the last 30 years not mentioned to Abraham due to their sins. In Psalms 95:11 and Judges 2:15, it is mentioned that God swore in anger and declared that a certain group would never reach His resting place, and His hand was against the people in their campaigns, leading to great distress. The Targum states that the Israelites spent thirty-eight years traveling from Kadesh Barnea to Wadi Zered, with the entire generation of men of war dying out during this time. 

|וְגַ֤ם יַד־יְהֹוָה֙ הָ֣יְתָה בָּ֔ם לְהֻמָּ֖ם מִקֶּ֣רֶב הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֑ה עַ֖ד תֻּמָּֽם׃|15|Indeed, the hand of יהוה struck them, to root them out from the camp until they were finished off.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The hand of the Lord caused afflictions and accelerated the death of the generation in the wilderness, separating those whose death had been decreed. The term "le-hummam" signifies a sudden calamity. The Torah uses descriptive terms and metaphoric imagery to relate to human thought processes. Whenever "the hand of God" is mentioned, it signifies a plague of pestilence. The Lord's hand came upon the generation who accepted the majority report of the spies. In Exodus 14:24, God looked down upon the Egyptian army from a pillar of fire and cloud, causing panic among them. A plague from the Lord attacked the people within the camp, leading to their destruction. 

|וַיְהִ֨י כַאֲשֶׁר־תַּ֜מּוּ כׇּל־אַנְשֵׁ֧י הַמִּלְחָמָ֛ה לָמ֖וּת מִקֶּ֥רֶב הָעָֽם׃|16|When all the warriors among the people had died off,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Deuteronomy 2:16 discusses God speaking to Moses after the death of the men of war, indicating a period of censure for the Israelites. Midrash explores the lack of prophecy and repentance during this time, while Musar highlights the special intimacy between God and Moses. Rashi and Or HaChaim emphasize that God's communication with Moses was for the benefit of the people. The Talmud notes that the fifteenth of Av marked the end of deaths in the wilderness, leading to a day of rejoicing. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the men of war dying out among the people. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֵלַ֥י לֵאמֹֽר׃|17|יהוה spoke to me, saying:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Lord communicated with Moses through brief nocturnal images during the years of Israel's disobedience, highlighting the importance of the Fifteenth of Av and various events associated with that day. God did not speak affectionately with Moses during this time, emphasizing the divine Presence resting on the prophet for the sake of Israel. The Talmud discusses the importance of great men in a generation, with examples such as God not speaking to Moses until all the warriors had died. In Numbers 21:12, the Israelites camped at the wadi Zered. 

|אַתָּ֨ה עֹבֵ֥ר הַיּ֛וֹם אֶת־גְּב֥וּל מוֹאָ֖ב אֶת־עָֽר׃|18|You are now passing through the territory of Moab, through Ar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The land of Ammon was located north of Moab. The timing of Passover is discussed, with the evening of the fifteenth considered the first day, and the smiting of the firstborn at midnight sanctifying all Jewish firstborn on that day. Rashi explains that גבול in Numbers 21:13 refers to the boundary line, while Ramban argues that the Moabites did not assist the Israelites, leading to their ban from the congregation of Israel. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan provide different interpretations of the Israelites crossing the border of Moab. 

|וְקָרַבְתָּ֗ מ֚וּל בְּנֵ֣י עַמּ֔וֹן אַל־תְּצֻרֵ֖ם וְאַל־תִּתְגָּ֣ר בָּ֑ם כִּ֣י לֹֽא־אֶ֠תֵּ֠ן מֵאֶ֨רֶץ בְּנֵי־עַמּ֤וֹן לְךָ֙ יְרֻשָּׁ֔ה כִּ֥י לִבְנֵי־ל֖וֹט נְתַתִּ֥יהָ יְרֻשָּֽׁה׃|19|You will then be close to the Ammonites; do not harass them or start a fight with them. For I will not give any part of the land of the Ammonites to you as a possession; I have assigned it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains the meaning of specific Hebrew words in the text. Halakhah discusses the 613 commandments given to Moshe at Sinai. Jewish Thought explores the actions of the Midianites and God's response. Midrash delves into the fear of the Moabites towards the Israelites. Quoting Commentary provides insights from Rashi, Ramban, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Ramban on various topics. Talmud discusses the naming of Ben-Ami by Lot's daughter. Tanakh mentions the victories and territories of the Israelites. Targum emphasizes that the land of the Ammonites belongs to the descendants of Lot. 

|אֶֽרֶץ־רְפָאִ֥ים תֵּחָשֵׁ֖ב אַף־הִ֑וא רְפָאִ֤ים יָֽשְׁבוּ־בָהּ֙ לְפָנִ֔ים וְהָֽעַמֹּנִ֔ים יִקְרְא֥וּ לָהֶ֖ם זַמְזֻמִּֽים׃|20|It, too, is counted as Rephaim country. It was formerly inhabited by Rephaim, whom the Ammonites call Zamzummim,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The land of the Rephaim promised to Abraham was dispossessed by the Israelites, while the Ammonites called these people Zamzumim. Ramban emphasizes that G-d divided the lands among the seed of Abraham and warns against forcibly taking land that G-d caused certain groups to inherit. The Talmud explains that Mount Sinai was not named for miracles, but for the hatred that descended upon nations who rejected the Torah, and the desert where Israel stayed for forty years has five names with specific reasons. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention that the land was inhabited by giants, with the Ammonites referring to them as Zamzumim and Zimthanee respectively. 

|עַ֣ם גָּד֥וֹל וְרַ֛ב וָרָ֖ם כָּעֲנָקִ֑ים וַיַּשְׁמִידֵ֤ם יְהֹוָה֙ מִפְּנֵיהֶ֔ם וַיִּירָשֻׁ֖ם וַיֵּשְׁב֥וּ תַחְתָּֽם׃|21|a people great and numerous and as tall as the Anakites. יהוה wiped them out, so that [the Ammonites] dispossessed them and settled in their place,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau settled in Se'ir, fighting with the sons of Se'ir before being given Mount Se'ir by God. The Talmud discusses the status of buying in Ammon and Moab for Sabbatical and tithes, clarifying it refers to the former tribes Reuben and Gad in Transjordan. The Targum mentions the Anokim as a people destroyed by God for the Israelites to settle in their place. 

|כַּאֲשֶׁ֤ר עָשָׂה֙ לִבְנֵ֣י עֵשָׂ֔ו הַיֹּשְׁבִ֖ים בְּשֵׂעִ֑יר אֲשֶׁ֨ר הִשְׁמִ֤יד אֶת־הַחֹרִי֙ מִפְּנֵיהֶ֔ם וַיִּֽירָשֻׁם֙ וַיֵּשְׁב֣וּ תַחְתָּ֔ם עַ֖ד הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|22|as [God] did for the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, by wiping out the Horites before them, so that they dispossessed them and settled in their place, as is still the case.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

God drove out the Chori inhabitants from the land of Seir for the descendants of Esau, who settled there and remained until the present day, displacing the Horites in the process. Ramban explains that the descendants of Mitzraim did not have their habitation specified in Scripture because they all lived around Egypt, with their countries named after them. Sforno highlights that Esau overpowered the Horites in Seir with G-d's will. Targum mentions how God destroyed the Chori before the descendants of Eisov and allowed them to settle in their place in Seir until the present day. 

|וְהָֽעַוִּ֛ים הַיֹּשְׁבִ֥ים בַּחֲצֵרִ֖ים עַד־עַזָּ֑ה כַּפְתֹּרִים֙ הַיֹּצְאִ֣ים מִכַּפְתֹּ֔ר הִשְׁמִידֻ֖ם וַיֵּשְׁב֥וּ תַחְתָּֽם׃|23|So, too, with the Avvim who dwelt in villages in the vicinity of Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came from Crete,  wiped them out and settled in their place.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Avim, originally Canaanites, were destroyed by the Caphtorim, who settled in their place. Different commentators provide varying interpretations of the tribes involved and the legality of Israel's conquest of the region. The Israelites invoked covenants made by their forefathers to assert their rights to the land in response to challenges from other nations. Ramban explains that the Torah establishes the Jewish people's rightful claim to the land of Canaan through the creation story. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish argues that seemingly redundant verses in the Torah are essential teachings, using the Avvim being replaced by the Caphtorim as an example. Abraham agrees to a covenant in Genesis 21:24, and the Canaanite territory includes the Avvim in Joshua 13:3. The Avim living in Chatzeirim were destroyed by the Caftorim, according to Onkelos Deuteronomy 2:23 and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 2:23. 

|ק֣וּמוּ סְּע֗וּ וְעִבְרוּ֮ אֶת־נַ֣חַל אַרְנֹן֒ רְאֵ֣ה נָתַ֣תִּי בְ֠יָדְךָ֠ אֶת־סִיחֹ֨ן מֶֽלֶךְ־חֶשְׁבּ֧וֹן הָֽאֱמֹרִ֛י וְאֶת־אַרְצ֖וֹ הָחֵ֣ל רָ֑שׁ וְהִתְגָּ֥ר בּ֖וֹ מִלְחָמָֽה׃|24|Up! Set out across the wadi Arnon! See, I give into your power Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin the occupation: engage him in battle.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses sent messengers to Sihon before being commanded by God to begin the battle, fulfilling the rule of offering peace before expansion. Despite being instructed to provoke war, the Torah emphasizes actively seeking peace, as seen in the Midrash. In Devarim Rabbah, Moses interceded on behalf of Israel, nullifying God's decree of punishment for the Golden Calf incident. The defeat of adversaries like Sichon begins in the Celestial Regions, reflecting the importance of Israel in the divine plan. Heshbon was the city of Sihon, the Amorite king, who had defeated a previous king of Moab and taken over his land up to the Arnon River. The Targum commentary on Deuteronomy 2:24 explains that the Israelites are instructed to cross Wadi Arnon and conquer Sichon, King of Cheshbon, and his land by intimidating him through warfare. 

|הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֗ה אָחֵל֙ תֵּ֤ת פַּחְדְּךָ֙ וְיִרְאָ֣תְךָ֔ עַל־פְּנֵי֙ הָֽעַמִּ֔ים תַּ֖חַת כׇּל־הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם אֲשֶׁ֤ר יִשְׁמְעוּן֙ שִׁמְעֲךָ֔ וְרָגְז֥וּ וְחָל֖וּ מִפָּנֶֽיךָ׃|25|This day I begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under heaven, so that they shall tremble and quake because of you whenever they hear you mentioned.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The defeat of Sichon and Og ensured that no remnants of these nations remained, allowing Israel to inherit their land without any claims from survivors (Akeidat Yitzchak 88:1:8). The Talmud discusses the similarities between the miracles performed for Moses and Joshua, focusing on the sun standing still for both of them, with verbal analogies and direct verses showing that the miracles for Joshua were also performed for Moses and Nakdimon ben Gurion. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 2:25 mention that God will instill fear and awe in the people under heaven, causing them to tremble upon hearing of the Israelites' reputation and miraculous deeds, such as the sun and moon standing still during battle. 

|וָאֶשְׁלַ֤ח מַלְאָכִים֙ מִמִּדְבַּ֣ר קְדֵמ֔וֹת אֶל־סִיח֖וֹן מֶ֣לֶךְ חֶשְׁבּ֑וֹן דִּבְרֵ֥י שָׁל֖וֹם לֵאמֹֽר׃|26|Then I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with an offer of peace, as follows,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses sent messengers to Sihon with words of peace from the wilderness of Kedemoth, despite God's command to wage war, following the value of attempting dialogue before conflict. The offer of peace was sincere due to the territory's history and previous ownership by Moab and Ammon, and was in line with Moses' actions aligned with God's will. Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, and two letters were sent with different intentions, suggesting the prince of any generation is equal to the whole generation. 

|אֶעְבְּרָ֣ה בְאַרְצֶ֔ךָ בַּדֶּ֥רֶךְ בַּדֶּ֖רֶךְ אֵלֵ֑ךְ לֹ֥א אָס֖וּר יָמִ֥ין וּשְׂמֹֽאול׃|27|“Let me pass through your country. I will keep strictly to the highway, turning off neither to the right nor to the left.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Rav Hirsch explain that "the highway" in Deuteronomy 2:27 refers to a well-known public road. The Midrash emphasizes the importance of peace, even in times of war, as shown by Moses offering terms of peace before attacking a city. Ramban clarifies that the Moabites were banned from the congregation of Israel for not providing bread and water, while Haamek Davar notes that Moses informed Sichon they had to pass through his land to avoid war. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both highlight Moses' intention to pass through the land without deviating from the main path. 

|אֹ֣כֶל בַּכֶּ֤סֶף תַּשְׁבִּרֵ֙נִי֙ וְאָכַ֔לְתִּי וּמַ֛יִם בַּכֶּ֥סֶף תִּתֶּן־לִ֖י וְשָׁתִ֑יתִי רַ֖ק אֶעְבְּרָ֥ה בְרַגְלָֽי׃|28|What food I eat you will supply for money, and what water I drink you will furnish for money; just let me pass through  —|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Israel did not commit to buying food from Sihon as they were sustained by manna, but requested to purchase supplies while passing through his territory, emphasizing the importance of proper conduct and payment for goods. The Midrash highlights the unity of Siḥon's people and divine intervention in their defeat by Israel. Ramban, Sforno, Tur HaArokh, and Talmudic sources discuss the interactions between Israel and other nations regarding food and payment, with specific examples of food preparation and customs. The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan elaborate on the request to buy food and water with money while traveling through Sihon's land. 

|כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר עָֽשׂוּ־לִ֜י בְּנֵ֣י עֵשָׂ֗ו הַיֹּֽשְׁבִים֙ בְּשֵׂעִ֔יר וְהַמּ֣וֹאָבִ֔ים הַיֹּשְׁבִ֖ים בְּעָ֑ר עַ֤ד אֲשֶֽׁר־אֶֽעֱבֹר֙ אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֔ן אֶל־הָאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ נֹתֵ֥ן לָֽנוּ׃|29|as the descendants of Esau who dwell in Seir did for me, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar—that I may cross the Jordan into the land that our God יהוה is giving us.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary explores the meaning of "as the children of Esau did to me" as selling food and water, the Midrash emphasizes etiquette and divine intervention in interactions with Edom and Moab, the Talmud discusses a woman's consent in preventing a marriage after rape, and the Targum translations mention the actions of Edom and Moab towards the Israelites. 

|וְלֹ֣א אָבָ֗ה סִיחֹן֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ חֶשְׁבּ֔וֹן הַעֲבִרֵ֖נוּ בּ֑וֹ כִּֽי־הִקְשָׁה֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ אֶת־רוּח֗וֹ וְאִמֵּץ֙ אֶת־לְבָב֔וֹ לְמַ֛עַן תִּתּ֥וֹ בְיָדְךָ֖ כַּיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|30|But King Sihon of Heshbon refused to let us pass through, because יהוה had stiffened his will and hardened his heart in order to deliver him into your power—as is now the case.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God hardened Sichon's spirit to prevent the Israelites from passing through his territory, leading to his refusal to allow them through his land. Those who commit great sins may have their chance to repent withheld by God, as seen with Pharaoh, Sichon, the Canaanites, and the Israelites during Elijah's time. The hardening of Sichon's heart was a result of his previous misdeeds, not Divine interference with his free will, showcasing God's power and fulfilling His promises to the Israelites. Sichon's defeat was a direct result of God hardening his spirit and mind. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֵלַ֔י רְאֵ֗ה הַֽחִלֹּ֙תִי֙ תֵּ֣ת לְפָנֶ֔יךָ אֶת־סִיחֹ֖ן וְאֶת־אַרְצ֑וֹ הָחֵ֣ל רָ֔שׁ לָרֶ֖שֶׁת אֶת־אַרְצֽוֹ׃|31|And יהוה said to me: See, I begin by placing Sihon and his land at your disposal. Begin the occupation; take possession of his land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that God cast down the tutelary angel of the Amorites beneath Moses' feet, Ibn Ezra discusses the vocalization of the word "I have begun," Or HaChaim explains that Moses misunderstood the word "I have begun" to refer to the previous paragraph, and Rav Hirsch emphasizes that Sihon's resistance is the beginning of his downfall. Steinsaltz summarizes this by stating that God has begun delivering Sihon and his land to the Israelites, instructing them to begin taking possession without delay. Sichon misinterpreted Moses' offer as weakness, leading to arrogance and deserved punishment, while Og's self-assurance did not need provocation. The conquest of Siḥon and his land by the Israelites was orchestrated by the Holy One to deliver him into their hands easily, emphasizing God's power in ensuring victory. The defeat of the Canaanite nations by Moses symbolized the union between the people of Israel and the land of Israel as husband and wife. Moses' initial hesitation to wage war against Og was overcome by God's assurance of victory, necessary for the overall conquest of Canaan. Rebbi Isaac bar Naḥman clarifies the status of Ammon and Moab in relation to Sabbatical and tithes, concluding that Transjordan is not part of the Holy Land. Adonoy instructs Onkelos to begin inheriting Sichon's defeated land. 

|וַיֵּצֵא֩ סִיחֹ֨ן לִקְרָאתֵ֜נוּ ה֧וּא וְכׇל־עַמּ֛וֹ לַמִּלְחָמָ֖ה יָֽהְצָה׃|32|Sihon with all his troops took the field against us at Jahaz,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sihon and Og were powerful rulers who did not need each other's help in battle. When Israel left Egypt, other nations feared them, including Sihon and Og, who questioned Israel's strength. Og, with legs eighteen cubits long, instilled fear in Moses, but God assured victory. The territory of Bney Ammon was inviolate against assault by the Israelites, allowing them to conquer other lands. Sichon and Cheshbon were brave and powerful, with Sichon's son portrayed as even tougher. Siftei Chakhamim discusses Rashi's explanation of verses in the context of the Amalekite attack. Sichon and his people fought against the Israelites at Yahatz/Jehaz. 

|וַֽיִּתְּנֵ֛הוּ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ לְפָנֵ֑ינוּ וַנַּ֥ךְ אֹת֛וֹ וְאֶת־בָּנָ֖ו וְאֶת־כׇּל־עַמּֽוֹ׃|33|and our God יהוה delivered him to us and we defeated him and his sons and all his troops.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sichon had a mighty son, the word "va-nakh" is missing a root nun, Sichon had one son, his sons were prominent individuals or warriors killed with him. The Midrash discusses not fearing enemies, punishment for ancestors' sins, maintaining fear of God, and destruction of nations in the world to come. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that God defeated the enemy before the Israelites, leading to the destruction of him, his sons, and his entire people. 

|וַנִּלְכֹּ֤ד אֶת־כׇּל־עָרָיו֙ בָּעֵ֣ת הַהִ֔וא וַֽנַּחֲרֵם֙ אֶת־כׇּל־עִ֣יר מְתִ֔ם וְהַנָּשִׁ֖ים וְהַטָּ֑ף לֹ֥א הִשְׁאַ֖רְנוּ שָׂרִֽיד׃|34|At that time we captured all his towns, and we doomed  every town—men, women, and children  —leaving no survivor.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses offered peace to the Amorites before destroying them, as commanded, while the Israelites plundered Sihon but held Og's plunder in contempt, only taking silver and gold. The annihilation of the population was justified as the Amorites belonged to the seven Canaanite tribes under the decree to not allow any survivors. Israel destroyed the men, women, and children of the Amorites, leaving no survivors, capturing Midianite women and noncombatants but instructed to kill all male noncombatants and women who had known a man. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that the Israelites conquered and destroyed all the cities, leaving no survivors, including men, women, and children. 

|רַ֥ק הַבְּהֵמָ֖ה בָּזַ֣זְנוּ לָ֑נוּ וּשְׁלַ֥ל הֶעָרִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר לָכָֽדְנוּ׃|35|We retained as booty only the cattle and the spoil of the cities that we captured.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites took only animals as loot during the war with Sihon, while in the war with Og, they took gold and silver but did not want cattle or garments, burning the garments and chasing away the sheep. Ramban explains that vessels used in the war against Midian required purification to remove traces of forbidden foods absorbed while in the possession of non-Jews, involving washing and scouring in water. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that the Israelites only took animals as plunder and spoils from conquered cities. 

|מֵֽעֲרֹעֵ֡ר אֲשֶׁר֩ עַל־שְׂפַת־נַ֨חַל אַרְנֹ֜ן וְהָעִ֨יר אֲשֶׁ֤ר בַּנַּ֙חַל֙ וְעַד־הַגִּלְעָ֔ד לֹ֤א הָֽיְתָה֙ קִרְיָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר שָׂגְבָ֖ה מִמֶּ֑נּוּ אֶת־הַכֹּ֕ל נָתַ֛ן יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ לְפָנֵֽינוּ׃|36|From Aroer on the edge of the Arnon valley, including the town  in the valley itself, to Gilead, not a city was too mighty for us; our God יהוה delivered everything to us.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra connects the word "sagevah" in Deuteronomy 2:36 to "venisgav" in Isaiah 2:11, while JPS 1985 Footnotes and Rav Hirsch discuss the uncertain meaning of "qiryah" and "shagvah." Steinsaltz explains that the Israelites conquered all cities with God's help. The Amorites' iniquity is linked to their power and sin of questioning God's promise, as noted by the Midrash and Radak. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos emphasize the Israelites' strength in defeating all cities from Aroer to Gilead. 

|רַ֛ק אֶל־אֶ֥רֶץ בְּנֵי־עַמּ֖וֹן לֹ֣א קָרָ֑בְתָּ כׇּל־יַ֞ד נַ֤חַל יַבֹּק֙ וְעָרֵ֣י הָהָ֔ר וְכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֖ה יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ׃|37|But you did not encroach upon the land of the Ammonites, all along the wadi Jabbok and the towns of the hill country, just as our God יהוה had commanded.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that "כל יד נחל יבק" refers to the district beside the brook of Jabbok, while Ibn Ezra notes that the land of the children of Ammon is in their hands today. Siftei Chakhamim interprets the phrase as the edge of the river, while Rav Hirsch connects it to Leviticus 4:2. Steinsaltz clarifies that the Israelites did not approach the land of the children of Ammon, and Chizkuni adds that this exclusion only applied to land currently in possession of the Ammonites. The Targum states that the Israelites followed God's command by not attacking the land of the Ammonites, including the area along Wadi Yabok and the hill cities.

## Deuteronomy 3

|וַנֵּ֣פֶן וַנַּ֔עַל דֶּ֖רֶךְ הַבָּשָׁ֑ן וַיֵּצֵ֣א עוֹג֩ מֶֽלֶךְ־הַבָּשָׁ֨ן לִקְרָאתֵ֜נוּ ה֧וּא וְכׇל־עַמּ֛וֹ לַמִּלְחָמָ֖ה אֶדְרֶֽעִי׃|1|We made our way up the road toward Bashan, and King Og of Bashan with all his troops took the field against us at Edrei.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites journeyed north towards Canaan through the wilderness, facing battles against Sihon and Og in the Bashan region. The defeat of these kings is highlighted in the Midrash, emphasizing the importance of both simple and weighty commandments in the Torah. Ramban explains the significance of Asshur and Assyria, while the Tanakh recounts the Israelites' victories over Sihon and Og. Targum describes Og's battle against the Israelites in Edrei. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֵלַי֙ אַל־תִּירָ֣א אֹת֔וֹ כִּ֣י בְיָדְךָ֞ נָתַ֧תִּי אֹת֛וֹ וְאֶת־כׇּל־עַמּ֖וֹ וְאֶת־אַרְצ֑וֹ וְעָשִׂ֣יתָ לּ֔וֹ כַּאֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשִׂ֗יתָ לְסִיחֹן֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ הָֽאֱמֹרִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּחֶשְׁבּֽוֹן׃|2|But יהוה said to me: Do not fear him, for I am delivering him and all his troops and his country into your power, and you will do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how the Lord assured Moses not to fear Og, as He had already delivered him and his people into the hands of Israel, dating back to the time of Abraham. It emphasizes the importance of not prioritizing one commandment over another, highlights the rewards for honoring parents, and recounts the war with Siḥon and Og, detailing the strategies used by the Israelites and the divine foresight in delivering their enemies into their hands. The tribes on the East Bank argued that the lands they conquered were part of the "Holy Land," citing Moses' instructions to conquer Sichon and Og as proof, while the Targum emphasizes the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham and Sarah through the victory over their enemies. 

|וַיִּתֵּן֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֵ֜ינוּ בְּיָדֵ֗נוּ גַּ֛ם אֶת־ע֥וֹג מֶֽלֶךְ־הַבָּשָׁ֖ן וְאֶת־כׇּל־עַמּ֑וֹ וַנַּכֵּ֕הוּ עַד־בִּלְתִּ֥י הִשְׁאִֽיר־ל֖וֹ שָׂרִֽיד׃|3|So our God יהוה also delivered into our power King Og of Bashan, with all his troops, and we dealt them such a blow that no survivor was left.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, and Steinsaltz explain that the Israelites defeated Og and left no survivors. The Midrash highlights Joshua's implementation of calling for peace before waging war, the defeat of the Amorites with the help of hornets, and the Israelites being chosen for their humility. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention how God delivered Og, King of the Boshon, into the hands of the Israelites, and they defeated him completely without leaving any survivors. 

|וַנִּלְכֹּ֤ד אֶת־כׇּל־עָרָיו֙ בָּעֵ֣ת הַהִ֔וא לֹ֤א הָֽיְתָה֙ קִרְיָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־לָקַ֖חְנוּ מֵֽאִתָּ֑ם שִׁשִּׁ֥ים עִיר֙ כׇּל־חֶ֣בֶל אַרְגֹּ֔ב מַמְלֶ֥כֶת ע֖וֹג בַּבָּשָֽׁן׃|4|At that time we captured all his towns; there was not a town that we did not take from them: sixty towns, the whole district of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators interpret the term "Argob" in Deuteronomy 3:4:1 differently, with Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Siftei Chakhamim offering different explanations. Rabbi Pinchas ben Ya’ir explains that the offerings made by the twelve tribes correspond to various aspects of the universe and Jewish tradition, symbolizing atonement for sins. Rashi, in II Kings 15:25:3, suggests a golden lion may have been in a palace, while the Talmud discusses the walled cities mentioned in the mishna and their consecration by exiles from Babylonia. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the conquest of sixty cities, including Argov, in Deuteronomy 3:4. 

|כׇּל־אֵ֜לֶּה עָרִ֧ים בְּצֻרֹ֛ת חוֹמָ֥ה גְבֹהָ֖ה דְּלָתַ֣יִם וּבְרִ֑יחַ לְבַ֛ד מֵעָרֵ֥י הַפְּרָזִ֖י הַרְבֵּ֥ה מְאֹֽד׃|5|all those towns were fortified with high walls, gates,  and bars—apart from a great number of unwalled towns.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The term "unwalled cities" refers to cities without protective walls, while strong, fortified cities were surrounded by high walls, gates, and bars. David sang Psalm 3 reflecting on his sins and kingdom's turmoil, comparing himself to Jacob and Moses before seeing his kingdom established. The Mishnah states that walled cities read the Megillah on the fifteenth of Adar, while villages read on the fourteenth or on the day of assembly. Rashi, Ibn Ezra, and Bartenura provide interpretations of the reading of the Megillah in walled and unwalled cities. The Talmud discusses the counting of specific walled cities in the Mishnah, clarifying that they were discovered by exiles from Babylonia and sanctified. The cities mentioned in Deuteronomy 3:5 were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, with many unwalled cities also present. 

|וַנַּחֲרֵ֣ם אוֹתָ֔ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשִׂ֔ינוּ לְסִיחֹ֖ן מֶ֣לֶךְ חֶשְׁבּ֑וֹן הַחֲרֵם֙ כׇּל־עִ֣יר מְתִ֔ם הַנָּשִׁ֖ים וְהַטָּֽף׃|6|We doomed them as we had done in the case of King Sihon of Heshbon; we doomed every town—men, women, and children—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi interprets "החרם" in Deuteronomy 3:6 as ongoing destruction, similar to the fate of King Sihon of Heshbon. The Akeidat Yitzchak teaches not to condemn without investigation, Moses burnt the platform for the golden calf, and Aaron's limited involvement was due to circumstances beyond his control. Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair turned two measures of barley into a substantial crop over seven years, illustrating God's reward for good deeds. The Midrash discusses the fear of the righteous, exemplified by Jacob and Moses, and the defeat of Og king of Bashan. Rashi and Rabbeinu Bahya discuss Moses's role as an angel in driving back Amalek and destroying cities. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the complete annihilation of the Amorites in Deuteronomy 3:6, similar to King Sihon. 

|וְכׇל־הַבְּהֵמָ֛ה וּשְׁלַ֥ל הֶעָרִ֖ים בַּזּ֥וֹנוּ לָֽנוּ׃|7|and retained as booty all the cattle and the spoil of the towns.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah uses different verbs for "looting" in Deuteronomy 3:7:1 and 2:35 to convey disdain for the loot in the former, with the expression "and all the animals" only found in Deuteronomy 3:7:1. The Midrash discusses the fear of the righteous and the battle with Og, King of Bashan. Rashi explains that the Israelites eagerly took spoils from Sihon but were contemptuous of the spoils from Og, only taking silver and gold. The Targum interprets Deuteronomy 3:7 similarly, stating that the Israelites took the animals and possessions of conquered cities as plunder for themselves. 

|וַנִּקַּ֞ח בָּעֵ֤ת הַהִוא֙ אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ מִיַּ֗ד שְׁנֵי֙ מַלְכֵ֣י הָאֱמֹרִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֖ר בְּעֵ֣בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּ֑ן מִנַּ֥חַל אַרְנֹ֖ן עַד־הַ֥ר חֶרְמֽוֹן׃|8|Thus we seized, at that time, from the two Amorite kings, the country beyond the Jordan, from the wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that "מיד" means "from the control of" as the Israelites conquered the land from the Emorite kings Sihon and Og, extending from the Arnon Ravine to Mount Hermon. Siftei Chakhamim clarifies that Og, king of the Chivites, was a remnant of the Refa’im. Ramban adds that Heshbon and Ashtaroth were conquered by Sihon and Og, who built them as their royal capitals, with Ashtaroth being well fortified. Targum mentions the Israelites taking land from two Amorite kings located across the Jordan River, from Wadi Arnon to Mount Chermon. 

|צִידֹנִ֛ים יִקְרְא֥וּ לְחֶרְמ֖וֹן שִׂרְיֹ֑ן וְהָ֣אֱמֹרִ֔י יִקְרְאוּ־ל֖וֹ שְׂנִֽיר׃|9|Sidonians called Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Mount Hermon, also known as Chermon, had multiple names such as Sirion and Senir, reflecting the different nations that prided themselves in the mountain. The various names mentioned in Scripture highlight the importance and esteem in which the Land of Israel was held, with nations vying for recognition through the naming of the mountain. The Targum further elaborates on the different names given to Mount Hermon by the Sidonians and Amorites, emphasizing the significance of the mountain in different cultures. 

|כֹּ֣ל ׀ עָרֵ֣י הַמִּישֹׁ֗ר וְכׇל־הַגִּלְעָד֙ וְכׇל־הַבָּשָׁ֔ן עַד־סַלְכָ֖ה וְאֶדְרֶ֑עִי עָרֵ֛י מַמְלֶ֥כֶת ע֖וֹג בַּבָּשָֽׁן׃|10|all the towns of the Tableland and the whole of Gilead and Bashan as far as Salcah  and Edrei, the towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Og ruled in Bashan as the last remaining Refaim after a war, mentioned cities in his kingdom include Salecah, Salchah, Salka, and Edre'i. The tablets of testimony symbolize dualities like heaven and earth, groom and bride, and this world and the world to come. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the cities of Gilead, Mathnan, Selukia, Edrehi, and Boshon as part of Og's kingdom. 

|כִּ֣י רַק־ע֞וֹג מֶ֣לֶךְ הַבָּשָׁ֗ן נִשְׁאַר֮ מִיֶּ֣תֶר הָרְפָאִים֒ הִנֵּ֤ה עַרְשׂוֹ֙ עֶ֣רֶשׂ בַּרְזֶ֔ל הֲלֹ֣ה הִ֔וא בְּרַבַּ֖ת בְּנֵ֣י עַמּ֑וֹן תֵּ֧שַׁע אַמּ֣וֹת אׇרְכָּ֗הּ וְאַרְבַּ֥ע אַמּ֛וֹת רׇחְבָּ֖הּ בְּאַמַּת־אִֽישׁ׃|11|Only King Og of Bashan was left of the remaining Rephaim. His bedstead, an iron bedstead, is now in Rabbah of the Ammonites; it is nine cubits long and four cubits wide, by the standard cubit! |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses how Moshe Rabeynu feared Og, King of Bashan, due to his appearance of having the sign of the covenant, but God revealed that his insides were not clean. The Commentary and Midrash elaborate on Og's extraordinary size and power, his survival from the flood, and the fear he instilled in others. The Talmud describes Abraham as a giant and Og as consuming vast amounts of food and drink, while the Tanakh and Targum mention Og as the only survivor of the giants with his iron bed placed in Rabbah of the Ammonites. 

|וְאֶת־הָאָ֧רֶץ הַזֹּ֛את יָרַ֖שְׁנוּ בָּעֵ֣ת הַהִ֑וא מֵעֲרֹעֵ֞ר אֲשֶׁר־עַל־נַ֣חַל אַרְנֹ֗ן וַחֲצִ֤י הַֽר־הַגִּלְעָד֙ וְעָרָ֔יו נָתַ֕תִּי לָרֽאוּבֵנִ֖י וְלַגָּדִֽי׃|12|And this is the land which we apportioned at that time: The part from Aroer along the wadi Arnon, with part of the hill country of Gilead and its towns, I assigned to the Reubenites and the Gadites.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The land mentioned in Deuteronomy 3:8 extended from the brook of Arnon to Mount Hermon and was possessed by the Israelites, with the Reubenites and Gadites receiving land from Aroer. Moses prayed to enter the land of Israel, but God denied his request, stating that all creatures are destined to die because of Adam's sin. The tribe of Menashe did not own land in Ramot in Gilad, sharing territory with other tribes on the east bank of the Jordan. The Reubenites and Gadites settled in Jazer and Gilead, agreeing to serve as shock-troops in battle before receiving Gilead as their inheritance. The land from Aro'er to Wadi Arnon and half of the Gilod hills with its cities was given to the Reuvenites and Gaddites at that time. 

|וְיֶ֨תֶר הַגִּלְעָ֤ד וְכׇל־הַבָּשָׁן֙ מַמְלֶ֣כֶת ע֔וֹג נָתַ֕תִּי לַחֲצִ֖י שֵׁ֣בֶט הַֽמְנַשֶּׁ֑ה כֹּ֣ל חֶ֤בֶל הָֽאַרְגֹּב֙ לְכׇל־הַבָּשָׁ֔ן הַה֥וּא יִקָּרֵ֖א אֶ֥רֶץ רְפָאִֽים׃|13|The rest of Gilead, and all of Bashan under Og’s rule—the whole Argob district, all that part of Bashan which is called Rephaim country—I assigned to the half-tribe of Manasseh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The land of Argob in Bashan, ruled by Og and associated with the Rephaim, was not part of the original lands promised to Abraham on the West Bank of the Jordan. The tribes of Gad and Manasseh received portions of the Gilead, but the lands of Sichon and Og were not considered suitable for the Temple or the Shekhinah to settle. The territory of Argob was given to half the tribe of Menashe. 

|יָאִ֣יר בֶּן־מְנַשֶּׁ֗ה לָקַח֙ אֶת־כׇּל־חֶ֣בֶל אַרְגֹּ֔ב עַד־גְּב֥וּל הַגְּשׁוּרִ֖י וְהַמַּֽעֲכָתִ֑י וַיִּקְרָא֩ אֹתָ֨ם עַל־שְׁמ֤וֹ אֶת־הַבָּשָׁן֙ חַוֺּ֣ת יָאִ֔יר עַ֖ד הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|14|Jair son of Manasseh received the whole Argob district (that is, Bashan) as far as the boundary of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and named it after himself: Havvoth-jair  —as is still the case.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jair, the son of Manasseh from the tribe of Judah, conquered the region of Argov and named it Havvoth Ya'ir, which remained to this day. He had thirty sons who owned thirty towns in Gilead, called Havvoth-jair, and warlords descended from Mochir captured sixty cities in the area. The Midrash praises God as great, mighty, and rich, with no limits to His wealth. 

|וּלְמָכִ֖יר נָתַ֥תִּי אֶת־הַגִּלְעָֽד׃|15|To Machir I assigned Gilead.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that "To Machir" means to the children of Machir, who received Gilad as an inheritance from the tribe of Manasseh. The Midrash discusses Abraham's fear of neglecting God's commandments after killing kings but reassures him of great rewards for uprooting evil. Jair, originally from Judah, is linked to his mother's family, Menasheh, and received an inheritance with them in Gilead. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both state that Gilead was given to Machir. 

|וְלָראוּבֵנִ֨י וְלַגָּדִ֜י נָתַ֤תִּי מִן־הַגִּלְעָד֙ וְעַד־נַ֣חַל אַרְנֹ֔ן תּ֥וֹךְ הַנַּ֖חַל וּגְבֻ֑ל וְעַד֙ יַבֹּ֣ק הַנַּ֔חַל גְּב֖וּל בְּנֵ֥י עַמּֽוֹן׃|16|And to the Reubenites and the Gadites I assigned the part from Gilead down to the wadi Arnon, the middle of the wadi being the boundary, and up to the wadi Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The land given to the tribes of Reuben and Gad extends from the Gilad to the Yabok Ravine, bordering Moav and Ammon respectively. Ramban discusses the angels meeting Jacob in Mahanaim to reassure him in enemy territory, and the order of mentioning Gad and Reuben in Numbers 32:2:1. Moses's request to enter the land is denied in Deuteronomy 3:23:1, leading to the appointment of Joshua. Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 3:16 describes the division of land given to the Reubenites and Gadites from Gilead to the river Arnon and the border of the descendants of Ammon. 

|וְהָֽעֲרָבָ֖ה וְהַיַּרְדֵּ֣ן וּגְבֻ֑ל מִכִּנֶּ֗רֶת וְעַ֨ד יָ֤ם הָֽעֲרָבָה֙ יָ֣ם הַמֶּ֔לַח תַּ֛חַת אַשְׁדֹּ֥ת הַפִּסְגָּ֖ה מִזְרָֽחָה׃|17|[We also seized] the Arabah, from the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east, to the edge of the Jordan, and from Chinnereth down to the sea of the Arabah, the Dead Sea.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The tribe of Gad's territory extended from the eastern side of the Jordan River to the Sea of Galilee, with the Jordan River serving as their western border. Naphtali's land is compared to a doe let loose, with Barak leading fighters to victory over the Canaanites. Ramban explains that the "book of the wars of the Eternal" refers to wise men writing history using proverbs, while the Talmud discusses whether the Jordan River is part of the Land of Israel or a boundary itself. The Targums describe the boundaries of the land, including specific locations like Kinneres and Tebaria. 

|וָאֲצַ֣ו אֶתְכֶ֔ם בָּעֵ֥ת הַהִ֖וא לֵאמֹ֑ר יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֗ם נָתַ֨ן לָכֶ֜ם אֶת־הָאָ֤רֶץ הַזֹּאת֙ לְרִשְׁתָּ֔הּ חֲלוּצִ֣ים תַּֽעַבְר֗וּ לִפְנֵ֛י אֲחֵיכֶ֥ם בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל כׇּל־בְּנֵי־חָֽיִל׃|18|At that time I charged you [men of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh], saying, “Your God יהוה has given you this country to possess. You must go as shock-troops, warriors all, at the head of your Israelite kin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Moshe Rabbeinu's ability to receive unearned gifts from God through the Ten Utterances, allowing him to conquer the Land of Israel. The Midrash explains that giving charity will hasten the arrival of the messianic era and the World to Come, bringing blessings and guidance from the Lord. The Mishnah discusses the permissibility of bathing in a bathhouse dedicated to Aphrodite, concluding that it is not forbidden if the idol is not treated as a deity. The Tanakh details the Israelites' plans for establishing themselves in the land, with shock-troops leading the way, and Moses instructs them to go to battle at the command of יהוה. Targum interpretations specify commands given to specific tribes, such as Reuben, Gad, and half of Menasheh, to go armed before their brethren. 

|רַ֠ק נְשֵׁיכֶ֣ם וְטַפְּכֶם֮ וּמִקְנֵכֶם֒ יָדַ֕עְתִּי כִּֽי־מִקְנֶ֥ה רַ֖ב לָכֶ֑ם יֵֽשְׁבוּ֙ בְּעָ֣רֵיכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לָכֶֽם׃|19|Only your wives, children, and livestock—I know that you have much livestock—shall be left in the towns I have assigned to you,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 3:19, Steinsaltz explains that only the wives, children, and livestock of the Israelites were allowed to live in the cities given to them on the eastern side of the Jordan River. This restriction was likely put in place to ensure the safety and security of the land. The Targum states that the wives, children, and cattle will remain in the cities given to the Israelites. 

|עַ֠ד אֲשֶׁר־יָנִ֨יחַ יְהֹוָ֥ה ׀ לַֽאֲחֵיכֶם֮ כָּכֶם֒ וְיָרְשׁ֣וּ גַם־הֵ֔ם אֶת־הָאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֛ם נֹתֵ֥ן לָהֶ֖ם בְּעֵ֣בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּ֑ן וְשַׁבְתֶּ֗ם אִ֚ישׁ לִֽירֻשָּׁת֔וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תִּי לָכֶֽם׃|20|until יהוה has granted your kin a haven such as you have, and they too have taken possession of the land that your God יהוה is assigning them, beyond the Jordan. Then you may return each to the homestead that I have assigned to him.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashbam interprets Exodus 33:14 as God's presence remaining with the Israelites until they have settled in Canaan and have rest from enemies. Nehemiah 9:22 mentions territories allotted to the people, including Sihon and Og. Moses instructs in Joshua 1:13-15 to help others gain possession before returning to their own land. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 3:20 discuss Israelites returning to their inheritance after their brothers have peace and inherit land. 

|וְאֶת־יְהוֹשׁ֣וּעַ צִוֵּ֔יתִי בָּעֵ֥ת הַהִ֖וא לֵאמֹ֑ר עֵינֶ֣יךָ הָרֹאֹ֗ת אֵת֩ כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֨ר עָשָׂ֜ה יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶם֙ לִשְׁנֵי֙ הַמְּלָכִ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה כֵּֽן־יַעֲשֶׂ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ לְכׇל־הַמַּמְלָכ֔וֹת אֲשֶׁ֥ר אַתָּ֖ה עֹבֵ֥ר שָֽׁמָּה׃|21|I also charged Joshua at that time, saying, “You have seen with your own eyes all that your God יהוה has done to these two kings; so shall יהוה do to all the kingdoms into which you shall cross over.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the loss of the "we will do" aspect of the covenant after the Golden Calf incident, Moses commands Joshua to be fearless in battle with God's help, Halakhah discusses the consecration of lands conquered by different groups of Jews, Midrash explains Moses' plea to enter the land and Targum emphasizes remembering God's past victories in battle. 

|לֹ֖א תִּֽירָא֑וּם כִּ֚י יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֔ם ה֖וּא הַנִּלְחָ֥ם לָכֶֽם׃|22|Do not fear them, for it is your God יהוה who will battle for you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses instructs Joshua and the Israelites not to fear the Canaanite kings, as God will fight for them in their conquest of the land. The text emphasizes the prohibition against soldiers being afraid in war, with references to Deuteronomy 7:21 and 3:22. Midrash highlights that when Israel fears God, even nations and animals fear them, and in the future, those who oppose Israel will not succeed as God will protect them. Targum interprets Deuteronomy 3:22 as emphasizing that God's word will fight for the Israelites, encouraging them not to fear their enemies.
