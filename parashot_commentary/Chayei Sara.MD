## Genesis 23

|וַיִּהְיוּ֙ חַיֵּ֣י שָׂרָ֔ה מֵאָ֥ה שָׁנָ֛ה וְעֶשְׂרִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה וְשֶׁ֣בַע שָׁנִ֑ים שְׁנֵ֖י חַיֵּ֥י שָׂרָֽה׃|1 P|Sarah’s lifetime—the span of Sarah’s life—came to one hundred and twenty-seven years.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sarah's age at death was significant as she overcame astrological predictions of barrenness through her merits and prayers, giving "life" to her years through good deeds and devotion to Hashem. Rashi emphasizes her sinlessness and beauty at different stages of life, with her last 37 years being most significant, connected to the purchase of the cave of Machpelah and the birth of Rebecca. Midrash highlights the blessings and offerings related to Sarah, Abraham, and their descendants, emphasizing their righteousness and honor. Musar stresses the importance of humility leading to honor in the world to come, symbolized by the division of Sarah's life into three periods reflecting her beauty, sinlessness, and motherly role. Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, Haamek Sheilah, Hizkuni, Da'at Zekenim, Targum Jonathan, and Onkelos provide additional insights into the significance of Sarah's life and age. 

|וַתָּ֣מׇת שָׂרָ֗ה בְּקִרְיַ֥ת אַרְבַּ֛ע הִ֥וא חֶבְר֖וֹן בְּאֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן וַיָּבֹא֙ אַבְרָהָ֔ם לִסְפֹּ֥ד לְשָׂרָ֖ה וְלִבְכֹּתָֽהּ׃|2 P|Sarah died in Kiriath-arba—now Hebron—in the land of Canaan; and Abraham proceeded to mourn for Sarah and to bewail her.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham mourned Sarah's death in Hebron after coming from Beer-sheba, with the small "kaf" in "bewail her" indicating restrained tears due to her old age. Eulogies for the deceased should reflect on their essence and behavior, following ancient customs, while the importance of burying and eulogizing the dead, especially Torah scholars, is emphasized in the Torah. Sarah's death may have been influenced by the news of the Akeida, with the delay in her funeral indicating her preference for Abraham's honor. Sarah died in Kiryat Arba, also known as Hebron, in the land of Canaan, as described in Targum. 

|וַיָּ֙קׇם֙ אַבְרָהָ֔ם מֵעַ֖ל פְּנֵ֣י מֵת֑וֹ וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר אֶל־בְּנֵי־חֵ֖ת לֵאמֹֽר׃|3 P|Then Abraham rose from beside his dead, and spoke to the Hittites, saying,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the feminine side of Yitzchok in the diagram of the 10 emanations, with Sarah's role in his birth highlighted, supported by Bereshit Rabbah 58:5. Halakhah explains the basis for Israel's claim to the Land of Israel and specific areas like the Cave of Machpelah. Jewish Thought discusses the multiple meanings of the Hebrew term "kam" in biblical texts. Kabbalah emphasizes the unity of all holy names and titles in adhering to HaShem. Midrash explores the precedence of Aaron's sons, Shimon and Yehuda ben Kimḥit, and themes of inheritance and honor. Mishnah details the acquisition and release of a wife through various means. Quoting Commentary reflects on Judaism's future-oriented faith despite grief, while Talmud debates exemptions from mitzvot in the presence of a deceased person. Targum recounts Abraham's actions after Sarah's death. 

|גֵּר־וְתוֹשָׁ֥ב אָנֹכִ֖י עִמָּכֶ֑ם תְּנ֨וּ לִ֤י אֲחֻזַּת־קֶ֙בֶר֙ עִמָּכֶ֔ם וְאֶקְבְּרָ֥ה מֵתִ֖י מִלְּפָנָֽי׃|4 P|“I am a resident alien among you; sell me a burial site among you, that I may remove my dead for burial.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham, as an outsider in Canaan, sought a burial plot for his wife Sarah to establish a connection to the land, negotiating with the locals who misunderstood his request as a gift. The tension between being a stranger and a resident is highlighted in the dialogue with the inhabitants of Hebron. The importance of showing mercy and generosity towards vulnerable groups, such as proselytes, is emphasized, with a focus on Abraham's actions and their impact on his descendants. Abraham's request for a burial site among the Hittites is discussed in Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. 

|וַיַּעֲנ֧וּ בְנֵי־חֵ֛ת אֶת־אַבְרָהָ֖ם לֵאמֹ֥ר לֽוֹ׃|5 P|And the Hittites replied to Abraham, saying to him,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Hittites appointed a single spokesman to respond to Abraham's request for a burial plot, showing respect for him. Abraham's interactions with mortals and angels were pleasing, and his behavior when burying Sarah emphasized giving thanks to God. Avraham symbolizes intellect hindered by physical powers, which must be separated to fully serve God. The sons of Hittah replied to Abraham's request for a burial site for Sarah. 

|שְׁמָעֵ֣נוּ ׀ אֲדֹנִ֗י נְשִׂ֨יא אֱלֹהִ֤ים אַתָּה֙ בְּתוֹכֵ֔נוּ בְּמִבְחַ֣ר קְבָרֵ֔ינוּ קְבֹ֖ר אֶת־מֵתֶ֑ךָ אִ֣ישׁ מִמֶּ֔נּוּ אֶת־קִבְר֛וֹ לֹֽא־יִכְלֶ֥ה מִמְּךָ֖ מִקְּבֹ֥ר מֵתֶֽךָ׃|6 P|“Hear us, my lord: you are the elect of God among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places; none of us will withhold his burial place from you for burying your dead.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the impact of righteous individuals like Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Avraham on their environment, attributing Rivkah's immaculate birth to Avraham's good deeds. Commentary highlights Abraham's respect and status as a prophet, while Halakhah emphasizes the importance of serving as a role model. Kabbalah interprets Avraham, Itzchak, and Yaakov as representing dominion, dread, and peace. Midrash praises Abraham's righteousness, faith, and obedience to God, while Musar discusses how Abraham purified and elevated those around him. Quoting Commentary connects Avraham's actions to bringing peace and his victories. Second Temple text recognizes Abraham's kingship based on wisdom and virtue, while Tanakh references David's acknowledgment of the LORD and his lord. Targum emphasizes the respect and honor shown to Abraham by those around him. 

|וַיָּ֧קׇם אַבְרָהָ֛ם וַיִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ לְעַם־הָאָ֖רֶץ לִבְנֵי־חֵֽת׃|7 P|Thereupon Abraham bowed low to the landowning citizens,  the Hittites,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham bowed down to the children of Heth as a sign of respect and gratitude, not to God, as clarified by various commentators. The children of Heth offered Abraham a burial plot for many burials, showing respect by calling him a prince of God. The sons of Chet acknowledged Abraham as a spiritual leader who purified their own roots, leading to their eventual salvation. Rashi explains that the word "stopped" in I Samuel 25:33 refers to preventing someone from doing something, as seen in other biblical verses like Tehillim 40:12 and Bereishis 23:6. In Genesis 23:7, Onkelos translates the people of the land as the sons of Cheis, while Targum Jonathan translates it as the sons of Hittah. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר אִתָּ֖ם לֵאמֹ֑ר אִם־יֵ֣שׁ אֶֽת־נַפְשְׁכֶ֗ם לִקְבֹּ֤ר אֶת־מֵתִי֙ מִלְּפָנַ֔י שְׁמָע֕וּנִי וּפִגְעוּ־לִ֖י בְּעֶפְר֥וֹן בֶּן־צֹֽחַר׃|8 P|and he said to them, “If it is your wish that I remove my dead for burial, you must agree to intercede for me with Ephron son of Zohar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yitro emphasized physical salvation and spiritual transformation for the Jewish people through the Torah, which guides their lives. Avraham sought to purchase a separate burial plot for his wife, with the Hittites acknowledging his righteousness. The term "נפשכם" signifies "your will," and "ופגעו לי" means entreaty. The Midrash warns against greed and stresses the importance of proper tithing, while Ibn Ezra and Rashi provide interpretations of various biblical verses. Reish Lakish explains liability for consuming forbidden fat, and Targum elaborates on Avraham's request to bury his dead. 

|וְיִתֶּן־לִ֗י אֶת־מְעָרַ֤ת הַמַּכְפֵּלָה֙ אֲשֶׁר־ל֔וֹ אֲשֶׁ֖ר בִּקְצֵ֣ה שָׂדֵ֑הוּ בְּכֶ֨סֶף מָלֵ֜א יִתְּנֶ֥נָּה לִּ֛י בְּתוֹכְכֶ֖ם לַאֲחֻזַּת־קָֽבֶר׃|9 P|Let him sell me the cave of Machpelah that he owns, which is at the edge of his land. Let him sell it to me, at the full price, for a burial site in your midst.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham wanted to purchase the cave of Machpelah from Efron to ensure a burial portion for his family in perpetuity, even though Efron offered him the entire field as well. Ephron's greed for wealth led to his loss, as illustrated in a story about tithing properly. The double cave in Genesis 23:9 is connected to virtues and their possessors, emphasizing the importance of goodness and worth. Rebbi Yasa and Rebbi Abbahu state that real estate cannot be bought for less than a peruṭah, contradicting Rebbi Ḥanina's belief that all šeqalim mentioned in the Torah are tetradrachmas. Abraham asked for the Machpeilah cave from Ephron at the end of his field, offering to buy it for its full value as a burial site. 

|וְעֶפְר֥וֹן יֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּת֣וֹךְ בְּנֵי־חֵ֑ת וַיַּ֩עַן֩ עֶפְר֨וֹן הַחִתִּ֤י אֶת־אַבְרָהָם֙ בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י בְנֵי־חֵ֔ת לְכֹ֛ל בָּאֵ֥י שַֽׁעַר־עִיר֖וֹ לֵאמֹֽר׃|10 P|Ephron was present among the Hittites; so Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, the assembly in his town’s gate,  saying,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham negotiated with Ephron for a burial site for Sarah in Genesis 23, with Ephron demanding a high price and ultimately being diminished due to his greed. Yehuda ben Tabai and Rambam caution against revealing legal opinions or organizing legal claims for others. Rabbi Ḥanina explains the different values of silver shekels in the Torah, Prophets, and Writings, with Ephron's shekels being an exception. The husband of the virtuous woman in Proverbs 31:23 is respected among the elders, and Ephron responded to Abraham in the presence of others in the city gate according to the Targum. 

|לֹֽא־אֲדֹנִ֣י שְׁמָעֵ֔נִי הַשָּׂדֶה֙ נָתַ֣תִּי לָ֔ךְ וְהַמְּעָרָ֥ה אֲשֶׁר־בּ֖וֹ לְךָ֣ נְתַתִּ֑יהָ לְעֵינֵ֧י בְנֵי־עַמִּ֛י נְתַתִּ֥יהָ לָּ֖ךְ קְבֹ֥ר מֵתֶֽךָ׃|11 P|“No, my lord, hear me: I give you the field and I give you the cave that is in it; I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Efron offers Abraham the entire field as a gift for burial purposes, as indicated by various commentators. G-d orchestrated events around the giving of the Torah to ensure Israel's favorable response. Rabbi Yehuda discusses incomplete generosity using Efron as an example, contrasting it with Abimelech's benevolence towards Isaac. Midrash highlights Ephron's initial promise and later demand for payment, illustrating the wicked's lack of follow-through. Rashi explains Psalm 110:1 as referring to Abraham, and Targum Onkelos and Jonathan both state that Abraham is given the field and cave as a gift for burial. 

|וַיִּשְׁתַּ֙חוּ֙ אַבְרָהָ֔ם לִפְנֵ֖י עַ֥ם הָאָֽרֶץ׃|12 P|Then Abraham bowed low before the landowning citizens,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham demonstrated humility by bowing before Ephron and the people of the land, acknowledging their role in the transaction and giving thanks to God for their permission to bury Sarah in the Cave of Machpelah (Reshit Chokhmah, Or Gadol 4:1; Midrash; Targum). 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֨ר אֶל־עֶפְר֜וֹן בְּאׇזְנֵ֤י עַם־הָאָ֙רֶץ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר אַ֛ךְ אִם־אַתָּ֥ה ל֖וּ שְׁמָעֵ֑נִי נָתַ֜תִּי כֶּ֤סֶף הַשָּׂדֶה֙ קַ֣ח מִמֶּ֔נִּי וְאֶקְבְּרָ֥ה אֶת־מֵתִ֖י שָֽׁמָּה׃|13 P|and spoke to Ephron in the hearing of the landowning citizens, saying, “If only you would hear me out! Let me pay the price of the land; accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Noach's saving of animals during the flood gave him ownership of the animal kingdom, allowing him to use some for food without causing pain. Avraham learned the term "קח" from Noach's actions to acquire animals for the ark, enabling him to use animals as beasts of burden. In the commentary, Abraham emphasizes his desire for Efron to accept payment for the burial plot for Sarah, using specific language to convey his intent. The Mishnah outlines transgressions punishable by stoning, including incest, bestiality, and idol worship, with distinctions made for unintentional sins. The Talmud discusses betrothal through money, drawing parallels between acquiring a wife and purchasing land. Abraham offers to pay Ephron for the burial plot in front of the people of the land. 

|וַיַּ֧עַן עֶפְר֛וֹן אֶת־אַבְרָהָ֖ם לֵאמֹ֥ר לֽוֹ׃|14 P|And Ephron replied to Abraham, saying to him,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ephron demanded an exorbitant price of four hundred shekels of silver for the field, which Abraham paid with the highest quality of coin. Ephron's greed was punished by the Torah diminishing the vav in his name. 

|אֲדֹנִ֣י שְׁמָעֵ֔נִי אֶ֩רֶץ֩ אַרְבַּ֨ע מֵאֹ֧ת שֶֽׁקֶל־כֶּ֛סֶף בֵּינִ֥י וּבֵֽינְךָ֖ מַה־הִ֑וא וְאֶת־מֵתְךָ֖ קְבֹֽר׃|15 P|“My lord, do hear me! A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver—what is that between you and me? Go and bury your dead.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how there are times when a person may not understand or see the great light of the tzaddik, mentions a concealed light for the righteous in the future, explores the meaning of the land worth four hundred shekels of silver in Genesis 23:15, praises Avraham's humility, highlights the righteous nature of Abraham in paying the full price for the burial site, discusses the principle that the wicked say much and do not do even a little as derived from Ephron, and translates Abraham's offer to purchase a burial plot for Sarah in Genesis 23:15 as "A land worth four hundred silver shekels" in Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. 

|וַיִּשְׁמַ֣ע אַבְרָהָם֮ אֶל־עֶפְרוֹן֒ וַיִּשְׁקֹ֤ל אַבְרָהָם֙ לְעֶפְרֹ֔ן אֶת־הַכֶּ֕סֶף אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֶּ֖ר בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י בְנֵי־חֵ֑ת אַרְבַּ֤ע מֵאוֹת֙ שֶׁ֣קֶל כֶּ֔סֶף עֹבֵ֖ר לַסֹּחֵֽר׃|16 P|Abraham accepted Ephron’s terms. Abraham paid out to Ephron the money that he had named in the hearing of the Hittites—four hundred shekels of silver at the going merchants’ rate.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the concealed light for the righteous, metaphorically referred to as the "pleasantness of the L–rd" and the "400 worlds of longing." Abraham's payment of 400 shekels of refined silver to Efron for the burial cave reflects his straightforward approach and Efron's lack of sincerity. Halakhah details the retroactive effect of a betrothal conditioned on a larger sum, with specific rules for validity and pending status. Jewish Thought contrasts Abraham's spiritual growth with Moses' concerns for justice and limitations, highlighting their different approaches. Kabbalah discusses the incomplete generosity of the wicked, using examples from Efron and Abimelech. Midrash references various biblical figures like Ephron, Balaam, and Abraham to discuss greed, consequences, and proper observance. The Talmud contrasts the actions of the wicked and the righteous, exemplified by Ephron and Abraham, while explaining the varying value of coins mentioned in scripture. Lastly, Targum recounts Abraham's payment to Ephron in negotiable currency for the burial cave. 

|וַיָּ֣קׇם ׀ שְׂדֵ֣ה עֶפְר֗וֹן אֲשֶׁר֙ בַּמַּכְפֵּלָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֖ר לִפְנֵ֣י מַמְרֵ֑א הַשָּׂדֶה֙ וְהַמְּעָרָ֣ה אֲשֶׁר־בּ֔וֹ וְכׇל־הָעֵץ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּשָּׂדֶ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּכׇל־גְּבֻל֖וֹ סָבִֽיב׃|17 P|So Ephron’s land in Machpelah, near Mamre—the field with its cave and all the trees anywhere within the confines of that field—passed|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham acquired a field and cave outside Kiryat Arba, transitioning from a commoner to a king, with the location previously known by different names. The term "kam" can signify confirmation or verification, as seen in biblical verses. In Bereshit Rabbah 58:8, the field of Ephron doubled in value after Abraham acquired it, and the righteous are compared to the sand. Or HaChaim explains the significance of "תשא" in Exodus 30:12, while Ramban clarifies the name "Machpelah." The Talmud discusses the exclusion of grafted carob and sycamore trunk from a field sale, with boundaries being acquired from the Torah. The Targum confirms Abraham's acquisition of the field of Ephron, including the cave and trees within it. 

|לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם לְמִקְנָ֖ה לְעֵינֵ֣י בְנֵי־חֵ֑ת בְּכֹ֖ל בָּאֵ֥י שַֽׁעַר־עִירֽוֹ׃|18 P|to Abraham as his possession, in the presence of the Hittites, of the assembly in his town’s gate.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham purchased the field from Ephron in the presence of local inhabitants after Sarah was buried there, with the money weighed in front of townspeople and a document confirming the sale handed to Abraham. The field in Makhpela doubled in value and sanctity after Abraham acquired it, with the transaction being equivalent to fulfilling the commandments and Torah. Ibn Ezra interprets Isaiah 54:15 as submitting to the authority of the people living in the land, while Targum states that Abraham purchased the land in front of witnesses at the city gate. 

|וְאַחֲרֵי־כֵן֩ קָבַ֨ר אַבְרָהָ֜ם אֶת־שָׂרָ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֗וֹ אֶל־מְעָרַ֞ת שְׂדֵ֧ה הַמַּכְפֵּלָ֛ה עַל־פְּנֵ֥י מַמְרֵ֖א הִ֣וא חֶבְר֑וֹן בְּאֶ֖רֶץ כְּנָֽעַן׃|19 P|And then Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field of Machpelah, facing Mamre—now Hebron—in the land of Canaan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham buried Sarah in the cave of Machpelah in Hebron to emphasize her burial in the land of Israel, fulfilling God's promise. Abraham's prayers for Adam and Eve were reflected in his actions of burying Sarah. The Midrash highlights Sarah's virtues and Abraham's deep love and honor towards her. Abraham and Sarah served as a rectification for Adam and Eve, ensuring their continuity in the afterlife. Rabbeinu Bahya and Ramban discuss the symbolic significance of the patriarchs' actions, while Targum simply states that Abraham buried Sarah in the cave of Machpelah. 

|וַיָּ֨קׇם הַשָּׂדֶ֜ה וְהַמְּעָרָ֧ה אֲשֶׁר־בּ֛וֹ לְאַבְרָהָ֖ם לַאֲחֻזַּת־קָ֑בֶר מֵאֵ֖ת בְּנֵי־חֵֽת׃|20 P|Thus the field with its cave passed from the Hittites to Abraham, as a burial site.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The townspeople agreed to sell Efron's fields to Avraham for the cave of Machpelah, establishing it as an inalienable burial site for him and his family, with the legal right to be buried alongside Sarah and the town seal attached to prevent future claims against the sale. Abraham paid a full price in silver to the children of Het for the cave, where he buried Sarah in Hebron after a mourning period of seven days. This act is seen as a rectification for Adam and Eve, ensuring their continuity in the afterlife through Abraham and Sarah. The purchase of the burial plot for Sara by Avraham reflects his dealings with neighbors and establishes a legal foothold in Canaan, balancing emotional reality with legal procedure and formalities typical of ancient Near Eastern contexts.

## Genesis 24

|וְאַבְרָהָ֣ם זָקֵ֔ן בָּ֖א בַּיָּמִ֑ים וַֽיהֹוָ֛ה בֵּרַ֥ךְ אֶת־אַבְרָהָ֖ם בַּכֹּֽל׃|1 J E|Abraham was now old, advanced in years, and יהוה had blessed Abraham in all things.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham, as an elder, was blessed by God with wealth, honor, and a son, desiring to see his son married before his death. The concept of old age signifies a connection to celestial largesse exclusive to the Jewish people, emphasizing the importance of spiritual growth and avoiding incorrect opinions and actions. The acceptance of converts is associated with serving God before experiencing good times, with Passover focused on God and Sukkot on heavenly bounty. Abraham raised Malchut/Kingship with kindness and observance of Torah, leading to blessings, and the Mishnah praises him for observing all mitzvot and being blessed in his old age. In the Liturgy, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are highlighted for their blessings, and the Talmud emphasizes their graceful aging as Torah scholars, contrasting Torah study with other professions. King David and Abraham are both described as old in the Tanakh, and both Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Abraham's old age and blessings. Rabbi Nehorai advocates teaching Torah over worldly trades, drawing parallels to Abraham's blessings and the abundance during his lifetime. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָהָ֗ם אֶל־עַבְדּוֹ֙ זְקַ֣ן בֵּית֔וֹ הַמֹּשֵׁ֖ל בְּכׇל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֑וֹ שִֽׂים־נָ֥א יָדְךָ֖ תַּ֥חַת יְרֵכִֽי׃|2 J E|And Abraham said to the senior servant of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, “Put your hand under my thigh|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer, as the faithful servant of Abraham, represents the lower Covenant in Chasidut, with a focus on Torah sh’b’AL Peh, guiding others modestly. In Kabbalah, keeping God's statutes involves caution against temptation, symbolized by a harlot. The Midrash texts explore various aspects of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob's lives, with Eliezer playing a key role in finding a wife for Isaac. In Musar, Eliezer resembles Abraham in appearance and control over his evil urge. The Talmud discusses Eliezer's mastery of his master's Torah and the symbolism of taking oaths. Israel asks Joseph in Tanakh not to bury him in Egypt, and a curse of adjuration is administered to a woman in Numbers 5:21. Abraham instructs his senior servant in Targum to place his hand under his thigh as a sign of loyalty and commitment. After Abraham's death, Isaac restored prosperity in Tosefta by sowing, reaping, and reopening wells filled by the Philistines. 

|וְאַשְׁבִּ֣יעֲךָ֔ בַּֽיהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם וֵֽאלֹהֵ֖י הָאָ֑רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא־תִקַּ֤ח אִשָּׁה֙ לִבְנִ֔י מִבְּנוֹת֙ הַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר אָנֹכִ֖י יוֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּקִרְבּֽוֹ׃|3 J E|and I will make you swear by יהוה, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham and Isaac were careful in selecting wives for their sons to ensure adherence to religious laws, with Abraham emphasizing the importance of choosing a spouse based on reverence for God and family reputation to avoid intermarriage with Canaanites. Different terms are used to express the relations of the heavens to God, and oaths are discussed in relation to vows, with the court administering oaths based on Abraham's instruction to his servant. Abraham's servant swore by the Word of the Lord God not to take a wife for Isaac from the Canaanites, and oaths are imposed by the court based on their understanding, as seen in Moses imposing an oath on the Children of Israel. 

|כִּ֧י אֶל־אַרְצִ֛י וְאֶל־מוֹלַדְתִּ֖י תֵּלֵ֑ךְ וְלָקַחְתָּ֥ אִשָּׁ֖ה לִבְנִ֥י לְיִצְחָֽק׃|4 J E|but will go to the land of my birth and get a wife for my son Isaac.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham insists that his servant find a wife for Isaac from his own relatives to maintain faith and lineage within the family, emphasizing the importance of finding a suitable match in character and compatibility. Abraham's concern for the observance of the law of Increase and multiply is evident in his instructions to find a wife from his family, as seen in the story of Rebecca in the Midrash and Targum. Abraham's journey to Canaan was based on his belief in the Divine promise, as clarified by Ramban. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָיו֙ הָעֶ֔בֶד אוּלַי֙ לֹא־תֹאבֶ֣ה הָֽאִשָּׁ֔ה לָלֶ֥כֶת אַחֲרַ֖י אֶל־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֑את הֶֽהָשֵׁ֤ב אָשִׁיב֙ אֶת־בִּנְךָ֔ אֶל־הָאָ֖רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יָצָ֥אתָ מִשָּֽׁם׃|5 J|And the servant said to him, “What if the woman does not consent to follow me to this land, shall I then take your son back to the land from which you came?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer is concerned about finding a wife for Isaac who is willing to return with him to Canaan, with Abraham instructing him to find a wife from his own relatives if necessary. After prophecy ceased, even sages cannot change a commandment. In Bereshit Rabbah, Eliezer contemplates exploiting Isaac's status, but Abraham rejects the idea. Different interpretations of Moses' question about bringing water from the rock are given by Ramban, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, and Rashi. The Targum mentions Eliezer asking if the woman would return with him to the land, suggesting bringing Isaac back if she refused. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖יו אַבְרָהָ֑ם הִשָּׁ֣מֶר לְךָ֔ פֶּן־תָּשִׁ֥יב אֶת־בְּנִ֖י שָֽׁמָּה׃|6 J|Abraham answered him, “On no account must you take my son back there!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the difference between Avraham's love for people and Yitzchok's reverence for God, Torah scholars deserving reverence, and the interpretations of "et" in the Torah. Commentary on Genesis 24:6 highlights Abraham's concern for Yitzchak's spiritual well-being and connection to the promised land. Midrash discusses Abraham's warning to Eliezer, with Rabbi Dosa suggesting the involvement of angels. Musar connects the Torah's command for pilgrimages to Isaac as an unblemished offering. Quoting Commentary provides Radak's explanations of Chavah's misinterpretation and the use of פן in the Torah. Targum simply states that Abraham warns his servant not to bring his son back to his homeland. 

|יְהֹוָ֣ה ׀ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַשָּׁמַ֗יִם אֲשֶׁ֨ר לְקָחַ֜נִי מִבֵּ֣ית אָבִי֮ וּמֵאֶ֣רֶץ מֽוֹלַדְתִּי֒ וַאֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבֶּר־לִ֜י וַאֲשֶׁ֤ר נִֽשְׁבַּֽע־לִי֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר לְזַ֨רְעֲךָ֔ אֶתֵּ֖ן אֶת־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֑את ה֗וּא יִשְׁלַ֤ח מַלְאָכוֹ֙ לְפָנֶ֔יךָ וְלָקַחְתָּ֥ אִשָּׁ֛ה לִבְנִ֖י מִשָּֽׁם׃|7 J|יהוה, the God of heaven—who took me from my father’s house and from my native land, who promised me on oath, saying, ‘I will assign this land to your offspring’—will send a messenger before you, and you will get a wife for my son from there.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham prays for an angel to help Eliezer find a wife for Isaac, emphasizing God's role in guiding their descendants and recognizing God as the King of heaven and earth. The Midrash discusses how angels protected the patriarchs and their descendants, while the Musar text explores the concept of the קליפה preceding light in Creation and the protection of the patriarchs' children. The Targum emphasizes God's role in guiding Abraham's servant to find a wife for Isaac, highlighting the divine promise of giving the land to Abraham's descendants. 

|וְאִם־לֹ֨א תֹאבֶ֤ה הָֽאִשָּׁה֙ לָלֶ֣כֶת אַחֲרֶ֔יךָ וְנִקִּ֕יתָ מִשְּׁבֻעָתִ֖י זֹ֑את רַ֣ק אֶת־בְּנִ֔י לֹ֥א תָשֵׁ֖ב שָֽׁמָּה׃|8 J|And if the woman does not consent to follow you, you shall then be clear of this oath to me; but do not take my son back there.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Likutei Moharan, Elul is connected to a woman's willingness, as seen in the initials of a verse from Genesis 24:8 spelling out ELUL. Abraham instructs Eliezer not to bring Isaac back to his birthplace, emphasizing not marrying a Canaanite woman. Mishnah Nedarim 1:2 lists substitute terms for offerings, dedication to the Temple treasury, and other concepts. The Creation report in Shenei Luchot HaBerit discusses the concept of קליפה preceding light, symbolizing Israel's exile before the Messiah. The Talmud states that a woman cannot be brought against her wishes for marriage. 

|וַיָּ֤שֶׂם הָעֶ֙בֶד֙ אֶת־יָד֔וֹ תַּ֛חַת יֶ֥רֶךְ אַבְרָהָ֖ם אֲדֹנָ֑יו וַיִּשָּׁ֣בַֽע ל֔וֹ עַל־הַדָּבָ֖ר הַזֶּֽה׃|9 J|So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore to him as bidden. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The servant swore an oath to Abraham, accepting all conditions, with the oath being absolute regarding a Canaanite girl and conditional if a girl from Abraham's birthplace refused to move to Canaan. The Midrash Tanchuma emphasizes the harmful nature of slander, comparing it to a dart that can cause spiritual death, with examples from Scripture illustrating the consequences. Ramban explains the meaning of vows and oaths, criticizing Rashi's interpretation, while Targum describes the servant swearing by placing his hand under Abraham's thigh or on his circumcised part. 

|וַיִּקַּ֣ח הָ֠עֶ֠בֶד עֲשָׂרָ֨ה גְמַלִּ֜ים מִגְּמַלֵּ֤י אֲדֹנָיו֙ וַיֵּ֔לֶךְ וְכׇל־ט֥וּב אֲדֹנָ֖יו בְּיָד֑וֹ וַיָּ֗קׇם וַיֵּ֛לֶךְ אֶל־אֲרַ֥ם נַֽהֲרַ֖יִם אֶל־עִ֥יר נָחֽוֹר׃|10 J|Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and set out, taking with him all the bounty of his master; and he made his way to Aram-naharaim, to the city of Nahor.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer took ten camels loaded with Abraham's possessions, including a document appointing Isaac as heir, to show the bride's family wealth she would marry into. The camels were muzzled to avoid grazing elsewhere, and were specially trained for Abraham's needs. Eliezer's departure was part of the journey preparations, taking silver and golden trinkets without permission. In Kabbalah, Metatron governs ten grades represented by camels. Midrash discusses Pinchas avenging Midianites for selling Joseph, Jacob setting out with a staff, and Abraham's camels being muzzled. Musar interprets Eliezer's mission to find Isaac's wife as enabling Jacob's birth. Radak, Tur HaArokh, Rashi, Ramban, Hizkuni, Second Temple, Targum, and Tosefta provide additional insights on the events. 

|וַיַּבְרֵ֧ךְ הַגְּמַלִּ֛ים מִח֥וּץ לָעִ֖יר אֶל־בְּאֵ֣ר הַמָּ֑יִם לְעֵ֣ת עֶ֔רֶב לְעֵ֖ת צֵ֥את הַשֹּׁאֲבֹֽת׃|11 J|He made the camels kneel down by the well outside the city, at evening time, the time when women come out to draw water.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer made the camels kneel twice at the well outside the city at sunset to water them, hoping to find a suitable wife for his master's son. The Midrash discusses omens related to taking a wife, the muzzling of Abraham's camels, and divine intervention in reaching long distances quickly. Rashi connects the act of kneeling in Psalms 95:6 to Genesis 24:11. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the scene of the camels resting by the well in the evening when women drew water. 

|וַיֹּאמַ֓ר ׀ יְהֹוָ֗ה אֱלֹהֵי֙ אֲדֹנִ֣י אַבְרָהָ֔ם הַקְרֵה־נָ֥א לְפָנַ֖י הַיּ֑וֹם וַעֲשֵׂה־חֶ֕סֶד עִ֖ם אֲדֹנִ֥י אַבְרָהָֽם׃|12 J|And he said, “O יהוה, God of my master Abraham’s [house], grant me good fortune this day, and deal graciously with my master Abraham:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains Betuel and Lavan's initial evil intentions towards Rivkah marrying Yitzchok, later changing their minds to prevent him from marrying another woman while the emissary was on his way. Eliezer prayed for God's kindness to fulfill Abraham's prayer for a suitable wife for Isaac, directing his prayer towards God's attribute of kindness. The Midrash praises Eliezer's faith and wisdom in choosing to serve Abraham, highlighting Isaac's dedication to God. Musar reflects on the attributes of the patriarchs seen in securing a wife for Isaac, connecting Abraham's kindness and Isaac's strength to Eliezer's prayer and Rebekah's actions. The Talmud lists seven patriarchs who died in honor without being affected by worms and maggots, along with seven individuals who entered Paradise alive due to specific merits. Targum references both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mentioning the servant of Abraham praying to God to find a suitable wife for Isaac. 

|הִנֵּ֛ה אָנֹכִ֥י נִצָּ֖ב עַל־עֵ֣ין הַמָּ֑יִם וּבְנוֹת֙ אַנְשֵׁ֣י הָעִ֔יר יֹצְאֹ֖ת לִשְׁאֹ֥ב מָֽיִם׃|13 J|Here I stand by the spring as the daughters of the townspeople  come out to draw water;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Eliezer sought a kind and generous wife for Yitzchok, finding Rivkah at the well displaying these traits inherited from Avraham. The Commentary emphasizes Eliezer's testing of potential brides based on their behavior and the deeper meanings of the well's description. The Midrash discusses the importance of returning borrowed items promptly and how God responds to unreasonable demands. Quoting Commentary explores the concept of righteousness faltering momentarily in the face of evil, clarifying misunderstandings about setting signs for oneself. The Targum translations of Genesis 24:13 by Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe Rebekah at the well drawing water with the townsmen's daughters. 

|וְהָיָ֣ה הַֽנַּעֲרָ֗ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֹמַ֤ר אֵלֶ֙יהָ֙ הַטִּי־נָ֤א כַדֵּךְ֙ וְאֶשְׁתֶּ֔ה וְאָמְרָ֣ה שְׁתֵ֔ה וְגַם־גְּמַלֶּ֖יךָ אַשְׁקֶ֑ה אֹתָ֤הּ הֹכַ֙חְתָּ֙ לְעַבְדְּךָ֣ לְיִצְחָ֔ק וּבָ֣הּ אֵדַ֔ע כִּי־עָשִׂ֥יתָ חֶ֖סֶד עִם־אֲדֹנִֽי׃|14 J|let the maiden to whom I say, ‘Please, lower your jar that I may drink,’ and who replies, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels’—let her be the one whom You have decreed for Your servant Isaac. Thereby shall I know that You have dealt graciously with my master.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rivkah's birth was influenced by Avraham, leading to her kindness and connection to him, symbolizing the overflow of Avraham's good deeds. Eliezer tested Rivkah's character before confirming her suitability for Isaac, based on kindness and generosity. Eliezer's prayer for a sign from God was not considered inappropriate, focusing on the girl's traits. Eliezer's reliance on character traits over omens is highlighted, contrasting with Rav's refusal to rely on divination. Eliezer, Caleb, Saul, and Yiftaḥ made unreasonable requests to God, with varying consequences. Moses' role as a provider for his people is likened to that of the angel Mattatron. Eliezer's test for Rivkah's generosity and humility, and Moses' role as a provider, are emphasized in their respective contexts. 

|וַֽיְהִי־ה֗וּא טֶ֘רֶם֮ כִּלָּ֣ה לְדַבֵּר֒ וְהִנֵּ֧ה רִבְקָ֣ה יֹצֵ֗את אֲשֶׁ֤ר יֻלְּדָה֙ לִבְתוּאֵ֣ל בֶּן־מִלְכָּ֔ה אֵ֥שֶׁת נָח֖וֹר אֲחִ֣י אַבְרָהָ֑ם וְכַדָּ֖הּ עַל־שִׁכְמָֽהּ׃|15 J|He had scarcely finished speaking, when Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milcah the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor, came out with her jar on her shoulder.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rivkah's lineage is emphasized as being from the primary wife of Nahor, showing her close relationship to Abraham. The commentary on Akeidat Yitzchak 5:1:14 raises questions regarding the text's syntax and narrative structure. In the Kabbalah text Tikkunei Zohar, prayer can elevate the Shekhinah towards the blessed Holy One. Abraham's servant Eliezer, Caleb, Saul, and Yiftaḥ made inappropriate demands of God. Mishnah Demai 7:8 specifies how to determine which jugs of wine are to be tithed when rows or jugs are not specified. The Talmud presents remedies for various ailments, with specific combinations and mnemonics for each. Rivkah, the daughter of Bethuel and Milcah, came out with a pitcher on her shoulder while Eliezer was still speaking. 

|וְהַֽנַּעֲרָ֗ טֹבַ֤ת מַרְאֶה֙ מְאֹ֔ד בְּתוּלָ֕ה וְאִ֖ישׁ לֹ֣א יְדָעָ֑הּ וַתֵּ֣רֶד הָעַ֔יְנָה וַתְּמַלֵּ֥א כַדָּ֖הּ וַתָּֽעַל׃|16 J|The maiden was very beautiful—[and] a virgin, no man having known her.  She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries and interpretations discuss the virginity and modesty of Rivkah in Genesis 24:16, emphasizing her purity and unique qualities. The Talmud highlights the requirement for the High Priest to marry a virgin, defined as a maiden who has not had sexual intercourse. The Targum describes Rivkah as a virgin and very beautiful, emphasizing her actions at the well. The concept of illumination of chochmah and the significance of virginity are discussed in Kabbalistic texts, linking these traits to Divine Wisdom. The Midrash emphasizes the restoration of the homes of the righteous and the importance of studying Torah. Ramban, Tur HaArokh, Zevach Pesach, Tze'enah Ure'enah, and Chizkuni provide further insights into the significance of virginity and modesty in biblical texts. 

|וַיָּ֥רׇץ הָעֶ֖בֶד לִקְרָאתָ֑הּ וַיֹּ֕אמֶר הַגְמִיאִ֥ינִי נָ֛א מְעַט־מַ֖יִם מִכַּדֵּֽךְ׃|17 J|The servant ran toward her and said, “Please, let me sip a little water from your jar.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries highlight different reasons for Eliezer running towards Rebekah at the well, such as her worthiness indicated by the rising water, her beauty, and her prompt response to his request. The path of the wise involves finding balance in traits, displaying anger only when necessary, and maintaining a composed sense of joy. The Midrash discusses righteous eating habits and atonement for sins through sacrifices, promising a great table in the World to Come for the righteous. In Musar, Eliezer is accompanied by the angel Mattatron on his mission, reflecting on the success of his mission based on Heavenly input. The Talmud debates the liability for carrying out milk based on the amount swallowed in one gulp, with a discussion on the spelling of kedei gemia. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both mention Eliezer running to meet Rebekah and asking for water from her pitcher in Genesis 24:17. 

|וַתֹּ֖אמֶר שְׁתֵ֣ה אֲדֹנִ֑י וַתְּמַהֵ֗ר וַתֹּ֧רֶד כַּדָּ֛הּ עַל־יָדָ֖הּ וַתַּשְׁקֵֽהוּ׃|18 J|“Drink, my lord,” she said, and she quickly lowered her jar upon her hand and let him drink.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca showed good manners by offering water to Eliezer and addressing him as "my lord," ensuring he could drink easily by lowering the pitcher to his mouth and removing it from her shoulder. The symbolism of offering water to the Righteous-One and his camels is discussed in Tikkunei Zohar, while Vayikra Rabbah emphasizes the importance of staying faithful to God and Torah in times of challenge. Rashi derived Hashem's concern for the Israelites' possessions from the mention of animals in Numbers 20:8, supported by the specific mention of livestock when providing water. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also recount the story of Rebekah's kindness in offering water to Abraham's servant in Genesis 24:18. 

|וַתְּכַ֖ל לְהַשְׁקֹת֑וֹ וַתֹּ֗אמֶר גַּ֤ם לִגְמַלֶּ֙יךָ֙ אֶשְׁאָ֔ב עַ֥ד אִם־כִּלּ֖וּ לִשְׁתֹּֽת׃|19 J|When she had let him drink his fill, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they finish drinking.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rivkah showed respect by waiting for Eliezer to finish drinking before speaking to him, prioritized his need for water over the camels, and demonstrated care and attentiveness towards both him and the animals (Commentary). The servant was amazed by Rebekah's kindness towards him and his camels, expressed gratitude to God for guiding him to her family's house, and gave her valuable gifts (Midrash). Rebekah not only gave water to the servant but also offered to water his camels until they had enough to drink (Targum). Sforno, Radak, Or HaChaim, and Rashi provide interpretations of specific phrases and constructions in biblical verses related to these actions (Quoting Commentary). 

|וַתְּמַהֵ֗ר וַתְּעַ֤ר כַּדָּהּ֙ אֶל־הַשֹּׁ֔קֶת וַתָּ֥רׇץ ע֛וֹד אֶֽל־הַבְּאֵ֖ר לִשְׁאֹ֑ב וַתִּשְׁאַ֖ב לְכׇל־גְּמַלָּֽיו׃|20 J|Quickly emptying her jar into the trough, she ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca's quick and diligent actions in providing water for Eliezer and his camels demonstrate righteousness and ethical conduct, reflecting the value of fulfilling obligations to God without delay. Various commentators reference the pouring out of a vessel in different biblical verses to explain the act of giving or sacrificing, emphasizing the importance of performing deeds with alacrity. In the Second Temple period, Rebecca's actions are portrayed as kind and generous, showing perfection in her care for others. The Targums also highlight Rebecca's swift and efficient actions in providing water for Eliezer and his camels. 

|וְהָאִ֥ישׁ מִשְׁתָּאֵ֖ה לָ֑הּ מַחֲרִ֕ישׁ לָדַ֗עַת הַֽהִצְלִ֧יחַ יְהֹוָ֛ה דַּרְכּ֖וֹ אִם־לֹֽא׃|21 J|The man,  meanwhile, stood gazing at her, silently wondering whether יהוה had made his errand successful or not.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 24, Eliezer is astonished by Rebekah's kindness and generosity, remaining silent until she finishes providing water for the camels. The servant recognizes her righteousness, expresses gratitude to God for guiding him, and gives her valuable gifts. The Talmud discusses uncommon expressions in the Torah, such as "שאה" and "גָּרָב," with unique meanings. The Targum highlights the man's silent observation to determine the success of his mission. 

|וַיְהִ֗י כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר כִּלּ֤וּ הַגְּמַלִּים֙ לִשְׁתּ֔וֹת וַיִּקַּ֤ח הָאִישׁ֙ נֶ֣זֶם זָהָ֔ב בֶּ֖קַע מִשְׁקָל֑וֹ וּשְׁנֵ֤י צְמִידִים֙ עַל־יָדֶ֔יהָ עֲשָׂרָ֥ה זָהָ֖ב מִשְׁקָלָֽם׃|22 J|When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold nose-ring weighing a half-shekel,  and two gold bands for her arms, ten shekels in weight.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer gave Rebecca a golden nose ring and two bracelets symbolizing the Israelites' shekels, tablets of stone, and Ten Commandments, which correspond to the 100 blessings recited daily to repair the loss of 100 lives. In the Midrash, Eliezer saw Rebecca's righteousness through her good deeds, leading to a positive outcome in finding a wife for Isaac. The Talmud discusses various gold items for atonement in offerings to the Eternal, and in the Tanakh, it is instructed to make a frontlet of pure gold engraved with the seal inscription "Holy to יהוה." [Shulchan Shel Arba 1:39, Bereshit Rabbah 60:6, Talmud, Exodus 28:36] 

|וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ בַּת־מִ֣י אַ֔תְּ הַגִּ֥ידִי נָ֖א לִ֑י הֲיֵ֧שׁ בֵּית־אָבִ֛יךְ מָק֥וֹם לָ֖נוּ לָלִֽין׃|23 J|“Pray tell me,” he said, “whose daughter are you? Is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer sought lodging for the night in Rivkah's father's house, using "ללין," while Rivkah offered lodging for multiple nights with "ללון," showcasing her family's hospitality and Eliezer's confidence in divine guidance. The Midrash emphasizes Eliezer's honesty and integrity, recognizing Rivkah's righteousness and generosity. The Targum mentions the servant asking Rebekah about her lineage and lodging for the night in her father's house. Ibn Ezra and Rashi provide explanations and insights on various biblical passages related to lodging and divine guidance. Studies in Spirituality highlight the journey of Judaism through the patriarchs living in tents. 

|וַתֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔יו בַּת־בְּתוּאֵ֖ל אָנֹ֑כִי בֶּן־מִלְכָּ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָלְדָ֖ה לְנָחֽוֹר׃|24 J|She replied, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca emphasized her lineage by mentioning her father Betuel to Eliezer, highlighting well-known family members to establish her genealogy clearly. Despite being born into a family of wicked individuals, Rebecca is described as being from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban to show her deviation from their ways and focus on good deeds. The servant recognized Rebecca's righteousness through her acts of kindness, hospitality, and gratitude, symbolized by jewelry representing the Ten Commandments. Rebekah's identification as the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, born to Nahor is emphasized in the Targum commentary. 

|וַתֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔יו גַּם־תֶּ֥בֶן גַּם־מִסְפּ֖וֹא רַ֣ב עִמָּ֑נוּ גַּם־מָק֖וֹם לָלֽוּן׃|25 J|And she went on, “There is plenty of straw  and feed at home, and also room to spend the night.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rivkah's generosity extended to providing lodging, straw, and fodder for Eliezer's camels, demonstrating wisdom by answering questions in order and offering additional information. The Midrash highlights Rebekah's righteousness in offering water to Eliezer and his camels, leading to divine intervention in their meeting. Rashi explains the difference between "לין" and "ללון" as one night's lodging versus many nights'. The Talmud references Rebecca's quick marriage preparation, while the Targum emphasizes Rebekah's assurance of hospitality for Eliezer. 

|וַיִּקֹּ֣ד הָאִ֔ישׁ וַיִּשְׁתַּ֖חוּ לַֽיהֹוָֽה׃|26 J|The man bowed low in homage to יהוה|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer expressed gratitude to God by bowing and prostrating himself, symbolizing submission and praise for divine guidance. The servant recognized Rebekah's righteousness, was amazed by her generosity, and thanked God for guiding him to her family. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the man bowing and worshiping before the Lord in acknowledgment of finding a suitable wife for Isaac. 

|וַיֹּ֗אמֶר בָּר֤וּךְ יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵי֙ אֲדֹנִ֣י אַבְרָהָ֔ם אֲ֠שֶׁ֠ר לֹֽא־עָזַ֥ב חַסְדּ֛וֹ וַאֲמִתּ֖וֹ מֵעִ֣ם אֲדֹנִ֑י אָנֹכִ֗י בַּדֶּ֙רֶךְ֙ נָחַ֣נִי יְהֹוָ֔ה בֵּ֖ית אֲחֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽי׃|27 J|and said, “Blessed be יהוה, the God of my master Abraham’s [house], who has not withheld steadfast faithfulness from my master. For I have been guided on my errand by יהוה, to the house of my master’s kin.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer felt guided by Hashem to Avraham's family, recognizing God's involvement in his successful mission to find a wife for Isaac. Prayer is a process of connecting with the Divine, and Emeth is associated with lovingkindness. In various Midrashim, characters like Rebekah, Abraham, and Esau's punishment are discussed in connection to God's justice. Non-Jews like Noah, Eliezer, and Yitro also express praise to God in the Torah, despite not being part of the Abrahamic covenant. The servant of Abraham praises God for leading him to the right place. 

|וַתָּ֙רׇץ֙ הַֽנַּעֲרָ֔ וַתַּגֵּ֖ד לְבֵ֣ית אִמָּ֑הּ כַּדְּבָרִ֖ים הָאֵֽלֶּה׃|28 J|The maiden ran and told all this to her mother’s household.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca confided in her mother about what happened, following the common practice of daughters sharing their experiences with their mothers first. Laban assessed Eliezer for financial gain and welcomed him into the house, clearing it of idol worship. Ramban explains Bethuel's lineage through his mother Milcah and discusses Potiphar's wife's accusation against Joseph. Onkelos translates Genesis 24:28 as Rebecca running to tell her mother's household about the events. 

|וּלְרִבְקָ֥ה אָ֖ח וּשְׁמ֣וֹ לָבָ֑ן וַיָּ֨רׇץ לָבָ֧ן אֶל־הָאִ֛ישׁ הַח֖וּצָה אֶל־הָעָֽיִן׃|29 J|Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man at the spring—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Laban's initial suspicion of Eliezer due to the nose-ring on Rebecca led him to offer hospitality, showing a focus on money rather than genuine care. Midrash texts highlight the lineage of David from Boaz and Ruth, the contrast between the wicked and righteous, Laban's wickedness, and discussions on the nazirite vow and repentance. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos mention Laban running towards the man at the well. 

|וַיְהִ֣י ׀ כִּרְאֹ֣ת אֶת־הַנֶּ֗זֶם וְֽאֶת־הַצְּמִדִים֮ עַל־יְדֵ֣י אֲחֹתוֹ֒ וּכְשׇׁמְע֗וֹ אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֞י רִבְקָ֤ה אֲחֹתוֹ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר כֹּֽה־דִבֶּ֥ר אֵלַ֖י הָאִ֑ישׁ וַיָּבֹא֙ אֶל־הָאִ֔ישׁ וְהִנֵּ֛ה עֹמֵ֥ד עַל־הַגְּמַלִּ֖ים עַל־הָעָֽיִן׃|30 J|when he saw the nose-ring and the bands on his sister’s arms, and when he heard his sister Rebekah say, “Thus the man spoke to me.” He went up to the man, who was still standing beside the camels at the spring.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Laban welcomed Eliezer into his home after seeing the gifts and hearing about his interactions with Rebecca, although his invitation was not wholehearted. The Midrash interprets Laban's actions as welcoming due to Eliezer's resemblance to Abraham and his faithful service, while the Musar commentary depicts Laban as ill-willed and greedy, trying to swindle Eliezer in the match between Rebecca and Isaac. Chizkuni explains the word על as meaning "beside" in various verses, emphasizing proximity rather than physical placement. Targum describes Laban approaching Eliezer after seeing the gifts and hearing Rebecca's words. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר בּ֖וֹא בְּר֣וּךְ יְהֹוָ֑ה לָ֤מָּה תַעֲמֹד֙ בַּח֔וּץ וְאָנֹכִי֙ פִּנִּ֣יתִי הַבַּ֔יִת וּמָק֖וֹם לַגְּמַלִּֽים׃|31 J|“Come in, O blessed of יהוה,” he said, “why do you remain outside, when I have made ready the house and a place for the camels?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer was blessed for serving Abraham faithfully, Laban acknowledged God's blessings on him and cleared his house of idols before inviting Eliezer in, the Sages discuss the connection between sins and curses in Israel, and the Talmud tells stories of pious individuals and their righteous actions bringing blessings. Laban mistook Eliezer for Abraham and welcomed him as a blessed servant of the Lord. 

|וַיָּבֹ֤א הָאִישׁ֙ הַבַּ֔יְתָה וַיְפַתַּ֖ח הַגְּמַלִּ֑ים וַיִּתֵּ֨ן תֶּ֤בֶן וּמִסְפּוֹא֙ לַגְּמַלִּ֔ים וּמַ֙יִם֙ לִרְחֹ֣ץ רַגְלָ֔יו וְרַגְלֵ֥י הָאֲנָשִׁ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר אִתּֽוֹ׃|32 J|So the man entered the house, and the camels were unloaded. The camels were given straw and feed, and water was brought to bathe his feet and the feet of the entourage  under him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Laban showed hospitality to Eliezer and his camels by providing them with food and water, demonstrating respect for guests and symbolizing his eagerness to expedite the marriage of Rebecca to Isaac. The Midrash emphasizes the righteousness of Abraham's camels and the significance of small details in Jewish law, while the Musar commentary highlights Laban's motives for hastening the marriage and Eliezer's generosity towards Rebecca. The Targum mentions Laban's actions of providing for the camels and washing the feet of the visitors. 

|לְפָנָיו֙ לֶאֱכֹ֔ל וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ לֹ֣א אֹכַ֔ל עַ֥ד אִם־דִּבַּ֖רְתִּי דְּבָרָ֑י וַיֹּ֖אמֶר דַּבֵּֽר׃|33 J|But when food was set before him, he said, “I will not eat until I have told my tale.” He said, “Speak, then.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Eliezer betrothed Rivkah as Yitzchok's representative and followed the tradition of the groom not eating until after the wedding, which is still practiced today. In Halakhah, Judaism prohibits eating before feeding animals, based on Deuteronomy 11:15. The Midrash discusses the importance of mentioning uncomplimentary traits first and highlights the significance of washing feet. In the Targum, Abraham's servant refused to eat food he suspected was poisoned until he spoke his words first. 

|וַיֹּאמַ֑ר עֶ֥בֶד אַבְרָהָ֖ם אָנֹֽכִי׃|34 J|“I am Abraham’s servant,” he began.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 24:34, Eliezer arrived in Charan as Abraham's servant, earning respect and patience from Betu'el and Laban. Rabba bar Mari explains the importance of acknowledging personal deficiencies before a mission, citing Eliezer's humility as an example. The Talmud references Eliezer as a model for immediately declaring his servant status, highlighting the servant's responsibility for all matters in his master's household. Both Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan identify the servant in Genesis 24:34 as Abraham's servant. 

|וַיהֹוָ֞ה בֵּרַ֧ךְ אֶת־אֲדֹנִ֛י מְאֹ֖ד וַיִּגְדָּ֑ל וַיִּתֶּן־ל֞וֹ צֹ֤אן וּבָקָר֙ וְכֶ֣סֶף וְזָהָ֔ב וַעֲבָדִם֙ וּשְׁפָחֹ֔ת וּגְמַלִּ֖ים וַחֲמֹרִֽים׃|35 J|“יהוה has greatly blessed my master, who has become rich—giving him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female slaves, camels and asses.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer praised Abraham's wealth and success, mentioning that he had been greatly blessed by God with flocks, cattle, silver, gold, slaves, and more. Eliezer, who acted as a matchmaker, highlighted Abraham's abundance, including his many possessions and the fact that he had only one manservant, Eliezer himself, who performed tasks as if he were many men. The Targum states that God blessed Abraham with sheep, cattle, silver, gold, male and female slaves, camels, and donkeys. 

|וַתֵּ֡לֶד שָׂרָה֩ אֵ֨שֶׁת אֲדֹנִ֥י בֵן֙ לַֽאדֹנִ֔י אַחֲרֵ֖י זִקְנָתָ֑הּ וַיִּתֶּן־ל֖וֹ אֶת־כׇּל־אֲשֶׁר־לֽוֹ׃|36 J|And Sarah, my master’s wife, bore my master a son in her old age, and he has assigned to him everything he owns.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham gave all his possessions to his son Isaac, emphasizing his legitimacy and piety, ensuring his wealth and honor. The inheritance was given to Isaac because his mother Sarah was too old to have more children, and the issue of disinheritance of Ishmael was resolved by suggesting they were both converts. The Targum also states that Sarah gave birth to Isaac in her old age, and Abraham gave him all his possessions. 

|וַיַּשְׁבִּעֵ֥נִי אֲדֹנִ֖י לֵאמֹ֑ר לֹא־תִקַּ֤ח אִשָּׁה֙ לִבְנִ֔י מִבְּנוֹת֙ הַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר אָנֹכִ֖י יֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּאַרְצֽוֹ׃|37 J|Now my master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I dwell;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham's servant was sent to find a wife for Abraham's son from his own family to fulfill an oath made by Abraham, who did not want his son to marry a Canaanite woman because he would inherit all of his wealth and wanted to ensure a suitable wife from his own family (Targum). 

|אִם־לֹ֧א אֶל־בֵּית־אָבִ֛י תֵּלֵ֖ךְ וְאֶל־מִשְׁפַּחְתִּ֑י וְלָקַחְתָּ֥ אִשָּׁ֖ה לִבְנִֽי׃|38 J|but you shall go to my father’s house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham wanted Isaac to marry someone from within his own family, unlike Ishmael who married an Egyptian handmaid, highlighting the righteousness of Isaac over Ishmael. Eliezer was not obligated to bring a wife for Isaac against her family's wishes, as indicated in Kiddushin 61b:11. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both state that Abraham's servant should find a wife for Isaac from his father's house and family. Rabbeinu Bahya emphasizes the importance of surrounding oneself with scholars and avoiding fools, while Ramban discusses the genealogy of Nahor's descendants and their worthiness to marry into Abraham's family. Chizkuni explains nuances in the text regarding servant women in Exodus. 

|וָאֹמַ֖ר אֶל־אֲדֹנִ֑י אֻלַ֛י לֹא־תֵלֵ֥ךְ הָאִשָּׁ֖ה אַחֲרָֽי׃|39 J|And I said to my master, ‘What if the woman does not follow me?’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer hinted at his desire for his daughter to marry Yitzchok by using the word "perhaps" without the letter ו, indicating his secret aspirations (Radak, Tur HaArokh, Siftei Chakhamim, Rashi). Eliezer's potential curse as a Canaanite slave made him more cursed than others, preventing him from uniting with a blessed individual like Yitzchok (Siftei Chakhamim). Eliezer's use of the word "perhaps" without the ו also indicated his flattery towards his hosts, suggesting that he could have prevented the union and offered his daughter as a bride (Chizkuni). Radak explains that the angel's response to Sarah's doubt about conceiving a child was a general statement about God's power, similar to Eliezer's mission explanation to Abraham. The angel did not address Sarah's mention of her husband's old age because her menopause was a greater impediment to conception. Rashi notes that Eliezer's use of "perhaps" without a vav indicated he wanted Isaac to marry his daughter, but Abraham rejected the idea due to Isaac's blessing and Eliezer's perceived curse. In Genesis 24:39, Onkelos translates Abraham's concern about finding a suitable wife for Isaac as questioning whether the woman will come back with him, while Targum Jonathan interprets it as questioning whether the woman will follow him to Canaan. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אֵלָ֑י יְהֹוָ֞ה אֲשֶׁר־הִתְהַלַּ֣כְתִּי לְפָנָ֗יו יִשְׁלַ֨ח מַלְאָכ֤וֹ אִתָּךְ֙ וְהִצְלִ֣יחַ דַּרְכֶּ֔ךָ וְלָקַחְתָּ֤ אִשָּׁה֙ לִבְנִ֔י מִמִּשְׁפַּחְתִּ֖י וּמִבֵּ֥ית אָבִֽי׃|40 J|He replied to me, ‘יהוה, whose ways I have followed, will send a messenger with you and make your errand successful; and you will get a wife for my son from my kindred, from my father’s house.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi points out Noah's need for assistance in walking with God compared to Abraham, raising questions about their levels of righteousness. Rashbam, Tur HaArokh, Steinsaltz, and other commentaries discuss Abraham's belief in divine assistance for Eliezer's mission to find a wife for Isaac. The Talmud Sotah highlights the importance of choosing a suitable life partner based on deeds and moral accomplishments to maximize one's potential. Noach's righteousness is contrasted with Abraham's proactive leadership in guiding others towards monotheism. Radak, Rashi, Ramban, Onkelos, and Targum Jonathan emphasize the importance of both thoughts and deeds in serving God, Abraham's desire for a wife for Isaac from his family, and divine assistance in finding a suitable wife for Isaac. 

|אָ֤ז תִּנָּקֶה֙ מֵאָ֣לָתִ֔י כִּ֥י תָב֖וֹא אֶל־מִשְׁפַּחְתִּ֑י וְאִם־לֹ֤א יִתְּנוּ֙ לָ֔ךְ וְהָיִ֥יתָ נָקִ֖י מֵאָלָתִֽי׃|41 J|Thus only shall you be freed from my adjuration: if, when you come to my kindred, they refuse you—only then shall you be freed from my adjuration.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The servant took an oath with a curse attached, indicating fear of his master's curse. The Talmud questions the need for an additional statement in the oath regarding finding a wife for Isaac, with different opinions on its purpose. The Targum states that if the servant's family does not give him a wife for Isaac, he will be absolved of the oath. 

|וָאָבֹ֥א הַיּ֖וֹם אֶל־הָעָ֑יִן וָאֹמַ֗ר יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵי֙ אֲדֹנִ֣י אַבְרָהָ֔ם אִם־יֶשְׁךָ־נָּא֙ מַצְלִ֣יחַ דַּרְכִּ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר אָנֹכִ֖י הֹלֵ֥ךְ עָלֶֽיהָ׃|42 J|“I came today to the spring, and I said: ‘O יהוה, God of my master Abraham’s [house], if You would indeed grant success to the errand on which I am engaged!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer's journey to find a wife for Isaac was miraculously shortened, highlighting his faith and initiative in fulfilling God's will according to Rashi and Chizkuni. Rabbi Yesa attributes his success to Abraham's merit, while the Midrash discusses instances where the earth contracted for Abraham, Eliezer, Jacob, and Abishai, allowing them to travel great distances in short periods of time with divine intervention. Ramban explains Jacob's dream of a ladder reaching from Beer-sheba to Beth-el symbolizes the connection between the Sanctuary in Jerusalem and the house of God, emphasizing characters in the Bible attributing success to the Lord. The Talmud teaches that land contracted for Eliezer, Jacob, and Abishai, allowing them to reach their destinations quickly, with Targum emphasizing Eliezer's acknowledgment of God's role in prospering his journey. 

|הִנֵּ֛ה אָנֹכִ֥י נִצָּ֖ב עַל־עֵ֣ין הַמָּ֑יִם וְהָיָ֤ה הָֽעַלְמָה֙ הַיֹּצֵ֣את לִשְׁאֹ֔ב וְאָמַרְתִּ֣י אֵלֶ֔יהָ הַשְׁקִֽינִי־נָ֥א מְעַט־מַ֖יִם מִכַּדֵּֽךְ׃|43 J|As I stand by the spring of water, let the young woman who comes out to draw and to whom I say, “Please, let me drink a little water from your jar,”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer was surprised that the people in Aram Naharayim understood Hebrew, not just Aramaic. Rabbi 'Aḳiba believes seeing maidens before entering a city signifies prosperity. Eliezer's use of עלמה instead of נערה is linked to the Torah's spelling of נער as masculine. Rabbeinu Bahya emphasizes the Jewish people's strength in prayer, contrasting them with the Gentiles. The Torah mentions death by sword as the highest level of impurity, with metal objects causing impurity equal to a corpse. Eliezer's prayer in Genesis 24 is seen as a petition for kindness to Abraham. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe the scene at the well in Genesis 24:43. 

|וְאָמְרָ֤ה אֵלַי֙ גַּם־אַתָּ֣ה שְׁתֵ֔ה וְגַ֥ם לִגְמַלֶּ֖יךָ אֶשְׁאָ֑ב הִ֣וא הָֽאִשָּׁ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־הֹכִ֥יחַ יְהֹוָ֖ה לְבֶן־אֲדֹנִֽי׃|44 J|and who answers, “You may drink, and I will also draw for your camels”—let her be the wife whom יהוה has decreed for my master’s son.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The chosen woman for marriage was predestined by the Lord, confirmed by celestial announcements based on compatibility rather than accomplishments, as seen in the Scriptures and Targums. Avimelch provided Sarah with a wardrobe to acknowledge her relationship with Abraham and ensure her safety. 

|אֲנִי֩ טֶ֨רֶם אֲכַלֶּ֜ה לְדַבֵּ֣ר אֶל־לִבִּ֗י וְהִנֵּ֨ה רִבְקָ֤ה יֹצֵאת֙ וְכַדָּ֣הּ עַל־שִׁכְמָ֔הּ וַתֵּ֥רֶד הָעַ֖יְנָה וַתִּשְׁאָ֑ב וָאֹמַ֥ר אֵלֶ֖יהָ הַשְׁקִ֥ינִי נָֽא׃|45 J|I had scarcely finished praying in my heart, when Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew. And I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer saw Rebekah coming out with her pitcher as he was still speaking, indicating that she may have overheard his prayer or that it was planned by God. The text discusses the cognitive powers of man, prophets having different soul faculties, and the Jewish people being called children of God. Ramban explains that God was displeased with the sins of humanity, while Ibn Ezra discusses how Hebrew language can convey different meanings with examples from Scripture. Gevia Kesef clarifies that when Abraham "said in his heart," it was to emphasize his certainty in God's promise and that his thoughts were private. 

|וַתְּמַהֵ֗ר וַתּ֤וֹרֶד כַּדָּהּ֙ מֵֽעָלֶ֔יהָ וַתֹּ֣אמֶר שְׁתֵ֔ה וְגַם־גְּמַלֶּ֖יךָ אַשְׁקֶ֑ה וָאֵ֕שְׁתְּ וְגַ֥ם הַגְּמַלִּ֖ים הִשְׁקָֽתָה׃|46 J|She quickly lowered her jar and said, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer recounted Rivkah's words as "drink" instead of "drink my lord" out of etiquette, as he did not want to repeat being addressed as "my lord." Rivkah not only offered Eliezer a drink but also offered to give water to his camels, which he drank and she fulfilled. In Tikkunei Zohar 47a:1 and 47a:10, the text discusses the act of quenching the thirst of the Righteous-One and his camels, relating it to those weaned of milk. Targum states that Rebekah quickly offered water to the servant and his camels, fulfilling the sign given by Abraham. 

|וָאֶשְׁאַ֣ל אֹתָ֗הּ וָאֹמַר֮ בַּת־מִ֣י אַתְּ֒ וַתֹּ֗אמֶר בַּת־בְּתוּאֵל֙ בֶּן־נָח֔וֹר אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָֽלְדָה־לּ֖וֹ מִלְכָּ֑ה וָאָשִׂ֤ם הַנֶּ֙זֶם֙ עַל־אַפָּ֔הּ וְהַצְּמִידִ֖ים עַל־יָדֶֽיהָ׃|47 J|I inquired of her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ And I put the ring on her nose and the bands on her arms.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer's actions in Genesis 24 reflect the influence of righteous individuals like Avraham, with the concept of "yuldah" symbolizing the impact of good deeds. The Mishnah discusses borrowing items forbidden by vow, while the commentary on Eliezer's actions raises questions about his status and Laban's blessing. Ibn Ezra explains the requirements for God's glory to appear, and the Targum recounts Eliezer's interaction with Rebekah. 

|וָאֶקֹּ֥ד וָֽאֶשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֖ה לַיהֹוָ֑ה וָאֲבָרֵ֗ךְ אֶת־יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵי֙ אֲדֹנִ֣י אַבְרָהָ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֤ר הִנְחַ֙נִי֙ בְּדֶ֣רֶךְ אֱמֶ֔ת לָקַ֛חַת אֶת־בַּת־אֲחִ֥י אֲדֹנִ֖י לִבְנֽוֹ׃|48 J|Then I bowed low in homage to יהוה and blessed יהוה, the God of my master Abraham’s [house], who led me on the right way to get the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, YHVH symbolizes matchmaking and truth, representing the perfection of speech through marriage bonds. Eliezer acknowledges a Divine mission to find a suitable bride for Yitzchak, hinting at a specific choice. Halakhah details the recitation of Birkat ha-mazon and prostrations in prayer, emphasizing reverence for God. Jewish Thought highlights God's faithfulness and love in guiding Abraham's servant. The Targum describes the servant's gratitude for finding a wife for Isaac from Abraham's family. 

|וְ֠עַתָּ֠ה אִם־יֶשְׁכֶ֨ם עֹשִׂ֜ים חֶ֧סֶד וֶֽאֱמֶ֛ת אֶת־אֲדֹנִ֖י הַגִּ֣ידוּ לִ֑י וְאִם־לֹ֕א הַגִּ֣ידוּ לִ֔י וְאֶפְנֶ֥ה עַל־יָמִ֖ין א֥וֹ עַל־שְׂמֹֽאל׃|49 J|And now, if you mean to treat my master with true kindness, tell me; and if not, tell me also, that I may turn right or left.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer asks Laban and Bethuel to send Rebecca to marry Isaac without concern for acquiring relatives through her, stating he will seek a wife from other family members if they refuse. In Bereshit Rabbah, it is suggested to disclose negative traits first, as seen when Abraham's servant introduces himself before discussing his mission. Rashi explains "May He incite Death upon them" as God inciting the Angel of Death, while Ramban clarifies Abraham did not want Isaac to marry a Canaanite. The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan emphasize Eliezer asking if they will be kind and truthful to Abraham before making a decision. 

|וַיַּ֨עַן לָבָ֤ן וּבְתוּאֵל֙ וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ מֵיְהֹוָ֖ה יָצָ֣א הַדָּבָ֑ר לֹ֥א נוּכַ֛ל דַּבֵּ֥ר אֵלֶ֖יךָ רַ֥ע אוֹ־טֽוֹב׃|50 J|Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The matter was decreed by יהוה; we cannot speak to you bad or good.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the influence of righteous individuals like Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and Avraham embodying kindness, exploring the concept of "yuldah" as symbolizing the transmission of goodness. Commentary emphasizes the belief that finding a spouse is a gift from God, with celestial forces determining matchmaking. Midrash highlights the importance of finding a good wife who brings blessings, while Musar focuses on Laban's blessings for Rebecca's descendants and Torah scholars becoming wiser with age. Quoting Commentary discusses blessings from Asher and Laban acknowledging God's decree, Second Temple mentions Laban approving of Rebecca marrying Isaac, Talmud discusses the divine decree of specific marriages, and Targum notes Laban and Bethuel recognizing God's will for the marriage of Isaac and Rebecca. 

|הִנֵּֽה־רִבְקָ֥ה לְפָנֶ֖יךָ קַ֣ח וָלֵ֑ךְ וּתְהִ֤י אִשָּׁה֙ לְבֶן־אֲדֹנֶ֔יךָ כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהֹוָֽה׃|51 J|Here is Rebekah before you; take her and go, and let her be a wife to your master’s son, as יהוה has spoken.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Laban and Bethuel initially agree for Rebecca to marry Isaac without objection, understanding it as God's will, while Ramban and Tur HaArokh discuss the interpretation of God's decrees and actions in biblical texts. 

|וַיְהִ֕י כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר שָׁמַ֛ע עֶ֥בֶד אַבְרָהָ֖ם אֶת־דִּבְרֵיהֶ֑ם וַיִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ אַ֖רְצָה לַֽיהֹוָֽה׃|52 J|When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed low to the ground before יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham's servant prostrated himself in gratitude towards God after hearing the consent of Rebekah's family, showing that thanks should be given for good tidings. This act of prostration demonstrates the connection between hearing and action or emotion, as seen in other instances in the Bible where hearing is followed by love for God and worship. 

|וַיּוֹצֵ֨א הָעֶ֜בֶד כְּלֵי־כֶ֨סֶף וּכְלֵ֤י זָהָב֙ וּבְגָדִ֔ים וַיִּתֵּ֖ן לְרִבְקָ֑ה וּמִ֨גְדָּנֹ֔ת נָתַ֥ן לְאָחִ֖יהָ וּלְאִמָּֽהּ׃|53 J|The servant brought out objects of silver and gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; and he gave presents to her brother and her mother.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains "migdanot" can mean precious fruits or expensive garments, Rashbam describes the jewelry given to Rivkah, Radak notes more gifts were produced after Rivkah was given, Tur HaArokh highlights the distinction between gifts given to Rivkah and her family, Rashi connects "migdanot" to precious fruits from Israel, Chizkuni explains Eliezer gave valuable gifts to Rivkah and less expensive gifts to her family. Rabbi Huna and the Rabbis differ on what the servant gave to Rebecca, showing the importance of provisions on a trip. Rashbam and Chizkuni explain the use of past tense in Genesis 20:16 and the phrase "אל יותר" in Exodus 16, respectively. In Exodus 3:22, God instructs the Israelites to borrow silver, gold, and clothing from the Egyptians before leaving Egypt, fulfilling the promise to Abraham. The Targum describes the gifts given to Rivkah and her family by the servant. 

|וַיֹּאכְל֣וּ וַיִּשְׁתּ֗וּ ה֛וּא וְהָאֲנָשִׁ֥ים אֲשֶׁר־עִמּ֖וֹ וַיָּלִ֑ינוּ וַיָּק֣וּמוּ בַבֹּ֔קֶר וַיֹּ֖אמֶר שַׁלְּחֻ֥נִי לַֽאדֹנִֽי׃|54 J|Then he and the entourage under him ate and drank, and they spent the night. When they arose next morning, he said, “Give me leave to go to my master.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer and his men ate, drank, and stayed the night after meeting Rebecca in the evening, with the intention of taking her with him to fulfill his mission. Rashbam explains that the phrase "two whole years" in Genesis 41:1 refers to a period of time equivalent to twice a year, and discusses the use of the term "ימים" to refer to a year. In the Targum, after eating and drinking, the men stayed overnight and the servant asked to be sent back to his master the next morning. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אָחִ֙יהָ֙ וְאִמָּ֔הּ תֵּשֵׁ֨ב הַנַּעֲרָ֥ אִתָּ֛נוּ יָמִ֖ים א֣וֹ עָשׂ֑וֹר אַחַ֖ר תֵּלֵֽךְ׃|55 J|But her brother and her mother said, “Let the maiden remain with us some ten days;  then you may go.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra disagrees with the Midrash on the reason for Bethuel's death, suggesting Laban was more respected. Sforno proposes giving Rivkah time to adjust to moving. Radak explains the Torah focuses on major characters and interprets "days" as a year. Tur HaArokh clarifies that Laban and Rivkah's mother requested a year or ten months delay. Da'at Zekenim suggests Betuel's silence was a plan to poison Eliezer. Chizkuni explains the delay request came after Eliezer performed betrothal rites. Alshekh suggests the delay was to deflect accusations. Mishnah Ketubot 5:2 states a virgin has twelve months to prepare for marriage, while a widow has thirty days. Talmud interprets "days" as a year and ten months. Targum Jonathan on Genesis 24:55 mentions Bethuel's death and the request for a year or ten months delay. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ אַל־תְּאַחֲר֣וּ אֹתִ֔י וַֽיהֹוָ֖ה הִצְלִ֣יחַ דַּרְכִּ֑י שַׁלְּח֕וּנִי וְאֵלְכָ֖ה לַֽאדֹנִֽי׃|56 J|He said to them, “Do not delay me, now that יהוה has made my errand successful. Give me leave that I may go to my master.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary emphasizes the importance of not delaying the mission, as the Lord has ensured its success and the servant must depart promptly to fulfill his master's command of finding a wife for his son. The Midrash discusses blessings given to Rebecca at her bridal banquet, Eliezer finding maidens before entering a city, and the prophecy of preparing the way for the Lord. The Targum emphasizes the urgency of the servant's departure, as God has guaranteed his journey's success. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֖וּ נִקְרָ֣א לַֽנַּעֲרָ֑ וְנִשְׁאֲלָ֖ה אֶת־פִּֽיהָ׃|57 J|And they said, “Let us call the girl and ask for her reply.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rivkah's consent was sought before her marriage to Yitzchok, as seen in the text and commented on by Midrash and Targum. The family respected her wishes and ensured she agreed to go with Eliezer, emphasizing the importance of a woman's consent in marriage. 

|וַיִּקְרְא֤וּ לְרִבְקָה֙ וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלֶ֔יהָ הֲתֵלְכִ֖י עִם־הָאִ֣ישׁ הַזֶּ֑ה וַתֹּ֖אמֶר אֵלֵֽךְ׃|58 J|They called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man  ?” And she said, “I will.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca immediately agreed to go with the servant of Abraham, showing her willingness to go of her own accord despite any reservations she may have had. Some commentaries suggest that her response indicated her consent for marriage, even if her family did not approve. Rabbi Yitzchak believes that Gabriel guides souls to Yisrael, while Rabbi Yosi questions the mention of Laban as Rebecca's brother. Betuel tried to impede the betrothal of Rebecca to Isaac, but was stricken down overnight, while Laban and his mother were willing to speed up the process. Rivkah's consent was required for her marriage, as shown when she agreed to go with Eliezer despite her family's disapproval. 

|וַֽיְשַׁלְּח֛וּ אֶת־רִבְקָ֥ה אֲחֹתָ֖ם וְאֶת־מֵנִקְתָּ֑הּ וְאֶת־עֶ֥בֶד אַבְרָהָ֖ם וְאֶת־אֲנָשָֽׁיו׃|59 J|So they sent off their sister Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham’s servant and his entourage.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra disagrees with the Midrashic statement that Rebekah was three years old at the time of her marriage. Radak explains that "their sister" refers to Lavan and his family sending Rebekah. The nursemaid is mentioned as the highest-ranking attendant, with Eliezer and his men also part of the entourage. Rav Hirsch contrasts the involvement of Laban in Rebekah's departure with the lack of involvement of Isaac in his marriage. Steinsaltz notes that Rebekah, her nursemaid, Abraham's servant, and his men were sent by her family after her response. Chizkuni explains that the mention of the nursemaid is important due to her close relationship with Rebekah as a young girl. Ramban discusses the placement of the verse about Deborah's death in between other events in Genesis 35, suggesting it alludes to Rebekah's death and explains why it was not explicitly mentioned. Chizkuni adds that Deborah was sent by Rebekah to inform Jacob it was safe to return, remained with him in Padan Arom, and died on the journey back to Canaan, clarifying her role in Jacob's entourage. Rivkah, along with her nurse, was sent off by her family along with Avraham's servant and his men according to Targum Jonathan on Genesis 24:59. 

|וַיְבָרְכ֤וּ אֶת־רִבְקָה֙ וַיֹּ֣אמְרוּ לָ֔הּ אֲחֹתֵ֕נוּ אַ֥תְּ הֲיִ֖י לְאַלְפֵ֣י רְבָבָ֑ה וְיִירַ֣שׁ זַרְעֵ֔ךְ אֵ֖ת שַׁ֥עַר שֹׂנְאָֽיו׃|60 J|And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “O sister! May you grow Into thousands of myriads; May your descendants seize The gates of their foes.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Laban and his mother blessed Rebecca with the hope that her descendants would fulfill the promise to Abraham, inherit the gates of their enemies, and become chieftains. Rebecca's barrenness was intended to prevent gentiles from claiming credit for her fertility, and she eventually conceived after Isaac prayed. Laban acknowledged the validity of Rebecca's blessings, allowing Esau to embrace monotheism. Women can recite all seven marriage blessings, and a Bat Mitzvah should be celebrated similarly to a Bar Mitzvah. The marriage benediction is essential for a bride and widow to be permissible to their husbands. Rebecca's family blessed her with hopes for many descendants and inheritance of enemy cities as she married a righteous man. 

|וַתָּ֨קׇם רִבְקָ֜ה וְנַעֲרֹתֶ֗יהָ וַתִּרְכַּ֙בְנָה֙ עַל־הַגְּמַלִּ֔ים וַתֵּלַ֖כְנָה אַחֲרֵ֣י הָאִ֑ישׁ וַיִּקַּ֥ח הָעֶ֛בֶד אֶת־רִבְקָ֖ה וַיֵּלַֽךְ׃|61 J|Then Rebekah and her maids arose, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went his way.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebekah, her nurse, and servant Eliezer traveled on camels to meet Isaac in Hebron, with Eliezer ensuring Rebekah's safety and comfort. The journey was expedited, emphasizing Rebekah's noble status and Eliezer's role as a servant. Isaac prayed in the field upon seeing them, likened to a poor man pouring out his heart to the Lord. The presence of the heavenly messenger Mattatron is indicated by Eliezer's descriptions in Genesis 24:61, with the mission considered concluded upon his return. The Gemara discusses women riding camels, concluding it is not immodest, while Rav Ashi criticizes Manoah for not knowing the story of Rebecca riding on camels. The journey to Padan Aram and back was miraculously shortened to just one day. 

|וְיִצְחָק֙ בָּ֣א מִבּ֔וֹא בְּאֵ֥ר לַחַ֖י רֹאִ֑י וְה֥וּא יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּאֶ֥רֶץ הַנֶּֽגֶב׃|62 J|Isaac had just come back from the vicinity of Beer-lahai-roi, for he was settled in the region of the Negeb.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac visited the well Lahai-roi, a place of prayer where prayers were answered, possibly coming from Beer-lahai-roi or the Garden of Eden for healing. He settled near the well, re-digging old wells for living water. Isaac and Moses met their mates at wells, following patriarchal examples. Moses prayed based on the faith of the patriarchs to defeat Amalek, with Yitzchak living near Be'er Lahai Roi after Abraham's death. Be'er Laḥai Ro'i is where Hagar encountered an angel and received a promise from God, symbolizing a connection between Yitzhak and Hagar's experience. 

|וַיֵּצֵ֥א יִצְחָ֛ק לָשׂ֥וּחַ בַּשָּׂדֶ֖ה לִפְנ֣וֹת עָ֑רֶב וַיִּשָּׂ֤א עֵינָיו֙ וַיַּ֔רְא וְהִנֵּ֥ה גְמַלִּ֖ים בָּאִֽים׃|63 J|And Isaac went out walking  in the field toward evening and, looking up, he saw camels approaching.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac found joy and intimacy with God while walking in the field, leading to answered prayers and the arrival of his soulmate. Praying at the Kotel and in open spaces enhances connection to God, as seen in the patriarchs' examples. The three daily prayers were established by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, each serving a specific purpose in connecting with God. Isaac's prayer in the field symbolizes the importance of prayer in seeking divine intervention, and his strength lies in his ability to be alone with God. The Temple Mount is a designated area for prayer, contrasting distractions in fields, and prayer is linked to sustenance and divine intervention, reflecting the power and importance of prayer. 

|וַתִּשָּׂ֤א רִבְקָה֙ אֶת־עֵינֶ֔יהָ וַתֵּ֖רֶא אֶת־יִצְחָ֑ק וַתִּפֹּ֖ל מֵעַ֥ל הַגָּמָֽל׃|64 J|Raising her eyes, Rebekah saw Isaac. She alighted from the camel|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebekah recognized Isaac, descended from the camel with respect and modesty, adjusting her posture to face him appropriately. She covered her face with a veil, reflecting proper behavior as a betrothed woman. Rebecca was impressed by Isaac's greatness and covered herself upon seeing him, recognizing his attractiveness and the presence of his angel. The Rabbis suggest that the Torah often provides general statements rather than detailed ones, emphasizing the praise for God in the story. In II Kings 5:21:1 and Psalms 37:24:1, Rashi interprets similar expressions as "leaning over" and "faltering," respectively. In Targum, Rivkah saw Yitzchok and bowed down on the camel. 

|וַתֹּ֣אמֶר אֶל־הָעֶ֗בֶד מִֽי־הָאִ֤ישׁ הַלָּזֶה֙ הַהֹלֵ֤ךְ בַּשָּׂדֶה֙ לִקְרָאתֵ֔נוּ וַיֹּ֥אמֶר הָעֶ֖בֶד ה֣וּא אֲדֹנִ֑י וַתִּקַּ֥ח הַצָּעִ֖יף וַתִּתְכָּֽס׃|65 J|and said to the servant, “Who is that man walking in the field toward us?” And the servant said, “That is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca veiled herself upon recognizing Isaac as her future husband, with the use of the word "lamed" indicating his distance. The Torah does not command married women to cover their hair, but mentions it in relation to Rebecca and Tamar. The merit of the patriarchs endures until various points in history, with Isaac living a long life due to his merit. The Targum describes Rebecca covering herself with a veil upon seeing Isaac approaching. 

|וַיְסַפֵּ֥ר הָעֶ֖בֶד לְיִצְחָ֑ק אֵ֥ת כׇּל־הַדְּבָרִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָֽׂה׃|66 J|The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eliezer told Yitzchak about the miracles during his mission to find a wife for him, including divine signs and gifts to Rivkah, with the earth shrinking for him and her readiness in response to his prayer. Rebecca covered herself upon meeting Isaac, the servant highlighted praise-worthy aspects of his journey, and Ramban explains the events after the Giving of the Torah in Exodus 24. Rashi provides linguistic analysis in Exodus 5 and Isaiah 41. The servant informed Yitzchak of his actions. 

|וַיְבִאֶ֣הָ יִצְחָ֗ק הָאֹ֙הֱלָה֙ שָׂרָ֣ה אִמּ֔וֹ וַיִּקַּ֧ח אֶת־רִבְקָ֛ה וַתְּהִי־ל֥וֹ לְאִשָּׁ֖ה וַיֶּאֱהָבֶ֑הָ וַיִּנָּחֵ֥ם יִצְחָ֖ק אַחֲרֵ֥י אִמּֽוֹ׃|67 J|Isaac then brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he took Rebekah as his wife. Isaac loved her, and thus found comfort after his mother’s death.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yitzchok's deep love for Rivkah was based on her role in helping him fulfill his Creator's will and symbolized by bringing her into Sarah's tent, leading to his comfort after Sarah's death. The marriage of Isaac and Rebekah was orchestrated by Eliezer's prayer and God's guidance, with their union celebrated by a great feast. Isaac's marriage to Rebekah resulted in Abraham taking another wife, Keturah, out of a sense of unsettledness. Isaac's marriage to Rebekah is seen as a reason for Abraham's subsequent marriage.

## Genesis 25

|וַיֹּ֧סֶף אַבְרָהָ֛ם וַיִּקַּ֥ח אִשָּׁ֖ה וּשְׁמָ֥הּ קְטוּרָֽה׃|1 ?|Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of surpassing boundaries with strength to bring goodness into holiness, using Elisha's story as an example. Commentary sources provide differing views on Keturah, with some highlighting her positive qualities and connection to Hagar. In Jewish thought, Isaac reconciles with his family after the binding incident, settling near a well. Midrash discusses the establishment of daily prayers by Abraham and the blessings of Moses to Israel. Musar connects the incense offering to the universe and prayer as a reflection of the relationship between the משפיע and the מושפע. Quoting commentary sources offer insights into Sarah's banishment of Hagar's son, the priestly blessing, and the exemption of women from the command to be fruitful. The Talmud discusses the differences between Keturah's children and Isaac, as well as claims to the land of Canaan. The Targum identifies Keturah as Hagar, suggesting she had been with Abraham from the beginning. 

|וַתֵּ֣לֶד ל֗וֹ אֶת־זִמְרָן֙ וְאֶת־יׇקְשָׁ֔ן וְאֶת־מְדָ֖ן וְאֶת־מִדְיָ֑ן וְאֶת־יִשְׁבָּ֖ק וְאֶת־שֽׁוּחַ׃|2 ?|She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, different colors symbolize different Divine attributes, with white representing chesed and red representing din. Mitzvos aseh require actions to express love for God, while mitzvos lo ta’aseh involve refraining from harmful acts. Abraham embodies chesed through acts of kindness, while Isaac embodies din through discipline and restraint. Sforno explains that Avraham adopted the children of Keturah as he had only personally sired Ishmael and Yitzchok, while Midrash discusses God's blessings to Sarah and the concept of additions being greater than the original. Rabbeinu Bahya explains Yitro's mixed feelings towards the Egyptians, Da'at Zekenim clarifies the sale of Joseph, and Targum lists the sons of Abraham and Keturah. 

|וְיׇקְשָׁ֣ן יָלַ֔ד אֶת־שְׁבָ֖א וְאֶת־דְּדָ֑ן וּבְנֵ֣י דְדָ֔ן הָי֛וּ אַשּׁוּרִ֥ם וּלְטוּשִׁ֖ם וּלְאֻמִּֽים׃|3 ?|Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, the Letushim, and the Leummim.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the concept of returning to one's roots, with marriage symbolizing a reunion of soul halves and a connection to one's roots in the Land of Israel. Commentary from various sources interprets the names Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim in Genesis 25:3, with different explanations provided. The Midrash describes the descendants of Zimran and Yokshan, as well as the relationship between the seventy nations and Jacob's descendants. In the Second Temple period, Abraham's sons with Keturah settled in different regions and played a role in the naming of Africa. The Targum identifies the sons of Dedan as Ashurim, Letushim, and Leumim, describing them as merchants, negotiators, and chiefs of peoples. 

|וּבְנֵ֣י מִדְיָ֗ן עֵיפָ֤ה וָעֵ֙פֶר֙ וַחֲנֹ֔ךְ וַאֲבִידָ֖ע וְאֶלְדָּעָ֑ה כׇּל־אֵ֖לֶּה בְּנֵ֥י קְטוּרָֽה׃|4 ?|The descendants of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Enoch,  Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham distributed his wealth during his lifetime to prevent inheritance quarrels after his death, appointing Isaac as his heir as commanded by God. The sons of Midian listed as Abraham's children were likely fathered by him, not just raised in his house, despite his old age and previous infertility. Sarah, not Abraham, was likely infertile based on the story of Ishmael's birth. Midian had five fathers' houses: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldoah, with Ephah being the king of one of them. Ephah and Epher are both sons of Midian. Abraham was a giant among men, with the strength of seventy-four men, settled his sons of Keturah in a walled city of iron with precious stones for future use as luminaries. Og, who could hide Abraham's feet in his hand, built sixty cities and had immense strength. Jacob tested his sons with stones, with only Joseph's stone causing them to bow, showing his significance. Rebekah was miraculously protected from defilement, and Dinah bore Asenath at six years old after Jacob's twenty years of service. Rabbi Tarfon's nephews were referred to as "the children of Keturah" for contributing little information. The sons of Midian, from Keturah, were Eiphah, Eipher, Chanoch, Avidah, and Eldoah according to Onkelos Genesis 25:4 and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 25:4. 

|וַיִּתֵּ֧ן אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֶת־כׇּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖וֹ לְיִצְחָֽק׃|5 R|Abraham willed all that he owned to Isaac;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac, justifying it by God's specific heir designation and the sons' idolatry. Legal issues aside, both Abraham and Ishmael were converts, not born Jews, unable to inherit from each other. The Talmud emphasizes the impossibility of fulfilling all pious conduct permutations in one lifetime, with the reward for observance being indescribable. Abraham's actions set a precedent for blessings passing down generations, with Esau receiving punishment for confronting Jacob. Sforno, Redeeming Relevance, Ramban, Ibn Ezra, and Chizkuni provide various interpretations of the events, while Geviha ben Pesisa challenges Ishmael's descendants' claim to Canaan with Abraham's property division as evidence. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan affirm Abraham giving all to Isaac in Genesis 25:5. 

|וְלִבְנֵ֤י הַפִּֽילַגְשִׁים֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לְאַבְרָהָ֔ם נָתַ֥ן אַבְרָהָ֖ם מַתָּנֹ֑ת וַֽיְשַׁלְּחֵ֞ם מֵעַ֨ל יִצְחָ֤ק בְּנוֹ֙ בְּעוֹדֶ֣נּוּ חַ֔י קֵ֖דְמָה אֶל־אֶ֥רֶץ קֶֽדֶם׃|6 R|but to Abraham’s sons by concubines Abraham gave gifts while he was still living, and he sent them away from his son Isaac eastward, to the land of the East.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham had concubines, including Hagar and Keturah, to whom he gave gifts and teachings on impure names, sending them away from Isaac to the east country. The concubines were not considered heirs to his estate, and Keturah is suggested to be Hagar. Abraham distributed his property while alive, favoring Jacob and Esau equally, and sending the sons of the concubines eastward to prevent inheritance disputes. The concubines were considered concubines due to the lack of a marriage contract, and the gifts given were substantial. Abraham did not rely on a will, and the concubines were sent away during his lifetime. 

|וְאֵ֗לֶּה יְמֵ֛י שְׁנֵֽי־חַיֵּ֥י אַבְרָהָ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־חָ֑י מְאַ֥ת שָׁנָ֛ה וְשִׁבְעִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה וְחָמֵ֥שׁ שָׁנִֽים׃|7 P|This was the total span of Abraham’s life: one hundred and seventy-five years.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak explains that the phrase "וַיְחִי" is in the past tense, with the root of the verb being either חיי or חיה. HaKtav VeHaKabalah notes that according to the Sages, Abraham should have lived another five years but died early to avoid witnessing Esau's moral decline. Rashi explains that the phrase "מאה שנה ושבעים שנה וחמש שנים" indicates Abraham's strength and righteousness at different ages. Steinsaltz mentions that Abraham lived for many years after Sarah's death. The Zohar explains that the days of the righteous are eternal, as seen in the examples of Sarah and Abraham, and even though Ishmael was not initially righteous, he repented, leading to his days being described in a similar way to Abraham's. In Midrash Tanchuma, Abraham observed the Torah even before it was given, and the failure to observe the sabbatical year led to Israel's exile. The Torah repeats the word "year" or "years" multiple times when describing the ages of various individuals to emphasize specific qualities or stages of their lives. R. Joshua b. Levi found in a book of ’aggadta that the 175 sections of the Torah correspond to the years of Abraham's life, leading to the practice of reading 175 orders in the Torah every Sabbath. Onkelos states that Abraham lived to be 175 years old, while Targum Jonathan also confirms this age but adds that Abraham lived for 100 years before having Isaac. 

|וַיִּגְוַ֨ע וַיָּ֧מׇת אַבְרָהָ֛ם בְּשֵׂיבָ֥ה טוֹבָ֖ה זָקֵ֣ן וְשָׂבֵ֑עַ וַיֵּאָ֖סֶף אֶל־עַמָּֽיו׃|8 J P|And Abraham breathed his last, dying at a good ripe age, old and contented; and he was gathered to his kin. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Kedushat Levi, Avram's unwavering faith in God is emphasized, along with his concern about inheriting land in Israel and his role in leading to the creation of the Jewish nation. In the commentary, Abraham's peaceful death is associated with righteousness, and Moses' blessings highlight the potential of different tribes. The Midrash discusses acts of kindness towards Abraham and pious individuals suffering before death. Ibn Ezra explains the term "expiring" for righteous deaths, and the Second Temple commentary symbolizes transitions from mortality to something better. In the Talmud, reflections on facing death and rewards in the afterlife are discussed. Finally, Targum mentions Abraham's peaceful death and Ishmael's repentance. 

|וַיִּקְבְּר֨וּ אֹת֜וֹ יִצְחָ֤ק וְיִשְׁמָעֵאל֙ בָּנָ֔יו אֶל־מְעָרַ֖ת הַמַּכְפֵּלָ֑ה אֶל־שְׂדֵ֞ה עֶפְרֹ֤ן בֶּן־צֹ֙חַר֙ הַֽחִתִּ֔י אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל־פְּנֵ֥י מַמְרֵֽא׃|9 P|His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi emphasizes the birth order of Yishmael's children in Genesis 25,9 to highlight Yitzchok's righteousness. Ishmael repented and acknowledged Isaac's precedence in burying Abraham, showcasing true penitence. The order of mention in Hebrew does not always indicate chronological order, as seen in Genesis 1:5. Isaac reconciled with Ishmael at Be'er Lachai Ro'i in the wilderness. Humility connects a person with the Creator, demonstrated by Hashem's acts of kindness. The Talmud suggests Ishmael repented based on his subordination to Yitzchak during Avraham's burial. Yitzhak never forgot Hagar and Yishmael, reuniting them with Avraham after Sara's death. Isaac and Ishmael buried Abraham together in the Machpelah cave. 

|הַשָּׂדֶ֛ה אֲשֶׁר־קָנָ֥ה אַבְרָהָ֖ם מֵאֵ֣ת בְּנֵי־חֵ֑ת שָׁ֛מָּה קֻבַּ֥ר אַבְרָהָ֖ם וְשָׂרָ֥ה אִשְׁתּֽוֹ׃|10 P|the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites; there Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham's purchase of the Cave of Machpelah for burial ensured that he and Sarah could be buried in the promised land, emphasizing his love for God and trust in His promises. The Midrash highlights the consequences of greed and the importance of acts of kindness, while the Gemara discusses the acquisition of Ephron's field by Abraham. In the Torah, Abraham is buried in the Cave of Machpelah alongside Sarah, emphasizing the significance of the burial site. 

|וַיְהִ֗י אַחֲרֵי֙ מ֣וֹת אַבְרָהָ֔ם וַיְבָ֥רֶךְ אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־יִצְחָ֣ק בְּנ֑וֹ וַיֵּ֣שֶׁב יִצְחָ֔ק עִם־בְּאֵ֥ר לַחַ֖י רֹאִֽי׃|11 J P|After the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac settled near the well of Lahai-Roi after Abraham's death to be comforted by God, reconciling with Ishmael and Hagar. Despite not receiving a blessing from Abraham, God made up for this omission. Isaac inherited the title of Lord-Adona”y from HaShem after Abraham's death, asking for blessings through this name. The patriarchs exemplify the concept of blessing, with Abraham passing it on to Isaac and then to Jacob. The importance of kindness, justice, and charity is emphasized in imitating God's virtues through actions such as providing for the needy, visiting the sick, comforting mourners, and burying the dead. 

|וְאֵ֛לֶּה תֹּלְדֹ֥ת יִשְׁמָעֵ֖אל בֶּן־אַבְרָהָ֑ם אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָלְדָ֜ה הָגָ֧ר הַמִּצְרִ֛ית שִׁפְחַ֥ת שָׂרָ֖ה לְאַבְרָהָֽם׃|12 R|This is the line of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s slave, bore to Abraham.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights Yishmael's lower spiritual level compared to Yitzchak and Israel, with Yishmaelites having a higher status as converts due to their connection to Avraham. Commentary from Rashbam, Radak, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz provide insights into Ishmael's significance, lineage, and role in completing the picture of Avraham's children. Kabbalah emphasizes the importance of Yitzchak and Jacob in holiness and lineage, while Midrash discusses additions and rejections in legacies, the significance of "toledot," and righteousness in lineages. Quoting commentary from Rabbeinu Bahya, Ramban, and Ramban further delve into the celestial wisdom in the Torah and the significance of certain terms in the narrative. The Talmud recounts a dispute over land ownership between the descendants of Ishmael, Keturah, and the Jewish people, with the Jews prevailing. The Targum translations of Genesis 25:12 highlight Ishmael's lineage as the son of Avraham and Hagar, Sarah's handmaid. 

|וְאֵ֗לֶּה שְׁמוֹת֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׁמָעֵ֔אל בִּשְׁמֹתָ֖ם לְתוֹלְדֹתָ֑ם בְּכֹ֤ר יִשְׁמָעֵאל֙ נְבָיֹ֔ת וְקֵדָ֥ר וְאַדְבְּאֵ֖ל וּמִבְשָֽׂם׃|13 P|These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the first-born of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi emphasizes the Torah listing names in chronological order of birth, contrasting with other instances where the order differs based on righteousness, while the Talmud discusses old age beginning with Avraham as a sign of celestial largesse for the Jewish people. The sons of Ishmael are listed in Genesis 25:13 in the order of their birth, suggesting the names were originally Ishmael's sons. R. Dostay advises against being idle in old age without a wife, citing Abraham's example of siring twelve children, and Ishmael is described as a wild man who plunders people in the Midrash. Radak questions why Tzidon is described as the firstborn in Genesis 10:15, Ibn Ezra explains the meaning of surrendering to authority in Isaiah 54:15, and Targum Jonathan lists the names of Yishmael's sons with slight variations in spelling. 

|וּמִשְׁמָ֥ע וְדוּמָ֖ה וּמַשָּֽׂא׃|14 P|Mishma, Dumah, Massa,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The names of the sons of Ishmael in Genesis 25:14 represent the various tribes descended from Ishmael, with symbolic meanings like "hearkening" and "silence." R’ Eliezer haModa’i questions why God needs to be told what to do regarding his children, highlighting Israel's faith in following Moshe into the wilderness and the splitting of the sea. Ibn Ezra notes a connection between Dumah in Isaiah 21:11 and Gen. 25:18, while Rashi identifies Jetur and Naphish as sons of Ishmael. A discussion on false Messiahs emphasizes the importance of wisdom in prophecy and the need for caution and unity among the Jewish people. In Isaiah 21:11, a call from Seir refers to the Dumah people, and Targum interpretations of the names Mishma, Dumah, and Masa as Hearing, Silence, and Patience respectively. 

|חֲדַ֣ד וְתֵימָ֔א יְט֥וּר נָפִ֖ישׁ וָקֵֽדְמָה׃|15 P|Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedmah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca arrived at the well promptly, the water rose towards her, and she left modestly after filling her jug. The descendants of Ishmael were called "sons of Cain" and were aided in battle by the blessings of Jacob and Joshua. Ibn Ezra compares the mention of Tema in Isaiah 21:14 to its mention in Genesis 25:15, and the Targum translations list the descendants of Ishmael as Chadad, Teima, Yetur, Nofish, and Keidmah with slight variations in spelling. 

|אֵ֣לֶּה הֵ֞ם בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׁמָעֵאל֙ וְאֵ֣לֶּה שְׁמֹתָ֔ם בְּחַצְרֵיהֶ֖ם וּבְטִֽירֹתָ֑ם שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֥ר נְשִׂיאִ֖ם לְאֻמֹּתָֽם׃|16 P|These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names by their villages and by their encampments: twelve chieftains of as many tribes.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra discusses the meaning of "encampments" as palaces and the vocalization of "nations," while Radak highlights the prominence of Ishmael's descendants in their ancestral lands. Rashi clarifies that "enclosures" refer to unwalled towns, and Steinsaltz describes the sons of Ishmael living in semi-permanent enclosures with twelve princes leading their nations. In Kabbalah, Tikkunei Zohar 36a:6 connects the twelve princes to the twelve zodiac signs. Rabbi Abahu explains the use of "eleh" and "ve'eleh" in various instances in the Bible, symbolizing rejection or addition to the previous matter. The Targum lists the twelve princes of Ishmael in their open villages and fortified strongholds, and Tosefta mentions the oral translation of certain scriptural passages during public readings. 

|וְאֵ֗לֶּה שְׁנֵי֙ חַיֵּ֣י יִשְׁמָעֵ֔אל מְאַ֥ת שָׁנָ֛ה וּשְׁלֹשִׁ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה וְשֶׁ֣בַע שָׁנִ֑ים וַיִּגְוַ֣ע וַיָּ֔מׇת וַיֵּאָ֖סֶף אֶל־עַמָּֽיו׃|17 P|These were the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred and thirty-seven years; then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his kin.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The lifespan of Yishmael in the Torah is used to illustrate the influence of a tzaddik in elevating those around him spiritually, with examples of tzaddikim going into hiding to avoid G’d’s wrath against the wicked. The years of Ishmael's life are mentioned in the Torah to calculate Jacob's age, with interpretations suggesting deeper meanings related to righteousness and penitence. Ishmael's kindness in attending his father's funeral is noted, and Rabbi Yoḥanan believed that Ishmael repented during his father's lifetime. Targum Jonathan on Genesis 25:17 also states that Ishmael repented before he died and was gathered to his people. 

|וַיִּשְׁכְּנ֨וּ מֵֽחֲוִילָ֜ה עַד־שׁ֗וּר אֲשֶׁר֙ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י מִצְרַ֔יִם בֹּאֲכָ֖ה אַשּׁ֑וּרָה עַל־פְּנֵ֥י כׇל־אֶחָ֖יו נָפָֽל׃|18 P|They dwelt from Havilah, by Shur, which is close to Egypt, all the way to Asshur; they camped alongside all their kin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ishmael's descendants settled from Chavilah to Shur, living among their brethren, possibly ruling over them. The relationship between God and Moses highlights direct communication without intermediaries. Ishmael's descendants built cities and lived in the wilderness, with Ishmael described as a wild man. Engaging in idle speech and levity leads to a spirit of uncleanliness that can punish in Gehinnom. Avraham is depicted as a central figure in the book of Genesis, engaging in conversations with God and facing struggles. The descendants of Ishmael lived from Chavilah to Shur, among their brethren.
