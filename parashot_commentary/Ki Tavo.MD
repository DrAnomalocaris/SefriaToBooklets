## Deuteronomy 26

|וְהָיָה֙ כִּֽי־תָב֣וֹא אֶל־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לְךָ֖ נַחֲלָ֑ה וִֽירִשְׁתָּ֖הּ וְיָשַׁ֥בְתָּ בָּֽהּ׃|1|When you enter the land that your God יהוה is giving you as a heritage, and you possess it and settle in it,|

The text discusses two levels of righteous people: those who serve God out of awe during the week and out of love on Shabbat, and those who serve God out of love both during the week and on Shabbat. The latter is referred to as Shabbat, as they are always at the level of love and are consistently connected to God. The Israelites were not obligated to bring first fruits until they had conquered and divided the land, and various commandments were to be observed upon entering the land, including offering first fruits. The Mishneh Torah explains the prohibition of prostrating on stones outside the Temple and the importance of Torah in meriting the Land. The Gaon interpreted the command to use a perfect and just weight as indicating his mission as the light of Mashiach ben Yosef. The Midrash discusses the importance of performing mitzvot upon entering the land and emphasizes prayer and obedience to God's commands. Rashi explains that the law of "Challah" applies as soon as the Israelites enter the land, and the Tanna of the school of Rabbi Yishmael argues that the verses regarding a king and first fruits are linked. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize that the land is given by God for the Israelites to possess and dwell in. First fruits are not presented before Pentecost according to the Tosefta. 

|וְלָקַחְתָּ֞ מֵרֵאשִׁ֣ית ׀ כׇּל־פְּרִ֣י הָאֲדָמָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר תָּבִ֧יא מֵֽאַרְצְךָ֛ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לָ֖ךְ וְשַׂמְתָּ֣ בַטֶּ֑נֶא וְהָֽלַכְתָּ֙ אֶל־הַמָּק֔וֹם אֲשֶׁ֤ר יִבְחַר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ לְשַׁכֵּ֥ן שְׁמ֖וֹ שָֽׁם׃|2|you shall take some of every first fruit of the soil, which you harvest from the land that your God יהוה is giving you, put it in a basket and go to the place where your God יהוה will choose to establish the divine name.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment of bringing first-fruits to the Sanctuary in Jerusalem applies to the seven chief kinds of produce from the Land of Israel, designated while still in the field and brought in a suitable vessel. The first-fruits must come from the best soil and the best of each fruit category, with only a portion needed to fulfill the obligation. Specific vessels and procedures are involved in bringing the first fruits to the Temple in a dignified manner, with the obligation becoming binding immediately after the conquest and division of the Land. 

|וּבָאתָ֙ אֶל־הַכֹּהֵ֔ן אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִהְיֶ֖ה בַּיָּמִ֣ים הָהֵ֑ם וְאָמַרְתָּ֣ אֵלָ֗יו הִגַּ֤דְתִּי הַיּוֹם֙ לַיהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ כִּי־בָ֙אתִי֙ אֶל־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר נִשְׁבַּ֧ע יְהֹוָ֛ה לַאֲבֹתֵ֖ינוּ לָ֥תֶת לָֽנוּ׃|3|You shall go to the priest in charge at that time and say to him, “I acknowledge this day before your God יהוה that I have entered the land that יהוה swore to our fathers to assign us.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the significance of bringing first-fruit offerings to the Cohen in the Holy Temple with sanctity, the role of the tzaddik in elevating prayers, and the importance of following current religious authority's rulings. Halakhah details the commandments and procedures regarding first fruits and gifts to priests outside the sanctuary, while the Midrash discusses priestly lineage and who is excluded from the mitzvah of bikkurim. Mishnah outlines rules for reciting the declaration of bikkurim in Hebrew, and Musar stresses giving thanks to Hashem and showing love towards the needy. Quoting commentary offers various interpretations on first fruits and their significance, and the Talmud debates scenarios related to priestly lineage and the obligations when bringing first fruits. Tanakh highlights the connection between the story of Lavan the Aramean and the first-fruits declaration, while Targum emphasizes acknowledging God's role in fulfilling the covenant when bringing offerings to the priest. 

|וְלָקַ֧ח הַכֹּהֵ֛ן הַטֶּ֖נֶא מִיָּדֶ֑ךָ וְהִ֨נִּיח֔וֹ לִפְנֵ֕י מִזְבַּ֖ח יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|4|The priest shall take the basket from your hand and set it down in front of the altar of your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The act of offering first fruits to God involves waving the basket before the altar, symbolizing dedication to God and fulfilling Torah laws. The first fruits must be brought to the Temple by the person themselves, placed at the side of the altar, and accompanied by a declaration. The rich bring first fruits in silver and gold baskets, while the poor use wicker baskets, emphasizing the importance of listening to the Torah, studying, and following commandments. The Mishnah establishes the order of precedence for offerings, stating that first fruits must be given before terumah and tithe. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov argue that first fruits require waving before the altar, as indicated in Deuteronomy 26:4 and 26:10. In Leviticus 7:30, offerings to Yahweh are to be presented by fire with the fat and breast being elevated. The priest receives the basket of early fruits from the person's hand and places it before the altar of the Lord. 

|וְעָנִ֨יתָ וְאָמַרְתָּ֜ לִפְנֵ֣י ׀ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ אֲרַמִּי֙ אֹבֵ֣ד אָבִ֔י וַיֵּ֣רֶד מִצְרַ֔יְמָה וַיָּ֥גׇר שָׁ֖ם בִּמְתֵ֣י מְעָ֑ט וַֽיְהִי־שָׁ֕ם לְג֥וֹי גָּד֖וֹל עָצ֥וּם וָרָֽב׃|5|You  shall then recite as follows before your God יהוה: “My father was a fugitive Aramean. He went down to Egypt with meager numbers and sojourned there; but there he became a great and very populous nation.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text delves into various aspects related to the recital of the first fruits declaration in Deuteronomy 26:5, emphasizing the history of the Jewish people, Laban's intentions towards Jacob, the importance of Torah study, and the significance of divine protection and blessings. Additionally, the text discusses the connection between Jacob's message to Esau and Laban's sorcery, highlighting Jacob's ability to resist Laban with divine assistance. The Targums also mention Laban's attempts to harm Jacob but God's protection, leading to the growth of Jacob's descendants into a powerful nation in Egypt. 

|וַיָּרֵ֧עוּ אֹתָ֛נוּ הַמִּצְרִ֖ים וַיְעַנּ֑וּנוּ וַיִּתְּנ֥וּ עָלֵ֖ינוּ עֲבֹדָ֥ה קָשָֽׁה׃|6|The Egyptians dealt harshly with us and oppressed us; they imposed heavy labor upon us.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Egyptians mistreated the Jewish people through hard labor, suspicion of disloyalty, and treating them as slaves, leading to their oppression and exile. The importance of producing complete stones through prayer, the humble beginnings of the Jewish people in Egypt, and the afflictions endured by Joseph and Israel are highlighted in various commentaries and Midrashim. The Egyptians justified their oppression by accusing the Israelites of wrongdoing, causing suffering rather than benefiting from their labor, as seen in the repetition of God's name in prayers and the mandatory nature of building an altar of stones for God. 

|וַנִּצְעַ֕ק אֶל־יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתֵ֑ינוּ וַיִּשְׁמַ֤ע יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־קֹלֵ֔נוּ וַיַּ֧רְא אֶת־עׇנְיֵ֛נוּ וְאֶת־עֲמָלֵ֖נוּ וְאֶֽת־לַחֲצֵֽנוּ׃|7|We cried to יהוה, the God of our ancestors, and יהוה heard our plea and saw our plight, our misery, and our oppression.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that the Jewish people's spiritual elevation leads to God's largesse, with Israel's spiritual accomplishments credited anew each day. The affliction of the Israelites in Egypt included lack of wealth, toil in building cities, and oppression by taskmasters, leading to prayers accepted by God without words. The Amidah prayer highlights God's mercy, acceptance of prayers, and the importance of approaching Him with humility, while also praising Him for hearing prayers. The Pesach Haggadah notes the Israelites' multiplication and strength in Egypt, while Midrash warns against lewd behavior and excessive drinking, emphasizing the importance of upholding justice. The Gemara challenges Rabbi Yishmael's view by discussing affliction in Egypt related to the prevention of conjugal relations, distinct from affliction caused by God or through His mitzvot. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan highlight the Israelites' prayers and God's acknowledgment of their suffering, labor, and oppression. 

|וַיּוֹצִאֵ֤נוּ יְהֹוָה֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם בְּיָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ וּבִזְרֹ֣עַ נְטוּיָ֔ה וּבְמֹרָ֖א גָּדֹ֑ל וּבְאֹת֖וֹת וּבְמֹפְתִֽים׃|8|יהוה freed us from Egypt by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm and awesome power, and by signs and portents,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Deuteronomy 26:8 describes God freeing the Israelites from Egypt with signs and wonders, inspiring awe and fear. The Haggadah emphasizes the suffering and oppression in Egypt, while the Maggid connects Laban to the Exodus story. The Mishnah outlines questions for the Passover Seder, including the significance of Pesach, matzah, and bitter herbs, and Rabbi Yehuda discusses waving first fruits. The Israelites, once oppressed, were brought out of Egypt by God's mighty hand and outstretched arm, as interpreted by both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. 

|וַיְבִאֵ֖נוּ אֶל־הַמָּק֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה וַיִּתֶּן־לָ֙נוּ֙ אֶת־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֔את אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּדְבָֽשׁ׃|9|bringing us to this place and giving us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators, including Rashi, Sforno, Steinsaltz, Chizkuni, and Rav Hirsch, emphasize the connection between the Temple and the Land of Israel as the never-before-possessed homeland of the Israelites. In the Haggadah, a fifth verse from Deuteronomy 26:9 is not discussed during the seder table despite Mishnaic instruction. R. Yossi Haglili notes the mention of "a land flowing with milk and honey" in both Exodus and Deuteronomy, referring to the Promised Land and the presence of five nations. Ramban, Sifre Rabbis, and Rashi discuss the significance of the term "Canaanite" and the land flowing with milk and honey, with differing interpretations. In the Talmud, Rebbi Yose, Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish, and Rebbi Jonah debate the specific location and extent of the Land flowing with milk and honey, with varying opinions on its size and boundaries. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Deuteronomy 26:9 as describing God bringing the Israelites to a land abundant with milk and honey. 

|וְעַתָּ֗ה הִנֵּ֤ה הֵבֵ֙אתִי֙ אֶת־רֵאשִׁית֙ פְּרִ֣י הָאֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֥תָּה לִּ֖י יְהֹוָ֑ה וְהִנַּחְתּ֗וֹ לִפְנֵי֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ וְהִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֔יתָ לִפְנֵ֖י יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|10|Wherefore I now bring the first fruits of the soil which You, יהוה, have given me.” You shall leave it  before your God יהוה and bow low before your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The ritual of presenting first fruits before God is an act of gratitude for His blessings, acknowledging that land and wealth are gifts from God. The priests and their households may fulfill their obligation with matzot made from Challah or terumah, and a person may fulfill his obligation with matzah made from ma'aser sheni if in Jerusalem. The Israelites offer first fruits to God as a thanksgiving for His help in overcoming challenges. The Mishnah details specific verses and rituals for bringing first fruits to the Temple, and a convert must bring an offering but does not read the passage from Deuteronomy 26:5-10. The Talmud discusses differing opinions on first fruits declarations and requirements, while Tanakh commands the declaration of one's history before presenting first fruits. The Targum emphasizes the presentation of first fruits as an act of worship and gratitude, and the Tosefta states that first fruits should not be brought before Shavuot. 

|וְשָׂמַחְתָּ֣ בְכׇל־הַטּ֗וֹב אֲשֶׁ֧ר נָֽתַן־לְךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ וּלְבֵיתֶ֑ךָ אַתָּה֙ וְהַלֵּוִ֔י וְהַגֵּ֖ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּקִרְבֶּֽךָ׃|11|And you shall enjoy, together with the [family of the] Levite and the stranger in your midst, all the bounty that your God יהוה has bestowed upon you and your household.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut suggests bringing gifts to Torah scholars, reciting bikkurim, learning Talmud, and minimizing the study of Aggadah as a segulah for having daughters. The Halakhah discusses the requirements for bringing first fruits to priests and emphasizes including family members, the poor, and the despondent in festival celebrations. Jewish Thought focuses on fulfilling divine laws, connecting with the Divine Influence, and striving for spiritual growth. The Talmud addresses obligations regarding produce and sharecroppers, while the Targum emphasizes rejoicing in God's blessings. Rebbi Meir in the Tosefta states the importance of blessing God for both good and bad things. 

|כִּ֣י תְכַלֶּ֞ה לַ֠עְשֵׂ֠ר אֶת־כׇּל־מַעְשַׂ֧ר תְּבוּאָתְךָ֛ בַּשָּׁנָ֥ה הַשְּׁלִישִׁ֖ת שְׁנַ֣ת הַֽמַּעֲשֵׂ֑ר וְנָתַתָּ֣ה לַלֵּוִ֗י לַגֵּר֙ לַיָּת֣וֹם וְלָֽאַלְמָנָ֔ה וְאָכְל֥וּ בִשְׁעָרֶ֖יךָ וְשָׂבֵֽעוּ׃|12|When you have set aside in full the tenth part of your yield—in the third year, the year of the tithe  —and have given it to the [family of the] Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat their fill in your settlements,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the obligation to leave over a corner of the field for the poor and the stranger, the laws regarding the separation of tithes, and the specific amounts of produce to be given to the poor. It also details the requirements for declaring the removal of sacred substances from one's home and the regulations for giving gifts to the poor. The Bible contains laws for income redistribution in an agricultural economy, including setting aside portions of the harvest for the poor and remitting debts every seven years. In the Talmud, various aspects related to tithing are discussed, including the confession over tithes and special offerings, the prohibition of deriving benefit from the poor man's tithe, and the requirement to set aside the poor man's tithe in the third year. 

|וְאָמַרְתָּ֡ לִפְנֵי֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ בִּעַ֧רְתִּי הַקֹּ֣דֶשׁ מִן־הַבַּ֗יִת וְגַ֨ם נְתַתִּ֤יו לַלֵּוִי֙ וְלַגֵּר֙ לַיָּת֣וֹם וְלָאַלְמָנָ֔ה כְּכׇל־מִצְוָתְךָ֖ אֲשֶׁ֣ר צִוִּיתָ֑נִי לֹֽא־עָבַ֥רְתִּי מִמִּצְוֺתֶ֖יךָ וְלֹ֥א שָׁכָֽחְתִּי׃|13|you  shall declare before your God יהוה: “I have cleared out the consecrated portion from the house; and I have given it to the [family of the] Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, just as You commanded me; I have neither transgressed nor neglected any of Your commandments:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes remembering God as the source of all things and sanctifying possessions for Him, while the declaration in Deuteronomy 26:13 outlines the proper sequence and order of giving tithes and offerings. Halakhah details the obligation to declare the removal of tithes and priestly tithes before God, and Jewish Thought highlights the observant Jew's adherence to divine, social, and ethical laws. The Midrash discusses the treatment of Jewish proselytes and the importance of tithing, while the Mishnah covers laws related to tithing, confession, and rituals. Quoting Commentary explains the Removal of Seventh-year produce and differing opinions on who can eat it, and the Talmud addresses the declaration of tithes and the requirements for various tithes. Tanakh emphasizes that all tithes belong to God and are holy to Him, and Targum stresses the importance of giving tithes as commanded by God. In Tosefta, R. Yosé specifically mentions removing holy produce. 

|לֹא־אָכַ֨לְתִּי בְאֹנִ֜י מִמֶּ֗נּוּ וְלֹא־בִעַ֤רְתִּי מִמֶּ֙נּוּ֙ בְּטָמֵ֔א וְלֹא־נָתַ֥תִּי מִמֶּ֖נּוּ לְמֵ֑ת שָׁמַ֗עְתִּי בְּקוֹל֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהָ֔י עָשִׂ֕יתִי כְּכֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּיתָֽנִי׃|14|I have not eaten of it while in mourning, I have not cleared out any of it while I was impure, and I have not deposited any of it with the dead.  I have obeyed my God יהוה; I have done just as You commanded me.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Moshe Rabbeinu's role in imbuing holiness in the Jewish people's hearts, creating a direct connection to God for all generations. Halakhah prohibits eating impure second tithe, consuming it in mourning, or using its proceeds for anything other than food and drink, with consequences for non-compliance. Jewish Thought stresses obedience to God's commandments and the importance of following His instructions, promising supremacy over all nations. The Talmud discusses the destruction of ritually impure teruma oil, the prohibition of consuming second tithe in a state of impurity, and the declaration of tithes in the Temple. Targum interpretations of Deuteronomy 26:14 highlight adherence to God's commands and avoidance of impurity or mourning while consuming offerings. 

|הַשְׁקִ֩יפָה֩ מִמְּע֨וֹן קׇדְשְׁךָ֜ מִן־הַשָּׁמַ֗יִם וּבָרֵ֤ךְ אֶֽת־עַמְּךָ֙ אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְאֵת֙ הָאֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֖תָּה לָ֑נוּ כַּאֲשֶׁ֤ר נִשְׁבַּ֙עְתָּ֙ לַאֲבֹתֵ֔ינוּ אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּדְבָֽשׁ׃|15|Look down from Your holy abode, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel and the soil You have given us, a land flowing with milk and honey, as You swore to our fathers.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses God's individual inspection of each person, with the essence of tzedakah linked to God's Providence. Halakhah details laws of second tithes and priestly blessings. Jewish Thought explores the promise of milk and honey in the Land of Israel and the concept of the yetzer hara. Liturgy includes prayers for blessings and divine intervention, while Midrash delves into blessings and the importance of following divine guidance. Mishnah describes the Torah portion read by the king and the blessings recited. Musar discusses blessings turning curses into blessings. Quoting Commentary highlights the acknowledgment of God's ownership of the soil. Talmud emphasizes the importance of following rituals related to tithing and agricultural produce. Tanakh and Targum focus on God's blessings for following laws and commandments, while Tosefta discusses blessings from offerings and the merit of the tribes. 

|הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֗ה יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ מְצַוְּךָ֧ לַעֲשׂ֛וֹת אֶת־הַחֻקִּ֥ים הָאֵ֖לֶּה וְאֶת־הַמִּשְׁפָּטִ֑ים וְשָׁמַרְתָּ֤ וְעָשִׂ֙יתָ֙ אוֹתָ֔ם בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֖ וּבְכׇל־נַפְשֶֽׁךָ׃|16|Your God יהוה commands you this day to observe these laws and rules; observe them faithfully with all your heart and soul.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes daily renewal through prayer and connection to Hashem, Moses stresses the importance of observing commandments with dedication, Jewish Thought discusses finding joy in spiritual growth, Midrash highlights seeking counsel from the Torah and Torah study's importance, Musar encourages approaching commandments as if given anew each day, Rambam connects vidui maaser to verses in various books, Talmud explains recitation practices, Tanakh emphasizes following God's laws, and Targum underscores observing statutes and laws wholeheartedly. 

|אֶת־יְהֹוָ֥ה הֶאֱמַ֖רְתָּ הַיּ֑וֹם לִהְיוֹת֩ לְךָ֨ לֵֽאלֹהִ֜ים וְלָלֶ֣כֶת בִּדְרָכָ֗יו וְלִשְׁמֹ֨ר חֻקָּ֧יו וּמִצְוֺתָ֛יו וּמִשְׁפָּטָ֖יו וְלִשְׁמֹ֥עַ בְּקֹלֽוֹ׃|17|You have affirmed  this day that יהוה is your God, in whose ways you will walk, whose laws and commandments and rules you will observe, and whom you will obey.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that all events are ultimately for the good and an expression of God's love, with Israel's spiritual state determining divine largesse. Halakhah discusses the requirements for consecrating a yevamah and the classification of defensive wars as milḥemet mizvah. Jewish Thought explores allegorical visions in prophets and the symbolism of t’fillin, while Midrash highlights the importance of Torah study and devotion to God. Musar stresses instilling Torah values in children and emulating God's traits, with references to lashon hara. Quoting Commentary delves into linguistic nuances in biblical verses, while Talmud emphasizes the unique relationship between Israel and God. Targum underscores the commitment to God and the acceptance of His rulership. 

|וַֽיהֹוָ֞ה הֶאֱמִֽירְךָ֣ הַיּ֗וֹם לִהְי֥וֹת לוֹ֙ לְעַ֣ם סְגֻלָּ֔ה כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּר־לָ֑ךְ וְלִשְׁמֹ֖ר כׇּל־מִצְוֺתָֽיו׃|18|And יהוה has affirmed  this day that you are, as promised, God’s treasured people who shall observe all the divine commandments,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut texts emphasize that blemishes in the soul affect the Shekhinah, God takes pride in His children, and events are ultimately for good. Jewish people are chosen by God to be His treasured nation, observing His commandments. The importance of fulfilling conditions of slavehood to designate G-d as master is discussed in Jewish Thought, while Midrash highlights the suffering of the blind and the special relationship between God and Israel. Musar compares the relationship between God and Israel to a groom and bride, emphasizing their mutual bond of love and loyalty. Talmud stresses the loyalty of Israel to God and the reciprocal relationship between them, while Tanakh and Targum affirm that Israel is God's treasured possession among all peoples. Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah and Rabbi Elazar ben Hisma discuss the significance of the commandment of Hakhel in Tosefta. 

|וּֽלְתִתְּךָ֣ עֶלְי֗וֹן עַ֤ל כׇּל־הַגּוֹיִם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֔ה לִתְהִלָּ֖ה וּלְשֵׁ֣ם וּלְתִפְאָ֑רֶת וְלִֽהְיֹתְךָ֧ עַם־קָדֹ֛שׁ לַיהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֵּֽר׃|19|and that [God] will set you, in fame and renown and glory, high above all the nations that [God] has made; and that you shall be, as promised, a holy people to your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the exaltation of the Jewish people above all nations by God, highlighting their special status and deep-rooted bond with Him. This unique relationship is eternal, not dependent on observance of the covenant, and is associated with praise, splendor, and sanctification. The Jewish people are praised for their connection to God, who is their glory and strength, and are called to fulfill their purpose in life to justify their existence. Israel's sacrifice for the Torah and sanctification of God's name lead to blessings and exaltation above all nations, with a constant call for redemption to be sought. The stones at Deuteronomy 27:8:1 are believed to contain the entire Torah or a summary of mitzvot and prohibitions, symbolizing the unity of the Jewish people and their future redemption. Rav Ashi explains that Israel is a great nation close to God, saved by the Lord, and elevated above all nations to be a holy people. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize that God will elevate the Israelites above all other nations, giving them praise, renown, and glory to sanctify them before Him.

## Deuteronomy 27

|וַיְצַ֤ו מֹשֶׁה֙ וְזִקְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֶת־הָעָ֖ם לֵאמֹ֑ר שָׁמֹר֙ אֶת־כׇּל־הַמִּצְוָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י מְצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם הַיּֽוֹם׃|1|Moses and the elders of Israel charged the people, saying: Observe all the Instruction that I enjoin upon you this day.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses and the elders of Israel emphasized the importance of following all the commandments of the Torah, instructing the people to do so by inscribing the Torah on stones and placing them on Mount Eyval. In cases of unsolved murder, a ritual with a heifer whose neck is broken is prescribed by the Torah, with Rabbi Yehuda specifying the number of judges involved. The thirteenth principle of repentance stresses the seriousness of seemingly minor transgressions, warning against the dangers of repeated sins leading to more serious offenses. Ramban explains that the commandments were inscribed in multiple languages on stones, while the German Commentary on Mishnah Sotah 9:1:2 discusses the importance of speaking in Hebrew during certain rituals. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה בַּיּוֹם֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תַּעַבְר֣וּ אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּן֒ אֶל־הָאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ נֹתֵ֣ן לָ֑ךְ וַהֲקֵמֹתָ֤ לְךָ֙ אֲבָנִ֣ים גְּדֹל֔וֹת וְשַׂדְתָּ֥ אֹתָ֖ם בַּשִּֽׂיד׃|2|As soon as you have crossed the Jordan into the land that your God יהוה is giving you, you shall set up large stones. Coat them with plaster|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy, Moses and the elders are commanded to write Words of Torah on stones for the nations to understand, while Israel learns from the consequences of evil. The stones were set up in three different sites, coated with plaster to withstand rain, and large enough to engrave the commandments. The altar in Shiloh was made of stones, and the Israelites were instructed to set up large stones covered with whitewash when crossing the Jordan River. The blessings and curses pronounced by Israel were carried by priests in three instances, with three sets of stones mentioned in different locations. 

|וְכָתַבְתָּ֣ עֲלֵיהֶ֗ן אֶֽת־כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֛י הַתּוֹרָ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את בְּעׇבְרֶ֑ךָ לְמַ֡עַן אֲשֶׁר֩ תָּבֹ֨א אֶל־הָאָ֜רֶץ אֲֽשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֣יךָ ׀ נֹתֵ֣ן לְךָ֗ אֶ֣רֶץ זָבַ֤ת חָלָב֙ וּדְבַ֔שׁ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֶּ֛ר יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵֽי־אֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ לָֽךְ׃|3|and inscribe upon them all the words of this Teaching. When you cross over to enter the land that your God יהוה is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as יהוה, the God of your ancestors, promised you—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators had different interpretations of the commandment to inscribe the Torah on stones upon entering the Land of Israel. The purpose was to give thanks for inheriting the land, remind the people to keep the Torah, and tie their conquest of the land to fulfilling the commandments. Ramban explained that expanding the borders and inheriting the lands of the ten nations promised to Abraham was contingent on keeping all the commandments forever, with the goal of achieving a perfect and everlasting love for God. The Gemara drew parallels between the Torah written on stones and the writing of a mezuzah, while Targum emphasized the importance of writing the Torah on stones before entering the promised land. 

|וְהָיָה֮ בְּעׇבְרְכֶ֣ם אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּן֒ תָּקִ֜ימוּ אֶת־הָאֲבָנִ֣ים הָאֵ֗לֶּה אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָנֹכִ֜י מְצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶ֛ם הַיּ֖וֹם בְּהַ֣ר עֵיבָ֑ל וְשַׂדְתָּ֥ אוֹתָ֖ם בַּשִּֽׂיד׃|4|upon crossing the Jordan, you shall set up these stones, about which I charge you this day, on Mount Ebal, and coat them with plaster.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses commanded the Israelites to set up stones on Mount Eival for offerings. The ceremony of blessings and curses took place on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, with six tribes on each mountain. Rashi explains that the Israelites crossed the Jordan with stones to build an altar on Mt. Eivel. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Sheila disagree on the location and timing of setting up stones near the Jordan. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that the Israelites were commanded to set up stones on Mount Ebal and coat them with whitewash after crossing the Jordan. 

|וּבָנִ֤יתָ שָּׁם֙ מִזְבֵּ֔חַ לַיהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ מִזְבַּ֣ח אֲבָנִ֔ים לֹא־תָנִ֥יף עֲלֵיהֶ֖ם בַּרְזֶֽל׃|5|There, too, you shall build an altar to your God יהוה, an altar of stones. Do not wield an iron tool over them;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against using iron tools on the stones of the altar is to maintain sanctity and prevent association with idolatry, extending to the construction of the Temple. The Talmud discusses the construction of altars and the importance of peace and atonement, while the Israelites built an altar of unhewn stone as commanded by Moses. Rabbi Yochana ben Zakai emphasizes not taking credit for learning Torah. 

|אֲבָנִ֤ים שְׁלֵמוֹת֙ תִּבְנֶ֔ה אֶת־מִזְבַּ֖ח יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ וְהַעֲלִ֤יתָ עָלָיו֙ עוֹלֹ֔ת לַיהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|6|you must build the altar of your God יהוה of unhewn  stones. You shall offer on it burnt offerings to your God יהוה,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that stones represent letters, with the altar of the Lord needing to be built with whole stones. Halakhah specifies that any stone with a crack or touched by iron is disqualified, and erecting a matsevah is forbidden. Kabbalah highlights the importance of producing complete stones through prayer, while the Midrash emphasizes the mandatory nature of building an altar of whole stones for promoting peace. The Mishnah details the ceremony of blessings and curses with six tribes on Mount Gerizim and six on Mount Ebal, using whole stones from Bet Kerem for the altar. The Talmud discusses the construction and materials of the altar, while the Tanakh and Targum mention the building of an altar of unhewn stones for burnt offerings and sacrifices to God. 

|וְזָבַחְתָּ֥ שְׁלָמִ֖ים וְאָכַ֣לְתָּ שָּׁ֑ם וְשָׂ֣מַחְתָּ֔ לִפְנֵ֖י יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|7|and you shall sacrifice there offerings of well-being and eat them, rejoicing before your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teaches that true rejoicing during festivals comes from eating meat, as stated in Deuteronomy 27:7. The Ba'al Shem Tov emphasizes that the greatest joy in heaven is when creatures serve God from earth. Halakhah mandates various aspects of celebration on festivals, including offering peace offerings, eating meat, drinking wine, and including the poor in the festivities. The Mishnah details specific rules for valid slaughter, while the Talmud discusses the fulfillment of the mitzva of rejoicing on a Festival and the use of second-tithe money for peace offerings. The Tanakh mentions the Israelites offering sacrifices of well-being to God, and Targum Jonathan emphasizes the importance of offering sacrifices and rejoicing in the presence of the Lord. 

|וְכָתַבְתָּ֣ עַל־הָאֲבָנִ֗ים אֶֽת־כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֛י הַתּוֹרָ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את בַּאֵ֥ר הֵיטֵֽב׃|8|And on those stones you shall inscribe every word of this Teaching most distinctly.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Moses commanded the Torah to be translated into 70 languages and inscribed on stones to show permission from God for Israelites to take Canaanite lands. Commentary from Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, HaKtav VeHaKabalah, Siftei Chakhamim, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz provide different perspectives on the significance of writing the Torah in multiple languages. In Guides, the Israelites were instructed to set up stones inscribed with the Torah upon entering the promised land, while Midrash discusses the miracles and events surrounding the inscribing of the Torah in seventy languages. Mishnah describes the ceremony of blessings and curses on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, while Talmud and Quoting Commentary elaborate on the writing of the Torah on stones in multiple languages. Finally, Targum emphasizes the importance of writing the Torah in a way that can be interpreted in different languages. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֤ר מֹשֶׁה֙ וְהַכֹּהֲנִ֣ים הַלְוִיִּ֔ם אֶ֥ל כׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לֵאמֹ֑ר הַסְכֵּ֤ת ׀ וּשְׁמַע֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל הַיּ֤וֹם הַזֶּה֙ נִהְיֵ֣יתָֽ לְעָ֔ם לַיהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|9|Moses and the levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying: Silence! Hear, O Israel! Today you have become the people of your God יהוה:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the daily renewal of Divine service, with Torah study and asceticism best done in groups to imbue holiness. Halakhah explains the matrilineal succession in Jewish identity from the Sinaitic covenant. Kabbalah discusses the male and female aspects of divinity in the Zohar commentary. Midrash highlights the importance of Torah study in groups and the sacrifices made for devotion. Quoting Commentary emphasizes the possessions of the Holy Tabernacle and the significance of treating Torah scholars with respect. Second Temple texts stress the importance of silence and listening, while the Talmud discusses the importance of studying Torah with companions and the daily importance of Torah study. Tanakh emphasizes the importance of listening to reveal internalities and truths, and Targum highlights the commitment of the people of Israel to God. 

|וְשָׁ֣מַעְתָּ֔ בְּק֖וֹל יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ וְעָשִׂ֤יתָ אֶת־מִצְוֺתָו֙ וְאֶת־חֻקָּ֔יו אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּֽוֹם׃|10|Heed your God יהוה and observe the divine commandments and laws, which I enjoin upon you this day.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of obeying God's commandments and listening to His voice, with a focus on the unity and equal importance of all the commandments. Moses instructs the people of Israel to be silent and listen to the commands of the Lord as they renew the Sinai Covenant in Deuteronomy 27:9-10, emphasizing the need to follow and obey God's word. 

|וַיְצַ֤ו מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶת־הָעָ֔ם בַּיּ֥וֹם הַה֖וּא לֵאמֹֽר׃|11|Thereupon Moses charged the people, saying:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses commands the people to proclaim blessings and curses on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal to emphasize the importance of upholding the law as guardians of the Torah, reassuring the Israelites that they will ultimately be redeemed and blessed by God. Ibn Ezra interprets Isaiah 3:10 as emphasizing the importance of thinking or declaring in one's heart or with the mouth, with formulaic declarations in Deuteronomy summarizing the entire Torah. The Targum states that Moses instructed the people to recite blessings and curses on the mountains. 

|אֵ֠לֶּה יַֽעַמְד֞וּ לְבָרֵ֤ךְ אֶת־הָעָם֙ עַל־הַ֣ר גְּרִזִ֔ים בְּעׇבְרְכֶ֖ם אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֑ן שִׁמְעוֹן֙ וְלֵוִ֣י וִֽיהוּדָ֔ה וְיִשָּׂשכָ֖ר וְיוֹסֵ֥ף וּבִנְיָמִֽן׃|12|After you have crossed the Jordan, the following shall stand on Mount Gerizim when the blessing for the people is spoken: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that blessings can be received immediately by following God's instructions, even before conquering Canaan. The ceremony on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal involved six tribes on each mountain, with priests, Levites, and the Ark in between, reciting blessings and curses directed at different groups of tribes based on ancestry. The Babylonian Talmud discusses the command to give blessings on Mount Gerizim and curses on Mount Ebal upon entering Canaan, while the Mishnah specifies that certain recitations and blessings must be done in Hebrew. The Midrash explores the Priestly Blessing, the story of Balaam and Balak, and the importance of blessings and curses. Lashon hara brings curses, while refraining brings blessings. Rashi, Mishnah, Rabbeinu Bahya, Ramban, Gevia Kesef, Chizkuni, and Second Temple sources provide further insights on blessings and curses. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi discuss the placement of Levites during the ceremony, and the Tosefta details the process of reciting blessings and curses on the mountains. 

|וְאֵ֛לֶּה יַֽעַמְד֥וּ עַל־הַקְּלָלָ֖ה בְּהַ֣ר עֵיבָ֑ל רְאוּבֵן֙ גָּ֣ד וְאָשֵׁ֔ר וּזְבוּלֻ֖ן דָּ֥ן וְנַפְתָּלִֽי׃|13|And for the curse, the following shall stand on Mount Ebal: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Six tribes, including Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali, are designated to stand on Mount Eival to pronounce curses as part of a ritual described in Deuteronomy 27:13. In various texts, it is explained that the priests and Levites were below the mountain during the blessings and curses, while the rest were on the mountain, with the Mishnah harmonizing descriptions by stating that all tribes went up while the priests and Levites remained in the middle. The ceremony on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal involved six tribes on each mountain with the Cohanim, Levites, and the ark in the middle, reciting blessings and curses, with the blessing preceding the curse, including prohibitions against making graven images. 

|וְעָנ֣וּ הַלְוִיִּ֗ם וְאָ֥מְר֛וּ אֶל־כׇּל־אִ֥ישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל ק֥וֹל רָֽם׃|14|The Levites shall then proclaim in a loud voice to all the people of Israel:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 27:14, the Levites stood between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, reciting blessings and curses in Hebrew, with the tribes divided accordingly. The Mishnah specifies that various rituals, including the blessings and curses, must be recited in Hebrew, as seen in the Torah. The Talmud discusses the requirement for Levites to speak in Hebrew during sacred ceremonies, with differing perspectives presented. The Targum mentions that the Levites were instructed to speak loudly to the people of Israel. 

|אָר֣וּר הָאִ֡ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יַעֲשֶׂה֩ פֶ֨סֶל וּמַסֵּכָ֜ה תּוֹעֲבַ֣ת יְהֹוָ֗ה מַעֲשֵׂ֛ה יְדֵ֥י חָרָ֖שׁ וְשָׂ֣ם בַּסָּ֑תֶר וְעָנ֧וּ כׇל־הָעָ֛ם וְאָמְר֖וּ אָמֵֽן׃|15|Cursed be any party who makes a sculptured or molten image, abhorred by יהוה, a craftsman’s handiwork, and sets it up in secret.—And all the people shall respond, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sforno explains the curses in Deuteronomy 27:15 target sinners violating specific commandments in secret, mostly leaders. Halakhah details the prohibitions related to idol worship, emphasizing the treatment of idols and accessories. Jewish Thought highlights collective responsibility for preventing corruption and addressing secret sins, with blessings and curses serving as warnings. Kabbalah warns against actions contrary to the Torah, linking them to idol creation. Midrash discusses blessings and curses related to idol worship at Mt. Gerizim and Mt. Ebal, targeting adulterers leading to idolatry. Talmud explores blessings for Torah observance and curses for sins like idol worship, with distinctions between idols made by Jews and Gentiles. The Targum emphasizes not making or hiding abominable images or idols, with responses of "Amen" to blessings and curses. Tosefta describes the ceremony with tribes on both mountains and the recitation of blessings and curses, including specific and general curses related to Torah observance. 

|אָר֕וּר מַקְלֶ֥ה אָבִ֖יו וְאִמּ֑וֹ וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|16|Cursed be the one who insults father or mother.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries, including Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, and Steinsaltz, discuss the significance of honoring parents and the consequences of cursing or shaming them, with punishments outlined in Deuteronomy 27:16. The importance of love, respect, and obedience towards parents is emphasized in Jewish thought, with Midrashic texts highlighting the consequences of disrespecting parents and the intervention of divine forces to prevent harm to the Israelites. The Musar perspective underscores the positive commandment to fear and honor parents, with specific guidelines on how to show respect. The Targum reinforces the idea that disrespect towards parents is cursed, with the community affirming this sentiment with an "Amen." 

|אָר֕וּר מַסִּ֖יג גְּב֣וּל רֵעֵ֑הוּ וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|17|Cursed be the one who moves a neighbor’s landmark.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text from Tanya prohibits printing certain materials without authority for five years, promising blessings to those who comply. In Sefat Emet, Korach's argument against Aharon's leadership is countered by the daily choice of Bnei Yisrael by Hashem, symbolized by Aharon's kindness and the mitzvah of tzitzit. Deuteronomy 27:17 condemns those who move their neighbor's boundary markers in a deceitful manner, leading the blind astray. Moses curses those who shift boundaries, likening it to leading the soul away from virtue towards passion. Deuteronomy 19:14 prohibits moving your neighbor's landmarks, with the Targum commentaries affirming this curse. 

|אָר֕וּר מַשְׁגֶּ֥ה עִוֵּ֖ר בַּדָּ֑רֶךְ וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|18|Cursed be the one who misdirects a blind person who is underway.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the mutual selection between Hashem and Yaakov, with purity attained through Hashem's words and Torah purified through speech. The curse on those who mislead the blind refers to giving bad advice, a transgression of the commandment not to mislead the blind. Justice is emphasized in Jewish Thought, respecting all beings and their possessions as creations of God. The Midrash likens blindness to suffering and explains that the blind will be the first to be healed when the world is healed. People are warned against misleading others for personal gain in Musar, highlighting the severity of their punishment. Rashi interprets Leviticus 19:14:3 as referring to giving bad advice rather than a physical stumbling block, supported by a similar concept in Devarim 27:18. The Second Temple text discusses the importance of reason over sense perception in understanding the world, while the Targums on Deuteronomy 27:18 all state that those who mislead the blind are cursed. 

|אָר֗וּר מַטֶּ֛ה מִשְׁפַּ֥ט גֵּר־יָת֖וֹם וְאַלְמָנָ֑ה וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|19|Cursed be the one who subverts the rights of the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the curse on those who pervert justice for vulnerable individuals like strangers, orphans, and widows, emphasizing the importance of accountability even in secret actions. The Talmud and Torah stress the importance of treating strangers with equality and love, prohibiting mistreatment and highlighting the need for justice and compassion towards all individuals. The Targum states that those who distort justice for converts, orphans, or widows will be cursed, with the people saying Amen. 

|אָר֗וּר שֹׁכֵב֙ עִם־אֵ֣שֶׁת אָבִ֔יו כִּ֥י גִלָּ֖ה כְּנַ֣ף אָבִ֑יו וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|20|Cursed be the [man] who lies with his father’s wife, for he has removed his father’s garment.  —And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah condemns sins such as uncovering a father's skirt and marrying a woman violated by one's father using respectful euphemisms to deter private crimes, as seen in the punishment of individuals like Asa, Uzzah, and the men of Beth Shemesh for seemingly minor transgressions not explicitly mentioned in the Torah. In the case of Reuben laying with Bilhah, interpretations suggest he did not actually sin but rearranged beds to defend his mother's honor, leading to his repentance and atonement. Rabbeinu Bahya explains that Reuven's sin was fully expiated when Moses ascended to God, reflected in the curse placed on anyone who slept with their father's wife when Reuven was appointed first to utter curses, indicating that his actions were not as severe as previously thought. 

|אָר֕וּר שֹׁכֵ֖ב עִם־כׇּל־בְּהֵמָ֑ה וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|21|Cursed be the one who lies with any beast.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Steinsaltz explain that the curse for lying with a beast applies to both male and female animals because they cannot protest verbally. Halakhah states that an immersion without intention is valid, but a woman should prepare for purification for it to be valid. In Kabbalah, demons are described as beasts that multiply and are despised by Torah students. The Midrash advises selling possessions to marry a scholar's daughter, while the Talmud recommends marrying the daughter of a Torah scholar and avoiding marrying an ignoramus. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan translate Deuteronomy 27:21 as stating that anyone who has intercourse with an animal is cursed. 

|אָר֗וּר שֹׁכֵב֙ עִם־אֲחֹת֔וֹ בַּת־אָבִ֖יו א֣וֹ בַת־אִמּ֑וֹ וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|22|Cursed be the [man] who lies with his sister, whether daughter of his father or of his mother.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The curse in Deuteronomy 27:22 is on those who sexually abuse their siblings, particularly adult brothers who may use their authority to prevent their minor sisters from objecting, leading to hidden transgressions. Leviticus 18:9 prohibits uncovering the nakedness of one's sister, whether born into the household or outside, as incestuous. The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 27:22 emphasize the curse on those engaging in incestuous relationships, with Onkelos mentioning sisters, Targum Jonathan including father or mother's daughters, and Targum Jerusalem adding a curse for those who lie with their mother-in-law, all ending with the people responding with "Amen." 

|אָר֕וּר שֹׁכֵ֖ב עִם־חֹֽתַנְתּ֑וֹ וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|23|Cursed be the [man] who lies with his mother-in-law.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Deuteronomy 27:23 curses those who lie with their mother-in-law, regardless of her marital status, bringing shame to the family. The Mishnah in Yevamot 1:1 exempts certain women from levirate marriage and ḥalitza due to forbidden relationships with the surviving brother. The German commentary on Mishnah Yevamot 1:1:15 discusses the prohibition of marrying a deceased wife's mother or deceased brother's wife, citing Leviticus. The Targum states that those who have intercourse with their father's-in-law's wife or mother-in-law are cursed, with the people saying Amen. 

|אָר֕וּר מַכֵּ֥ה רֵעֵ֖הוּ בַּסָּ֑תֶר וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|24|Cursed be the one who strikes down a fellow [Israelite] in secret.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi and other commentaries explain that the curse of smiting one's fellow secretly refers to slander, with the mention of eleven curses corresponding to the eleven tribes, excluding Simeon. Halakhah emphasizes that lashon hara brings curses, removes blessings, and is forbidden in all forms. Jewish Thought stresses the importance of justice and respect for all beings, while the Midrash shows the consequences of secret slander. Musar highlights the harm caused by lashon hara and the denial of fundamental principles of faith, while both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Deuteronomy 27:24 as a curse against those who harm others in secret. 

|אָרוּר֙ לֹקֵ֣חַ שֹׁ֔חַד לְהַכּ֥וֹת נֶ֖פֶשׁ דָּ֣ם נָקִ֑י וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|25|Cursed be the one who accepts a bribe in the case of the murder of  an innocent person.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Sforno interpret Deuteronomy 27:25 as referring to false witnesses and bribery to slander, with Tur HaArokh warning of perjury leading to judicial murder. The Sefer HaChinukh and Mishneh Torah prohibit judges from accepting bribes, with the obligation to return them if demanded. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan translate the verse as a curse on those who accept bribes to harm innocent individuals, with the people responding with "Amen." 

|אָר֗וּר אֲשֶׁ֧ר לֹא־יָקִ֛ים אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֥י הַתּוֹרָֽה־הַזֹּ֖את לַעֲשׂ֣וֹת אוֹתָ֑ם וְאָמַ֥ר כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם אָמֵֽן׃|26|Cursed be whoever will not uphold the terms of this Teaching and observe them.—And all the people shall say, Amen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Deuteronomy 27:26 curses those who do not uphold the Torah, including promoting Torah observance and repenting sincerely. Violating the prohibition of Lashon Hara and Rechilut incurs a grave sin. Karet applies to all positive commandments, including forbidden relationships. Repentance for even minor sins is crucial, and supporting Torah scholars is essential to avoid being cursed. The Talmud discusses the laws of curses in Deuteronomy 27:15-26, requiring specific recitations and detailing the number of covenants in the Torah. The people affirm curses on those who do not uphold the Torah, with tribes pronouncing blessings and curses on Mounts Gerizim and Ebal. At the recitation of blessings and curses, tribes, priests, and Levites alternate between facing the mountains, emphasizing the importance of Torah observance.

## Deuteronomy 28

|וְהָיָ֗ה אִם־שָׁמ֤וֹעַ תִּשְׁמַע֙ בְּקוֹל֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ לִשְׁמֹ֤ר לַעֲשׂוֹת֙ אֶת־כׇּל־מִצְוֺתָ֔יו אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם וּנְתָ֨נְךָ֜ יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ עֶלְי֔וֹן עַ֖ל כׇּל־גּוֹיֵ֥י הָאָֽרֶץ׃|1|Now, if you obey your God יהוה, to observe faithfully all the divine commandments which I enjoin upon you this day, your God יהוה will set you high above all the nations of the earth.|

Ramban explains the spiritual significance of the census of the Jewish people, and the Talmud discusses the importance of being a vessel for knowledge and analyzing curses in Deuteronomy 28. Targum highlights the promise of being elevated above all nations by obeying God's commandments. 

|וּבָ֧אוּ עָלֶ֛יךָ כׇּל־הַבְּרָכ֥וֹת הָאֵ֖לֶּה וְהִשִּׂיגֻ֑ךָ כִּ֣י תִשְׁמַ֔ע בְּק֖וֹל יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|2|All these blessings shall come upon you and take effect, if you will but heed the word of your God יהוה:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that blessings promised to Israel will remain constant in their soul, with every good deed generating blessing that will eventually reach them. The commentary on Deuteronomy 28:2 highlights that blessings will come to the Jewish people without active pursuit, prioritizing Torah and following God's will. The Midrash emphasizes divine protection in various aspects of life, safeguarding against harm and providing guidance. Quoting commentary and Targum Jonathan further emphasize the importance of obedience to God's word for blessings to abide. 

|בָּר֥וּךְ אַתָּ֖ה בָּעִ֑יר וּבָר֥וּךְ אַתָּ֖ה בַּשָּׂדֶֽה׃|3|Blessed shall you be in the city and blessed shall you be in the country.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The city will see an increase in merchandise and blessings for observing urban commandments, while the field will have blessings for farmers following laws related to growing crops. Jerusalem is considered the blessed city, and Zion the blessed field. The Kabbalah text Zohar mentions that waiting for sanctification brings blessings, even acknowledged by the wicked in Gehenom. Liturgy in Deuteronomy 28:3,4,5,6,8,12 states not to borrow. The Midrash discusses blessings in the city and field, arrival and departure, and emphasizes listening to the Torah. Musar discusses seeking vengeance, detestable in those resembling a lion, while the wise do not seek revenge. Rashi explains the promise of blessing from the Lord in Deuteronomy 28:3-12. Gemara discusses the meaning of blessing in Deuteronomy 28:3 and 28:6. Targum interprets Deuteronomy 28:3 as a blessing for prosperity in urban and rural settings, and Tosefta Maaser Sheni states that the verse "And bless your people" includes all blessings. 

|בָּר֧וּךְ פְּרִֽי־בִטְנְךָ֛ וּפְרִ֥י אַדְמָתְךָ֖ וּפְרִ֣י בְהֶמְתֶּ֑ךָ שְׁגַ֥ר אֲלָפֶ֖יךָ וְעַשְׁתְּר֥וֹת צֹאנֶֽךָ׃|4|Blessed shall be your issue from the womb, your produce from the soil, and the offspring of your cattle, the calving of your herd and the lambing of your flock.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The blessings in Deuteronomy 28:4 include healthy children, prosperous livestock, and abundant crops, with the fruit of the womb considered the supreme blessing. The blessing of the Lord includes protection and prosperity, extending to physical well-being, protection from evil inclinations, and even in the afterlife. Radak explains "עץ פרי" as including both the trunk and fruit of a tree, Rashi interprets "ככבש אלוף" as animals brought for slaughter, and Ramban suggests "u’mlo’oh" refers to blessings of fertility. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention blessings on offspring, produce, cattle, and flocks. 

|בָּר֥וּךְ טַנְאֲךָ֖ וּמִשְׁאַרְתֶּֽךָ׃|5|Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 28:5, various commentators interpret "blessed shall be thy basket" and "thy basket" as referring to fruits, liquids filtered through baskets, and the place where flour is placed. The Midrash emphasizes the blessings associated with performing mitzvot in different settings, while the Targum translations focus on the significance of first fruits and flour offerings for divine favor. Ramban and Rashbam provide insights into the order of blessings and curses mentioned in the text, highlighting the importance of G'd's blessings on daily livelihood. 

|בָּר֥וּךְ אַתָּ֖ה בְּבֹאֶ֑ךָ וּבָר֥וּךְ אַתָּ֖ה בְּצֵאתֶֽךָ׃|6|Blessed shall you be in your comings and blessed shall you be in your goings.|

Various commentaries on Deuteronomy 28:6 discuss the concept of being blessed when coming in and going out, with Rashi emphasizing sinless arrival and departure, Ibn Ezra expanding on different situations for the blessing, and Siftei Chakhamim connecting it to forgetting Torah. The priests focus on material, spiritual, and harmonious blessings from God, while Kabbalah emphasizes the oneness of God through reciting the Shema. Midrash texts discuss blessings and protections from the Lord, and Musar highlights the importance of maintaining a close relationship with God and fulfilling spiritual tasks before death. The Talmud discusses how generosity and fulfilling precepts bring blessings, while the Tanakh and Targum emphasize God's protection and blessings during journeys and in places of learning. 

|יִתֵּ֨ן יְהֹוָ֤ה אֶת־אֹיְבֶ֙יךָ֙ הַקָּמִ֣ים עָלֶ֔יךָ נִגָּפִ֖ים לְפָנֶ֑יךָ בְּדֶ֤רֶךְ אֶחָד֙ יֵצְא֣וּ אֵלֶ֔יךָ וּבְשִׁבְעָ֥ה דְרָכִ֖ים יָנ֥וּסוּ לְפָנֶֽיךָ׃|7|יהוה will put to rout before [your army] the enemies who attack you; they will march out against you by a single road, but flee from you by many  roads.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse in Deuteronomy 28:7 distinguishes Israel from gentile nations by highlighting their unique ability to relate to God with both love and awe, while gentile nations can only do so with either love or fear. Various commentaries explain that Israel's security is dependent on faithful obedience to God, and the number seven symbolizes multiplicity and perfection. The Talmud discusses the use of masculine and feminine forms in the Mishna, with Torah being feminine and war being masculine. Adonoy will defeat Israel's enemies, causing them to scatter in seven directions. 

|יְצַ֨ו יְהֹוָ֤ה אִתְּךָ֙ אֶת־הַבְּרָכָ֔ה בַּאֲסָמֶ֕יךָ וּבְכֹ֖ל מִשְׁלַ֣ח יָדֶ֑ךָ וּבֵ֣רַכְךָ֔ בָּאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לָֽךְ׃|8|יהוה will ordain blessings for you upon your barns and upon all your undertakings: you will be blessed in the land that your God יהוה is giving you.|

|יְקִֽימְךָ֨ יְהֹוָ֥ה לוֹ֙ לְעַ֣ם קָד֔וֹשׁ כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר נִֽשְׁבַּֽע־לָ֑ךְ כִּ֣י תִשְׁמֹ֗ר אֶת־מִצְוֺת֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ וְהָלַכְתָּ֖ בִּדְרָכָֽיו׃|9|יהוה will establish you as God’s holy people, as was sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of your God יהוה and walk in God’s ways.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai's teachings in Chasidut are essential for understanding the secrets of the Torah, emphasizing charity, Torah study, and repentance. Halakhah discusses emulating God's traits and acting with compassion, while Jewish Thought focuses on the importance of following God's ways and commandments. Kabbalah highlights the fear of HaShem and the removal of the shoe as symbols of a deeper connection. Mishnah details the process of flogging and the importance of observing the law and God's mercy. Musar emphasizes acts of justice, loving-kindness, and mercy as essential for fulfilling one's purpose in creation. Quoting Commentary sources various commentators discussing walking in God's ways, emulating God's attributes, and the significance of commandments. Tanakh and Targum both stress the importance of walking in God's ways and being blameless to receive blessings. 

|וְרָאוּ֙ כׇּל־עַמֵּ֣י הָאָ֔רֶץ כִּ֛י שֵׁ֥ם יְהֹוָ֖ה נִקְרָ֣א עָלֶ֑יךָ וְיָֽרְא֖וּ מִמֶּֽךָּ׃|10|And all the peoples of the earth shall see that יהוה’s name is proclaimed over you,  and they shall stand in fear of you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rav Mordechai Yosef established the fundamentals of Chasidut, emphasizing the universal application of Torah teachings to all souls. The significance of Tefillin in connecting to Hashem and meriting Torah is discussed, emphasizing self-nullification and acceptance of the Kingdom of Heaven. The nations will recognize Israel as favored by God through the symbol of Tefillin, leading to awe and fear of both Israel and God. Tefillin should be worn during the day, not at night, Sabbaths, or holidays, with the time to put them on beginning when one can see a colleague standing four cubits away. Wearing Tefillin is crucial for spiritual protection and connection to the Divine, symbolizing the presence of God's Name and instilling fear in destructive forces and nations. Israel's steadfast faith during various exiles is highlighted in the Midrash, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling vows and faithfulness leading to reverence from other nations. The wearing of phylacteries serves as a reminder of the miracles of the Exodus and God's providence, establishing the Jewish people as God's chosen ones. 

|וְהוֹתִרְךָ֤ יְהֹוָה֙ לְטוֹבָ֔ה בִּפְרִ֧י בִטְנְךָ֛ וּבִפְרִ֥י בְהֶמְתְּךָ֖ וּבִפְרִ֣י אַדְמָתֶ֑ךָ עַ֚ל הָאֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר נִשְׁבַּ֧ע יְהֹוָ֛ה לַאֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ לָ֥תֶת לָֽךְ׃|11|יהוה will give you abounding prosperity in your issue from the womb, the offspring of your cattle, and the produce of your soil in the land that יהוה swore to your fathers to assign to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries on Deuteronomy 28:11 discuss God granting abundance and excess blessings to the Israelites, surpassing expectations and fulfilling promises. The Midrash emphasizes the concept of four keys held by the Holy One, not given to humans, and highlights instances where they were delivered to righteous individuals. Bartenura explains the permission to make a cavity under the public domain for bringing First Fruits, while Targum Jonathan emphasizes the blessings of offspring, animals, and produce on the promised land. 

|יִפְתַּ֣ח יְהֹוָ֣ה ׀ לְ֠ךָ֠ אֶת־אוֹצָר֨וֹ הַטּ֜וֹב אֶת־הַשָּׁמַ֗יִם לָתֵ֤ת מְטַֽר־אַרְצְךָ֙ בְּעִתּ֔וֹ וּלְבָרֵ֕ךְ אֵ֖ת כׇּל־מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יָדֶ֑ךָ וְהִלְוִ֙יתָ֙ גּוֹיִ֣ם רַבִּ֔ים וְאַתָּ֖ה לֹ֥א תִלְוֶֽה׃|12|יהוה will open for you that bounteous store, the heavens, to provide rain for your land in season and to bless all your undertakings. You will be creditor to many nations, but debtor to none.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses serving the Lord with reverence and awe to receive hidden pleasures in the afterlife, observing the Sabbath actively and passively for rewards, and the importance of Torah insights for creating blessings. Rain is considered a treasure crucial for survival, symbolizing wealth and blessings for prosperity. God's acts of kindness, such as providing rain and livelihood, are out of His kindness rather than due to the righteousness of His creations. Many passages in the prophets are figurative, and blessings after meals express gratitude for sustenance provided through food and Torah. The prayer asks for mercy, the removal of barriers, sealing in the book of life, sweetening restrictions, and forgiveness of sins. Rabbi Yoḥanan asserts God controls rainfall and birthing, while the Talmud describes storehouses for snow, hail, and harmful elements with doors made of fire. Adonoy will open the sky to give rain on time and bless all endeavors, eliminating the need for borrowing. Blessings come from the heavenly storehouse of good, as indicated by looking down from the heavens and opening the storehouse of good. 

|וּנְתָֽנְךָ֨ יְהֹוָ֤ה לְרֹאשׁ֙ וְלֹ֣א לְזָנָ֔ב וְהָיִ֙יתָ֙ רַ֣ק לְמַ֔עְלָה וְלֹ֥א תִהְיֶ֖ה לְמָ֑טָּה כִּֽי־תִשְׁמַ֞ע אֶל־מִצְוֺ֣ת ׀ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָנֹכִ֧י מְצַוְּךָ֛ הַיּ֖וֹם לִשְׁמֹ֥ר וְלַעֲשֽׂוֹת׃|13|יהוה will make you the head, not the tail; you will always be at the top and never at the bottom—if only you obey and faithfully observe the commandments of your God יהוה that I enjoin upon you this day,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the hierarchy of abstract thought, speech, and action, emphasizing the importance of striving for the highest level of understanding and connection to God to prevent being relegated to a lower spiritual position. It highlights that Israel will be above all nations by observing God's commandments and not turning to idols, with disobedience leading to being lower than others. The concept of "above" and "below" in holiness is connected to levels of holiness and greatness, with G-d's greatness surpassing any holiness we can attain. The ultimate perfection of the world is debated by Maimonides and Nachmanides, with Nachmanides believing it will include both body and soul. The importance of maintaining faith and obedience to God's commandments to remain elevated is emphasized throughout various commentaries and texts. 

|וְלֹ֣א תָס֗וּר מִכׇּל־הַדְּבָרִים֙ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָנֹכִ֜י מְצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶ֛ם הַיּ֖וֹם יָמִ֣ין וּשְׂמֹ֑אול לָלֶ֗כֶת אַחֲרֵ֛י אֱלֹהִ֥ים אֲחֵרִ֖ים לְעׇבְדָֽם׃|14|and do not deviate to the right or to the left from any of the commandments that I enjoin upon you this day and turn to the worship of other gods.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban stresses the importance of not straying from God's commandments to receive blessings, while Sforno and Tur HaArokh warn against introducing changes or contemplating idolatrous actions. The Oral Torah traditions, including the hue of techelet, must be followed as received from Moshe at Sinai. The Second Temple text equates the royal road with the word of God, emphasizing the importance of following it without deviation. The curse on the Jewish people in Deuteronomy is represented by specific Hebrew letters, and both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize the importance of not worshiping idols of other nations. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה אִם־לֹ֤א תִשְׁמַע֙ בְּקוֹל֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ לִשְׁמֹ֤ר לַעֲשׂוֹת֙ אֶת־כׇּל־מִצְוֺתָ֣יו וְחֻקֹּתָ֔יו אֲשֶׁ֛ר אָנֹכִ֥י מְצַוְּךָ֖ הַיּ֑וֹם וּבָ֧אוּ עָלֶ֛יךָ כׇּל־הַקְּלָל֥וֹת הָאֵ֖לֶּה וְהִשִּׂיגֽוּךָ׃|15|But if you do not obey your God יהוה to observe faithfully all the commandments and laws which I enjoin upon you this day, all these curses shall come upon you and take effect:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Failure to fulfill all aspects of Judaism will lead to escalating curses and punishments, threatening the decline of the Jewish people as a holy nation. The Holocaust caused a crisis of faith, challenging traditional beliefs in punishment and atonement. Balaam's attempt to curse Israel failed, highlighting their unique status as God's chosen people. The importance of heeding God's commandments and listening willingly is emphasized in the Bible. The curses on Israel are represented by the twenty-two letters of the alphabet, and are conditional based on obedience to God's laws. 

|אָר֥וּר אַתָּ֖ה בָּעִ֑יר וְאָר֥וּר אַתָּ֖ה בַּשָּׂדֶֽה׃|16|Cursed shall you be in the city and cursed shall you be in the country.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The curse in Deuteronomy 28:16 signifies a loss of valuable and essential things, with R. Elazar explaining that different elements mentioned in the verse represent Torah, holidays, circumcision, and Tephilin. Rabbeinu Bahya stresses the importance of joy in serving God, with Levites between 30-50 years old commanded to offer songs and hymns. The Midrash BeChiddush on Pesach Haggadah discusses the tragic consequences for pregnant women during the Ten Plagues, while Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret the curse in Deuteronomy 28:16 as affecting both urban and rural areas. 

|אָר֥וּר טַנְאֲךָ֖ וּמִשְׁאַרְתֶּֽךָ׃|17|Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading bowl.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra interprets "their leftovers" in Exodus 12:34 as wooden bowls for kneading dough, questioning why the Israelites carried them instead of placing them on donkeys with lighter garments. The Targum translation of Deuteronomy 28:17 states that both the fruit basket and solid foods of the people will be cursed. 

|אָר֥וּר פְּרִֽי־בִטְנְךָ֖ וּפְרִ֣י אַדְמָתֶ֑ךָ שְׁגַ֥ר אֲלָפֶ֖יךָ וְעַשְׁתְּרֹ֥ת צֹאנֶֽךָ׃|18|Cursed shall be your issue from the womb and your produce from the soil, the calving of your herd and the lambing of your flock.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban explains the order of blessings and curses, with the fruit of the body mentioned first in blessings and delayed in curses as punishment. Liturgy connects Deuteronomy 28:18,19 to the words "for fame, for glory, and for praise" and discusses the discrepancy between "Preserve" and "Remember" in the fourth commandment. The Targum mentions that disobedience will result in cursed offspring, crops, cattle, and flocks. 

|אָר֥וּר אַתָּ֖ה בְּבֹאֶ֑ךָ וְאָר֥וּר אַתָּ֖ה בְּצֵאתֶֽךָ׃|19|Cursed shall you be in your comings and cursed shall you be in your goings.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rav Hirsch and Steinsaltz interpret Deuteronomy 28:19 as a continuation of verse 6, stating that people are cursed both upon arrival and departure. The Halakhah emphasizes the importance of not forgetting the wicked deeds of Amalek, commanding to destroy their memory while maintaining hatred towards them. The Midrash BeChiddush on Pesach Haggadah explains how God hardened Pharaoh's heart, leading to the chaos of pursuit and the downfall of the Egyptians. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that one is cursed upon arrival and departure, as well as when entering places of entertainment and leaving to attend to worldly matters. 

|יְשַׁלַּ֣ח יְהֹוָ֣ה ׀ בְּ֠ךָ֠ אֶת־הַמְּאֵרָ֤ה אֶת־הַמְּהוּמָה֙ וְאֶת־הַמִּגְעֶ֔רֶת בְּכׇל־מִשְׁלַ֥ח יָדְךָ֖ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תַּעֲשֶׂ֑ה עַ֣ד הִשָּׁמֶדְךָ֤ וְעַד־אֲבׇדְךָ֙ מַהֵ֔ר מִפְּנֵ֛י רֹ֥עַ מַֽעֲלָלֶ֖יךָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר עֲזַבְתָּֽנִי׃|20|יהוה will let loose against you calamity, panic, and frustration in all the enterprises you undertake, so that you shall soon be utterly wiped out because of your evildoing in forsaking Me.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The term "המארה" refers to paucity, "המהומה" is a terrifying sound, a curse signifies diminution, discomfiture refers to inability to finish tasks, rebuke means inability to enjoy work, and curses, confusion, panic, and disorder will befall individuals due to wicked deeds. God can bring blight and curses as punishment for disobedience in various aspects of life. Humility is essential, imperfections prevent arrogance, and can come from nature, family, events, or deeds. Rashbam and Ibn Ezra connect curses and confusion to afflictions, Or HaChaim discusses destructive forces, Ramban links commands to promises, and Midrash BeChiddush emphasizes the severity of plagues. Adonoy will bring ruin, panic, and frustration in all endeavors until destruction due to forsaking worship. 

|יַדְבֵּ֧ק יְהֹוָ֛ה בְּךָ֖ אֶת־הַדָּ֑בֶר עַ֚ד כַּלֹּת֣וֹ אֹֽתְךָ֔ מֵעַל֙ הָאֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה בָא־שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|21|יהוה will make pestilence cling to you, until putting an end to you in the land that you are entering to possess.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The curses in Deuteronomy 28:21:1-5 are consequences of sin and spiritual corruption, affecting individuals and their descendants for generations, serving as a warning against straying from God's path. Rebbi Levi in the Talmud compares the epidemic to a contagious disease, with fasting rules varying based on the size of the town and number of victims. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret the passage as God bringing a plague upon the people, leading to their extermination from the land. 

|יַכְּכָ֣ה יְ֠הֹוָ֠ה בַּשַּׁחֶ֨פֶת וּבַקַּדַּ֜חַת וּבַדַּלֶּ֗קֶת וּבַֽחַרְחֻר֙ וּבַחֶ֔רֶב וּבַשִּׁדָּפ֖וֹן וּבַיֵּרָק֑וֹן וּרְדָפ֖וּךָ עַ֥ד אׇבְדֶֽךָ׃|22|יהוה will strike you with consumption, fever, and inflammation,  with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew; they shall hound you until you perish.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Siftei Chakhamim, and Chizkuni provide interpretations of specific diseases mentioned in Deuteronomy 28:22. In cases of agricultural afflictions or epidemics, fasting and sounding trumpets are called for, while dry itch only requires crying out to God. The Mishnah discusses liability for false oaths and curses using names of God, with Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis differing on the specifics. The Talmud prohibits cursing with names of God and advises using euphemisms to avoid direct curses. The Targum describes various diseases and afflictions that will lead to destruction. 

|וְהָי֥וּ שָׁמֶ֛יךָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר עַל־רֹאשְׁךָ֖ נְחֹ֑שֶׁת וְהָאָ֥רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־תַּחְתֶּ֖יךָ בַּרְזֶֽל׃|23|The skies above your head shall be copper and the earth under you iron.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses described the curses in Deuteronomy 28 as milder than those in Leviticus 26, with the punishment of the sky being copper and the earth being iron symbolizing a lack of rain and unfruitfulness. The Midrash explains that having the sky as iron and the earth as brass is worse than the reverse, resulting in the loss of fruit. Various commentaries emphasize that the punishment of no rain at all is a severe consequence for sins, corresponding to the Destruction of the First and Second Temples. The Tanakh states that God will humble the Israelites by making their skies like iron and their earth like copper if they disobey His commandments, while the Targum elaborates on this punishment by describing the heavens as unyielding like copper and the earth as strong as iron in withholding rain and fruitfulness. 

|יִתֵּ֧ן יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת־מְטַ֥ר אַרְצְךָ֖ אָבָ֣ק וְעָפָ֑ר מִן־הַשָּׁמַ֙יִם֙ יֵרֵ֣ד עָלֶ֔יךָ עַ֖ד הִשָּׁמְדָֽךְ׃|24|יהוה will make the rain of your land dust, and sand shall drop on you from the sky, until you are wiped out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 28:24:1 explains that insufficient rain will lead to mud that rots vegetation, while the wind will bring dust and dirt, causing destruction. The Midrash emphasizes the importance of tithing for receiving blessings from God, with references to key figures like Abraham and Moses. Ramban suggests that the dust in Moses' hands caused boils in Egypt as a decree of God. The Talmud considers winds after rain as a curse that raises dust, while the Targum describes Adonoy bringing drought and destruction upon the land. 

|יִתֶּנְךָ֨ יְהֹוָ֥ה ׀ נִגָּף֮ לִפְנֵ֣י אֹיְבֶ֒יךָ֒ בְּדֶ֤רֶךְ אֶחָד֙ תֵּצֵ֣א אֵלָ֔יו וּבְשִׁבְעָ֥ה דְרָכִ֖ים תָּנ֣וּס לְפָנָ֑יו וְהָיִ֣יתָ לְזַֽעֲוָ֔ה לְכֹ֖ל מַמְלְכ֥וֹת הָאָֽרֶץ׃|25|יהוה will put you to rout before your enemies; you shall march out against them by a single road, but flee from them by many  roads; and you shall become a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The afflictions of the Israelites will cause fear and trembling among others, with the suffering being so intense that it will shock all nations. Ibn Ezra and Ramban provide interpretations of specific phrases in biblical texts, while Midrash BeChiddush and Abarbanel draw parallels between historical events and biblical stories. Adonoy will cause the Israelites to be defeated by their enemies, becoming a source of fear for all nations. 

|וְהָיְתָ֤ה נִבְלָֽתְךָ֙ לְמַֽאֲכָ֔ל לְכׇל־ע֥וֹף הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וּלְבֶהֱמַ֣ת הָאָ֑רֶץ וְאֵ֖ין מַחֲרִֽיד׃|26|Your carcasses shall become food for all the birds of the sky and all the beasts of the earth, with none to frighten them off.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse in Deuteronomy 28:26 depicts a scenario where the bodies of the disobedient will be left unburied, allowing birds and beasts to feed on them without interference, as explained in various commentaries and Targums. 

|יַכְּכָ֨ה יְהֹוָ֜ה בִּשְׁחִ֤ין מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ וּבַגָּרָ֖ב וּבֶחָ֑רֶס אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־תוּכַ֖ל לְהֵרָפֵֽא׃|27|יהוה will strike you with the Egyptian inflammation,  with hemorrhoids, boil-scars, and itch, from which you shall never recover.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various skin diseases and afflictions, including wet boils, dry boils, hemorrhoids, scabs, and itch, are discussed in the text as punishments from God for disobedience, with physicians unable to cure them due to their divine origin. The most perfect way to write a Torah scroll is outlined, with serious scribal errors disqualifying the scroll, such as using the wrong form of a word. Rashi provides interpretations of specific terms, while the Talmud teaches that verses with coarse language should be read in a refined manner. In the Tanakh, Moses causes boils to break out in Egypt as a punishment from God. Adonoy is said to afflict people with various incurable afflictions, including boils and scurvy. Verses in the Torah written in obscene language are to be read in refined language, according to the Tosefta. 

|יַכְּכָ֣ה יְהֹוָ֔ה בְּשִׁגָּע֖וֹן וּבְעִוָּר֑וֹן וּבְתִמְה֖וֹן לֵבָֽב׃|28|יהוה will strike you with madness, blindness, and dismay.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators interpret the phrase "clogging of the heart" in Deuteronomy 28:28 as afflictions of the mind like madness, numbness, blindness, and confusion of thoughts and emotions. In Mishnah, a wife is expected to perform various tasks for her husband, with the number of maidservants determining her responsibilities. Rashbam and other commentators discuss the meaning of specific words in different texts, such as "אבן" and "שעמום." The curse described in Deuteronomy includes suffering madness, loss of sight, and confusion of mind. Targum explains that Adonoy will afflict with insanity, blindness, and confusion in the heart. 

|וְהָיִ֜יתָ מְמַשֵּׁ֣שׁ בַּֽצׇּהֳרַ֗יִם כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר יְמַשֵּׁ֤שׁ הַֽעִוֵּר֙ בָּאֲפֵלָ֔ה וְלֹ֥א תַצְלִ֖יחַ אֶת־דְּרָכֶ֑יךָ וְהָיִ֜יתָ אַ֣ךְ עָשׁ֧וּק וְגָז֛וּל כׇּל־הַיָּמִ֖ים וְאֵ֥ין מוֹשִֽׁיעַ׃|29|You shall grope at noon as the blind grope in the dark; you shall not prosper in your ventures, but shall be constantly abused and robbed, with none to give help.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators explain that in Deuteronomy 28:29, being "wronged" means facing disputes in all actions, "groping" refers to blindness, and oppression by enemies will occur with no savior, leading to constant cheating, robbery, exploitation, and failure without any help. Isaac's failing eyesight was a deliberate act by God to prevent Esau from receiving the blessing, with Jacob ultimately obtaining it based on his own merit. The plague of darkness in Exodus 10:21 is described as tangible darkness lasting seven days, with the Israelites having light in their dwellings while the Egyptians were enveloped in darkness. The Rabbis believe that even a blind man benefits from the luminaries, as they can sense the difference between light and darkness, despite not being able to see. Targum Jonathan expands on Deuteronomy 28:29, emphasizing the lack of guidance and truth, leading to constant struggle and oppression with no deliverance in sight. 

|אִשָּׁ֣ה תְאָרֵ֗שׂ וְאִ֤ישׁ אַחֵר֙ בַּ֥יִת תִּבְנֶ֖ה וְלֹא־תֵשֵׁ֣ב בּ֑וֹ כֶּ֥רֶם תִּטַּ֖ע וְלֹ֥א תְחַלְּלֶֽנּוּ׃|30|If you [a man] pay the bride-price for a wife, another man shall enjoy her. If you build a house, you shall not live in it. If you plant a vineyard, you shall not harvest it.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi interprets "ישגלנה" as sexual intercourse, Ibn Ezra connects "תחללנו" to the flute, Mishneh Torah advises establishing an occupation, buying a house, and then marrying, Jewish Thought emphasizes the order of building a house before marriage, and the Talmud discusses using euphemisms for indelicate words. Jeremiah and Zechariah prophesy about defilement and war in Jerusalem, while Targum explains marrying a woman for another man and not enjoying a house or vineyard. The Tosefta mentions reading obscene verses in refined language, avoiding saying "amen" after leading a prayer, and giving instructions for leaders speaking to the people at the border and during war. 

|שׁוֹרְךָ֞ טָב֣וּחַ לְעֵינֶ֗יךָ וְלֹ֣א תֹאכַל֮ מִמֶּ֒נּוּ֒ חֲמֹֽרְךָ֙ גָּז֣וּל מִלְּפָנֶ֔יךָ וְלֹ֥א יָשׁ֖וּב לָ֑ךְ צֹֽאנְךָ֙ נְתֻנ֣וֹת לְאֹיְבֶ֔יךָ וְאֵ֥ין לְךָ֖ מוֹשִֽׁיעַ׃|31|Your ox shall be slaughtered before your eyes, but you shall not eat of it; your ass shall be seized in front of you, and it shall not be returned to you; your flock shall be delivered to your enemies, with none to help you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Disobedience in Deuteronomy leads to consequences such as having your ox slaughtered, donkey stolen, and flock given to enemies with no help (Steinsaltz). During Greek oppression, Jews faced decrees like no doors in houses and inscribed animals, but found ways to overcome (Midrash). Euphemisms are used in the Talmud to replace indelicate words, and interpreting dreams was seen as predicting outcomes (Talmud). Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe animals being killed or taken away with no hope of rescue in Deuteronomy (Targum). 

|בָּנֶ֨יךָ וּבְנֹתֶ֜יךָ נְתֻנִ֨ים לְעַ֤ם אַחֵר֙ וְעֵינֶ֣יךָ רֹא֔וֹת וְכָל֥וֹת אֲלֵיהֶ֖ם כׇּל־הַיּ֑וֹם וְאֵ֥ין לְאֵ֖ל יָדֶֽךָ׃|32|Your sons and daughters shall be delivered to another people, while you look on; and your eyes shall strain for them constantly, but you shall be helpless.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Steinsaltz, and Chizkuni discuss the longing and captivity of children in various contexts, while Mishnah Ketubot 4:11 states that a man must support his daughters until marriage even if it is not explicitly stated in the marriage contract. Ramban connects oaths and curses in Leviticus to the Babylonian exile and the destruction of the first Temple, while the German Commentary on Mishnah Ketubot interprets the verb "יתנסבן" as an Ithpeel of "נסב" meaning "to marry." The Talmud discusses different interpretations of children being given to another people, with Rav and Rabbi Eliezer offering differing explanations, and also delves into the consequences of cursing using divine names. Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Targum Jerusalem describe the helplessness and longing of parents whose children are taken away, and the Tosefta explores interpretations of fear and returning from battle. 

|פְּרִ֤י אַדְמָֽתְךָ֙ וְכׇל־יְגִ֣יעֲךָ֔ יֹאכַ֥ל עַ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־יָדָ֑עְתָּ וְהָיִ֗יתָ רַ֛ק עָשׁ֥וּק וְרָצ֖וּץ כׇּל־הַיָּמִֽים׃|33|A people you do not know shall eat up the produce of your soil and all your gains; you shall be abused and downtrodden continually,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Foreign nations will exploit the Israelites, leaving them with nothing and showing no mercy. Samuel was cautious in his leadership to avoid misunderstandings. The Talmud discusses sacred and secular uses of the divine name, consequences of cursing with divine attributes, and penalties for cursing with the Tetragrammaton. Targum states that foreign people will oppress the Israelites, consuming their fruit and labor. 

|וְהָיִ֖יתָ מְשֻׁגָּ֑ע מִמַּרְאֵ֥ה עֵינֶ֖יךָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר תִּרְאֶֽה׃|34|until you are driven mad by what your eyes behold.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 28:34 explains that overwhelming troubles will lead to madness and distress. In Kabbalah, valuing external nations over internal Israel will result in the nations overcoming the Jewish nation. The Egyptians, convinced of their strength, were driven mad by impending death. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that people will become insane from what they see and shaken by vengeance. 

|יַכְּכָ֨ה יְהֹוָ֜ה בִּשְׁחִ֣ין רָ֗ע עַל־הַבִּרְכַּ֙יִם֙ וְעַל־הַשֹּׁקַ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־תוּכַ֖ל לְהֵרָפֵ֑א מִכַּ֥ף רַגְלְךָ֖ וְעַ֥ד קׇדְקֳדֶֽךָ׃|35|יהוה will afflict you at the knees and thighs with a severe inflammation, from which you shall never recover—from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra notes that boils on knees and legs are difficult to heal and will afflict Israel if wounds cannot be cured by physicians. Rav Hirsch suggests that those exiled may suffer from this disease, making their situation worse. Steinsaltz summarizes that the Lord will strike with a rash from head to toe. The Mishnah Shevuot discusses liabilities for false oaths using specific names of God and cursing. Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis have differing views on punishment for cursing God or parents. Rabbi Meir holds witnesses liable for not testifying when God's name is invoked, but the Halakha does not follow this ruling. Adonoy will afflict with unhealable boils as punishment unless the law is followed. 

|יוֹלֵ֨ךְ יְהֹוָ֜ה אֹתְךָ֗ וְאֶֽת־מַלְכְּךָ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תָּקִ֣ים עָלֶ֔יךָ אֶל־גּ֕וֹי אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־יָדַ֖עְתָּ אַתָּ֣ה וַאֲבֹתֶ֑יךָ וְעָבַ֥דְתָּ שָּׁ֛ם אֱלֹהִ֥ים אֲחֵרִ֖ים עֵ֥ץ וָאָֽבֶן׃|36|יהוה will drive you, and the king you have set over you, to a nation unknown to you or your ancestors, where you shall serve other gods, of wood and stone.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary discusses the significance of the scepter not departing from Judah, indicating that the king of Israel will be from the tribe of Judah, with references to David and the Messiah. It also discusses the punishment of kings from other tribes ruling over Israel, such as the Hasmoneans, and the consequences of not following God's commandments, leading to exile and servitude to other nations. The text also delves into the warnings and prophecies given in the Torah regarding idolatry and the consequences for straying from God's path, as well as the fulfillment of these prophecies in history, such as the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of the Jewish people. King Josiah buried the Ark of the Covenant to prevent its desecration in exile, sequestering it along with other sacred items to avoid its exile to Babylon. In II Chronicles 34:21, King Josiah seeks guidance from the Lord regarding a discovered scroll, believing that the wrath of the Lord has been brought upon them due to their ancestors' failure to obey the word of the Lord. Adonoy will lead the Israelites and their king into exile to a nation they did not know, where they will serve other nations that worship idols of wood and stone. After the Ark was hidden away by King Josiah, its vessels were also hidden to prevent them from being taken to Babylonia, with differing opinions on the whereabouts of the Ark among rabbis. 

|וְהָיִ֣יתָ לְשַׁמָּ֔ה לְמָשָׁ֖ל וְלִשְׁנִינָ֑ה בְּכֹל֙ הָֽעַמִּ֔ים אֲשֶׁר־יְנַהֶגְךָ֥ יְהֹוָ֖ה שָֽׁמָּה׃|37|You shall be a consternation, a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples to which יהוה will drive you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites will become objects of astonishment, proverbs, and bywords among all the peoples they are driven to as a punishment for their sins, while the foreigner among them will be spared. Those who worship idols will also face similar consequences when scattered among the Gentiles. 

|זֶ֥רַע רַ֖ב תּוֹצִ֣יא הַשָּׂדֶ֑ה וּמְעַ֣ט תֶּאֱסֹ֔ף כִּ֥י יַחְסְלֶ֖נּוּ הָאַרְבֶּֽה׃|38|Though you take much seed out to the field, you shall gather in little, for the locust shall consume it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The locust is known for its ability to consume all vegetation in the field, earning it the nickname "the demolisher" or "grasshoppered." Locusts are specifically destructive to trees and fruit, contrasting with hail which affects a wider range of targets. Ramban explains that pollution in Numbers 35:33 refers to the Land becoming barren due to sin, while defilement means the Glory of God will leave if innocent blood is shed. In Deuteronomy 28:42, Ramban interprets "tz'latzal" as a hostile army, warning of captivity and destruction if idolatry continues. Targum translations of Deuteronomy 28:38 all mention that despite sowing much seed, little will be gathered due to locusts destroying the crops. 

|כְּרָמִ֥ים תִּטַּ֖ע וְעָבָ֑דְתָּ וְיַ֤יִן לֹֽא־תִשְׁתֶּה֙ וְלֹ֣א תֶאֱגֹ֔ר כִּ֥י תֹאכְלֶ֖נּוּ הַתֹּלָֽעַת׃|39|Though you plant vineyards and till them, you shall have no wine to drink or store, for the worm shall devour them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that despite planting vineyards, one will not enjoy the wine due to worms; The Sabbath Epistle discusses the beginning of days and the return of God; Certain actions by women can stop hail from falling, considered witchcraft; Ramban interprets "tz’latzal" as a hostile army in Deuteronomy 28:42; The Gemara discusses a judge not keeping his ruling to himself; Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that worms will consume wine despite planting vineyards. 

|זֵיתִ֛ים יִהְי֥וּ לְךָ֖ בְּכׇל־גְּבוּלֶ֑ךָ וְשֶׁ֙מֶן֙ לֹ֣א תָס֔וּךְ כִּ֥י יִשַּׁ֖ל זֵיתֶֽךָ׃|40|Though you have olive trees throughout your territory, you shall have no oil for anointment, for your olives shall drop off.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators interpret the verb "ישל" in Deuteronomy 28:40 as meaning "discard" or "drop off" in relation to olive trees losing their fruits, with Steinsaltz summarizing that the Israelites will not benefit from their olive trees. The Shulchan Arukh outlines specific rules for handling fruits on holidays. In Midrash, Torah is compared to oil, symbolizing the bitterness and sweetness of study, while the Talmud discusses the meaning of "getting lost" and interprets verses about olives falling off as symbolic of events before the Messiah's coming. Targum translations convey that olive trees will be plentiful but produce no oil in Deuteronomy 28:40. 

|בָּנִ֥ים וּבָנ֖וֹת תּוֹלִ֑יד וְלֹא־יִהְי֣וּ לָ֔ךְ כִּ֥י יֵלְכ֖וּ בַּשֶּֽׁבִי׃|41|Though you beget sons and daughters, they shall not remain with you, for they shall go into captivity.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Children born to the Israelites will be taken into captivity as a result of their disobedience to God's commandments, with Ramban interpreting the term "tz'latzal" as a hostile army in Deuteronomy 28:42. Historical events such as the Roman conquest of Jerusalem are linked to these warnings, emphasizing the consequences of idolatry. In a dream, Rava and Abaye receive different interpretations of a verse from Deuteronomy, with Abaye being told his children will marry outsiders, making it seem as if they were taken into captivity. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain that despite bearing sons and daughters, the Israelites will not benefit from them as they will go into captivity. 

|כׇּל־עֵצְךָ֖ וּפְרִ֣י אַדְמָתֶ֑ךָ יְיָרֵ֖שׁ הַצְּלָצַֽל׃|42|The cricket shall take over all the trees and produce of your land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban interprets "tz'latzal" in Deuteronomy 28:42 as a hostile army, warning against idolatry leading to exile. Locusts specifically target fruit trees, unlike hail which affects animals and people. Mishnah Bava Kamma 10:5 discusses compensation for stolen fields due to regional disasters. The moon's request in Deuteronomy 28:43 reflects the concept of rising and sinking. Rashi emphasizes the importance of joy and thanksgiving in serving God in the Promised Land. The Talmud defines "massikin" as those who consume others' property, while various Targums interpret the destruction of trees and fruit differently. 

|הַגֵּר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּקִרְבְּךָ֔ יַעֲלֶ֥ה עָלֶ֖יךָ מַ֣עְלָה מָּ֑עְלָה וְאַתָּ֥ה תֵרֵ֖ד מַ֥טָּה מָּֽטָּה׃|43|The strangers in your midst shall rise above you higher and higher, while you sink lower and lower:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that "higher and higher" indicates a height over which no one else towers and may also indicate permanency, while "lower and lower" means very low. Steinsaltz summarizes that the stranger living among the Israelites will rise higher and higher while they will fall lower and lower. The Hebrew terms 'alah' and 'yarad' are used to indicate ascending and descending, as well as greatness and power, as seen in biblical references. If a Jewish person values the external, the "nations of the world" within them over the "Israel" within them, it will lead to the nations of the world overcoming and lowering the Jewish nation, causing their descent. The Midrash discusses the importance of giving thanks to God in times of distress and exile, and how following God's will leads to elevation while not doing so results in being brought low. Non-Jews living among the Israelites will experience increasing success and prosperity, while the Israelites themselves will face a decline in their fortunes. 

|ה֣וּא יַלְוְךָ֔ וְאַתָּ֖ה לֹ֣א תַלְוֶ֑נּוּ ה֚וּא יִהְיֶ֣ה לְרֹ֔אשׁ וְאַתָּ֖ה תִּֽהְיֶ֥ה לְזָנָֽב׃|44|they shall be your creditors, but you shall not be theirs; they shall be the head and you the tail.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 28:44, commentators Ibn Ezra, Steinsaltz, and Chizkuni all reference Proverbs 22:7 to explain the power dynamic between borrowers and lenders, emphasizing the servitude of the borrower. The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan also highlight the imbalance of power between the lender and borrower in this verse. 

|וּבָ֨אוּ עָלֶ֜יךָ כׇּל־הַקְּלָל֣וֹת הָאֵ֗לֶּה וּרְדָפ֙וּךָ֙ וְהִשִּׂיג֔וּךָ עַ֖ד הִשָּׁמְדָ֑ךְ כִּי־לֹ֣א שָׁמַ֗עְתָּ בְּקוֹל֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ לִשְׁמֹ֛ר מִצְוֺתָ֥יו וְחֻקֹּתָ֖יו אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוָּֽךְ׃|45|All these curses shall befall you; they shall pursue you and overtake you, until you are wiped out, because you did not heed your God יהוה and keep the commandments and laws that were enjoined upon you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The curses in Deuteronomy 28:45 will pursue the people of Israel until their destruction for not obeying God's commandments. Failure to remember God in times of prosperity may lead to punishment in order to recognize the need for Him, preventing a cycle of punishment and repentance. 

|וְהָי֣וּ בְךָ֔ לְא֖וֹת וּלְמוֹפֵ֑ת וּֽבְזַרְעֲךָ֖ עַד־עוֹלָֽם׃|46|They shall serve as signs and proofs against you and your offspring for all time.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The troubles and plagues will be a sign of rebellion against God for the current generation and their descendants, serving as a reminder of their sins and leading to exile and punishment. In the month of Nisan, the Temple Assembly must observe signs of the month appointed by God for signs and wonders. Ramban explains that Laban establishes a covenant with Jacob using a physical object as a witness. The curses will serve as signs and wonders for the people and their descendants forever. 

|תַּ֗חַת אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹא־עָבַ֙דְתָּ֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ בְּשִׂמְחָ֖ה וּבְט֣וּב לֵבָ֑ב מֵרֹ֖ב כֹּֽל׃|47|Because you would not serve your God יהוה in joy and gladness over the abundance of everything,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes serving God with joy to redeem the soul from evil forces, rejecting sadness and highlighting the importance of continuous joy in seeking God. Various commentaries stress the consequences of not serving God joyfully, with rewards and punishments tied to fulfilling positive commandments and the need for joy in discipline. The text underlines the importance of rejoicing in God's service during festivals, Torah study at night, and the significance of fear of God in acquiring wisdom. Divine service should be performed with joy and gladness, distinct but interconnected concepts that can exist independently, while serving God with joy increases one's desire and love for adhering to Him. The consequences of not serving God with joy and gladness are evident in the suffering and hardships endured by the Israelites. Various sources highlight the importance of serving God with joy, establishing a meal for the joy of the commandment, and the eternal joy found in serving God. Rabbi Hananya emphasizes the importance of taking words of Torah to heart to alleviate troubling thoughts, with the requirement to accompany Temple offerings with song derived from serving God with joyfulness and goodness of heart. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize that not serving God joyfully leads to lack of affluence, while serving God cheerfully and with a right heart leads to an abundance of good things. 

|וְעָבַדְתָּ֣ אֶת־אֹיְבֶ֗יךָ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְשַׁלְּחֶ֤נּוּ יְהֹוָה֙ בָּ֔ךְ בְּרָעָ֧ב וּבְצָמָ֛א וּבְעֵירֹ֖ם וּבְחֹ֣סֶר כֹּ֑ל וְנָתַ֞ן עֹ֤ל בַּרְזֶל֙ עַל־צַוָּארֶ֔ךָ עַ֥ד הִשְׁמִיד֖וֹ אֹתָֽךְ׃|48|you shall have to serve—in hunger and thirst, naked and lacking everything—the enemies whom יהוה will let loose against you. [God] will put an iron yoke upon your neck until you are wiped out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The punishment of serving enemies in deprivation is a consequence for Israelites not serving the Lord, emphasized in Mishneh Torah's importance of studying Torah at night for wisdom and blessings, while Midrash discusses the relationship between God's will, work, and Torah study. Ramban connects Deuteronomy 28:42 to Israel's captivity, Talmud highlights the joy of Torah study and consequences of neglect, and Targum warns of serving enemies in deprivation until destruction. 

|יִשָּׂ֣א יְהֹוָה֩ עָלֶ֨יךָ גּ֤וֹי מֵרָחֹק֙ מִקְצֵ֣ה הָאָ֔רֶץ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר יִדְאֶ֖ה הַנָּ֑שֶׁר גּ֕וֹי אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־תִשְׁמַ֖ע לְשֹׁנֽוֹ׃|49|יהוה will bring a nation against you from afar, from the end of the earth, which will swoop down like the eagle—a nation whose language you do not understand,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the arrival of the Roman Emperor Vespasianus and his son Titus leading to the destruction of the Second Temple by the Roman Empire. Observant Jewish individuals fulfill divine laws and believe in constant observation by God. The Liturgy text emphasizes following God's commandments and staying true to one's heritage. Affliction can be a sign of God's love or a consequence of neglecting Torah study according to Midrash. The repair work of the world will restore humanity to its original state, with Torah study being essential. The Talmud mentions historical events of persecution, and the Tanakh describes a distant nation with an unintelligible language symbolized by an eagle. The Targum references a foreign nation coming swiftly like an eagle with an unknown language. 

|גּ֖וֹי עַ֣ז פָּנִ֑ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹא־יִשָּׂ֤א פָנִים֙ לְזָקֵ֔ן וְנַ֖עַר לֹ֥א יָחֹֽן׃|50|a ruthless nation, that will show the influential  no regard and the vulnerable  no mercy.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The nation in Deuteronomy 28:50 is identified as the Roman Empire by Chizkuni, characterized as brazen and lacking compassion. Duties towards oneself, others, and God are outlined by the prophet Michah, with vows viewed negatively by sages. Cruelty is the opposite of mercy and leads to punishment, while holding socially and spiritually eminent individuals accountable is emphasized. The Targum commentaries on Deuteronomy 28:50 also describe a nation that is harsh and lacks compassion, showing no respect for the elderly and no mercy towards the young. 

|וְ֠אָכַ֠ל פְּרִ֨י בְהֶמְתְּךָ֥ וּפְרִֽי־אַדְמָתְךָ֮ עַ֣ד הִשָּׁמְדָךְ֒ אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹא־יַשְׁאִ֜יר לְךָ֗ דָּגָן֙ תִּיר֣וֹשׁ וְיִצְהָ֔ר שְׁגַ֥ר אֲלָפֶ֖יךָ וְעַשְׁתְּרֹ֣ת צֹאנֶ֑ךָ עַ֥ד הַאֲבִיד֖וֹ אֹתָֽךְ׃|51|It shall devour the offspring of your cattle and the produce of your soil, until you have been wiped out, leaving you nothing of new grain, wine, or oil, of the calving of your herds and the lambing of your flocks, until it has brought you to ruin.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Steinsaltz explains that the enemy will exploit the land and animals, leading to the destruction of the people. The chastisements mentioned in the Torah were meant to terrify the people of Israel, with some names of the chastisements experienced in Egypt being slightly changed. Both Targums on Deuteronomy 28:51 state that the enemies will consume the produce of the land and animals until the people are destroyed, leaving them with nothing. 

|וְהֵצַ֨ר לְךָ֜ בְּכׇל־שְׁעָרֶ֗יךָ עַ֣ד רֶ֤דֶת חֹמֹתֶ֙יךָ֙ הַגְּבֹהֹ֣ת וְהַבְּצֻר֔וֹת אֲשֶׁ֥ר אַתָּ֛ה בֹּטֵ֥חַ בָּהֵ֖ן בְּכׇל־אַרְצֶ֑ךָ וְהֵצַ֤ר לְךָ֙ בְּכׇל־שְׁעָרֶ֔יךָ בְּכׇ֨ל־אַרְצְךָ֔ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֛ן יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לָֽךְ׃|52|It shall shut you up in all your towns throughout your land until every mighty, towering wall in which you trust has come down. And when you are shut up in all your towns throughout your land that your God יהוה has assigned to you,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains "רדת" as subjugation, Rabbeinu Bahya sees frustration in Jewish movements, Siftei Chakhamim discusses "רדת" as mastering, Rav Hirsch blames weak fortifications and lack of divine protection for enemy success, Steinsaltz describes enemy breaching fortified walls. Midrash warns against idol worship, adultery, and negative influences of wine, referencing biblical figures for consequences of actions. Quoting Commentary clarifies meanings of specific words in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Targum predicts suffering in cities, with enemies capturing relied-upon fortifications [Onkelos Deuteronomy 28:52; Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 28:52]. 

|וְאָכַלְתָּ֣ פְרִֽי־בִטְנְךָ֗ בְּשַׂ֤ר בָּנֶ֙יךָ֙ וּבְנֹתֶ֔יךָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַן־לְךָ֖ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ בְּמָצוֹר֙ וּבְמָצ֔וֹק אֲשֶׁר־יָצִ֥יק לְךָ֖ אֹיְבֶֽךָ׃|53|you shall eat your own issue, the flesh of your sons and daughters that your God יהוה has assigned to you, because of the desperate straits to which your enemy shall reduce you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

During a siege, extreme famine will lead people to resort to cannibalism out of desperation, as foretold in Deuteronomy 28:53. David's righteousness is everlasting, bringing comfort and troubles that lead to righteousness forever for Israel. The Talmud explains that both "massikin" and "matzikin" refer to thugs causing distress, supported by a verse from Deuteronomy mentioning distress caused by enemies as "matzok." The Targum describes a horrifying scenario where people will eat their own children due to famine and oppression during a siege. 

|הָאִישׁ֙ הָרַ֣ךְ בְּךָ֔ וְהֶעָנֹ֖ג מְאֹ֑ד תֵּרַ֨ע עֵינ֤וֹ בְאָחִיו֙ וּבְאֵ֣שֶׁת חֵיק֔וֹ וּבְיֶ֥תֶר בָּנָ֖יו אֲשֶׁ֥ר יוֹתִֽיר׃|54|The householder  who is most tender and fastidious among you shall be too mean to his brother and the wife of his bosom and the children he has spared|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that the person in Deuteronomy 28:54 will become cruel due to hunger, not sharing the flesh of his children with his remaining children. Ibn Ezra suggests that "whom he hath remaining" refers to the enemy or those hidden, all due to the siege. Siftei Chakhamim clarifies that the person will be stingy towards his brother and wife, not himself. Steinsaltz emphasizes the selfishness of the man towards his family due to extreme famine, while Chizkuni also mentions the enemy or those in hiding as the ones remaining. Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Targum Jerusalem all describe how even the most delicate and refined individuals will look upon their family members with disdain and evil eyes, including their own brothers, wives, and children who are left behind. 

|מִתֵּ֣ת ׀ לְאַחַ֣ד מֵהֶ֗ם מִבְּשַׂ֤ר בָּנָיו֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֹאכֵ֔ל מִבְּלִ֥י הִשְׁאִֽיר־ל֖וֹ כֹּ֑ל בְּמָצוֹר֙ וּבְמָצ֔וֹק אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָצִ֥יק לְךָ֛ אֹיִבְךָ֖ בְּכׇל־שְׁעָרֶֽיךָ׃|55|to share with any of them the flesh of the children that he eats, because he has nothing else left as a result of the desperate straits to which your enemy shall reduce you in all your towns.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra interprets "in all thy gates" in Deuteronomy 28:55 as meaning in any place in the country. Steinsaltz describes extreme desperation during a siege where people resort to consuming their own children's flesh due to intense hunger, leading to a loss of humanity within the city gates. Martha, a wealthy woman in Jerusalem, died from infection after failing to find food, fulfilling a prophecy by throwing her gold and silver in the streets. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai notes the unique mention of a tender and delicate woman in Deuteronomy, highlighting the significance of women in that context. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explains that both "massikin" and "matzikin" can refer to thugs in the mishna, with the term "matzikin" supported by a verse from Deuteronomy. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Deuteronomy 28:55 as describing a situation where individuals are so besieged by enemies that they are forced to eat their own children out of desperation. 

|הָרַכָּ֨ה בְךָ֜ וְהָעֲנֻגָּ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא־נִסְּתָ֤ה כַף־רַגְלָהּ֙ הַצֵּ֣ג עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ מֵהִתְעַנֵּ֖ג וּמֵרֹ֑ךְ תֵּרַ֤ע עֵינָהּ֙ בְּאִ֣ישׁ חֵיקָ֔הּ וּבִבְנָ֖הּ וּבְבִתָּֽהּ׃|56|And she who is most tender and dainty among you, so tender and dainty that she would never venture to set a foot on the ground, shall begrudge the husband of her bosom, and her son and her daughter,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 28:56, Rashi and Rashbam explain that during times of hardship, women will be selfish towards their family members, not sharing food even with their own children. Martha and Miriam, two women from the Midrash, suffered greatly due to their wealth and delicate nature, fulfilling biblical prophecies. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai and Talmudic texts discuss the complexities of giving money and making decisions, while Targum translations emphasize the consequences of indulgence and selfishness. 

|וּֽבְשִׁלְיָתָ֞הּ הַיּוֹצֵ֣ת ׀ מִבֵּ֣ין רַגְלֶ֗יהָ וּבְבָנֶ֙יהָ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תֵּלֵ֔ד כִּֽי־תֹאכְלֵ֥ם בְּחֹסֶר־כֹּ֖ל בַּסָּ֑תֶר בְּמָצוֹר֙ וּבְמָצ֔וֹק אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָצִ֥יק לְךָ֛ אֹיִבְךָ֖ בִּשְׁעָרֶֽיךָ׃|57|the afterbirth that issues from between her legs and the babies she bears; she shall eat them secretly, because of utter want, in the desperate straits to which your enemy shall reduce you in your towns.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 28:57 discusses the extreme distress that may lead a mother to cannibalism, the Jewish Thought discusses the future of Jacob's sons, the Midrash emphasizes the importance of knowledge and righteousness, the Quoting Commentary explains the hereditary nature of Yehudah's descendants as kings, the Talmud discusses the validity of ḥalitza in certain cases, and the Targum describes a situation where a woman may resort to eating her own children during a siege. 

|אִם־לֹ֨א תִשְׁמֹ֜ר לַעֲשׂ֗וֹת אֶת־כׇּל־דִּבְרֵי֙ הַתּוֹרָ֣ה הַזֹּ֔את הַכְּתֻבִ֖ים בַּסֵּ֣פֶר הַזֶּ֑ה לְ֠יִרְאָ֠ה אֶת־הַשֵּׁ֞ם הַנִּכְבָּ֤ד וְהַנּוֹרָא֙ הַזֶּ֔ה אֵ֖ת יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|58|If you fail to observe faithfully all the terms of this Teaching that are written in this book, to reverence this honored and awesome Name, your God יהוה,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teaches that fear in the heart is connected to the glorious name of God, emphasizing the intertwining of fear and knowledge in understanding His exaltedness. Halakhah details the process of lashing and the prohibition of mentioning God's names in vain, while Jewish Thought highlights the importance of fearing God and obedience. Midrash discusses the prophecy of the Torah being forgotten and the significance of Torah traditions. Musar stresses the need to fear God's exaltedness and avoid rushing through prayers, with various commentaries emphasizing the severity of punishment for such conduct. The Talmud explores the connection between those liable for execution and receiving lashes, as well as the importance of observing the law during flogging. Targum emphasizes following all Torah commands to show reverence and fear towards God's name. 

|וְהִפְלָ֤א יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־מַכֹּ֣תְךָ֔ וְאֵ֖ת מַכּ֣וֹת זַרְעֶ֑ךָ מַכּ֤וֹת גְּדֹלֹת֙ וְנֶ֣אֱמָנ֔וֹת וׇחֳלָיִ֖ם רָעִ֥ים וְנֶאֱמָנִֽים׃|59|יהוה will inflict extraordinary plagues upon you and your offspring, strange and lasting plagues, malignant and chronic diseases—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that astounding afflictions result from a loss of faith, leading to illnesses that cannot be cured by medicine, prayer, or ancestral merit. Halakhah outlines the criteria for a maidservant to be liable for lashes and the sins requiring a guilt-offering sacrifice. Jewish Thought explores the concept of ne'eman in relationships with God and humans. Liturgy praises God's compassion, miracles, and wonders, emphasizing gratitude and the inadequacy of human actions to thank Him. Midrash discusses the future of the Torah being forgotten and the concept of God's jealousy. Mishnah details the recitation of verses during flogging and exemptions from further lashes. Musar prohibits cursing with God's name and emphasizes the role of doctors in healing. Quoting Commentary offers insights on blessings for following commandments, divine healing, and the punishment for a maidservant. Talmud describes the process of flogging, liability of the beadle, and the destiny of the Torah being forgotten. Targum depicts Adonoy inflicting severe and enduring plagues and illnesses. 

|וְהֵשִׁ֣יב בְּךָ֗ אֵ֚ת כׇּל־מַדְוֵ֣ה מִצְרַ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָגֹ֖רְתָּ מִפְּנֵיהֶ֑ם וְדָבְק֖וּ בָּֽךְ׃|60|bringing back upon you all the sicknesses of Egypt that you dreaded so, and they shall cling to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites endured the plagues in Egypt for refinement and to sever ties with the Egyptians, with fear of the plagues meant to refine their hearts and straighten out deficiencies. Rashi explains that the Israelites feared the plagues, not Egypt itself, with the afflictions of Egypt eventually returning to them. The promise of protection from diseases is contingent on obedience to God's commandments, with disobedience potentially leading to afflictions similar to those in Egypt. In Deuteronomy, it is mentioned that God will bring back the Egyptian diseases that the Israelites feared, clinging to them. 

|גַּ֤ם כׇּל־חֳלִי֙ וְכׇל־מַכָּ֔ה אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹ֣א כָת֔וּב בְּסֵ֖פֶר הַתּוֹרָ֣ה הַזֹּ֑את יַעְלֵ֤ם יְהֹוָה֙ עָלֶ֔יךָ עַ֖ד הִשָּׁמְדָֽךְ׃|61|Moreover, יהוה will bring upon you all the other diseases and plagues that are not mentioned in this book of Teaching, until you are wiped out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that the death of Torah sages can bring punishment to those who do not heed their words, leading to an incurable illness and death. The Midrash discusses the discovery of Philacteries on the heads of those killed in Byther and the mistreatment of Israelite youth by Roman nobles, connecting disobedience to afflictions and diseases. The Talmud recounts a story of two children seeking to understand a form of punishment not explicitly written in the Torah, highlighting the importance of studying and seeking knowledge. The Targum mentions that illnesses and plagues not mentioned in the Torah will be brought upon the people by the Word of the Lord until they are destroyed. 

|וְנִשְׁאַרְתֶּם֙ בִּמְתֵ֣י מְעָ֔ט תַּ֚חַת אֲשֶׁ֣ר הֱיִיתֶ֔ם כְּכוֹכְבֵ֥י הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם לָרֹ֑ב כִּֽי־לֹ֣א שָׁמַ֔עְתָּ בְּק֖וֹל יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|62|You shall be left a scant few, after having been as numerous as the stars in the skies, because you did not heed the command of your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 28:62 explains that the Israelites will remain few in number due to their failure to heed God's voice, rather than a lack of ability to stand against enemies. R. Joshua b. Chanina discusses God's lack of rejoicing over the downfall of the wicked, while the Targum states that the Israelites will become a small nation instead of numerous like the stars because they did not obey the word of the Lord. 

|וְ֠הָיָ֠ה כַּאֲשֶׁר־שָׂ֨שׂ יְהֹוָ֜ה עֲלֵיכֶ֗ם לְהֵיטִ֣יב אֶתְכֶם֮ וּלְהַרְבּ֣וֹת אֶתְכֶם֒ כֵּ֣ן יָשִׂ֤ישׂ יְהֹוָה֙ עֲלֵיכֶ֔ם לְהַאֲבִ֥יד אֶתְכֶ֖ם וּלְהַשְׁמִ֣יד אֶתְכֶ֑ם וְנִסַּחְתֶּם֙ מֵעַ֣ל הָאֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה בָא־שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|63|And as יהוה once delighted in making you prosperous and many, so will יהוה now delight in causing you to perish and in wiping you out; you shall be torn from the land that you are about to enter and possess.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators and sources explain that God does not personally rejoice in the downfall of the wicked or the suffering of the Israelites, but rather causes others to rejoice over these events. This is seen in interpretations of verses from Exodus, Deuteronomy, and other biblical texts, as well as in Talmudic discussions and explanations of God's actions and emotions using metaphors and imagery. The ultimate goal is for the Jewish people to turn back to God, leading to their rehabilitation and God's personal delight in their redemption. 

|וֶהֱפִֽיצְךָ֤ יְהֹוָה֙ בְּכׇל־הָ֣עַמִּ֔ים מִקְצֵ֥ה הָאָ֖רֶץ וְעַד־קְצֵ֣ה הָאָ֑רֶץ וְעָבַ֨דְתָּ שָּׁ֜ם אֱלֹהִ֣ים אֲחֵרִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֧ר לֹא־יָדַ֛עְתָּ אַתָּ֥ה וַאֲבֹתֶ֖יךָ עֵ֥ץ וָאָֽבֶן׃|64|יהוה will scatter you among all the peoples from one end of the earth to the other, and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone, whom neither you nor your ancestors have experienced.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi, Siftei Chakhamim, and Rav Hirsch clarify that serving other gods in Deuteronomy 28:64 refers to paying tribute to idol-worshipping peoples, not idolatry itself. Steinsaltz emphasizes the unfamiliarity of the idol worship of their captors. The text discusses entering and inheriting the land of Israel, dwelling in it according to the teachings of the Ari, and the unity of God. The Rabbi compares those who venerate the land of prophecy but also revere places sacred to idols to proselytes who only accept the fundamental principles of the law. The Jewish people left Egypt and will be redeemed with the quality of the Sefirah of Understanding-Binah. The Midrash Tehillim explores the creation of Adam, the punishment of the Flood, and the destruction of Amalek. Ramban explains the covenant made by God with Israel alludes to the first and present exiles, with a promise of a more complete redemption. Haamek Davar discusses how suffering and exile serve a greater purpose of fulfilling God's plan. Abarbanel explains that in times of great troubles, some may turn to idol worship out of fear for their lives, seen as a punishment rather than a sin. Targum Jonathan describes how Adonoy will scatter the people to serve other gods among all nations. 

|וּבַגּוֹיִ֤ם הָהֵם֙ לֹ֣א תַרְגִּ֔יעַ וְלֹא־יִהְיֶ֥ה מָנ֖וֹחַ לְכַף־רַגְלֶ֑ךָ וְנָתַן֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה לְךָ֥ שָׁם֙ לֵ֣ב רַגָּ֔ז וְכִלְי֥וֹן עֵינַ֖יִם וְדַאֲב֥וֹן נָֽפֶשׁ׃|65|Yet even among those nations you shall find no peace, nor shall your foot find a place to rest. יהוה will give you there an anguished heart and eyes that pine and a despondent spirit.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries interpret phrases in the text differently, such as Rashi explaining "לא תרגיע" as no rest, Haamek Davar interpreting it as a lack of tranquility, and Rav Hirsch emphasizing the lack of rest and trembling heart among the nations. The Midrash discusses divine punishment and consequences of sin, including lack of rest and peace among the nations. Anger is likened to a disease of the soul in Musar, leading to physical ailments and torment in hell. In the Second Temple text, the foolish man is described as constantly moving and averse to rest. The Talmud discusses hemorrhoids causing pain and soul anguish, anger leading to murder, and the lack of rest among the nations. Targum emphasizes the lack of peace and fear among the Israelites if they worship idols. 

|וְהָי֣וּ חַיֶּ֔יךָ תְּלֻאִ֥ים לְךָ֖ מִנֶּ֑גֶד וּפָֽחַדְתָּ֙ לַ֣יְלָה וְיוֹמָ֔ם וְלֹ֥א תַאֲמִ֖ין בְּחַיֶּֽיךָ׃|66|The life you face shall be precarious; you shall be in terror, night and day, with no assurance of survival.|

Commentary on Deuteronomy 28:66 discusses the fear of imminent death for those relying on buying food, with different interpretations highlighting uncertainty and insecurity. The Midrash explores various levels of reliance on grain and historical events related to oppressive decrees on Israel. Ramban connects biblical warnings against idolatry to historical events like the Roman conquest and exile of the Jewish people. In the Talmud, discussions range from uncertainty about the future to the purity of a mule's blood and the implications of buying food from different sources. Targum translations convey a sense of fear and dread in relation to the uncertainty of life. 

|בַּבֹּ֤קֶר תֹּאמַר֙ מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן עֶ֔רֶב וּבָעֶ֥רֶב תֹּאמַ֖ר מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן בֹּ֑קֶר מִפַּ֤חַד לְבָֽבְךָ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּפְחָ֔ד וּמִמַּרְאֵ֥ה עֵינֶ֖יךָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר תִּרְאֶֽה׃|67|In the morning you shall say, “If only it were evening!” and in the evening you shall say, “If only it were morning!”—because of what your heart shall dread and your eyes shall see.|

Emunah in Jewish thought emphasizes the reliability of wisdom and knowledge over material treasures. The Liturgy expresses a longing for morning as a reflection of fear and impatience in exile. Midrash discusses the daily merits of prayers and the fear experienced by different nations. In the Talmud, it is stated that each day since the Temple's destruction is cursed, with each day worse than the previous one. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret the verse as describing affliction and fear as punishment for wrongdoing. 

|וֶהֱשִֽׁיבְךָ֨ יְהֹוָ֥ה ׀ מִצְרַ֘יִם֮ בׇּאֳנִיּוֹת֒ בַּדֶּ֙רֶךְ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָמַ֣רְתִּֽי לְךָ֔ לֹא־תֹסִ֥יף ע֖וֹד לִרְאֹתָ֑הּ וְהִתְמַכַּרְתֶּ֨ם שָׁ֧ם לְאֹיְבֶ֛יךָ לַעֲבָדִ֥ים וְלִשְׁפָח֖וֹת וְאֵ֥ין קֹנֶֽה׃|68|יהוה will send you back to Egypt in galleys, by a route which I told you you should not see again. There you shall offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but none will buy.|

|אֵ֩לֶּה֩ דִבְרֵ֨י הַבְּרִ֜ית אֲֽשֶׁר־צִוָּ֧ה יְהֹוָ֣ה אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֗ה לִכְרֹ֛ת אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מוֹאָ֑ב מִלְּבַ֣ד הַבְּרִ֔ית אֲשֶׁר־כָּרַ֥ת אִתָּ֖ם בְּחֹרֵֽב׃|69|These are the terms of the covenant which יהוה commanded Moses to conclude with the Israelites in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant which was made with them at Horeb.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The covenant with the children of Israel involved taking on the observance of the Torah under an imprecation and oath, renewing and strengthening the covenant made at Horeb, reflecting historical experiences in the wilderness and impending possession of the promised land. On Tish'ah B'Av, specific passages are read in the morning and Minchah services.

## Deuteronomy 29

|וַיִּקְרָ֥א מֹשֶׁ֛ה אֶל־כׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֑ם אַתֶּ֣ם רְאִיתֶ֗ם אֵ֣ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁר֩ עָשָׂ֨ה יְהֹוָ֤ה לְעֵֽינֵיכֶם֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם לְפַרְעֹ֥ה וּלְכׇל־עֲבָדָ֖יו וּלְכׇל־אַרְצֽוֹ׃|1|Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: You have seen all that יהוה did before your very eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his courtiers and to his whole country:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses called Israel to renew the covenant, emphasizing their role in revealing God's glory. Man has free will and must follow the commandments, with Moses reassured of his mission by God. Torah study and mitzvot are essential, showcasing Israel's resilience and faith in the face of challenges. Moses reminded Israel of the plagues in Egypt to reaffirm their faith. 

|הַמַּסּוֹת֙ הַגְּדֹלֹ֔ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר רָא֖וּ עֵינֶ֑יךָ הָאֹתֹ֧ת וְהַמֹּפְתִ֛ים הַגְּדֹלִ֖ים הָהֵֽם׃|2|the wondrous feats that you saw with your own eyes, those prodigious signs and marvels.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rav Hirsch and Steinsaltz interpret different divine manifestations experienced by the Israelites as trials, miracles, signs, and wonders. Midrash highlights the importance of Torah study and mitzvot for receiving rewards in this world and the World to Come, distinguishing Israel as God's children. Mishnah states that certain groups will not have a share in the World-to-Come, while Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer have differing beliefs on the return of the ten tribes. Kabbalistic interpretations connect aspects of Torah to the Divine name in Mitzvah, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling commandments in the land of Israel. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both emphasize the extraordinary signs and wonders witnessed by the Israelites. 

|וְלֹא־נָתַן֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה לָכֶ֥ם לֵב֙ לָדַ֔עַת וְעֵינַ֥יִם לִרְא֖וֹת וְאׇזְנַ֣יִם לִשְׁמֹ֑עַ עַ֖ד הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|3|Yet to this day יהוה has not given you a mind to understand or eyes to see or ears to hear.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of understanding the deeper meanings in the Torah, including moral lessons from the patriarchs and matriarchs. Halakhah lists actions that impede Teshuvah, while Jewish Thought discusses the interpretation of the word "heart" in biblical passages. Midrash explores Israel's acceptance of the covenant at Mount Sinai, and Mishnah outlines stages of life and learning. Musar highlights actions that impede repentance, and Talmud discusses Moses addressing the Israelites after forty years in the desert. Targum reflects on the Israelites' lack of understanding until a certain point. 

|וָאוֹלֵ֥ךְ אֶתְכֶ֛ם אַרְבָּעִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה בַּמִּדְבָּ֑ר לֹֽא־בָל֤וּ שַׂלְמֹֽתֵיכֶם֙ מֵעֲלֵיכֶ֔ם וְנַעַלְךָ֥ לֹֽא־בָלְתָ֖ה מֵעַ֥ל רַגְלֶֽךָ׃|4|I led you through the wilderness forty years; the clothes on your back did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Sforno, and Rav Hirsch highlight the significance of the Israelites' experiences in the wilderness in reinforcing their covenant with God, developing sagacity, and solidifying their knowledge of God's power, respectively. Steinsaltz points out the miraculous preservation of the Israelites' garments and shoes during this time. Admonishment is crucial for repentance, and congregations should appoint a sage to motivate towards Teshuvah. Prophecy is a gift from God based on qualifications and attributes like physical well-being, wisdom, and devotion. The Midrash discusses Israel's sustenance in the wilderness through divine miracles and the importance of humility. Repentance is always available to those who seek to draw closer to God with sincerity. Moses did not allude to the Jewish people until after forty years of learning Torah, indicating a deep understanding. In Nehemiah 9:21 and Targum, it is mentioned that God sustained the Israelites in the wilderness for forty years, ensuring their needs were met. 

|לֶ֚חֶם לֹ֣א אֲכַלְתֶּ֔ם וְיַ֥יִן וְשֵׁכָ֖ר לֹ֣א שְׁתִיתֶ֑ם לְמַ֙עַן֙ תֵּֽדְע֔וּ כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶֽם׃|5|you had no bread to eat and no wine or other intoxicant to drink—that you might know that I יהוה am your God.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites relied on manna provided by God in the wilderness, occasionally purchasing food for pleasure, to demonstrate God as their sustainer. Repentance is crucial to avoid harsh consequences, recording miracles prevents doubt, Torah study is best for those not providing a livelihood. Prohibited sexual intercourse laws apply to all Israel, Moses spoke in God's name, Israel's survival in the desert was miraculous, Joshua's command is an extension of God's promises. Abstaining from certain foods and focusing on God's law is important to know He is their God. 

|וַתָּבֹ֖אוּ אֶל־הַמָּק֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה וַיֵּצֵ֣א סִיחֹ֣ן מֶֽלֶךְ־חֶ֠שְׁבּ֠וֹן וְע֨וֹג מֶלֶךְ־הַבָּשָׁ֧ן לִקְרָאתֵ֛נוּ לַמִּלְחָמָ֖ה וַנַּכֵּֽם׃|6|When you reached this place, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to engage us in battle, but we defeated them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the tzaddik's attributes were present in physical space during his lifetime, with disciples only receiving a portion of these attributes through his teachings. The commentary on the Israelites' conquest emphasizes the importance of faith, wisdom, and observance of mitzvot for success, while Targum recounts the victory of the Israelites over Sihon and Og in battle. 

|וַנִּקַּח֙ אֶת־אַרְצָ֔ם וַנִּתְּנָ֣הּ לְנַחֲלָ֔ה לָראוּבֵנִ֖י וְלַגָּדִ֑י וְלַחֲצִ֖י שֵׁ֥בֶט הַֽמְנַשִּֽׁי׃|7|We took their land and gave it to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh as their heritage.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites were reminded of God giving them the land of the Amorites as an inheritance, specifically to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh. They were warned not to disregard this display of God's power. God also granted the Israelites kingdoms, peoples, and territories, allowing them to possess the lands of Sihon and Og. 

|וּשְׁמַרְתֶּ֗ם אֶת־דִּבְרֵי֙ הַבְּרִ֣ית הַזֹּ֔את וַעֲשִׂיתֶ֖ם אֹתָ֑ם לְמַ֣עַן תַּשְׂכִּ֔ילוּ אֵ֖ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּעֲשֽׂוּן׃|8|Therefore observe faithfully all the terms of this covenant, that you may succeed in all that you undertake.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of preparing for Rosh Hashanah by engaging in Torah study, repentance, reciting penitential prayers, embodying kindness and charity, focusing on the thirteen attributes of mercy, and raising one's heart to God during prayer is emphasized in Chasidut. In commentary, the covenant at Mount Gerizim and Mount Eyval is highlighted as essential for success, and the obligation to observe the covenant in light of favors received from the Lord is stressed. Mitzvah performance should be automatic and not forgotten in Jewish Thought, with the garments worn by priests serving as reminders of the commandments. The righteous do not engage in robbery, studying the Torah brings prosperity, and teaching Torah to others is considered creating them in Midrash. The court crier recites verses from Deuteronomy during the flogging process in Mishnah, emphasizing the importance of observing the law and the mercy of God. Wisdom and knowledge are necessary for recognizing and serving God in Musar, with Torah study linked to success in property dealings in Talmud. The covenant must be kept and fulfilled to succeed in all endeavors and have prosperity is reiterated in Targum.
