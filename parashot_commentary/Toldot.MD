## Genesis 25

|וְאֵ֛לֶּה תּוֹלְדֹ֥ת יִצְחָ֖ק בֶּן־אַבְרָהָ֑ם אַבְרָהָ֖ם הוֹלִ֥יד אֶת־יִצְחָֽק׃|19 R|This is the story of Isaac, son of Abraham. Abraham begot Isaac.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains how parental thoughts during conception influence a child's spiritual focus, with Avraham transmitting spiritual values to Yitzchak. Ramban clarifies that "the generations of Isaac" refer specifically to Jacob and Esau, emphasizing Isaac's distinction as the true offspring of Avraham. Rabbi Yosi in Kabbalah discusses how Isaac carried the image of Avraham even after his death, symbolizing a soul that brings joy and laughter to the world. The Midrash emphasizes the importance of rebuking children to prevent them from going astray, teaching Torah, and establishing royal and priestly dynasties through biblical lineages. Musar highlights the similarities between Isaac and Avraham, as well as between Rebeccah and Sarah, with the Zohar noting how Rebeccah brought back the presence of the שכינה. The Talmud recounts how descendants of Ishmael and Keturah claimed the land of Canaan, and how doubts about Isaac's paternity were dispelled by his resemblance to Avraham. The Targum emphasizes the physical resemblance between Yitzchok and Avraham, leading people to believe that Avraham was Yitzchok's father. 

|וַיְהִ֤י יִצְחָק֙ בֶּן־אַרְבָּעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה בְּקַחְתּ֣וֹ אֶת־רִבְקָ֗ה בַּת־בְּתוּאֵל֙ הָֽאֲרַמִּ֔י מִפַּדַּ֖ן אֲרָ֑ם אֲח֛וֹת לָבָ֥ן הָאֲרַמִּ֖י ל֥וֹ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|20 P|Isaac was forty years old when he took to wife Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, sister of Laban the Aramean.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries on Genesis 25:20 discuss the significance of Paddan and Laban in relation to Rebecca, her barrenness, character, and God's intervention in her life, as well as the delay in her marriage and her righteousness despite her family's background. The act of presenting offerings in Jewish law emphasizes gratitude, individual success stemming from the altar, and the belief that successful farming is a gift from God. In Kabbalah, Isaac's marriage to Rivkah at forty symbolizes the balance of fire and water, and the dead will be transformed in the future. The Midrash praises Rebecca's righteousness amidst a deceitful family, highlighting the theme of redemption and suffering. Rashi explains that Abraham heard of Rebecca's birth on his return from Mount Moriah when Isaac was 37 years old. Rabbeinu Bahya and Siftei Chakhamim emphasize God's love despite sin and the significance of investigating a woman's family before marriage. The Talmud discusses Isaac's example of waiting twenty years before marrying another woman, with differing opinions on the cause of his infertility. The Targum notes that Isaac was forty when he married Rebecca, the daughter of Besueil from Padan Aram, sister of Laban. 

|וַיֶּעְתַּ֨ר יִצְחָ֤ק לַֽיהֹוָה֙ לְנֹ֣כַח אִשְׁתּ֔וֹ כִּ֥י עֲקָרָ֖ה הִ֑וא וַיֵּעָ֤תֶר לוֹ֙ יְהֹוָ֔ה וַתַּ֖הַר רִבְקָ֥ה אִשְׁתּֽוֹ׃|21 J|Isaac pleaded with יהוה on behalf of his wife, because she was barren; and יהוה responded to his plea, and his wife Rebekah conceived.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The power of prayer in changing the laws of nature and overturning decrees of childlessness is exemplified in the story of Isaac and Rebekah, where Isaac's fervent prayer for his barren wife led to her conception, demonstrating the effectiveness of direct prayer to God without intermediaries. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yitzchak from the Talmud discuss how prayers of the righteous, like Isaac's, can turn God's mind from cruelty to mercy, resulting in answered prayers. Additionally, the Midrash highlights the significance of barrenness and prayer in the lives of biblical figures such as Sarah, Rebecca, Leah, and Rachel, emphasizing the importance of prayer in overcoming challenges and receiving blessings from God. 

|וַיִּתְרֹֽצְצ֤וּ הַבָּנִים֙ בְּקִרְבָּ֔הּ וַתֹּ֣אמֶר אִם־כֵּ֔ן לָ֥מָּה זֶּ֖ה אָנֹ֑כִי וַתֵּ֖לֶךְ לִדְרֹ֥שׁ אֶת־יְהֹוָֽה׃|22 J|But the children struggled in her womb, and she said, “If so, why do I exist?”  She went to inquire of יהוה,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Rivkah's challenging pregnancy, seeking answers from God and Torah scholars about the struggles of her sons, emphasizing the importance of hidden knowledge. Commentary offers differing interpretations of Rebekah's questioning and the struggle in her womb, with some suggesting violent movements and prophetic guidance sought from Shem and Eber. Halakhah describes the rise of false prophets promoting idol worship, while Jewish Thought explores prophecy, sibling rivalry between Esau and Jacob, and the blessing given to Jacob. Kabbalah delves into the conflict between Esau and Jacob in Rebekah's womb, representing opposing forces. Midrash highlights the struggles between the brothers, Jacob's righteousness, and the significance of seeking guidance from Torah scholars. Musar discusses Jacob's victory over Esau in two worlds, the blessings bestowed upon him, and the significance of the number twelve in relation to the tribes of Israel. Quoting Commentary emphasizes seeking counsel from God, linguistic styles in Scripture, invoking divine attributes in blessings, and exploring biblical narratives. Targum recounts Rebekah seeking guidance from the Lord and questioning the pain of motherhood at the school of Shem Rabba. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה לָ֗הּ שְׁנֵ֤י בְּבִטְנֵ֔ךְ וּשְׁנֵ֣י לְאֻמִּ֔ים מִמֵּעַ֖יִךְ יִפָּרֵ֑דוּ וּלְאֹם֙ מִלְאֹ֣ם יֶֽאֱמָ֔ץ וְרַ֖ב יַעֲבֹ֥ד צָעִֽיר׃|23 J|and יהוה answered her, “Two nations are in your womb, Two separate peoples shall issue from your body; One people shall be mightier than the other, And the older shall serve the younger.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the righteous nullify the Kingdom of Evil through Torah adherence, business activities can elevate wisdom, the divine and animal souls battle for control, Torah lishmah brings peace, Bnei Yisrael's power comes from overcoming negative forces, and negative forces exist for the righteous to conquer. The prophecy to Rebecca foretells the conflict between her twin sons, with one serving the other, each with different destinies. Esau's desire for his inheritance leads to Jacob's ascent and Esau's descent. The Zohar links the twins to the liver and heart, while Midrash compares Esau to Ishmael. Rebbi Yehuda and King Chizkiyahu lived simply despite their status, and the Talmud discusses the rise and fall of nations, the dangers of flattering the wicked, and direct divine communication with women. Adonoy tells Rebekah in the Targum that her twins will become two nations, with the greater serving the smaller if the smaller follows the commandments. 

|וַיִּמְלְא֥וּ יָמֶ֖יהָ לָלֶ֑דֶת וְהִנֵּ֥ה תוֹמִ֖ם בְּבִטְנָֽהּ׃|24 J|When her time to give birth was at hand, there were twins in her womb.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The spelling of "twins" in Genesis 25:24 indicates one child would be wicked and the other righteous, with Esau and Yaakov being identified before birth. A Seifer Torah with serious errors affecting pronunciation or meaning requires a new one, while missing auxiliary letters may not. The term "male" in Hebrew has various meanings, including completion and excellency. King David embodies qualities of kindness, judgment, and mercy, contrasting with Esav. The Midrash discusses the birth of twins, focusing on their characteristics. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak states that a woman with treasure in her belly will not miscarry, citing Rebecca's pregnancy as an example. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the birth of twins from Rebekah's womb after 270 days. 

|וַיֵּצֵ֤א הָרִאשׁוֹן֙ אַדְמוֹנִ֔י כֻּלּ֖וֹ כְּאַדֶּ֣רֶת שֵׂעָ֑ר וַיִּקְרְא֥וּ שְׁמ֖וֹ עֵשָֽׂו׃|25 J|The first one emerged red, like a hairy mantle all over; so they named him Esau. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes seeking Divine truth with sincerity and reverence for the Torah, contrasting the holy ruach-of-life with the negativity associated with Esav. Commentary delves into the significance of Esau's appearance and name, with various interpretations highlighting his unique birth and vitality. Jewish Thought discusses the conflict between Esau and Jacob, foreshadowing their future struggles, while Kabbalah connects Esau to harsh judgment and the liver's role in hunting and contemplation. Liturgy references Esau as the arch-enemy of the Jewish People in the Chanukah service, and Midrash explores the significance of Esau, Jacob, and biblical figures in relation to various themes. Musar illustrates Jacob's cunning and spiritual ascent over Esau, while Quoting Commentary discusses the symbolism of materials in the Tabernacle and contrasts Yaakov's virtuous character with Esav. Talmud cites sources connecting Esau's descendants, the construction of the Temple, and the Jewish people as Messiah, while Tanakh associates Esav with the goat imagery in the Torah. Targum mentions Esau's birth with a reddish complexion and hair. 

|וְאַֽחֲרֵי־כֵ֞ן יָצָ֣א אָחִ֗יו וְיָד֤וֹ אֹחֶ֙זֶת֙ בַּעֲקֵ֣ב עֵשָׂ֔ו וַיִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖וֹ יַעֲקֹ֑ב וְיִצְחָ֛ק בֶּן־שִׁשִּׁ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה בְּלֶ֥דֶת אֹתָֽם׃|26 J|Then his brother emerged, holding on to the heel of Esau; so they named him Jacob.  Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Yaakov's challenge against the force of death associated with Esau and the importance of spiritual maturity attained through trials. Likutei Halakhot explains the connection between washing hands upon waking and the revelation of daat engendered by nighttime devotions. In Kabbalah, it is explained that Jacob must be wiser than the primordial serpent. Midrash details the deaths of Sarah and Nahor, Abraham's negotiations for the cave of Machpelah, and Isaac's marriage to Rebekah. Musar connects Jacob's name to the struggle with Esau, highlighting his humility and spiritual refinement. Quoting Commentary discusses the importance of heeding even the lighter commandments and the significance of mentioning the Exodus in the messianic era. The Talmud discusses the significance of mentioning Ishmael's lifespan to calculate Jacob's age and Isaac's infertility. In Tanakh, God will not revoke the decree against Edom for their transgressions, and Jeremiah warns against trusting friends and family. Targum mentions Yaakov being born holding onto Eisov's heel. 

|וַֽיִּגְדְּלוּ֙ הַנְּעָרִ֔ים וַיְהִ֣י עֵשָׂ֗ו אִ֛ישׁ יֹדֵ֥עַ צַ֖יִד אִ֣ישׁ שָׂדֶ֑ה וְיַעֲקֹב֙ אִ֣ישׁ תָּ֔ם יֹשֵׁ֖ב אֹהָלִֽים׃|27 J|When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the outdoors; but Jacob became a mild man, raising livestock. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the spiritual spark of harmony within Rachel, connecting her to Yaakov's attribute of Tiferet, which helped Joseph avoid sin with Potiphar's wife. Esau's deceitful nature contrasts with Jacob's honesty and dedication to Torah study, leading to their divergent paths and destinies. The importance of Torah study, dedication to spiritual values, and pursuit of truth are highlighted in various commentaries, emphasizing the significance of Yaakov as a wholehearted man and master of Torah. The symbolism of Jacob's tents representing simplicity and internal growth is contrasted with Esau's pursuit of material pleasures and immediate results. The Midrash discusses the importance of guidance and rebuke in shaping the behavior of descendants, while Musar highlights Yaakov's integrity and avoidance of deceit in maintaining a close relationship with God. The Second Temple text contrasts Jacob's virtuous dwelling with Esau's wickedness and lack of a home, emphasizing the importance of living a life of wisdom and virtue. The Talmud discusses divine covenants with patriarchs and biblical figures born circumcised, while the Targum highlights the contrasting pursuits of Eisov and Yaakov, with Eisov's idleness and hunting birds and beasts contrasting with Yaakov's dedication to study and seeking instruction before the Lord. 

|וַיֶּאֱהַ֥ב יִצְחָ֛ק אֶת־עֵשָׂ֖ו כִּי־צַ֣יִד בְּפִ֑יו וְרִבְקָ֖ה אֹהֶ֥בֶת אֶֽת־יַעֲקֹֽב׃|28 J|Isaac favored Esau because he had a taste for game;  but Rebekah favored Jacob.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Yitzchak loved Esau for his hunting skills to capture divine sparks, while Rivkah's love for Yaakov was enduring, reflecting Hashem's intrinsic love for Bnei Yisrael. Esau's deceptive behavior contrasted with Yaakov's trust in God, highlighting the importance of sincerity in serving God. Midrash details the deaths of Sarah, Nahor, and Lot, and Abraham's arrangements for Isaac's marriage to Rebekah. Musar emphasizes Rebeccah's enduring love for Jacob based on spiritual qualities, while Isaac's love for Esau was transient and materialistic. Tanakh and Targum highlight the contrast in Yitzhak's love for Esav based on food and Rivkah's love for Yaakov based on honesty. 

|וַיָּ֥זֶד יַעֲקֹ֖ב נָזִ֑יד וַיָּבֹ֥א עֵשָׂ֛ו מִן־הַשָּׂדֶ֖ה וְה֥וּא עָיֵֽף׃|29 J|Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the open, famished.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau returns home exhausted and hungry, requesting food from Jacob, who cooked lentils as a symbol of mourning for Abraham's death. Esau's exhaustion was attributed to sins committed that day, including murder and denying God and the birthright, reflecting his self-centeredness and lack of moral principles. Jacob cooked red lentils to break Esau's power, associated with his sins and wickedness, according to Rabbi Elazar and Midrash Tanchuma. The Talmud discusses various punishments and actions related to Esau's behavior, while Targum Jonathan adds that Esau committed five transgressions on the day Abraham died. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר עֵשָׂ֜ו אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֗ב הַלְעִיטֵ֤נִי נָא֙ מִן־הָאָדֹ֤ם הָאָדֹם֙ הַזֶּ֔ה כִּ֥י עָיֵ֖ף אָנֹ֑כִי עַל־כֵּ֥ן קָרָֽא־שְׁמ֖וֹ אֱדֽוֹם׃|30 J|And Esau said to Jacob, “Give me some of that red stuff to gulp down, for I am famished”—which is why he was named Edom. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut advises eating at a moderate pace and with proper table manners to avoid gluttony like Esau, contrasting with those who seek independence, leading to spiritual deadness. Esau's intense desire for red lentils led to his nickname "the red one," reflecting his attraction to anything red. Mishneh Torah emphasizes finding a balanced temperament in all traits, while Esau's lack of respect for his father led Jacob to ask him to sell his birthright. Lust for pleasure is considered worse than negative traits like gluttony, leading to greed and other negative behaviors. The Musar teachings emphasize not eating in a gluttonous manner when breaking a fast and the importance of sanctity and modesty in food intake. Rabbeinu Bahya discusses Pharaoh's fear of bloodshed in the desert and the contrast between the righteous and the wicked in their consumption habits. Esau asked Jacob for red pottage when exhausted, leading to him being named Edom. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֑ב מִכְרָ֥ה כַיּ֛וֹם אֶת־בְּכֹרָֽתְךָ֖ לִֽי׃|31 J|Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau's lack of respect for his father and pursuit of frivolities led Jacob to demand his birthright as a way to honor their father, emphasizing the importance of spiritual growth over physical desires. The Midrash and Targum texts further explore the significance of selling a birthright and the passing of the birthright from Adam to Jacob. Rashi highlights Esau's deception in wanting Jacob's soup before the birthright sale, while Rabbeinu Bahya and Siftei Chakhamim discuss the significance of offerings and allegories in relation to prayer and intentions. Radak and Targum interpretations emphasize themes of superiority, proper words in prayer, and the timing of selling the birthright. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר עֵשָׂ֔ו הִנֵּ֛ה אָנֹכִ֥י הוֹלֵ֖ךְ לָמ֑וּת וְלָמָּה־זֶּ֥ה לִ֖י בְּכֹרָֽה׃|32 J|And Esau said, “I am at the point of death, so of what use is my birthright to me?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a meal due to his hunting lifestyle and belief that he might die before his father, rendering the birthright irrelevant for him. The interpretation of "hal'itehu" in Genesis 25:30 as "Gorge the wicked" in relation to thieves stealing fruit from a sapling within the first four years of planting is discussed in Halakhah, based on Esau's demand to be fed until he dies. Esau's rejection of the birthright for immediate gratification reflects the consequences of valuing immediate pleasure over long-term consequences in Jewish Thought. In Musar, Jacob's ability to pass on his teachings to his children is contrasted with Esau's impure actions leading to death. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains in the Talmud that Esau engaged in various sins, including denying God's existence and despising his birthright. Esau's belief that he was about to die and questioning the value of the birthright is expressed in Targum Jonathan on Genesis 25:32. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֗ב הִשָּׁ֤בְעָה לִּי֙ כַּיּ֔וֹם וַיִּשָּׁבַ֖ע ל֑וֹ וַיִּמְכֹּ֥ר אֶת־בְּכֹרָת֖וֹ לְיַעֲקֹֽב׃|33 J|But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore to him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob secured Esau's sale of the birthright with an oath to ensure its validity and irrevocability, given the intangible nature of the birthright and Esau's state of exhaustion. This practice of using oaths to confirm transactions is still common today. The significance of names like Jacob and Israel in relation to greatness is explored, with Israel representing greatness despite Jacob initially being associated with the birthright. Lentils symbolize mourning and dedication to the birthright, with blessings following a pattern set by the patriarchs. The birthright transfer led Jacob to flee from Esau's challenge, and the Torah emerged from Jerusalem containing legal judgments. The story of Esau selling his birthright is compared to Rachel's request for mandrakes as both involve intangible items acquired through oaths. Esau's sale of the birthright to Jacob highlights the precedence given to Jacob over Esau due to his discipline and practice of excellence, with Reuben's name seen as a prophecy comparing him to Esau. 

|וְיַעֲקֹ֞ב נָתַ֣ן לְעֵשָׂ֗ו לֶ֚חֶם וּנְזִ֣יד עֲדָשִׁ֔ים וַיֹּ֣אכַל וַיֵּ֔שְׁתְּ וַיָּ֖קׇם וַיֵּלַ֑ךְ וַיִּ֥בֶז עֵשָׂ֖ו אֶת־הַבְּכֹרָֽה׃|34 J|Jacob then gave Esau bread and lentil stew; he ate and drank, and he rose and went away. Thus did Esau spurn the birthright.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau despised his birthright symbolizing inner intelligence and vitality, leading to disgrace in the Kingdom of Evil and the moon of the Other Side. Various commentators offer different perspectives on Esau's reasons for despising the birthright, with some attributing it to his focus on immediate gratification and others to his lack of moral stature. Esau's actions of giving up his birthright for food and showing no regret highlight his disdain for spiritual matters, contrasting with Jacob's value for truth. The Talmud provides evidence of Esau's sinful behavior, including engaging in immoral acts and denying God's existence. Ultimately, Esau's actions symbolize a rejection of his spiritual inheritance and a denial of future blessings. 

## Genesis 26

|וַיְהִ֤י רָעָב֙ בָּאָ֔רֶץ מִלְּבַד֙ הָרָעָ֣ב הָרִאשׁ֔וֹן אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָיָ֖ה בִּימֵ֣י אַבְרָהָ֑ם וַיֵּ֧לֶךְ יִצְחָ֛ק אֶל־אֲבִימֶ֥לֶךְ מֶֽלֶךְ־פְּלִשְׁתִּ֖ים גְּרָֽרָה׃|1 J|There was a famine in the land—aside from the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham—and Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, in Gerar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses a severe famine in the time of Abraham and Isaac, highlighting the challenges faced by the righteous and the importance of following God's guidance. It also emphasizes the pattern of leaving and returning to the Promised Land seen in the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as the significance of Isaac's actions in the land of the Philistines. Additionally, it discusses the reopening of wells by Isaac after Abraham's death, symbolizing the restoration of abundance. 

|וַיֵּרָ֤א אֵלָיו֙ יְהֹוָ֔ה וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אַל־תֵּרֵ֣ד מִצְרָ֑יְמָה שְׁכֹ֣ן בָּאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֖ר אֹמַ֥ר אֵלֶֽיךָ׃|2 J|יהוה had appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land which I point out to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of understanding constraints and waiting for God's guidance, as seen in Yaakov, Yitzchak, and Avraham's different experiences of traveling or staying in the Holy Land. Ramban, Sforno, Or HaChaim, Radak, Tur HaArokh, Siftei Chakhamim, Rav Hirsch, and Rashi provide insights into Isaac's obedience to God's instructions to stay in the land of Canaan and not go to Egypt, highlighting his status as a pure burnt offering. The Midrash and Quoting Commentary further discuss how God's will is abrogated for the righteous and how Jacob and Isaac's decisions to stay in the land of Israel were significant. The Second Temple period commentary and Targum emphasize the importance of avoiding irrational passions and following God's guidance, as seen in the patriarchs' actions. 

|גּ֚וּר בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַזֹּ֔את וְאֶֽהְיֶ֥ה עִמְּךָ֖ וַאֲבָרְכֶ֑ךָּ כִּֽי־לְךָ֣ וּֽלְזַרְעֲךָ֗ אֶתֵּן֙ אֶת־כׇּל־הָֽאֲרָצֹ֣ת הָאֵ֔ל וַהֲקִֽמֹתִי֙ אֶת־הַשְּׁבֻעָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּ֖עְתִּי לְאַבְרָהָ֥ם אָבִֽיךָ׃|3 J|Reside in this land, and I will be with you and bless you; I will assign all these lands to you and to your heirs, fulfilling the oath that I swore to your father Abraham.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Avraham's attribute was love, Yitzchok's was reverence for God, and Yaakov prayed to clarify if he could leave the Holy Land. The Liturgy in Siddur Ashkenaz and Siddur Sefard invokes the covenant with Abraham and the binding of Isaac during prayers. The Targum emphasizes God's promise to be with Isaac and fulfill the covenant made with Abraham. The Musar commentary discusses the gift of Torah starting with Avraham and the land of Israel becoming real when Yitzchok was forbidden to leave during a famine. The Talmud states that the reward for delighting in Shabbat is the unlimited portion of Yaakov, contrasting with the limited portions of Avraham and Yitzchak. 

|וְהִרְבֵּיתִ֤י אֶֽת־זַרְעֲךָ֙ כְּכוֹכְבֵ֣י הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם וְנָתַתִּ֣י לְזַרְעֲךָ֔ אֵ֥ת כׇּל־הָאֲרָצֹ֖ת הָאֵ֑ל וְהִתְבָּרְכ֣וּ בְזַרְעֲךָ֔ כֹּ֖ל גּוֹיֵ֥י הָאָֽרֶץ׃|4 J|I will make your heirs as numerous as the stars of heaven, and assign to your heirs all these lands, so that all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by your heirs—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak, Rashi, and Steinsaltz emphasize the promise of multiplying descendants and blessings for all nations through Abraham's descendants, with Chizkuni highlighting the expulsion of gentiles from the land and the genetic input received by all nations. Halakhah states that Yitzhak's descendants will inherit all lands and receive blessings from all nations. Midrash texts discuss blessings, consequences of not following God's statutes, and the interconnectedness of actions and consequences. Musar connects Jacob's name עקב to the ultimate purpose of life as defined in Kohelet 12,13. Ibn Ezra notes that God fulfilled the blessing of multiplication in Egypt for the Israelites, while Chizkuni explains that God will maintain His covenant with the Israelites. Tanakh and Targum highlight God's promise to make the children of Israel numerous, inherit lands, and bring blessings to all nations through them. 

|עֵ֕קֶב אֲשֶׁר־שָׁמַ֥ע אַבְרָהָ֖ם בְּקֹלִ֑י וַיִּשְׁמֹר֙ מִשְׁמַרְתִּ֔י מִצְוֺתַ֖י חֻקּוֹתַ֥י וְתוֹרֹתָֽי׃|5 J|inasmuch as Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge: My commandments, My laws, and My teachings.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham observed and fulfilled the Torah before it was given, keeping various decrees and laws through divine inspiration and voluntary observance, focusing on faith, commandments, and teachings. He elevated the quality of Malchut through acts of kindness and charity, observed the Torah with obedience, and was rewarded for his righteousness and loyalty to God. Abraham's adherence to Torah is highlighted as a model for future generations, with God promising blessings to him and his descendants for obeying His commands. 

|וַיֵּ֥שֶׁב יִצְחָ֖ק בִּגְרָֽר׃|6 J|So Isaac stayed in Gerar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac followed God's command to dwell in Gerar and identified Rebecca as his sister for her safety. The righteous patriarchs saw themselves as sojourners in the land, reflecting humility and recognition of their transient nature. Despite not being a central character, Isaac's presence ensured continuity in the land of Canaan, with the Philistines potentially supporting Egypt against the Israelites. Isaac never left the land of Israel despite residing among the Philistines, and the Canaanites feared being dispossessed by the Israelites, leading to God's dilemma in fulfilling His promise to bring Abraham's descendants to a land of abundance. 

|וַֽיִּשְׁאֲל֞וּ אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַמָּקוֹם֙ לְאִשְׁתּ֔וֹ וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אֲחֹ֣תִי הִ֑וא כִּ֤י יָרֵא֙ לֵאמֹ֣ר אִשְׁתִּ֔י פֶּן־יַֽהַרְגֻ֜נִי אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַמָּקוֹם֙ עַל־רִבְקָ֔ה כִּֽי־טוֹבַ֥ת מַרְאֶ֖ה הִֽוא׃|7 J|When the local leaders  asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say “my wife,” thinking, “The local leaders might kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is beautiful.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of honoring one's wife as a means to becoming wealthy, exemplified by Adam, Avraham, and Yitzchak, as well as the potential consequences of sinful thoughts. In marriage, the husband is obligated to provide for his wife's needs as outlined in the ketubah and rabbinic legislation, with examples like Isaac obligating himself to provide daily allowances. The word "yir-ah" has two meanings in Jewish thought, referring to instinctive fear and reverence for moral or intellectual qualities. In Kabbalah, the connection to the Shechinah allowed Biblical figures like Isaac to refer to their wives as sisters, reflecting divine presence and strength. Biblical heroes faced complex choices, such as dealing with beautiful wives in foreign nations or jealousy from family members, as seen in various passages throughout the Tanakh. 

|וַיְהִ֗י כִּ֣י אָֽרְכוּ־ל֥וֹ שָׁם֙ הַיָּמִ֔ים וַיַּשְׁקֵ֗ף אֲבִימֶ֙לֶךְ֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ פְּלִשְׁתִּ֔ים בְּעַ֖ד הַֽחַלּ֑וֹן וַיַּ֗רְא וְהִנֵּ֤ה יִצְחָק֙ מְצַחֵ֔ק אֵ֖ת רִבְקָ֥ה אִשְׁתּֽוֹ׃|8 J|When some time had passed, Abimelech king of the Philistines, looking out of the window, saw Isaac fondling his wife Rebekah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yitzchok became less cautious in hiding his relationship with Rivkah, leading Avimelech to observe them engaging in marital intimacy through a window, which was permitted during the day due to specific circumstances. The Sages instituted the wearing of belts to separate the heart from the genitals to prevent lustful fantasies. The key to understanding the words of the Prophets lies in knowledge of the figures and general ideas they employ, serving to illuminate the deeper meanings of the Law. In Zohar Toldot, it is explained that the presence of the Shechinah was with Rivkah. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains that bad dreams, harsh prophecies, and disproportionate mourning are nullified by extended time. Rashbam explains that the "המשקוף" in Exodus 12:7 refers to the upper lintel visible when entering a door. Abimelech observed Isaac and Rebecca engaging in sacred sporting, suitable for kings. The Israelites offered burnt offerings and sacrifices of well-being, then ate, drank, and danced the following day. Avimelech observed Isaac playing with his wife Rebekah through a window after they had been there for a long time. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֲבִימֶ֜לֶךְ לְיִצְחָ֗ק וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אַ֣ךְ הִנֵּ֤ה אִשְׁתְּךָ֙ הִ֔וא וְאֵ֥יךְ אָמַ֖רְתָּ אֲחֹ֣תִי הִ֑וא וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָיו֙ יִצְחָ֔ק כִּ֣י אָמַ֔רְתִּי פֶּן־אָמ֖וּת עָלֶֽיהָ׃|9 J|Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, “So she is your wife! Why then did you say: ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac said to him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak explains that the word אך in Genesis 26:9 means "but" or "however," clarifies that Avimelech in this chapter is not the same one from Avraham's time. Steinsaltz describes Avimelech questioning Yitzchok about presenting Rivkah as his sister, to which Yitzchok responds out of fear for his own life. Kabbalah states that Abimelech used astrology to determine Rebekah was Isaac's wife and did not harm him due to God's reprimand in a previous incident. Yitzchak's detachment from the world is evident in his lack of focus on physical matters and silence when challenged about concealing his wife's identity, highlighting his disinterest in engaging with others. Targum confirms Avimelech confronting Isaac for lying about Rebekah being his sister, to which Isaac responds out of fear for his life. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲבִימֶ֔לֶךְ מַה־זֹּ֖את עָשִׂ֣יתָ לָּ֑נוּ כִּ֠מְעַ֠ט שָׁכַ֞ב אַחַ֤ד הָעָם֙ אֶת־אִשְׁתֶּ֔ךָ וְהֵבֵאתָ֥ עָלֵ֖ינוּ אָשָֽׁם׃|10 J|Abimelech said, “What have you done to us! One of the men  might have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 26:10, Avimelekh almost slept with Rivkah, causing concern for potential guilt and punishment, prompting him to take action to prevent it. The Midrash connects offerings brought by the tribes of Israel to biblical figures like Jacob, Joseph, Ephraim, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Commentaries on Deuteronomy 15:7:1 and Numbers 16:15:2 emphasize helping the destitute with dignity and refute claims of despotism, while highlighting the portrayal of the Messiah as poor and Moses' denial of taking donkeys. Abimelech questions Isaac's actions in Targum translations, expressing concern about potential guilt. 

|וַיְצַ֣ו אֲבִימֶ֔לֶךְ אֶת־כׇּל־הָעָ֖ם לֵאמֹ֑ר הַנֹּגֵ֜עַ בָּאִ֥ישׁ הַזֶּ֛ה וּבְאִשְׁתּ֖וֹ מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת׃|11 J|Abimelech then charged all the people, saying, “Anyone who molests this man or his wife shall be put to death.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avimelech warned his people not to harm Isaac or his wife, emphasizing the consequences of death for any harm done. Rabbi Aivu, Rabbi Ḥanin, and Daniyel the tailor discuss Isaac's prosperity and the importance of overseeing slaves for their work. The text emphasizes the similarities between Isaac's experiences and those of his father Abraham, highlighting the importance of maintaining covenants and oaths in relationships. Isaac faced adversity in Gerar but eventually found peace and security by digging wells. Avimelech commanded his people not to harm Isaac or his wife, threatening death as punishment. 

|וַיִּזְרַ֤ע יִצְחָק֙ בָּאָ֣רֶץ הַהִ֔וא וַיִּמְצָ֛א בַּשָּׁנָ֥ה הַהִ֖וא מֵאָ֣ה שְׁעָרִ֑ים וַֽיְבָרְכֵ֖הוּ יְהֹוָֽה׃|12 J|Isaac sowed in that land and reaped a hundredfold the same year. יהוה blessed him,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how the Patriarchs sought eternal life and spiritual blessings, not just temporal goods, as seen in Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his life for eternal life and Isaac blessing Jacob with spiritual blessings. Additionally, the text explores the symbolism of the moon and its relationship to the Jewish people, highlighting the need for humility and spiritual success over material success in both this world and the world to come. Isaac's sowing in the land and reaping a hundredfold harvest was a blessing from God, unaffected by jealousy, and symbolized his devotion to righteous behavior and tithing. 

|וַיִּגְדַּ֖ל הָאִ֑ישׁ וַיֵּ֤לֶךְ הָלוֹךְ֙ וְגָדֵ֔ל עַ֥ד כִּֽי־גָדַ֖ל מְאֹֽד׃|13 J|and the man grew richer and richer until he was very wealthy:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Sarah's doubt about why God waited until she was too old to conceive was subtly expressed through her comment about her husband's age, showing her lack of belief in her own righteousness. In the Midrash, Rabbi Tanhuma explains that the mention of old age for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the Torah indicates their merit, with Isaac being blessed with beauty, strength, wealth, wisdom, and a long life. The Musar commentary questions the value of Avimelech's wealth compared to the dung of Isaac's mules and criticizes Anah for crossbreeding horses and donkeys. In the Targum, both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe how the man in Genesis 26:13 prospered and became very great. 

|וַֽיְהִי־ל֤וֹ מִקְנֵה־צֹאן֙ וּמִקְנֵ֣ה בָקָ֔ר וַעֲבֻדָּ֖ה רַבָּ֑ה וַיְקַנְא֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ פְּלִשְׁתִּֽים׃|14 J|he acquired flocks and herds, and a large household, so that the Philistines envied him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac's wealth in flocks and herds led to jealousy from the Philistines, who expelled him courteously. The Midrash emphasizes overseeing one's property for blessings, while Rabbeinu Bahya notes the significance of sheep in the Torah. Joseph's brothers were jealous of him due to his dreams, not his virtues, according to another commentary. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both highlight the jealousy of the Philistines towards Isaac's wealth in flocks and herds. 

|וְכׇל־הַבְּאֵרֹ֗ת אֲשֶׁ֤ר חָֽפְרוּ֙ עַבְדֵ֣י אָבִ֔יו בִּימֵ֖י אַבְרָהָ֣ם אָבִ֑יו סִתְּמ֣וּם פְּלִשְׁתִּ֔ים וַיְמַלְא֖וּם עָפָֽר׃|15 J|And the Philistines stopped up all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham, filling them with earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how the Philistines stopped up the wells dug by Abraham out of jealousy towards Isaac, leading Isaac to redig them to sustain his herds and flocks. The Midrash explores God's healing with what He wounds, priestly blessings, Jacob's actions, and the impact of deaths on the world. Yitzchak is portrayed as passive, relying on his father's strategies, while Rashi and Ramban provide explanations for specific verses. The Targum mentions the Philistines stopping up the wells, and the Tosefta discusses Abraham and Isaac bringing plenty after a famine. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֲבִימֶ֖לֶךְ אֶל־יִצְחָ֑ק לֵ֚ךְ מֵֽעִמָּ֔נוּ כִּֽי־עָצַ֥מְתָּ מִמֶּ֖נּוּ מְאֹֽד׃|16 J|And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you have become far too big for us.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The residents of Gerar were envious of Isaac's wealth and power, leading them to want him to leave so they could benefit from his successful harvest. Rabbi Eliezer explains that the double letters in the Torah represent expressions of redemption passed down through the generations, including from Abraham to Serah, the daughter of Asher. Rabbi Yehuda discusses Efron's incomplete generosity towards Abraham and Abimelech's true benevolence towards Isaac. Pesikta Rabbati emphasizes the importance of directing the heart towards the Holy of Holies during prayer, while Midrash Tanchuma explores the significance of doubled letters in the Torah and their association with different patriarchs. The Targum notes that Abimelech asked Isaac to leave because he had become more powerful than them in terms of wealth. 

|וַיֵּ֥לֶךְ מִשָּׁ֖ם יִצְחָ֑ק וַיִּ֥חַן בְּנַֽחַל־גְּרָ֖ר וַיֵּ֥שֶׁב שָֽׁם׃|17 J|So Isaac departed from there and encamped in the wadi of Gerar, where he settled.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac dug wells in the valley of Gerar, facing opposition from the Philistines, until he found a well of living water. He remained in the land of the Philistines, settling in Gerar as instructed by God, even after being forced to leave the city of Avimelech. Isaac camped far from the city, according to Rashi. 

|וַיָּ֨שׇׁב יִצְחָ֜ק וַיַּחְפֹּ֣ר ׀ אֶת־בְּאֵרֹ֣ת הַמַּ֗יִם אֲשֶׁ֤ר חָֽפְרוּ֙ בִּימֵי֙ אַבְרָהָ֣ם אָבִ֔יו וַיְסַתְּמ֣וּם פְּלִשְׁתִּ֔ים אַחֲרֵ֖י מ֣וֹת אַבְרָהָ֑ם וַיִּקְרָ֤א לָהֶן֙ שֵׁמ֔וֹת כַּשֵּׁמֹ֕ת אֲשֶׁר־קָרָ֥א לָהֶ֖ן אָבִֽיו׃|18 J|Isaac dug anew the wells which had been dug in the days of his father Abraham and which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham’s death; and he gave them the same names that his father had given them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac redug the wells originally dug by Abraham, maintaining continuity of ownership and emphasizing his father's merit. Various prayers connect the story of digging wells to themes of salvation and divine intervention. Rabbi Tanhuma highlights the generational blessings passed down from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Radak and Ramban discuss the differences in the wells mentioned in Genesis and the actions of the Philistines towards Isaac. Targum emphasizes Isaac reopening his father's wells after they were blocked by the Philistines. 

|וַיַּחְפְּר֥וּ עַבְדֵֽי־יִצְחָ֖ק בַּנָּ֑חַל וַיִּ֨מְצְאוּ־שָׁ֔ם בְּאֵ֖ר מַ֥יִם חַיִּֽים׃|19 J|But when Isaac’s servants, digging in the wadi, found there a well of spring water,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses how God is the source of life-force, with those attached receiving it while those who block themselves become separated. Ibn Ezra, Kli Yakar, Radak, Tur HaArokh, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Steinsaltz provide different interpretations of Isaac digging wells. Midrash texts highlight the significance of spring waters for purification rituals and the blessings associated with wells for the patriarchs. Talmudic interpretations see wells in dreams as symbols of peace, Torah, and life. The Targum and Tosefta mention how Isaac's servants found a well of spring water in a valley and how Isaac re-dug wells after Abraham's death to restore prosperity. 

|וַיָּרִ֜יבוּ רֹעֵ֣י גְרָ֗ר עִם־רֹעֵ֥י יִצְחָ֛ק לֵאמֹ֖ר לָ֣נוּ הַמָּ֑יִם וַיִּקְרָ֤א שֵֽׁם־הַבְּאֵר֙ עֵ֔שֶׂק כִּ֥י הִֽתְעַשְּׂק֖וּ עִמּֽוֹ׃|20 J|the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” He named that well Esek,  because they contended with him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses how Isaac's faith in God led to the restoration of the wells, symbolizing the challenges faced in spiritual growth. Commentary interprets the naming of the wells as representing conflicts and resolutions regarding the House of God, with hope for peace. Midrash contrasts Moses' doubt with the forefathers' faith, while Quoting Commentary analyzes the term "עשוק" in Deuteronomy 28:29:1 and discusses unity and peace potential. Second Temple explores powers of thought, and Talmud highlights Isaac's faith in God's attributes. Targum recounts the quarrel over the well and its drying up and flowing again. 

|וַֽיַּחְפְּרוּ֙ בְּאֵ֣ר אַחֶ֔רֶת וַיָּרִ֖יבוּ גַּם־עָלֶ֑יהָ וַיִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמָ֖הּ שִׂטְנָֽה׃|21 J|And when they dug another well, they disputed over that one also; so he named it Sitnah. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that after Abraham's death, the Philistines blocked the springs of wisdom, but Isaac restored it through faith by digging wells of living water. The commentary discusses how the well named Sitna reflected the Philistines' true feelings of hatred towards Isaac. Midrash explains the apportioning of the land to the people standing at the Plains of Moav due to foreseen destruction, and Aggadat Bereshit contrasts Isaac's merits with Joab's calamities. Quoting commentary interprets the four hundred years of affliction in Egypt and explains the concept of obstruction using the example of Bileam. Targum describes further contention over a well named Sitnah, meaning Obstruction or Accusation. 

|וַיַּעְתֵּ֣ק מִשָּׁ֗ם וַיַּחְפֹּר֙ בְּאֵ֣ר אַחֶ֔רֶת וְלֹ֥א רָב֖וּ עָלֶ֑יהָ וַיִּקְרָ֤א שְׁמָהּ֙ רְחֹב֔וֹת וַיֹּ֗אמֶר כִּֽי־עַתָּ֞ה הִרְחִ֧יב יְהֹוָ֛ה לָ֖נוּ וּפָרִ֥ינוּ בָאָֽרֶץ׃|22 J|He moved from there and dug yet another well, and they did not quarrel over it; so he called it Rehoboth, saying, “Now at last יהוה has granted us ample space  to increase in the land.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac continued Abraham's legacy by digging wells of living water through faith and attachment to God, symbolizing different periods in Jewish history and the coming of the Messiah. He avoided conflict with the Philistines, expressing hope for peace and prosperity in the land by naming the wells. The name Rechovot symbolizes spreading springs on all sides, crucial for salvation and redemption. Isaac's actions allude to the three Temples that will be built in the future, with each well representing a different Temple. Yitzchak's approach to conflict resolution with the Philistines differed from Avraham's and Yaakov's, relying on God's intervention and persistence in reopening wells despite challenges. 

|וַיַּ֥עַל מִשָּׁ֖ם בְּאֵ֥ר שָֽׁבַע׃|23 J|From there he went up to Beer-sheba.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the three wells represent different historical periods and the struggle between good and evil, ultimately leading to a connection with God. Commentary notes that Isaac's move to Beersheba was due to fear of the Philistines, leading to success and honor. Kabbalah describes the Divine quality of retribution as admonishing the Jewish people to fear judgment, associated with the well of Be'er Sheva. Targum translations confirm Isaac's journey to Beer Sheva. 

|וַיֵּרָ֨א אֵלָ֤יו יְהֹוָה֙ בַּלַּ֣יְלָה הַה֔וּא וַיֹּ֕אמֶר אָנֹכִ֕י אֱלֹהֵ֖י אַבְרָהָ֣ם אָבִ֑יךָ אַל־תִּירָא֙ כִּֽי־אִתְּךָ֣ אָנֹ֔כִי וּבֵֽרַכְתִּ֙יךָ֙ וְהִרְבֵּיתִ֣י אֶֽת־זַרְעֲךָ֔ בַּעֲב֖וּר אַבְרָהָ֥ם עַבְדִּֽי׃|24 J|That night יהוה appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham’s [house]. Fear not, for I am with you, and I will bless you and increase your offspring for the sake of My servant Abraham.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God reassured Isaac of protection and blessings despite conflicts with Abimelech and the Philistines, tying his success to his father's obedience. Midrash texts highlight the importance of being a servant of God, with examples from biblical figures like Abraham, Joseph, and Moses. Targum emphasizes God's promise to bless Isaac for Abraham's righteousness, while Tosefta teaches that blessings come through physical deeds like planting seeds and giving thanks, establishing the obligation of Birkat Hamazon. 

|וַיִּ֧בֶן שָׁ֣ם מִזְבֵּ֗חַ וַיִּקְרָא֙ בְּשֵׁ֣ם יְהֹוָ֔ה וַיֶּט־שָׁ֖ם אׇהֳל֑וֹ וַיִּכְרוּ־שָׁ֥ם עַבְדֵי־יִצְחָ֖ק בְּאֵֽר׃|25 J|So he built an altar there and invoked יהוה by name. Isaac pitched his tent there and his servants started digging a well.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yitzchak dug wells to separate from idolaters and cleave to God's attributes, symbolizing Torah study, Temple sacrifices, and patience in suffering. The well named "Sheva" hints at future goodness for those who suffer for God's name, and when God appeared to Yitzchak, he stopped all other preparations to receive Him. Isaac's success in digging a well in Beersheba resulted in a treaty with Avimelech, showing God's timing and Isaac's proclamation of the Lord's name. Isaac redug wells his father Abraham had dug, including one in Beersheba, where Jacob later lingered before going to Egypt. Moses, Aaron, and elders of Israel dug a well honored as "a well dug by princes," passing down knowledge of God through the generations. Yitzchok built an altar, prayed in the Name of Adonoy, set up his tent, and had his servants dig a well at that location according to Targum Jonathan on Genesis 26:25. 

|וַאֲבִימֶ֕לֶךְ הָלַ֥ךְ אֵלָ֖יו מִגְּרָ֑ר וַאֲחֻזַּת֙ מֵֽרֵעֵ֔הוּ וּפִיכֹ֖ל שַׂר־צְבָאֽוֹ׃|26 J|And Abimelech came to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his councilor and Phicol chief of his troops.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashbam, Or HaChaim, Radak, Rashi, and Chizkuni offer interpretations of Avimelech's visit to Isaac, with varying explanations for the entourage he brought. The Midrash emphasizes the transient nature of happiness and success, using examples from various biblical figures to highlight the need to be prepared for changes in fortune. The commentary on Jacob's naming of his son and the oath regarding Shechem illustrates the importance of fulfilling promises and oaths in Jewish tradition. Targum Jonathan describes Avimelech's visit to Isaac with his entourage, including his chief of the army, to address the impact of Isaac's departure on their land. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵהֶם֙ יִצְחָ֔ק מַדּ֖וּעַ בָּאתֶ֣ם אֵלָ֑י וְאַתֶּם֙ שְׂנֵאתֶ֣ם אֹתִ֔י וַתְּשַׁלְּח֖וּנִי מֵאִתְּכֶֽם׃|27 J|Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, seeing that you have been hostile to me and have driven me away from you?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac questions Avimelech's motives for approaching him, suggesting they are rooted in jealousy and fear of God's promise to Abraham. Despite a covenant being made between them, Isaac challenges Avimelech's intentions, implying their hatred will not disappear. The Midrash highlights the importance of giving and receiving rebuke for establishing peace, contrasting Isaac's approach to conflict resolution with that of Abraham and Jacob. In the Targum, Yitzchok questions why his enemies seek his help after previously driving him away and hating him. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֗וּ רָא֣וֹ רָאִ֘ינוּ֮ כִּֽי־הָיָ֣ה יְהֹוָ֣ה ׀ עִמָּךְ֒ וַנֹּ֗אמֶר תְּהִ֨י נָ֥א אָלָ֛ה בֵּינוֹתֵ֖ינוּ בֵּינֵ֣ינוּ וּבֵינֶ֑ךָ וְנִכְרְתָ֥ה בְרִ֖ית עִמָּֽךְ׃|28 J|And they said, “We now see plainly that יהוה has been with you, and we thought: Let there be a sworn treaty between our two parties, between you and us. Let us make a pact with you|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Avraham's heightened spiritual awareness when encountering the three strangers, paralleled in the teachings of the Tzaddik after visiting the Land of Israel. Commentary from Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Sforno, Or HaChaim, Radak, Tur HaArokh, and Siftei Chakhamim provides insights on the pact between Isaac and Avimelech, emphasizing the continuation of the oath from Abraham's time. The Midrash highlights the importance of submitting to divine will in times of suffering and seeking justice for the persecuted, while the Targum describes the blessings brought by Isaac's presence and the proposed oath and covenant with him by the people. Ramban, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Chizkuni provide interpretations on various biblical texts and concepts. 

|אִם־תַּעֲשֵׂ֨ה עִמָּ֜נוּ רָעָ֗ה כַּאֲשֶׁר֙ לֹ֣א נְגַֽעֲנ֔וּךָ וְכַאֲשֶׁ֨ר עָשִׂ֤ינוּ עִמְּךָ֙ רַק־ט֔וֹב וַנְּשַׁלֵּֽחֲךָ֖ בְּשָׁל֑וֹם אַתָּ֥ה עַתָּ֖ה בְּר֥וּךְ יְהֹוָֽה׃|29 J|that you will not do us harm, just as we have not molested you but have always dealt kindly with you and sent you away in peace. From now on, be you blessed of יהוה!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avimelech seeks peace with Yitzhak due to his recognition of Yitzhak's blessings and power, leading to the renewal of the covenant with Abraham. The Rambam and Ramban describe holy figures as both scholars and warriors, with the Ramban highlighting the threat posed by the covenant with God. The people wanted to establish a covenant with Isaac, but their intentions were not entirely good. Radak and Ibn Ezra explain the respect shown to the Patriarchs by kings and the significance of bearing false witness. The Targums emphasize that Avimelech and his people acted with good intentions towards Isaac. 

|וַיַּ֤עַשׂ לָהֶם֙ מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה וַיֹּאכְל֖וּ וַיִּשְׁתּֽוּ׃|30 J|Then he made for them a feast, and they ate and drank.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Kedushat Levi, the absence of a festive meal when Abraham entertained angels is explained by the idea of a righteous person elevating the spiritual status of a wicked person through a meal. Yitzchok's feast for Abimelech in Genesis, Toldot 15, serves as a reminder for Israelites during exile of their forebears facing danger and persecution yet being sought after by powerful kings. Isaac's actions in Gerar during a famine, where he claims Rebekah as his sister out of fear, are met with kindness by Abimelech, who remembers the covenant with Abraham and provides for Isaac until the famine ends. Eating together can create strong bonds, as seen in various biblical examples, while maintaining spiritual purity is emphasized through Daniel and his friends refusing non-kosher food in exile. Yitzchok's feast for Abimelech and his companions is highlighted in Targum as a shared meal. 

|וַיַּשְׁכִּ֣ימוּ בַבֹּ֔קֶר וַיִּשָּׁבְע֖וּ אִ֣ישׁ לְאָחִ֑יו וַיְשַׁלְּחֵ֣ם יִצְחָ֔ק וַיֵּלְכ֥וּ מֵאִתּ֖וֹ בְּשָׁלֽוֹם׃|31 J|Early in the morning, they exchanged oaths. Isaac then bade them farewell, and they departed from him in peace.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac made a covenant with Abimelech and Phicol before parting ways in peace, emphasizing the importance of maintaining friendly relations. Celebratory meals are customary for certain mitzvot like circumcision, with expenses seen as separate from other obligations. Pharaoh's change of heart towards the Israelites led to him being rewarded with a burial place, despite his initial refusal to let them go. Esau despised his birthright due to mortal danger, not poverty, and Isaac's dim vision was attributed to old age, not a punishment from God. Isaac's desire for venison was typical of kings, and Jacob was not given wealth before fleeing to prevent jealousy and danger. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe Isaac sending off his guests with a covenant and blessings, praying for their peace as they departed. 

|וַיְהִ֣י ׀ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֗וּא וַיָּבֹ֙אוּ֙ עַבְדֵ֣י יִצְחָ֔ק וַיַּגִּ֣דוּ ל֔וֹ עַל־אֹד֥וֹת הַבְּאֵ֖ר אֲשֶׁ֣ר חָפָ֑רוּ וַיֹּ֥אמְרוּ ל֖וֹ מָצָ֥אנוּ מָֽיִם׃|32 J|That same day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac's servants found water in a well, symbolizing a connection to God as the source of life-force. Those attached to God receive a continuous flow of life-force, while sin can create blockages. The well dug by Isaac was likely the same one dug by Abraham and stopped up by the Philistines, demonstrating Isaac's success to Abimelech. The event was timed by God to show Isaac's prosperity. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֥א אֹתָ֖הּ שִׁבְעָ֑ה עַל־כֵּ֤ן שֵׁם־הָעִיר֙ בְּאֵ֣ר שֶׁ֔בַע עַ֖ד הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּֽה׃|33 J|He named it Shibah;  therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Abraham and Isaac both named Beersheba, ensuring its enduring significance and connection to oaths, with the name alluding to the Tabernacle at Shiloh. The gravity of oaths and importance of swearing in the Name of God is emphasized in Kabbalah, with the term Oath-Shevuah founded on the Sefirah of the Living God. In the Midrash, Abraham mourns Sarah's death, negotiates for the cave of Machpelah, arranges Isaac's marriage to Rebekah, and sends Eliezer to find a wife for Isaac. Confirmation of Isaac's status as heir is established through material blessings in the Quoting Commentary, with the explanation of the name Be'er-Sheva. Targum explains that Isaac named the city Shiva/Sheba in Genesis 26:33, leading to its name Beersheba. 

|וַיְהִ֤י עֵשָׂו֙ בֶּן־אַרְבָּעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה וַיִּקַּ֤ח אִשָּׁה֙ אֶת־יְהוּדִ֔ית בַּת־בְּאֵרִ֖י הַֽחִתִּ֑י וְאֶת־בָּ֣שְׂמַ֔ת בַּת־אֵילֹ֖ן הַֽחִתִּֽי׃|34 P|When Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau married Yehudit and Basmat, symbolizing his spiritual corruption and disregard for his heritage, leading to bitterness and strife within the family. His marriages reflected his pursuit of external appearances over spiritual values, causing unhappiness to Isaac and Rebecca and leading to his eyes becoming dim at the age of forty. Esau's choice of wives, including Canaanite women, showed his failure to understand the covenant and the importance of choosing the right marriage partner, as he took authority over his own marriages without his father's approval. 

|וַתִּהְיֶ֖יןָ מֹ֣רַת ר֑וּחַ לְיִצְחָ֖ק וּלְרִבְקָֽה׃|35 P|and they were a source of bitterness to Isaac and Rebekah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau's wives caused mental anguish and discord within the family, leading to frustration and opposition to the parents' wishes. Their rebellious behavior, possibly influenced by idol worship, resulted in Esau receiving a blessing that fueled his hatred towards Jacob, leading to Jacob fleeing for his life. The wives' conduct significantly impacted family dynamics and subsequent events. The term "מורה" in Deuteronomy 21:18:3 is interpreted by Chizkuni as meaning "rebellious," as seen in Genesis 26:35. The Targums on Genesis 26:35 describe Esau's wives as rebellious and disrespectful, engaging in strange worship and rejecting instruction from Isaac and Rebekah. 

## Genesis 27

|וַֽיְהִי֙ כִּֽי־זָקֵ֣ן יִצְחָ֔ק וַתִּכְהֶ֥יןָ עֵינָ֖יו מֵרְאֹ֑ת וַיִּקְרָ֞א אֶת־עֵשָׂ֣ו ׀ בְּנ֣וֹ הַגָּדֹ֗ל וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָיו֙ בְּנִ֔י וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖יו הִנֵּֽנִי׃|1 J|When Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.” He answered, “Here I am.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yitzchak Avinu's blindness is contrasted with Moshe Rabeynu's ability to see the land of Israel from afar, embodying the three Patriarchs. The concept of blindness is associated with kelipah and Lilith, while getting too close to Godliness can harm one's eyes. Different interpretations suggest reasons for Yitzchak's failing eyesight, including divine affliction, punishment, or prevention from leaving his house. Darkness in Kabbalah represents a withdrawal of judgment and elevation to mercy, linked to the shofar and the creation of light. The Midrash explains Isaac's weakened eyesight as punishment for taking a bribe from Esau, contrasting his righteous end with the fate of the wicked. Job's rebellious behavior is attributed to a failure to recognize divine judgment, highlighting the importance of distancing oneself from evildoers in Musar teachings. Rabbi Elazar warns against taking curses lightly, as seen in the fulfillment of Abimelech's curse on Sarah resulting in Isaac's blindness. Isaac's fading eyesight due to seeing the Throne of Glory is mentioned in Targum, with Esau responding to his father's revelation. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר הִנֵּה־נָ֖א זָקַ֑נְתִּי לֹ֥א יָדַ֖עְתִּי י֥וֹם מוֹתִֽי׃|2 J|And he said, “I am old now, and I do not know how soon I may die.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators discuss Isaac's uncertainty about his impending death, Rebecca's motives for changing Isaac's words, and the significance of Esau's arguments for a blessing. The Midrash reflects on mortality, legal judgments, and the obscurities of death and consolation. Isaac's transition from Justice to Mercy, his spiritual equivalence to Adam, and his connection to the holy soil of Israel are explored in Musar. Additionally, Rabbeinu Bahya explains God's anger towards Bileam, Gad's complex background, Isaac's love for Esau, and the meaning of the Vale of Siddim in Targum. Yitzchok's acknowledgment of his old age and uncertainty about death is highlighted in both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan. 

|וְעַתָּה֙ שָׂא־נָ֣א כֵלֶ֔יךָ תֶּלְיְךָ֖ וְקַשְׁתֶּ֑ךָ וְצֵא֙ הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה וְצ֥וּדָה לִּ֖י ׃|3 J|Take your gear, your quiver and bow, and go out into the open and hunt me some game.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 27:3, Yitzchak instructs Esav to inspect his flawless slaughter knife, with commentators like Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Sforno, Radak, Tur HaArokh, Ba'al ha-Turim, Nefesh HaChayim, and Midrash Tanchuma Buber offering interpretations on the significance of hunting tools and proper slaughtering. Kabbalistic texts emphasize the importance of peace of mind and diligent study, while Talmudic texts from Tractate Soferim 7:2 discuss the pronunciation of certain words. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan provide translations of the instruction given to Jacob in Genesis 27:3 to take his hunting tools to procure food for his father. 

|וַעֲשֵׂה־לִ֨י מַטְעַמִּ֜ים כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר אָהַ֛בְתִּי וְהָבִ֥יאָה לִּ֖י וְאֹכֵ֑לָה בַּעֲב֛וּר תְּבָרֶכְךָ֥ נַפְשִׁ֖י בְּטֶ֥רֶם אָמֽוּת׃|4 J|Then prepare a dish for me such as I like, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my innermost blessing before I die.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut compares positive commandments to preparing a tasty dish for God, symbolizing good deeds on Rosh HaShanah. Isaac intended to bless Esau for the land and covenant, emphasizing the taste of food for a joyous blessing. Halakhah highlights Jacob's contentment with necessities and prioritizing personal integrity. Jewish Thought discusses Isaac's love for Esau and the importance of joy in blessings. Kabbalah emphasizes the importance of positive precepts and commandments to bring the Holy One closer. Midrash explores the patriarchs' knowledge of their impending death and the significance of items given to Esau. Musar links Isaac's desire for delicacies before blessing Esau to the future meal for the righteous in the World to Come. Quoting Commentary discusses the spiritual benefits of the future meal of the righteous and the importance of recognizing God's presence. Tanakh emphasizes the importance of love in blessings, as seen in Yitzhak's request for food he loved before blessing Esav. Targum translates Genesis 27:4 similarly, with Isaac asking for a tasty dish to bless Esau before he dies. 

|וְרִבְקָ֣ה שֹׁמַ֔עַת בְּדַבֵּ֣ר יִצְחָ֔ק אֶל־עֵשָׂ֖ו בְּנ֑וֹ וַיֵּ֤לֶךְ עֵשָׂו֙ הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה לָצ֥וּד צַ֖יִד לְהָבִֽיא׃|5 J|Rebekah had been listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau had gone out into the open to hunt game to bring home,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebekah advised Jacob to deceive Isaac to receive Esau's blessing by preparing a meal with goats, emphasizing the importance of interpreting deeper meanings in Jewish texts. In Kabbalah, Rebekah's actions ensured the survival of the Jewish people. The Midrash connects tithing to wealth and highlights the consequences of neglecting it. Rashi and Ramban provide interpretations of the text, discussing the significance of offerings and the similarities between a kid and a deer. Targum emphasizes Rebekah's role in ensuring Jacob received the blessing intended for Esau. 

|וְרִבְקָה֙ אָֽמְרָ֔ה אֶל־יַעֲקֹ֥ב בְּנָ֖הּ לֵאמֹ֑ר הִנֵּ֤ה שָׁמַ֙עְתִּי֙ אֶת־אָבִ֔יךָ מְדַבֵּ֛ר אֶל־עֵשָׂ֥ו אָחִ֖יךָ לֵאמֹֽר׃|6 J|Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I overheard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca informed Jacob about Isaac sending Esau for the blessing, referred to Esau as Jacob's brother, and used the word "saying" to relay Isaac's words. Yaakov prayed after being aroused by tasty foods, and it was decreed by God that Jacob would rule the world if Esau was not blessed. R. Johanan emphasized promoting peace for longevity, Jacob's actions were strategic, and Rebecca's instructions were to advance the nation. Positive and negative commandments in the Torah separate and sanctify the Jewish people, with positive commandments likened to delicious dishes. Rivkah heard Isaac speaking to Esau and informed Jacob about the treasures of the dew being opened that night. 

|הָבִ֨יאָה לִּ֥י צַ֛יִד וַעֲשֵׂה־לִ֥י מַטְעַמִּ֖ים וְאֹכֵ֑לָה וַאֲבָרֶכְכָ֛ה לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה לִפְנֵ֥י מוֹתִֽי׃|7 J|‘Bring me some game and prepare a dish for me to eat, that I may bless you, with יהוה’s approval, before I die.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various interpretations of Rivkah's phrase "before the Lord" in relation to Yitzchok's blessing include divine approval and prophetic importance. In the Kabbalah, Esau's desire for blessings leads to a questioning of Jacob's fate. The Midrash discusses blessings, assistance to Israel being assistance to the Holy Spirit, and the significance of blessings from patriarchs. Rabbeinu Bahya connects blessings to wisdom, Ibn Ezra discusses the preservation of meaning in Scripture and the commandment to honor parents, and Targum Jonathan emphasizes Isaac's request for venison before blessing Esau in the presence of the Lord. 

|וְעַתָּ֥ה בְנִ֖י שְׁמַ֣ע בְּקֹלִ֑י לַאֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲנִ֖י מְצַוָּ֥ה אֹתָֽךְ׃|8 J|Now, my son, listen carefully as I instruct you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca instructs her son to bring her two young kids for sacrifice, emphasizing her authority as a prophetess and the importance of obeying prophets even if it involves deception. The details of the menorah construction in the Torah symbolize enlightenment and wisdom, with each component serving a specific function in man's development. Rivkah cooked two dishes on Pesach eve in Kabbalah to exterminate the Evil Inclination and allow faith to govern, while in Midrash, Rebecca instructs Jacob to deceive Isaac to receive blessings, seen as advancing the nation and symbolizing blessings and atonement for future generations. Onkelos Genesis 27:8 and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 27:8 both convey the message of a command being given to a son to listen and receive instructions. 

|לֶךְ־נָא֙ אֶל־הַצֹּ֔אן וְקַֽח־לִ֣י מִשָּׁ֗ם שְׁנֵ֛י גְּדָיֵ֥י עִזִּ֖ים טֹבִ֑ים וְאֶֽעֱשֶׂ֨ה אֹתָ֧ם מַטְעַמִּ֛ים לְאָבִ֖יךָ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר אָהֵֽב׃|9 J|Go to the flock and fetch me two choice kids, and I will make of them a dish for your father, such as he likes.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca instructed Jacob to bring two choice goat kids for Isaac, one for a meal and one for a sin offering, symbolizing his ascendancy over Esau and securing forgiveness for his descendants. Isaac was likely to mistake the taste of goat meat for that of deer, so Rebecca prepared it for him. The sacrifices made by Jacob for Isaac were considered good for both him and his descendants, leading to blessings and atonement. Esau's choice to marry Maḥalat from Ishmael was seen as a possible step towards repentance. Rebecca instructed Jacob to take two good goats for his father's blessing, as Isaac had stipulated in her marriage contract. 

|וְהֵבֵאתָ֥ לְאָבִ֖יךָ וְאָכָ֑ל בַּעֲבֻ֛ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר יְבָרֶכְךָ֖ לִפְנֵ֥י מוֹתֽוֹ׃|10 J|Then take it to your father to eat, in order that he may bless you before he dies.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Midrash teaches that the heavenly court first takes away a person's trust in G‑d before punishing them, reflecting the chasidic belief that faith can draw down guidance and afflictions only come after depression. Rebecca advises Jacob to bring food to Isaac to put him in a good mood for a blessing, as the Holy Spirit only rests on those in a positive state. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both emphasize the act of bringing food to receive a blessing before death in Genesis 27:10. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֔ב אֶל־רִבְקָ֖ה אִמּ֑וֹ הֵ֣ן עֵשָׂ֤ו אָחִי֙ אִ֣ישׁ שָׂעִ֔ר וְאָנֹכִ֖י אִ֥ישׁ חָלָֽק׃|11 J|Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am smooth-skinned.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the wicked receive their ruach from the impure ruach of Esav, who is described as hairy and powerful. Kabbalah relates Esav's portion to the scapegoat, representing his impurity and association with lower beings. Midrash discusses the relationship between Moses and Aaron, Jacob and Esau, and the importance of honoring parents. Musar connects Esau's power as an accuser to the Sa-ir mentioned in Leviticus 17:7, highlighting the vulnerability of Torah scholars. Quoting Commentary discusses the sending away of the scapegoat to prevent interference with offerings to God and the connection to Esau and Samael. Second Temple texts depict Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as naked or smooth, symbolizing their spiritual dedication. Targum Jonathan on Genesis 27:11 explains Jacob's concern about being cursed by his father for deceiving him about Esav's appearance. 

|אוּלַ֤י יְמֻשֵּׁ֙נִי֙ אָבִ֔י וְהָיִ֥יתִי בְעֵינָ֖יו כִּמְתַעְתֵּ֑עַ וְהֵבֵאתִ֥י עָלַ֛י קְלָלָ֖ה וְלֹ֥א בְרָכָֽה׃|12 J|If my father touches me, I shall appear to him as a trickster and bring upon myself a curse, not a blessing.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob was not concerned about vocal recognition from Isaac, as he believed their voices were similar, but he feared being recognized by touch to avoid being cursed for deceiving his father by pretending to be Esau. The word "yemusheni" is related to "yesubeni," indicating a similarity in meaning, and "ki-metate'a" means "as a mocker," coming from the same root as "to'eh." Jacob may have altered his voice to sound like Esau's, a common practice of impersonating others' voices. Rebekah heard Jacob knocking and sent him to greet Isaac, who intended to bless both Jacob and Esau but only called Esau to avoid supplanting the genealogical chain. Esau honored his father by serving him in fine garments, while Jacob followed Rebekah's instructions to receive Isaac's blessing. The text warns against lying to manipulate others, comparing it to idolatry and emphasizing the importance of honesty in speech to avoid desecrating the divine Name. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Eliezer b. Jacob equate amending the truth in speech with idol worship, using Jacob's actions in Genesis 27:12 as an example. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the fear of being seen as an impostor or mocker by Isaac in Genesis 27:12. 

|וַתֹּ֤אמֶר לוֹ֙ אִמּ֔וֹ עָלַ֥י קִלְלָתְךָ֖ בְּנִ֑י אַ֛ךְ שְׁמַ֥ע בְּקֹלִ֖י וְלֵ֥ךְ קַֽח־לִֽי׃|13 J|But his mother said to him, “Your curse, my son, be upon me! Just do as I say and go fetch them for me.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebekah offers to take any curse that may come upon Jacob in order for him to receive the blessings from Isaac, with different commentaries emphasizing her love for Jacob and the righteousness of Jacob compared to Esau. The Midrash justifies Jacob's deception as a means to prevent a curse and highlights Esau's wickedness. Musar suggests that Rebekah's statement indicates a recognition of the spiritual dynamics between Jacob and Esau. Rashi draws parallels between Rebekah's reassurance to Jacob and Naomi's reassurance to Ruth, while Ibn Ezra offers an alternative interpretation of Aaron's role in the making of the golden calf. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan provide translations of Rebekah's words to Jacob, emphasizing the impact of blessings and curses on him and his descendants. 

|וַיֵּ֙לֶךְ֙ וַיִּקַּ֔ח וַיָּבֵ֖א לְאִמּ֑וֹ וַתַּ֤עַשׂ אִמּוֹ֙ מַטְעַמִּ֔ים כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר אָהֵ֥ב אָבִֽיו׃|14 J|He got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared a dish such as his father liked.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca convinces Jacob to deceive Isaac for the blessing, believing the plan was divinely inspired and ensuring there will be no curse by convincing Isaac of Jacob's righteousness. Rashbam explains that in Exodus 12:39, "כי לא חמץ" means the dough had not become fermented, showing how adjectives in the Torah indicate what led to the present state of something. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan describe how Jacob brought the food to his mother in Genesis 27:14, who then prepared a dish that Isaac loved. 

|וַתִּקַּ֣ח רִ֠בְקָ֠ה אֶת־בִּגְדֵ֨י עֵשָׂ֜ו בְּנָ֤הּ הַגָּדֹל֙ הַחֲמֻדֹ֔ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר אִתָּ֖הּ בַּבָּ֑יִת וַתַּלְבֵּ֥שׁ אֶֽת־יַעֲקֹ֖ב בְּנָ֥הּ הַקָּטָֽן׃|15 J|Rebekah then took the best clothes of her older son Esau, which were there  in the house, and had her younger son Jacob put them on;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebekah dressed Jacob in Esau's fine garments to transfer the blessing, emphasizing the importance of commandments and symbolic significance of garments. Esau's garments were costly and originally belonged to Adam, passed down through generations. Adam's garments were decorated with drawings of animals and birds, showing God's mercy. Esau desired these garments, as they were considered desirable. The text also discusses the importance of performing mitzvot with dedication and wisdom, as seen in Rebbi Joḥanan's insight in the Talmud. 

|וְאֵ֗ת עֹרֹת֙ גְּדָיֵ֣י הָֽעִזִּ֔ים הִלְבִּ֖ישָׁה עַל־יָדָ֑יו וְעַ֖ל חֶלְקַ֥ת צַוָּארָֽיו׃|16 J|and she covered his hands and the hairless part of his neck with the skins of the kids.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebekah used goats' skins to deceive Isaac into blessing Jacob instead of Esau, as described in the Kabbalah, Midrash, Musar, Second Temple, Talmud, and Targum commentaries. The Talmud discusses the interpretation of the word "kid" in Chullin 113b:2, while the Musar commentary emphasizes the principle of tit for tat in the punishment of Jacob, his sons, and Yehudah. Rebekah's deception with the goat skins led to similar actions by Jacob's sons, highlighting the theme of justice in the narrative. 

|וַתִּתֵּ֧ן אֶת־הַמַּטְעַמִּ֛ים וְאֶת־הַלֶּ֖חֶם אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑תָה בְּיַ֖ד יַעֲקֹ֥ב בְּנָֽהּ׃|17 J|Then she put in the hands of her son Jacob the dish and the bread that she had prepared.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebekah gave Jacob a well-spiced dish and fresh bread to take to Isaac as requested, with Jacob reluctantly participating in the deception. In the Midrash, Isaac receiving wine from the Garden of Eden is linked to blessings, and Jacob's large arms covered in skins hint at miraculous acts. Rashi explains the use of the plural form "necks" in Scripture, clarifying Binyamin's actions, while the Targum confirms Rebekah giving the food to Jacob. 

|וַיָּבֹ֥א אֶל־אָבִ֖יו וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אָבִ֑י וַיֹּ֣אמֶר הִנֶּ֔נִּי מִ֥י אַתָּ֖ה בְּנִֽי׃|18 J|He went to his father and said, “Father.” And he said, “Yes, which of my sons are you?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In the Kabbalah commentary, Jacob's respectful approach to Isaac is contrasted with Esau's impolite speech. The Midrash discusses Jacob's deceit to receive blessings meant for Esau, highlighting the consequences of deceit and the inability to curse those whom God has not cursed. In the Targum, both Onkelos and Jonathan versions depict Jacob identifying himself as Isaac's son when approaching him. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֜ב אֶל־אָבִ֗יו אָנֹכִי֙ עֵשָׂ֣ו בְּכֹרֶ֔ךָ עָשִׂ֕יתִי כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּ֖רְתָּ אֵלָ֑י קֽוּם־נָ֣א שְׁבָ֗ה וְאׇכְלָה֙ מִצֵּידִ֔י בַּעֲב֖וּר תְּבָרְכַ֥נִּי נַפְשֶֽׁךָ׃|19 J|Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your first-born; I have done as you told me. Pray sit up and eat of my game, that you may give me your innermost blessing.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Some commentators suggest that prophets may stretch the truth in certain circumstances, such as foreseeing the future, as seen in examples involving King David, Elisha, Micaiah, and Daniel. The Bible portrays instances of deception and manipulation through words, highlighting the dark side of leadership and followership, with examples like the snake lying to Eve, Jacob deceiving his father, and Joseph's brothers deceiving Jacob. In Zohar Toldot 19:158, Jacob speaks humbly to his father, while Esau is impertinent. Esau's laziness led to him losing blessings to Jacob, and despite deceiving his father, Jacob was not considered a liar. In Genesis 27:19, Yaakov pretends to be Eisov to receive his father's blessing by bringing him food as instructed, as seen in the Targum Jonathan version of the same verse. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יִצְחָק֙ אֶל־בְּנ֔וֹ מַה־זֶּ֛ה מִהַ֥רְתָּ לִמְצֹ֖א בְּנִ֑י וַיֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֥י הִקְרָ֛ה יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לְפָנָֽי׃|20 J|Isaac said to his son, “How did you succeed so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because your God יהוה granted me good fortune.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac became suspicious of Jacob pretending to be Esau due to his quick return from the hunt and mentioning God, leading Isaac to realize that Jacob, not Esau, was before him. The Derashot HaRan and Akeidat Yitzchak commentaries discuss Isaac blessing Jacob with good intentions, divine assistance, and outstanding moral stature. In the Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Jacob's actions are justified by following God's guidance, with angels supporting him during the crucial moment. Rashi's interpretation of the verb "קרה" in Numbers 35:11:1 is linked to Genesis 27:20, while a debate on calendrical calculations as a commandment is discussed. The Second Temple text emphasizes the swift acquisition of divine knowledge for perfect happiness, contrasting with earthly teachings, and the Targum highlights Yaakov attributing his success to God's preparation. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יִצְחָק֙ אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֔ב גְּשָׁה־נָּ֥א וַאֲמֻֽשְׁךָ֖ בְּנִ֑י הַֽאַתָּ֥ה זֶ֛ה בְּנִ֥י עֵשָׂ֖ו אִם־לֹֽא׃|21 J|Isaac said to Jacob, “Come closer that I may feel you, my son—whether you are really my son Esau or not.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac wanted to feel Esau to confirm his identity, believing Esau wouldn't mention God's name easily due to his lifestyle. Isaac blessed Jacob with reservations, assuming the Blessed One wouldn't allow harm to Esau. Jacob sang a song when Isaac mistook him for Esau, crying out to Hashem in distress. God sent angels to support Isaac when he mistook Jacob for Esau, reassuring him not to fear. Isaac questioned how Jacob quickly found the blessing, realizing it was God's coordination. Isaac asked Jacob to come closer so he could touch him and determine if he was really Esau or not. 

|וַיִּגַּ֧שׁ יַעֲקֹ֛ב אֶל־יִצְחָ֥ק אָבִ֖יו וַיְמֻשֵּׁ֑הוּ וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הַקֹּל֙ ק֣וֹל יַעֲקֹ֔ב וְהַיָּדַ֖יִם יְדֵ֥י עֵשָֽׂו׃|22 J|So Jacob drew close to his father Isaac, who felt him and wondered. “The voice is the voice of Jacob, yet the hands are the hands of Esau.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the symbolism of wine at the Passover Seder and the importance of Torah study in sorting out sparks. Commentary highlights Yitzchok's reliance on touch to differentiate between Yaakov and Esau. Jewish Thought discusses deception in the Bible and the significance of fulfilling one's purpose. Kabbalah focuses on rivers symbolizing truth and the voice of Jacob. Midrash recounts the avenging of Zekharya's blood. Musar highlights the power of children's voices and the righteousness of Torah study. Quoting Commentary explores the connection between Moses' prayer for water and Jacob's blessing. Responsa prohibits wearing tefillin outside. Talmud discusses the destruction of the Temple by Rome. Tanakh emphasizes the Israelites crying out to יהוה. Targum depicts Yitzchok recognizing the voice of Yaakov and the hands of Esau. 

|וְלֹ֣א הִכִּיר֔וֹ כִּֽי־הָי֣וּ יָדָ֗יו כִּידֵ֛י עֵשָׂ֥ו אָחִ֖יו שְׂעִרֹ֑ת וַֽיְבָרְכֵֽהוּ׃|23 J|He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; and so he blessed him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac initially suspected Jacob of being an imposter but ended up blessing him after confirming his identity as Esau through his hairy hands. Jacob cried out to God when Isaac questioned his identity. Noah warned the generation of the flood for 120 years before building the ark, Isaac did not recognize Jacob at first due to Esau's wickedness but blessed him after foreseeing his repentance. God showed Isaac the Temple built and destroyed in the future. The Shechinah dwells among the Jewish people even when contaminated. The Israelites heard the voice of God in Deuteronomy 4:12. Yitzchok did not recognize Jacob because of his hairy hands. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר אַתָּ֥ה זֶ֖ה בְּנִ֣י עֵשָׂ֑ו וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אָֽנִי׃|24 J|He asked, “Are you really my son Esau?” And when he said, “I am,”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac initially mistook Jacob for Esau, seeking confirmation of his identity before giving the blessing, focusing on the person in front of him rather than the name. The Midrash discusses the significance of wine in blessings and the symbolism of odor and garments, emphasizing the importance of abstaining from wine. Musar highlights Isaac's intention for blessings to apply in the Hereafter or this world, with the wine symbolizing Paradise. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos convey Jacob confirming his identity as Esau to Isaac. 

|וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הַגִּ֤שָׁה לִּי֙ וְאֹֽכְלָה֙ מִצֵּ֣יד בְּנִ֔י לְמַ֥עַן תְּבָֽרֶכְךָ֖ נַפְשִׁ֑י וַיַּגֶּשׁ־לוֹ֙ וַיֹּאכַ֔ל וַיָּ֧בֵא ל֦וֹ יַ֖יִן וַיֵּֽשְׁתְּ׃|25 J|he said, “Serve me and let me eat of my son’s game that I may give you my innermost blessing.” So he served him and he ate, and he brought him wine and he drank.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov represents judgment and gevurot, symbolized by wine, bringing a blessing. Ibn Ezra explains grammatical nuances in the text, Radak notes customary language, and Tur HaArokh suggests Gavriel brought the wine. In Kabbalah, wine brings complete joy, similar to Levites needing cheering. Isaac asked Esau about the source of wine, suggesting it was from the Garden of Eden. The Midrash mentions references to Torah, Prophets, Talmud, and Midrashim in Isaac's blessing. Taste includes joy, grief, penitence, and tranquility, with pleasure from eating and drinking. Speech can bring joy or grief, as illustrated in Proverbs and 1 Samuel. In Targum, an angel provided wine from ancient grapes for Isaac to drink. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖יו יִצְחָ֣ק אָבִ֑יו גְּשָׁה־נָּ֥א וּשְׁקָה־לִּ֖י בְּנִֽי׃|26 J|Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come close and kiss me, my son”;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yitzchak asked Yaakov to kiss him to identify him, using smell and touch due to his blindness. Yitzchak felt close to Yaakov after eating, leading to the request for a kiss. In the Midrash, Jacob smelled like the Garden of Eden, while Esau smelled like Gehenna. Or HaChaim explains that mentioning Sinai in Deuteronomy 33:2 shows the spiritual level of the Jewish people, creating a suitable mindset for blessings. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan offer different translations of Yitzchak's words in Genesis 27:26. 

|וַיִּגַּשׁ֙ וַיִּשַּׁק־ל֔וֹ וַיָּ֛רַח אֶת־רֵ֥יחַ בְּגָדָ֖יו וַֽיְבָרְכֵ֑הוּ וַיֹּ֗אמֶר רְאֵה֙ רֵ֣יחַ בְּנִ֔י כְּרֵ֣יחַ שָׂדֶ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר בֵּרְכ֖וֹ יְהֹוָֽה׃|27 J|and he went up and kissed him. And he smelled his clothes and he blessed him, saying, “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of the fields that יהוה has blessed. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the pleasing odour of Noach and Yitzchok, the significance of blessings for different experiences, the importance of the right hand in blessings, and the metaphor of tilling a field to unite with the divine. It also highlights Jacob's ability to foresee future events, the contrasting scents of Jacob and Esau, and the transfer of priestly garments from Adam to Isaac. The imagery of sweetness and desirability is used to describe the bride in Song of Songs. Targum Jonathan describes Yitzchok blessing Jacob after smelling the fragrance of his garments. 

|וְיִֽתֶּן־לְךָ֙ הָאֱלֹהִ֔ים מִטַּל֙ הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם וּמִשְׁמַנֵּ֖י הָאָ֑רֶץ וְרֹ֥ב דָּגָ֖ן וְתִירֹֽשׁ׃|28 J|“May God give you Of the dew of heaven and the fat of the earth, Abundance of new grain and wine. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the blessings of livelihood for the Jewish people, emphasizing the constant need for renewal and connection to the Divine. Halakhah details the rituals surrounding the berachah for bread, including hand placement and pronunciation. Jewish Thought discusses the pursuit of eternal life and spiritual blessings by the Patriarchs, prioritizing spiritual over material blessings. Kabbalah delves into the symbolism of dew in providing sustenance for the righteous. Liturgy references blessings leading to further blessings, while Midrash and Musar explore the dual interpretations of blessings in the Torah. Quoting Commentary offers various insights on the blessings in the Torah, connecting them to different aspects of Jewish thought. Second Temple and Talmudic sources discuss the significance of dew as a gift from God to the descendants of Abraham. Lastly, Tanakh and Targum emphasize the blessings of abundance and sustenance for the Jewish people. 

|יַֽעַבְד֣וּךָ עַמִּ֗ים לְךָ֙ לְאֻמִּ֔ים הֱוֵ֤ה גְבִיר֙ לְאַחֶ֔יךָ וְיִשְׁתַּחֲו֥וּ לְךָ֖ בְּנֵ֣י אִמֶּ֑ךָ אֹרְרֶ֣יךָ אָר֔וּר וּֽמְבָרְכֶ֖יךָ בָּרֽוּךְ׃|29 J|Let peoples serve you, And nations bow to you; Be master over your brothers, And let your mother’s sons bow to you. Cursed be they who curse you, Blessed they who bless you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac's blessings indicate that the righteous suffer before finding tranquility, while the wicked experience tranquility before affliction. Jacob's humbling of himself before Esau leads to eventual dominion over him. The Torah was passed down from Moses to the Men of the Great Assembly, emphasizing patience in justice and raising disciples. Jacob's dual task as Jacob and Israel involved neutralizing negative influences and promoting positive spiritual forces. Isaac prepared separate blessings for Esau and Jacob, with Jacob ultimately becoming the heir of the covenant. 

|וַיְהִ֗י כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר כִּלָּ֣ה יִצְחָק֮ לְבָרֵ֣ךְ אֶֽת־יַעֲקֹב֒ וַיְהִ֗י אַ֣ךְ יָצֹ֤א יָצָא֙ יַעֲקֹ֔ב מֵאֵ֥ת פְּנֵ֖י יִצְחָ֣ק אָבִ֑יו וְעֵשָׂ֣ו אָחִ֔יו בָּ֖א מִצֵּידֽוֹ׃|30 J|No sooner had Jacob left the presence of his father Isaac—after Isaac had finished blessing Jacob—than his brother Esau came back from his hunt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yitzchok initially hesitated to bless Yaakov, each patriarch associated with a different name of God representing different attributes. Yaakov narrowly received the blessing from Yitzchok before Esau arrived, highlighting the miraculous circumstances. In Kabbalah, Jacob and the Shechinah were blessed together, while Esau's hunting contained no blessing. The Midrash explains Jacob hid from Esau to avoid being killed after receiving the blessing, and Isaac trembled upon realizing his mistake. Moses portrays the constant battle between virtue and vice symbolized by Jacob and Esau. The Gemara discusses the size of a bird's face and the thickness of the Ark cover, while the Targum describes Esau returning after Jacob's blessing. 

|וַיַּ֤עַשׂ גַּם־הוּא֙ מַטְעַמִּ֔ים וַיָּבֵ֖א לְאָבִ֑יו וַיֹּ֣אמֶר לְאָבִ֗יו יָקֻ֤ם אָבִי֙ וְיֹאכַל֙ מִצֵּ֣יד בְּנ֔וֹ בַּעֲבֻ֖ר תְּבָרְכַ֥נִּי נַפְשֶֽׁךָ׃|31 J|He too prepared a dish and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father sit up and eat of his son’s game, so that you may give me your innermost blessing.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau prepared food for his father Isaac and woke him up to receive his blessing, showing disrespect compared to Jacob's humble approach. Repentance is urged for Israel to avoid harsh punishment from God, with cleansing the heart leading to salvation. Esau's impertinent behavior and offering of "bitter foods" symbolized his sinful nature, ultimately leading to God's disfavor. Esau's inability to catch game for his father's blessing was attributed to Satan's interference, highlighting his disrespectful speech towards his father and his later punishment by God. Targum Jonathan specifies that Esau made food out of a dog to bring to his father for the blessing. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר ל֛וֹ יִצְחָ֥ק אָבִ֖יו מִי־אָ֑תָּה וַיֹּ֕אמֶר אֲנִ֛י בִּנְךָ֥ בְכֹֽרְךָ֖ עֵשָֽׂו׃|32 J|His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, Esau, your first-born!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac mistook Jacob for Esau when he asked "Who are you?" leading to confusion when Esau entered. Jacob's humility towards Isaac results in blessings for his descendants, while Esau's lack of respect brings retribution. Reuven's offer to guarantee Benjamin's return is criticized in the Midrash, highlighting the consequences of his past actions. Ramban explains that Esau despised his birthright due to mortal danger, not poverty, and attributes Isaac's dim vision to old age. In Targum Jonathan and Onkelos, Esau identifies himself as the firstborn son when questioned by Isaac. 

|וַיֶּחֱרַ֨ד יִצְחָ֣ק חֲרָדָה֮ גְּדֹלָ֣ה עַד־מְאֹד֒ וַיֹּ֡אמֶר מִֽי־אֵפ֡וֹא ה֣וּא הַצָּֽד־צַ֩יִד֩ וַיָּ֨בֵא לִ֜י וָאֹכַ֥ל מִכֹּ֛ל בְּטֶ֥רֶם תָּב֖וֹא וָאֲבָרְכֵ֑הוּ גַּם־בָּר֖וּךְ יִהְיֶֽה׃|33 J|Isaac was seized with very violent trembling. “Who was it then,” he demanded, “that hunted game and brought it to me? Moreover, I ate of it before you came, and I blessed him; now he must remain blessed!”|

Chasidut emphasizes Yitzchok's blessings to Yaakov for both the world to come and success on earth, with the righteous focusing on the needs of others. Commentary delves into Yitzchok's realization and confirmation of Jacob's rightful blessing over Esau, while Liturgy calls for similar blessings for all worshippers. Kabbalah discusses the legions between earth and heaven, and Musar interprets the blessings in terms of material benefits or blessings of the Torah. Quoting Commentary explores interpretations of various biblical passages, and Responsa argues for Isaac's favor over Abraham and Jacob. Second Temple highlights moments of astonishment and ecstasy, while Talmud discusses repentance and a taste of the World-to-Come for the patriarchs. Targum depicts Yitzchok's surprise and confirmation of Jacob's blessing over Esau. 

|כִּשְׁמֹ֤עַ עֵשָׂו֙ אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֣י אָבִ֔יו וַיִּצְעַ֣ק צְעָקָ֔ה גְּדֹלָ֥ה וּמָרָ֖ה עַד־מְאֹ֑ד וַיֹּ֣אמֶר לְאָבִ֔יו בָּרְכֵ֥נִי גַם־אָ֖נִי אָבִֽי׃|34 J|When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst into wild and bitter sobbing, and said to his father, “Bless me too, Father!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau sought a blessing from his father after Jacob received the blessing of lordship, leading to a cycle of crying and punishment among descendants. Additionally, the Mishnah discusses clauses in marriage contracts regarding administering oaths, while the Targum portrays Esau's bitter cry for a blessing after Jacob's deception. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר בָּ֥א אָחִ֖יךָ בְּמִרְמָ֑ה וַיִּקַּ֖ח בִּרְכָתֶֽךָ׃|35 J|But he answered, “Your brother came with guile and took away your blessing.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov received Esau's blessing through deceit, which Isaac acknowledged as irreversible. Comforting mourners evolved from family visits to community responsibility, emphasized by the Sages for reward in Gehinnom. Abraham's fair purchase of Machpelah reflects justice, contrasting with Ephron's greed. Esau's deception led to hatred, Leah's children earned Jacob's love, and blessings passed down through generations. Jacob's trickery symbolizes defeating evil, ascending spiritually, and surpassing angels. Yitzchok confirmed Jacob's cunning in receiving Esau's blessing in Targum commentaries. 

|וַיֹּ֡אמֶר הֲכִי֩ קָרָ֨א שְׁמ֜וֹ יַעֲקֹ֗ב וַֽיַּעְקְבֵ֙נִי֙ זֶ֣ה פַעֲמַ֔יִם אֶת־בְּכֹרָתִ֣י לָקָ֔ח וְהִנֵּ֥ה עַתָּ֖ה לָקַ֣ח בִּרְכָתִ֑י וַיֹּאמַ֕ר הֲלֹא־אָצַ֥לְתָּ לִּ֖י בְּרָכָֽה׃|36 J|[Esau] said, “Was he, then, named Jacob that he might supplant  me these two times? First he took away my birthright and now he has taken away my blessing!” And he added, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov is associated with wisdom and intellect, outwitting others like Esav and Yitzchak, ultimately connected to speech and Torah, bringing healing to the soul. Various interpretations of Genesis 27:36 explore Esau's bitterness towards Jacob for deceiving him twice, questioning if he has any blessing left. Esau's respect for his father, the importance of honoring parents, and seeking refuge in Torah are highlighted in the Midrash. Esau's complaint about being tricked twice by Jacob is seen as justified retaliation for Esau's own deceptive actions, leading to ongoing tension between the brothers. Esau's anger at Jacob for taking his birthright and blessing, despite selling his birthright, reflects his unwillingness to let go of what he feels is rightfully his. People defrauding God by withholding tithes and contributions from priests is condemned in Malachi 3:8. 

|וַיַּ֨עַן יִצְחָ֜ק וַיֹּ֣אמֶר לְעֵשָׂ֗ו הֵ֣ן גְּבִ֞יר שַׂמְתִּ֥יו לָךְ֙ וְאֶת־כׇּל־אֶחָ֗יו נָתַ֤תִּי לוֹ֙ לַעֲבָדִ֔ים וְדָגָ֥ן וְתִירֹ֖שׁ סְמַכְתִּ֑יו וּלְכָ֣ה אֵפ֔וֹא מָ֥ה אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֖ה בְּנִֽי׃|37 J|Isaac answered, saying to Esau, “But I have made him master over you: I have given him all his brothers for servants, and sustained him with grain and wine. What, then, can I still do for you, my son?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac tells Esau that Jacob will be his master and all his brothers will serve him, hinting at Esau's descendants achieving superiority after 5000 years, while he will end up in Gehinom. Material possessions should be used for spiritual growth, as emphasized in the Akeidat Yitzchak. The Zohar discusses Esau's blessing suited for shedding blood and waging wars, acknowledging his unique qualities. Esau questioned why Jacob received the blessing, but Isaac explained Jacob's superiority and Esau's future prosperity. The symbolism of Isaac loving Esau and Jacob securing his birthright is discussed in Shenei Luchot HaBerit and Sha'arei Teshuvah. Shadal explains the difference between "deshe" and "esev," while Targum mentions Isaac making Jacob master and providing sustenance to Esau. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר עֵשָׂ֜ו אֶל־אָבִ֗יו הַֽבְרָכָ֨ה אַחַ֤ת הִֽוא־לְךָ֙ אָבִ֔י בָּרְכֵ֥נִי גַם־אָ֖נִי אָבִ֑י וַיִּשָּׂ֥א עֵשָׂ֛ו קֹל֖וֹ וַיֵּֽבְךְּ׃|38 J|And Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, Father? Bless me too, Father!” And Esau wept aloud.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau questions his father Isaac about blessings, seeking a separate blessing from Jacob, reflecting his origins on the "left" side of the emanations. The text emphasizes the need to overpower Esau's voice to hear the voice of Yaakov through repentance, highlighting the power of holy tears to oppose evil tears shed by Esau. Esau's honoring of his father is rewarded by God, even though he was considered wicked, demonstrating the importance of honoring parents. The Sages teach that Esau, along with Cain and Manasseh, sought repentance in different ways. 

|וַיַּ֛עַן יִצְחָ֥ק אָבִ֖יו וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֑יו הִנֵּ֞ה מִשְׁמַנֵּ֤י הָאָ֙רֶץ֙ יִהְיֶ֣ה מֽוֹשָׁבֶ֔ךָ וּמִטַּ֥ל הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם מֵעָֽל׃|39 J|And his father Isaac answered, saying to him, “See, your abode shall enjoy the fat of the earth And  the dew of heaven above. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac blesses Esau with promises of fertile land but a life of subservience, emphasizing his role as a servant to his brother. The Midrash discusses how God shows mercy to the wicked like Esau, contrasting him with Jacob as an example of faith and righteousness. Rashi, Tur HaArokh, and Rabbeinu Bahya provide insights into the nature of Esau's blessing and the conditions attached to it. In the Targum, Yitzchok and Targum Jonathan both convey that Esau will dwell in fertile areas and receive blessings from heaven. 

|וְעַל־חַרְבְּךָ֣ תִֽחְיֶ֔ה וְאֶת־אָחִ֖יךָ תַּעֲבֹ֑ד וְהָיָה֙ כַּאֲשֶׁ֣ר תָּרִ֔יד וּפָרַקְתָּ֥ עֻלּ֖וֹ מֵעַ֥ל צַוָּארֶֽךָ׃|40 J|Yet by your sword you shall live, And you shall serve your brother; But when you grow restive, You shall break his yoke from your neck.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Yaakov observed the 613 commandments even in Padan Aram, Yitzchak's blessing to Esau encourages humility, and the power to punish the wicked comes from Edom. Commentary from Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Or HaChaim, Radak, Tur HaArokh, Steinsaltz, Da'at Zekenim, Chizkuni, and others elaborate on Esau's blessings and abilities. Halakhah discusses Rav Hisda's view on eating meat before cheese, the necessity of mayim ahronim, and the significance of removing a knife from the table. Jewish Thought emphasizes individual actions, faith, and the importance of fulfilling G'd's will. Kabbalah delves into the blessings of Jacob and Esau, the mysteries of faith, and the connection between bile and the sword. Midrash explores various themes related to divine promises, prayers, violence, and the symbolism of the sword. The Mishnah outlines rules regarding bathing and medicine on Shabbat. Musar discusses Isaac's addition to Jacob's blessing and the potential of contending with Heavenly forces. Quoting Commentary reflects on the fulfillment of Yitzchak's blessing regarding Esau and the symbolic significance of using iron tools. Second Temple discusses the benefits of submitting to the wise. Talmud emphasizes seeking forgiveness from God, pursuing peace, humility, and avoiding pride. Tanakh mentions Edom's refusal to allow the Israelites to pass through their land. Targum explains Esau's fate to live by the sword and serve his brother. 

|וַיִּשְׂטֹ֤ם עֵשָׂו֙ אֶֽת־יַעֲקֹ֔ב עַ֨ל־הַבְּרָכָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר בֵּרְכ֖וֹ אָבִ֑יו וַיֹּ֨אמֶר עֵשָׂ֜ו בְּלִבּ֗וֹ יִקְרְבוּ֙ יְמֵי֙ אֵ֣בֶל אָבִ֔י וְאַֽהַרְגָ֖ה אֶת־יַעֲקֹ֥ב אָחִֽי׃|41 J|Now Esau harbored a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing which his father had given him, and Esau said to himself, “Let but the mourning period of my father come, and I will kill my brother Jacob.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau harbored hatred towards Jacob for receiving their father's blessing, leading him to plan Jacob's murder after Isaac's death to avoid causing him grief. Rebekah was aware of Esau's intentions and warned Jacob, ensuring his safety. The Talmud discusses Esau's hatred towards Jacob and the importance of close relationships, while the Targum compares Esau's plan to kill Jacob to Cain's murder of Abel. 

|וַיֻּגַּ֣ד לְרִבְקָ֔ה אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֥י עֵשָׂ֖ו בְּנָ֣הּ הַגָּדֹ֑ל וַתִּשְׁלַ֞ח וַתִּקְרָ֤א לְיַעֲקֹב֙ בְּנָ֣הּ הַקָּטָ֔ן וַתֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔יו הִנֵּה֙ עֵשָׂ֣ו אָחִ֔יךָ מִתְנַחֵ֥ם לְךָ֖ לְהׇרְגֶֽךָ׃|42 J|When the words of her older son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca warned Jacob of Esau's plan to kill him, transferring the blessing from Esau to Jacob due to Esau's wickedness. Esau's intentions were revealed through his thoughts, prompting Rebecca to advise Jacob to flee to avoid being killed by his brother. Jacob heeded his mother's warning, showing the importance of listening to wise counsel [Targum Jonathan on Genesis 27:42]. 

|וְעַתָּ֥ה בְנִ֖י שְׁמַ֣ע בְּקֹלִ֑י וְק֧וּם בְּרַח־לְךָ֛ אֶל־לָבָ֥ן אָחִ֖י חָרָֽנָה׃|43 J|Now, my son, listen to me. Flee at once to Haran, to my brother Laban.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebeccah advised Jacob to flee to Laban in Haran to escape Esau's potential harm, as she feared Isaac's imminent death could lead to Esau carrying out his evil intentions. Jacob heeded his mother's advice and went to Haran, where he worked for Laban for seven years to marry Rachel. Psalm 3 was written by David as he fled from Absalom, drawing parallels to biblical figures who fled, and Charan and Padan Arom are the same town with two different names. Targum Jonathan also conveys Isaac instructing Jacob to flee to Laban in Haran for safety. 

|וְיָשַׁבְתָּ֥ עִמּ֖וֹ יָמִ֣ים אֲחָדִ֑ים עַ֥ד אֲשֶׁר־תָּשׁ֖וּב חֲמַ֥ת אָחִֽיךָ׃|44 J|Stay with him a while, until your brother’s fury subsides—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 27:44, the phrase "a few days" is interpreted as meaning a few years, less than ten, to wait for Esau's anger towards Jacob to subside due to selling his birthright. Leah was initially hated by Jacob for tricking him into marriage, working seven years for Rachel, not Leah, as Laban intended, with Jacob's love making the years seem like days. The Second Temple text discusses learning about the senses, oneself, body parts, their functions, and the mind's role. Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Targum Jerusalem advise Rebekah to stay with Laban until Esau's anger subsides in Genesis 27:44. 

|עַד־שׁ֨וּב אַף־אָחִ֜יךָ מִמְּךָ֗ וְשָׁכַח֙ אֵ֣ת אֲשֶׁר־עָשִׂ֣יתָ לּ֔וֹ וְשָׁלַחְתִּ֖י וּלְקַחְתִּ֣יךָ מִשָּׁ֑ם לָמָ֥ה אֶשְׁכַּ֛ל גַּם־שְׁנֵיכֶ֖ם י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד׃|45 J|until your brother’s anger against you subsides—and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will fetch you from there. Let me not lose you both in one day!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of fulfilling commandments before enjoying the fruits of labor, highlighting Balak's fear of the Israelites' ability to elevate Moabite converts to a high spiritual level. Commentary discusses Rebekah's concern about Jacob and Esau dying on the same day due to their conflict. Midrash details Esau's protest over burial place, Jacob's deception for blessings, and Joseph's honor in burying Jacob. Quoting commentary connects Rivkah's loss of Yaakov and Eisav, Deborah's death delivering a message, and Leah's thankfulness for her fourth child. Second Temple texts highlight Rebecca's wisdom in advising Jacob to flee to Laban, and Talmud confirms the fulfillment of Rebecca's prophecy about Jacob and Esau being bereaved on the same day. Targum references emphasize God's intervention to prevent the loss of both brothers in one day. 

|וַתֹּ֤אמֶר רִבְקָה֙ אֶל־יִצְחָ֔ק קַ֣צְתִּי בְחַיַּ֔י מִפְּנֵ֖י בְּנ֣וֹת חֵ֑ת אִם־לֹקֵ֣חַ יַ֠עֲקֹ֠ב אִשָּׁ֨ה מִבְּנֽוֹת־חֵ֤ת כָּאֵ֙לֶּה֙ מִבְּנ֣וֹת הָאָ֔רֶץ לָ֥מָּה לִּ֖י חַיִּֽים׃|46 P|Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am disgusted with my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries a Hittite woman like these, from among the native women, what good will life be to me?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rebecca's concern for Jacob's safety and the preservation of the Holy Temple led her to suggest he marry someone from her family far away to avoid intermarriage with the Canaanites. Jacob's settlement in Canaan symbolized his return to his father's land, while Joseph's actions of tale-bearing caused jealousy among his brothers. Rebecca's disgust with the idea of a life against God's will is connected to the destruction of the Temple, emphasizing the Jewish people's connection to God. The term "קץ" signifies loathsomeness or being fed up with life, as seen in references to Rivkah in Genesis 27:46 and other verses. 

## Genesis 28

|וַיִּקְרָ֥א יִצְחָ֛ק אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֖ב וַיְבָ֣רֶךְ אֹת֑וֹ וַיְצַוֵּ֙הוּ֙ וַיֹּ֣אמֶר ל֔וֹ לֹֽא־תִקַּ֥ח אִשָּׁ֖ה מִבְּנ֥וֹת כְּנָֽעַן׃|1 P|So Isaac sent for Jacob and blessed him. He instructed him, saying, “You shall not take a wife from among the Canaanite women.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that a tzadik's departure leaves a lasting impact, as seen in the creation of the world; Yitzchok retroactively approved of Yaakov's actions and warned him to flee; prophets need wealth and strength to chastise; blessings were passed down from generation to generation; and Yitzchok commanded Yaakov not to marry a Canaanite woman. 

|ק֥וּם לֵךְ֙ פַּדֶּ֣נָֽה אֲרָ֔ם בֵּ֥יתָה בְתוּאֵ֖ל אֲבִ֣י אִמֶּ֑ךָ וְקַח־לְךָ֤ מִשָּׁם֙ אִשָּׁ֔ה מִבְּנ֥וֹת לָבָ֖ן אֲחִ֥י אִמֶּֽךָ׃|2 P|Up, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father, and take a wife there from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak explains that "קום" means to go quickly, not literally rise, while "פדנה ארם" refers to going to Charan. Siftei Chakhamim notes that words needing a "ל" prefix are usually names of places. Isaac knew Laban had daughters, indicating contact between the families. The blessing Esav sold to Yaakov was given exclusively to Yaakov and his descendants. Abraham and Isaac sought wives for their sons to fulfill the command to be fruitful and multiply. In the Second Temple text, marriages were arranged with specific instructions from fathers. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that Jacob was instructed to go to Padan Aram to marry one of Laban's daughters. 

|וְאֵ֤ל שַׁדַּי֙ יְבָרֵ֣ךְ אֹֽתְךָ֔ וְיַפְרְךָ֖ וְיַרְבֶּ֑ךָ וְהָיִ֖יתָ לִקְהַ֥ל עַמִּֽים׃|3 P|May El Shaddai  bless you, make you fertile and numerous, so that you become an assembly of peoples.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Isaac blesses Jacob with wealth, offspring, and stature, emphasizing God's sufficiency in providing blessings and the potential for greatness. Moses is granted a longer-lasting revelation of God's goodness and forgiveness for Israel. Jacob receives blessings through cunning and from God, with El Shaddai providing protection. The succession of blessings from Jacob to Moses is highlighted, showing individualized blessings reflecting unique characteristics. The importance of marriage for receiving blessings, the role of wives in bringing blessings, and conditions of worthiness for blessings are discussed. Targums emphasize God blessing Jacob with offspring and a great assembly of tribes. 

|וְיִֽתֶּן־לְךָ֙ אֶת־בִּרְכַּ֣ת אַבְרָהָ֔ם לְךָ֖ וּלְזַרְעֲךָ֣ אִתָּ֑ךְ לְרִשְׁתְּךָ֙ אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ מְגֻרֶ֔יךָ אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֥ן אֱלֹהִ֖ים לְאַבְרָהָֽם׃|4 P|May you and your offspring be granted the blessing of Abraham, that you may possess the land where you are sojourning, which God assigned to Abraham.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yitzchok initially hesitated to bless Yaakov to keep him unaware of the blessings, with each patriarch associated with a different name of G'd. Yaakov is instructed to marry within the family to pass down monotheism and blessings, ensuring the continuation of the family legacy. Only Abraham and his descendants are commanded to undergo circumcision, excluding Ishmael and Esau's descendants. The Midrash emphasizes the fulfillment of patriarchal blessings in establishing the twelve tribes, while Isaac had different blessings in mind for Jacob and Esau. The text refutes claims of allusions to Mohammed in Scripture and warns against heretics undermining the teachings of Moses. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention that God will give Jacob and his descendants the blessing of Abraham in Genesis 28:4. 

|וַיִּשְׁלַ֤ח יִצְחָק֙ אֶֽת־יַעֲקֹ֔ב וַיֵּ֖לֶךְ פַּדֶּ֣נָֽה אֲרָ֑ם אֶל־לָבָ֤ן בֶּן־בְּתוּאֵל֙ הָֽאֲרַמִּ֔י אֲחִ֣י רִבְקָ֔ה אֵ֥ם יַעֲקֹ֖ב וְעֵשָֽׂו׃|5 P|Then Isaac sent Jacob off, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, mother of Jacob and Esau.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Yaakov emphasizes the importance of mercy in divine judgment and is warned about Lavan's mixed nature. Commentary highlights the influence of maternal relatives on character and the importance of following parental commands. In Jewish Thought, the story of Jacob and Esau emphasizes heavenly blessings over material wealth, with Jacob receiving the principal blessing after a successful struggle. Midrash discusses Rebecca's righteousness in a family of deceivers, urging Israel to uphold Torah and righteousness. In Musar, Jacob and Esau's mystical purpose is explored, with Rebecca allocating certain genes to each twin. The Targum emphasizes Yitzchok sending Yaakov to stay with Lavan in Paddan Aram. 

|וַיַּ֣רְא עֵשָׂ֗ו כִּֽי־בֵרַ֣ךְ יִצְחָק֮ אֶֽת־יַעֲקֹב֒ וְשִׁלַּ֤ח אֹתוֹ֙ פַּדֶּ֣נָֽה אֲרָ֔ם לָקַֽחַת־ל֥וֹ מִשָּׁ֖ם אִשָּׁ֑ה בְּבָרְכ֣וֹ אֹת֔וֹ וַיְצַ֤ו עָלָיו֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר לֹֽא־תִקַּ֥ח אִשָּׁ֖ה מִבְּנ֥וֹת כְּנָֽעַן׃|6 P|When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him off to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, charging him, as he blessed him, “You shall not take a wife from among the Canaanite women,”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the humility of Abraham and Jacob, who considered themselves unworthy despite promises; Esau realized he lost his share due to marrying Canaanite women and sought to marry into Avraham's family to restore his claim; Jacob required greater protection outside of Israel but was assured by God; Dinah's actions led to her being seized by Shechem, showcasing her family's strength, wealth, and beauty; Esau's decision to marry Canaanite women demonstrated his lack of understanding of the Abrahamic destiny and his inability to lead the household. 

|וַיִּשְׁמַ֣ע יַעֲקֹ֔ב אֶל־אָבִ֖יו וְאֶל־אִמּ֑וֹ וַיֵּ֖לֶךְ פַּדֶּ֥נָֽה אֲרָֽם׃|7 P|and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and gone to Paddan-aram,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Jacob obeyed his father and went to Padan-aram, delaying his return to honor his parents, leading to Joseph not honoring him for the same amount of time. The text emphasizes the importance of dwelling in the Holy Land and being buried there, criticizes astronomers who do not follow the Jewish theory of Sabbath calculation, and discusses the significance of following divine guidance. Midrashim highlight the obedience of Jacob and the importance of heeding God's commandments, with Ramban explaining the spiritual significance of Jacob's experiences and the importance of prayer in Jerusalem. The Second Temple text stresses the importance of being a practitioner rather than just a listener, using Jacob's journey to Mesopotamia as an example. 

|וַיַּ֣רְא עֵשָׂ֔ו כִּ֥י רָע֖וֹת בְּנ֣וֹת כְּנָ֑עַן בְּעֵינֵ֖י יִצְחָ֥ק אָבִֽיו׃|8 P|Esau realized that the Canaanite women displeased his father Isaac.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau, realizing his Canaanite wives displeased his father Isaac, married a daughter of Ishmael to ensure his father's blessing for his descendants. Jacob heeded advice and warnings, receiving blessings and setting out to Paddan-Aram. Ibn Ezra warns against marrying Canaanite women, while Targum notes Esau's understanding of Isaac's disapproval of Canaanite women. 

|וַיֵּ֥לֶךְ עֵשָׂ֖ו אֶל־יִשְׁמָעֵ֑אל וַיִּקַּ֡ח אֶֽת־מָחֲלַ֣ת ׀ בַּת־יִשְׁמָעֵ֨אל בֶּן־אַבְרָהָ֜ם אֲח֧וֹת נְבָי֛וֹת עַל־נָשָׁ֖יו ל֥וֹ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|9 P|So Esau went to Ishmael and took to wife, in addition to the wives he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, sister of Nebaioth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Esau married Mahalat, the daughter of Ishmael, to bring spirituality into his household, influenced by a desire to connect to Abraham's lineage. The concept of creatures sticking with their own kind is illustrated through examples like Esau going to Yishmael and birds of the same kind being ritually impure or pure. The story of Yaakov's deceit and blessing in Genesis highlights sensuality and love, with Yitzhak's blindness leading to deception and the proper transfer of the blessing. Forgiveness of sins is compared to forgiveness granted to a proselyte and is illustrated through various examples in Jewish texts.
