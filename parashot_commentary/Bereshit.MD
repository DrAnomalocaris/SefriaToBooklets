|--:|:-:|:--|

Ben Zoma's interpretation of the creation of the firmament on the second day of creation led to debates among the sages, with Rabbi Yehoshua clarifying that the division between the upper and lower waters was slight, creating darkness to allow free will. Various commentaries discuss the creation of the firmament as a structure dividing the waters, stabilizing the atmosphere, and serving as a screen.

|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of performing commandments with the intent of fulfilling God's wishes rather than personal gain is explored in Chasidut, using the example of Rabbi Yoshua ben Chananyah and ben Zoma's discussion on the significance of the "upper waters" and "lower waters." The division between the upper and lower waters in Genesis 1:7 signifies the separation of the material and spiritual planes, allowing them to exist separately but interconnected, according to various commentaries. The separation between the upper and lower sefirot in Kabbalah is represented by the diaphragm, while prayers from the Siddur and Machzor praise God's creation of the heavens and waters above the skies.

Ramban explains the regulations for a captive woman in relation to mourning, preventing her from being forced to abandon her religion. In Genesis 1:7, Elohim, the Lord, and Allah all created a separation or canopy that divided the waters below from the waters above. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֧א אֱלֹהִ֛ים לָֽרָקִ֖יעַ שָׁמָ֑יִם וַֽיְהִי־עֶ֥רֶב וַֽיְהִי־בֹ֖קֶר י֥וֹם שֵׁנִֽי׃|8 P|God called the expanse Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The firmament was named "heaven" on the second day of creation to support the waters and prepare for earthly creatures, signifying the mingling of fire and water essential for earth's functioning. The distinction between "shamayim" and "raki‘a" is explained in Jewish thought, while the Kabbalah text Sha'arei Orah mentions God calling the firmament. Liturgy sees the firmament as symbolizing the separation between heavenly and earthly realms, and the Midrash discusses the integration of fire and water in creating the heavens. Sforno and Radak explain the purpose of the firmament, and the Talmud discusses the allotment of verses for Torah readings. In the Targum, different names are used for the separation as "Heavens" in Genesis 1:8. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים יִקָּו֨וּ הַמַּ֜יִם מִתַּ֤חַת הַשָּׁמַ֙יִם֙ אֶל־מָק֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד וְתֵרָאֶ֖ה הַיַּבָּשָׁ֑ה וַֽיְהִי־כֵֽן׃|9 P|God said, “Let the water below the sky be gathered into one area, that the dry land may appear.” And it was so.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God's power over nature is highlighted in the Tanakh, and in the Targum, the waters were gathered into one place as commanded. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים ׀ לַיַּבָּשָׁה֙ אֶ֔רֶץ וּלְמִקְוֵ֥ה הַמַּ֖יִם קָרָ֣א יַמִּ֑ים וַיַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים כִּי־טֽוֹב׃|10 P|God called the dry land Earth and called the gathering of waters Seas. And God saw that this was good.|

|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbeinu Bahya explains that the first three days of creation focused on the movement of the celestial sphere, not light, with evening and morning associated with light only from the fourth day onwards. Tiferet Yisra'el discusses the observance of Shabbat at the North Pole based on the sun's movement, but fails to address demarcating days during the polar night.

## Genesis 3

|וְהַנָּחָשׁ֙ הָיָ֣ה עָר֔וּם מִכֹּל֙ חַיַּ֣ת הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֑ים וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־הָ֣אִשָּׁ֔ה אַ֚ף כִּֽי־אָמַ֣ר אֱלֹהִ֔ים לֹ֣א תֹֽאכְל֔וּ מִכֹּ֖ל עֵ֥ץ הַגָּֽן׃|1 J|Now the serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild beasts that God יהוה had made.

|--:|:-:|:--|

Eve intelligently responds to the serpent, clarifying God's commandments and emphasizing their benefit and protection. In Jewish thought, the importance of a wife is highlighted, with teachings on the blessings and mourning after the loss of a wife. The Midrash discusses the actions and consequences of Cain, Noah, Uzziah, and praises Abraham for his faith. Bekhor Shor interprets the serpent's questioning of God's prohibition as a means to prevent Adam and Eve from becoming wise like angels. The Midrash of Philo and Targum Jonathan explore the serpent's interactions with Eve in Genesis 3:2. 

|וּמִפְּרִ֣י הָעֵץ֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּתוֹךְ־הַגָּן֒ אָמַ֣ר אֱלֹהִ֗ים לֹ֤א תֹֽאכְלוּ֙ מִמֶּ֔נּוּ וְלֹ֥א תִגְּע֖וּ בּ֑וֹ פֶּן־תְּמֻתֽוּן׃|3 J|It is only about fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden that God said: ‘You shall not eat of it or touch it, lest you die.’”|

|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains how Eve was misled by the serpent's argument that touching the tree of knowledge would not lead to death, leading her to eat from it. The serpent's idolatrous and blasphemous claims aimed to make the prohibition seem plausible. Midrash discusses God's rebuke of the serpent for slandering His children and compares it to leprosy. Musar highlights the importance of purity and modesty in the service of God, using Adam and Eve's story to illustrate the consequences of sin. Quoting Commentary questions Eve's lie to the snake and Adam's defense for eating the fruit, linking it to Esav hating Yaakov. Second Temple discusses why the serpent in the Garden of Eden lied to Eve about God's command. Targum mentions the serpent denying that the woman would die, accusing the Creator of hatred towards his creation. 

|כִּ֚י יֹדֵ֣עַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים כִּ֗י בְּיוֹם֙ אֲכׇלְכֶ֣ם מִמֶּ֔נּוּ וְנִפְקְח֖וּ עֵֽינֵיכֶ֑ם וִהְיִיתֶם֙ כֵּֽאלֹהִ֔ים יֹדְעֵ֖י ט֥וֹב וָרָֽע׃|5 J|but God knows that as soon as you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like divine beings who know  good and bad.”|

She also gave some to her husband, and he ate.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The story of Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit involves Eve being enticed by the serpent's deception and desiring wisdom, leading to Adam also eating the fruit out of love. The sin resulted in a loss of intellectual faculty for Adam and brought darkness and death into the world. The story emphasizes the danger of following desires rather than listening to God, with the significance of the forbidden fruit explained through various interpretations. The impact of the sin led to the separation of what should remain joined together, symbolized by the fig tree providing leaves to cover Adam's nakedness after the other trees refused. 

|וַתִּפָּקַ֙חְנָה֙ עֵינֵ֣י שְׁנֵיהֶ֔ם וַיֵּ֣דְע֔וּ כִּ֥י עֵֽירֻמִּ֖ם הֵ֑ם וַֽיִּתְפְּרוּ֙ עֲלֵ֣ה תְאֵנָ֔ה וַיַּעֲשׂ֥וּ לָהֶ֖ם חֲגֹרֹֽת׃|7 J|Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they perceived that they were naked; and they sewed together fig leaves and made themselves loincloths.|

|וַֽיִּשְׁמְע֞וּ אֶת־ק֨וֹל יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים מִתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ בַּגָּ֖ן לְר֣וּחַ הַיּ֑וֹם וַיִּתְחַבֵּ֨א הָֽאָדָ֜ם וְאִשְׁתּ֗וֹ מִפְּנֵי֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים בְּת֖וֹךְ עֵ֥ץ הַגָּֽן׃|8 J|They heard the sound of God יהוה moving about in the garden at the breezy time of day; and the Human and his wife hid from God יהוה among the trees of the garden.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

|וַיִּקְרָ֛א יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־הָֽאָדָ֑ם וַיֹּ֥אמֶר ל֖וֹ אַיֶּֽכָּה׃|9 J|God יהוה called out to the Human and said to him, “Where are you?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The concept of losing one's true self through sin and the importance of seeking one's connection to God is emphasized in various commentaries, including the idea that man has strayed from following their souls and focused on physical desires. The dialogue between God and various biblical figures is seen as a way to engage in conversation and prompt self-reflection. In the Second Temple period, questions arise about Adam hiding from God and the significance of his response. The Talmud discusses proper behavior and the importance of seeking permission before leaving a teacher or friend, as exemplified by God's call to Adam. God's questioning of Adam in the garden serves as a reminder that nothing is hidden from His sight. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר אֶת־קֹלְךָ֥ שָׁמַ֖עְתִּי בַּגָּ֑ן וָאִירָ֛א כִּֽי־עֵירֹ֥ם אָנֹ֖כִי וָאֵחָבֵֽא׃|10 J|He replied, “I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the rectification of fears and scents in the garden through the concept of voice symbolized by a river from Eden, leading to the growth of fear of God in the soul. Various commentaries on Genesis 3:10 explore Adam's fear and shame at being naked in the presence of God, with interpretations ranging from awe to fear of punishment. Kabbalah discusses the fear of sin stemming from being stripped of divine protection due to sin, emphasizing the importance of Torah and mitzvot to maintain a connection with the Shechinah. The Midrash delves into the consequences of sin with examples from various biblical figures, while the Targum interprets Adam's fear as a reaction to hearing God's voice in the garden. 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר מִ֚י הִגִּ֣יד לְךָ֔ כִּ֥י עֵירֹ֖ם אָ֑תָּה הֲמִן־הָעֵ֗ץ אֲשֶׁ֧ר צִוִּיתִ֛יךָ לְבִלְתִּ֥י אֲכׇל־מִמֶּ֖נּוּ אָכָֽלְתָּ׃|11 J|“Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat of the tree from which I had forbidden you to eat?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the Jewish people's ability to infuse holiness into mundane activities like eating and drinking, contrasting with the nations' lack of belief in bodily pleasures. Commentary on Genesis 3:11 offers various interpretations, including Ibn Ezra's explanation of "bilti" and Rashbam's question about the prefix "ה" in "המן." Midrash draws parallels between Adam's expulsion from Eden and Israel's expulsion from the Land, while Musar hints at the existence of Moses, Haman, Mordechai, and Esther in specific Torah verses. The Talmud finds an allusion to Haman's hanging in the word "hamin" from Genesis 3:11, and Targum emphasizes the disobedience of Adam and Eve in eating from the forbidden tree. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר הָֽאָדָ֑ם הָֽאִשָּׁה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נָתַ֣תָּה עִמָּדִ֔י הִ֛וא נָֽתְנָה־לִּ֥י מִן־הָעֵ֖ץ וָאֹכֵֽל׃|12 J|The Human said, “The woman You put at my side—she gave me of the tree, and I ate.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Adam's sin was a result of misunderstanding God's intention in providing Eve, leading him to believe he could eat the forbidden fruit if she permitted it. Despite naming the snake as deceitful, Adam failed to discern its nature, ultimately benefiting future generations by providing them with a world they could call their own. Adam's attempt to shift blame to Eve and God, and Eve's blame on the serpent, prevented repentance by shifting responsibility for sin. In the Talmud, Moses called the Israelites ungrateful for complaining about the manna, comparing them to Adam who blamed Eve instead of taking responsibility. Both Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that Adam blamed the woman for giving him the fruit, while Tafsir Rasag emphasizes that Adam blamed both the woman and God for his actions. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים לָאִשָּׁ֖ה מַה־זֹּ֣את עָשִׂ֑ית וַתֹּ֙אמֶר֙ הָֽאִשָּׁ֔ה הַנָּחָ֥שׁ הִשִּׁיאַ֖נִי וָאֹכֵֽל׃|13 J|And God יהוה said to the woman, “What is this you have done!” The woman replied, “The serpent duped me, and I ate.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that accepting advice from the wicked is like being polluted by kelipah, as seen in Chavah's acceptance of the Serpent's advice. Commentary highlights punishment for causing others to sin, while Jewish Thought discusses the people's preference for physical freedom over moral imperatives. Midrash explores God's delight in vindicating people and commendation of Abraham for calling Lot his brother. Quoting Commentary delves into various interpretations of biblical texts, including the symbolism of offerings for atonement and the incitement of the serpent. Second Temple and Targum both recount the blame game between Adam, Eve, and the serpent in Genesis 3:9-13. 

|וַיֹּ֩אמֶר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֥ים ׀ אֶֽל־הַנָּחָשׁ֮ כִּ֣י עָשִׂ֣יתָ זֹּאת֒ אָר֤וּר אַתָּה֙ מִכׇּל־הַבְּהֵמָ֔ה וּמִכֹּ֖ל חַיַּ֣ת הַשָּׂדֶ֑ה עַל־גְּחֹנְךָ֣ תֵלֵ֔ךְ וְעָפָ֥ר תֹּאכַ֖ל כׇּל־יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽיךָ׃|14 J|Then God יהוה said to the serpent, “Because you did this, More cursed shall you be Than all cattle And all the wild beasts: On your belly shall you crawl And dirt shall you eat All the days of your life. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the protective nature of keeping the mitzvah of tzitzit against immorality and the Serpent's advice, while money and wealth are equated to dust. Israel, cleansed of the Serpent's pollution at Mount Sinai, contrasts with the nations. Eliyahu's banishment of falsehood symbolizes the banishment of the Serpent, highlighting the revelation on Motzaei Shabbat. Rabbi Yehoshua's findings on the serpent's curse and physical changes, Rabbi Abraham ben Ezra's interpretation of the serpent's curse, and the Akeidat Yitzchak's discussion on nourishment are explored. Jacob's behavior towards his father brought blessings upon the world, linking to the serpent's curse. The Midrash discusses the significance of leprosy as a punishment for slander and emphasizes the power of the tongue. Envy led to the downfall of many, including the serpent, Cain, and Korah, highlighting the importance of avoiding jealousy and lust. The curse of the serpent is connected to its role in the Garden of Eden, emphasizing consequences for humanity. The Talmud describes the primeval snake's desire for Eve and the curses it received, while the Targum adds details of its curse. Finally, the Tosefta explains the consequences of seeking forbidden things and recounts Moses' retrieval of Joseph's coffin with the help of Serakh daughter of Asher. 

|וְאֵיבָ֣ה ׀ אָשִׁ֗ית בֵּֽינְךָ֙ וּבֵ֣ין הָֽאִשָּׁ֔ה וּבֵ֥ין זַרְעֲךָ֖ וּבֵ֣ין זַרְעָ֑הּ ה֚וּא יְשׁוּפְךָ֣ רֹ֔אשׁ וְאַתָּ֖ה תְּשׁוּפֶ֥נּוּ עָקֵֽב׃|15 J|I will put enmity Between you and the woman, And between your offspring and hers; They shall strike at your head, And you shall strike at their heel.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The enmity between man and the serpent, originating from the curse in Genesis 3:14-15, results in man having an advantage by crushing the serpent's head while the serpent can only bruise man's heel. This enmity extends to their offspring, leading to animosity between species and a moral downfall. The Torah does not explicitly prohibit cannibalism, but ethical changes may eliminate the urge to eat meat. The curse on the serpent in Genesis 3:15 symbolizes enmity between pleasure and sense, with the serpent losing its status as king over animals and being cursed to crawl on its belly. The Targum commentaries on Genesis 3:15 emphasize the enmity between the serpent and the woman's offspring, with a remedy for the woman's offspring in the days of the King Meshiha but none for the serpent. 

|אֶֽל־הָאִשָּׁ֣ה אָמַ֗ר הַרְבָּ֤ה אַרְבֶּה֙ עִצְּבוֹנֵ֣ךְ וְהֵֽרֹנֵ֔ךְ בְּעֶ֖צֶב תֵּֽלְדִ֣י בָנִ֑ים וְאֶל־אִישֵׁךְ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָתֵ֔ךְ וְה֖וּא יִמְשׇׁל־בָּֽךְ׃|16 J|And to the woman [God] said, “I will greatly expand Your hard labor—and your pregnancies; In hardship shall you bear children. Yet your urge shall be for your husband, And he shall rule over you.” |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of awareness and attachment to God, serving Him with smallness and greatness, giving up one's life in service, and the significance of Torah in preventing spiritual poverty. Ramban disagrees with Rashi's interpretation of Genesis 3:16, Ibn Ezra explains the pain and conception in the verse, and Kli Yakar interprets "greatly increase" as the multiplication of offspring. Halakhah states that women are equal partners in marriage and both men and women should express love and desire for each other. In Jewish Thought, 'eẓeb can denote pain, individuals vary in conduct based on nobility or indulgence, and the curse on the woman and serpent corresponds to their rebellion. Kabbalah discusses Nukva preparing for Zeir Anpin, the importance of desire in mating, and how sadness does not increase blessings. Midrash connects the sin of adultery to the punishment of exile, while Mishnah explains the conditions for being a nazirite. Musar discusses Eve's sin, impurity, and ritual impurity after childbirth. Quoting Commentary, Sforno explains the purification required for menstruation and untimely discharges, while Ibn Ezra interprets sin lying in wait for man. Second Temple discusses the symbolic nature of rivers and the struggles and pains of life for women. Talmud states that providing food is twice as difficult as childbirth, righteous women may be exempt from pain, and discusses Eve's curses and the consequences of Adam and Eve's actions. Tanakh suggests that doing right brings uplift and mastery over sin, while Targum translations of Genesis 3:16 all explain the consequences of the woman's sin as increased pain in childbirth, desire for her husband, and his dominion over her. 

|וּלְאָדָ֣ם אָמַ֗ר כִּֽי־שָׁמַ֘עְתָּ֮ לְק֣וֹל אִשְׁתֶּ֒ךָ֒ וַתֹּ֙אכַל֙ מִן־הָעֵ֔ץ אֲשֶׁ֤ר צִוִּיתִ֙יךָ֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑נּוּ אֲרוּרָ֤ה הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽעֲבוּרֶ֔ךָ בְּעִצָּבוֹן֙ תֹּֽאכְלֶ֔נָּה כֹּ֖ל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽיךָ׃|17 J|To Adam [God] said, “Because you did as your wife said and ate of the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ Cursed be the ground because of you; By hard labor shall you eat of it All the days of your life: |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the significance of wine in relation to knowledge and providence, warning against chasing after money and feeling hopeless about livelihoods. The curse on the ground in Genesis is explained as a consequence of Adam's rebellion, failure to investigate, and violation of God's command, with different commentators highlighting the value of labor and the consequences of straying from God's path. The importance of listening to God and attaining holiness is emphasized, as well as the consequences of Adam's sin on the earth and mankind's relationship with it. The curse on the serpent, woman, and man is explained as reflecting the order of offenses committed, with the man's curse linked to listening to his wife and eating the forbidden fruit. Providing food is described as twice as difficult as childbirth, and differing opinions on the reason for the curse on the earth are presented. The punishment of Adam for listening to his wife and eating from the forbidden tree is that the ground is cursed, and he will have to toil in labor to eat from it for the rest of his life. 

|וְק֥וֹץ וְדַרְדַּ֖ר תַּצְמִ֣יחַֽ לָ֑ךְ וְאָכַלְתָּ֖ אֶת־עֵ֥שֶׂב הַשָּׂדֶֽה׃|18 J|Thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you. But your food shall be the grasses of the field; |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of humility and repentance to rectify disorder caused by haughtiness, as seen in Adam and Eve's sin. The curse of eating grass represents the need for humility, with the goal of merging disorder into order through repentance and humility. Various commentaries explore the consequences of Adam and Eve's actions, emphasizing the need for hard work and the significance of dietary permissions and restrictions. Thorns symbolize passions that burden the soul, and the pursuit of pleasures leads to a painful life for the wicked. The Targums mention that thorns and thistles grew as a result of Adam's sin, leading humans to eat herbs of the field and work with their hands to distinguish themselves from animals. 

|בְּזֵעַ֤ת אַפֶּ֙יךָ֙ תֹּ֣אכַל לֶ֔חֶם עַ֤ד שֽׁוּבְךָ֙ אֶל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה כִּ֥י מִמֶּ֖נָּה לֻקָּ֑חְתָּ כִּֽי־עָפָ֣ר אַ֔תָּה וְאֶל־עָפָ֖ר תָּשֽׁוּב׃|19 J|By the sweat of your brow Shall you get bread to eat, Until you return to the ground— For from it you were taken. For dust  you are, And to dust you shall return.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut texts discuss the significance of incense in binding the heart's burning with the ruach, the connection between incense and nullifying curses, the impact of Torah studies on virtuous and non-virtuous individuals, breaking the desire for wealth through charity to draw God's providence, and the idea of returning to dust as a reminder of one's mortality. Commentary delves into the consequences of Adam's sin, contrasting the curse of toiling for food with the promise of eternal life for the righteous, while Jewish Thought emphasizes the impurity of returning to dust and the establishment of the world of souls for righteous individuals. Kabbalah warns against anger towards others and destruction of the soul, Midrash interprets various Torah verses, Mishnah discusses vows regarding garments, Musar connects humility to thoughts and deeds, and Quoting Commentary explores the significance of sweat and the consequences of Adam's sin. Second Temple texts discuss discipline of the body, sense-perception, and turning back to the earth, while Talmud delves into Adam and Eve's creation, life in the Garden of Eden, and the role of angels. Targum emphasizes the connection between humanity's creation from dust and their return to it. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֧א הָֽאָדָ֛ם שֵׁ֥ם אִשְׁתּ֖וֹ חַוָּ֑ה כִּ֛י הִ֥וא הָֽיְתָ֖ה אֵ֥ם כׇּל־חָֽי׃|20 J|The Human named his wife Eve,  because she was the mother of all the living. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of being cautious when new honor comes as it may signal the soul's time to be taken up into glory, recommending binding with Jewish souls and focusing on charity. In Jewish Thought, the Tashbaz's responsa rules that a husband mistreating his wife should divorce her and pay her ketubah to avoid causing suffering. Kabbalah discusses special men who partake in the roots of souls, leading to various roles in society. Midrash explores Moses' fear of speaking to Pharaoh, Abraham's circumcision, Eve as the mother of all beings, and Adam and Eve's actions in the Garden of Eden. Musar highlights the importance of not speaking slanderously and the relationship between the soul and body. Quoting Commentary explains the significance of choosing a wife wisely and the husband's role in vetoing his wife's vows.

Talmud discusses a woman ascending to her husband's socioeconomic status and the verse indicating her role as a wife. Targum Jonathan and Tafsir Rasag state that Adam named his wife Eve as the mother of all living people. 

|וַיַּ֩עַשׂ֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים לְאָדָ֧ם וּלְאִשְׁתּ֛וֹ כׇּתְנ֥וֹת ע֖וֹר וַיַּלְבִּשֵֽׁם׃|21 J|And God יהוה made garments of skins for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the connection between tefillin, the Tree of Life, and the skin, emphasizing the repair of the imagination and Empty Space through piety and Emunah, linking the garments of skin given to Adam and Eve to purification rites after the sin of the Golden Calf. Various commentators suggest the material of the garments and their symbolic significance, reflecting God's mercy and active kindness. The Avodah service on Yom Kippur references the garment of skin, while the Midrash explores God's care for humanity through clothing, and the Musar text delves into the symbolism of garments in relation to priests and rehabilitation after sin. The Talmud discusses the creation of garments for Adam and Eve by God, and Job and Exodus mention the significance of skin in the Tanakh. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר ׀ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֗ים הֵ֤ן הָֽאָדָם֙ הָיָה֙ כְּאַחַ֣ד מִמֶּ֔נּוּ לָדַ֖עַת ט֣וֹב וָרָ֑ע וְעַתָּ֣ה ׀ פֶּן־יִשְׁלַ֣ח יָד֗וֹ וְלָקַח֙ גַּ֚ם מֵעֵ֣ץ הַֽחַיִּ֔ים וְאָכַ֖ל וָחַ֥י לְעֹלָֽם׃|22 J|And God יהוה said, “Now that humankind has become like any of us, knowing good and bad, what if one should stretch out a hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever!”|

Second Temple texts explore God's interactions with humanity and the concept of evil being carried out through agents. Targum emphasizes the consequences of Adam's disobedience and the prevention of eternal life through access to the Tree of Life. 

|וַֽיְשַׁלְּחֵ֛הוּ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים מִגַּן־עֵ֑דֶן לַֽעֲבֹד֙ אֶת־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֻקַּ֖ח מִשָּֽׁם׃|23 J|So God יהוה banished humankind  from the garden of Eden, to till the humus  from which it was taken:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

## Genesis 4

|וְהָ֣אָדָ֔ם יָדַ֖ע אֶת־חַוָּ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֑וֹ וַתַּ֙הַר֙ וַתֵּ֣לֶד אֶת־קַ֔יִן וַתֹּ֕אמֶר קָנִ֥יתִי אִ֖ישׁ אֶת־יְהֹוָֽה׃|1 J|Now the Human knew  his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, “I have gained  a person  with the help of  יהוה.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, G'd gives Avram the land of Canaan as an inheritance, emphasizing his role as Avram's "father." In Midrash, the birth of Cain symbolizes material acquisition while Abel represents good, with Cain's sin being offering subpar sacrifices. In Mishnah, uncircumcised priests cannot partake of teruma, and certain genital injuries disqualify priests from marrying Jewish women. In Musar, the union of Elkanan and Chanah is compared to Adam and Eve, with Cain representing the female aspect and Abel the male aspect. In Targum, Chavah gives birth to Kayin with the help of Adonoy. 

|וַתֹּ֣סֶף לָלֶ֔דֶת אֶת־אָחִ֖יו אֶת־הָ֑בֶל וַֽיְהִי־הֶ֙בֶל֙ רֹ֣עֵה צֹ֔אן וְקַ֕יִן הָיָ֖ה עֹבֵ֥ד אֲדָמָֽה׃|2 J|She then bore his brother Abel. Abel became a keeper of sheep, and Cain became a tiller of the soil.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Hevel chose shepherding over farming for mental stimulation, leading to different offerings to G'd from him and Kayin; the Torah hints at a lack of brotherliness in their relationship. Work on holidays is permitted for the soul's needs, while avoiding unnecessary labor is emphasized. Liturgical texts cover creation, Adam and Eve, the flood, Noah, Abraham, and High Priest consecration for Yom Kippur. Midrash explores the significance of the term "was" in biblical contexts, highlighting themes of punishment, exile, and new beginnings. Yitro's transformation reflects newfound belief in justice and life after death. Noah and Abel symbolize cultivation and attitudes towards G'd, while Talmudic interpretations differ on the number of children one must have. Koheleth declares the futility of everything, and Targum states that Eve gave birth to Abel, a shepherd, and Cain, a farmer. 

|וַֽיְהִ֖י מִקֵּ֣ץ יָמִ֑ים וַיָּבֵ֨א קַ֜יִן מִפְּרִ֧י הָֽאֲדָמָ֛ה מִנְחָ֖ה לַֽיהֹוָֽה׃|3 J|In the course of time, Cain brought an offering to יהוה from the fruit of the soil;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban and Ibn Ezra discuss Cain and Abel's understanding of sacrifices, with Rashbam, Radak, and Rabbeinu Bahya criticizing Cain's offering.

|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the "helmet of salvation" refers to the descent of light and abundance from the "three hundred and seventy lights" mentioned in the Zohar, facilitated through acts of charity. Commentary on Cain and Abel's offerings highlights God's acceptance of Abel's sacrifice and rejection of Cain's, leading to Cain's jealousy and murder of his brother. The Mishneh Torah emphasizes the importance of high-quality offerings to God, while the Talmud discusses debates about the nature of offerings and references biblical verses to support different positions. The Targum recounts how Hevel's offering of the best of his flock pleased the Lord and received His favor. 

|וְאֶל־קַ֥יִן וְאֶל־מִנְחָת֖וֹ לֹ֣א שָׁעָ֑ה וַיִּ֤חַר לְקַ֙יִן֙ מְאֹ֔ד וַֽיִּפְּל֖וּ פָּנָֽיו׃|5 J|but to Cain and his offering [God] paid no heed. Cain was much distressed and his face fell.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God rejected Cain's offering, leading to his jealousy and anger towards his brother and ultimately resulting in murder. The importance of presenting one's best in fulfilling mitzvot is emphasized through the story of Cain and Abel. Sacrifices in the Torah symbolize different intentions, with the olah offering representing altruistic motives. The rejection of Cain's sacrifice is attributed to his wicked nature and selfish intentions, contrasting with Abel's genuine love for God. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־קָ֑יִן לָ֚מָּה חָ֣רָה לָ֔ךְ וְלָ֖מָּה נָפְל֥וּ פָנֶֽיךָ׃|6 J|And יהוה said to Cain, “Why are you distressed, And why is your face fallen? |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the connection between Kayin's downfall and his failure to wear tefilin, as well as how a person's wisdom can illuminate their face but anger can cause this wisdom to depart.

The Midrash Tanchuma explores unclear words in the Torah and the transmission of oral teachings, while Bereshit Rabbah discusses resisting the evil inclination. Musar emphasizes considering light sins weighty and the importance of repentance and conquering impulses to avoid falling into sin.

|הֲל֤וֹא אִם־תֵּיטִיב֙ שְׂאֵ֔ת וְאִם֙ לֹ֣א תֵיטִ֔יב לַפֶּ֖תַח חַטָּ֣את רֹבֵ֑ץ וְאֵלֶ֙יךָ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָת֔וֹ וְאַתָּ֖ה תִּמְשׇׁל־בּֽוֹ׃|7 J|Surely, if you do right, There is uplift. But if you do not do right Sin couches at the door; Its urge is toward you, Yet you can be its master.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the impact of jealousy on sin and the importance of repentance in life, Torah study, and Teshuvah. The Evil Inclination is portrayed as crouching at the door, but individuals have the power to overcome it. The Midrash highlights the significance of Torah study in overcoming evil inclinations, while Musar explores the mystical dimensions of repentance and the importance of recognizing and overcoming the evil inclination. The Talmud discusses the relationship between Torah study and the evil inclination, emphasizing the power of Torah to lift one above it. Tanakh references the consequences of sin and the importance of wisdom, while Targum emphasizes the power of repentance and the choice between righteousness and sin. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר קַ֖יִן אֶל־הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑יו וַֽיְהִי֙ בִּהְיוֹתָ֣ם בַּשָּׂדֶ֔ה וַיָּ֥קׇם קַ֛יִן אֶל־הֶ֥בֶל אָחִ֖יו וַיַּהַרְגֵֽהוּ׃|8 J|Cain said to his brother Abel …  and when they were in the field, Cain set upon his brother Abel and killed him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the story of Cain and Abel is interpreted as a dispute over the division of the world, leading to Cain killing Abel out of jealousy and fear of being overshadowed. In Liturgy, the High Priest undergoes purification rituals before Yom Kippur to atone for the Jewish people. Midrash texts discuss the unique brotherly love between Moses and Aaron and the consequences of Cain killing Abel. Musar emphasizes that the wicked are a natural part of creation, contrasting with the pious who represent the pure part. Quoting Commentary highlights different interpretations of terms like "רציחה" and the spiritual concept of "קדש." In Second Temple texts, Cain's murder of Abel is seen as a reminder of his wicked act, with some suggesting that Cain ultimately harmed himself. Targum explains that Kayin killed Hevel in a dispute over their differing beliefs about judgment and the afterlife. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־קַ֔יִן אֵ֖י הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑יךָ וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ לֹ֣א יָדַ֔עְתִּי הֲשֹׁמֵ֥ר אָחִ֖י אָנֹֽכִי׃|9 J|יהוה said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” And he said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God questioned Cain about Abel's whereabouts to give him a chance to repent and highlight his denial and lack of responsibility, leading to curses. The questioning aimed to provoke repentance and show Cain's self-centeredness, contrasting with Adam's admission of sin. Cain's deceptive response raised questions about the fate of the dead but ultimately denied his role as his brother's keeper. The story emphasizes the importance of repentance and spiritual repair after transgression, with various interpretations suggesting transformation and rehabilitation through acknowledging guilt and seeking spiritual cleansing. The significance of God's questions to the wicked, including Cain, Hezekiah, and Balaam, is highlighted in various commentaries, emphasizing the lack of humility and faithfulness in their responses and the negative consequences that followed. The responsibility of an elder brother for a younger brother is underscored in Kayin's denial of being his brother's guardian when questioned by God about Hevel's fate. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר מֶ֣ה עָשִׂ֑יתָ ק֚וֹל דְּמֵ֣י אָחִ֔יךָ צֹעֲקִ֥ים אֵלַ֖י מִן־הָֽאֲדָמָֽה׃|10 J|“What have you done? Hark, your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries on Genesis 4:10 discuss Abel's blood crying out to God from the ground, symbolizing his potential descendants and emphasizing the significance of Cain's crime and accountability for his deeds. Halakhah details the process of intimidating witnesses in capital cases and the execution of the defendant, while Jewish Thought explores the spiritual implications of consuming blood. The Midrash discusses Adam and Cain's punishments, emphasizing the consequences of false testimony, and the Mishnah warns witnesses of the gravity of their role and the importance of truthful testimony. Kabbalists believe Korach was Cain's reincarnation, with Moses avenging Abel's death. The Talmud and Second Temple texts also delve into the consequences of false witness and the sanctity of human life, with references to Cain and Abel's story. 

|וְעַתָּ֖ה אָר֣וּר אָ֑תָּה מִן־הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר פָּצְתָ֣ה אֶת־פִּ֔יהָ לָקַ֛חַת אֶת־דְּמֵ֥י אָחִ֖יךָ מִיָּדֶֽךָ׃|11 J|Therefore, you shall be more cursed than the ground,  which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The author of Kedushat Levi connects the sea's refusal to wash up bodies to Adam's sin, with the ocean's revulsion at death stemming from not being involved in the sin. Cain is cursed to be separated from the ground and become a wanderer, with the earth punished for covering up Abel's blood. The Midrash explains that the earth's refusal to accept blood is due to the curse after Cain's murder, affecting agricultural success. Various commentaries interpret biblical passages related to the earth's actions, with some discussing Isaac's involvement in agriculture and the Egyptians' burial in the earth. The Midrash of Philo questions the curses on Cain and the effect of earthly elements on purity, while Targum elaborates on the curse from the ground for killing Abel. 

|כִּ֤י תַֽעֲבֹד֙ אֶת־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה לֹֽא־תֹסֵ֥ף תֵּת־כֹּחָ֖הּ לָ֑ךְ נָ֥ע וָנָ֖ד תִּֽהְיֶ֥ה בָאָֽרֶץ׃|12 J|If you till the soil, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. You shall become a ceaseless wanderer on earth.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses how a tzaddik falling from his level can lift up fallen souls, linking wars and bloodshed to higher prices due to the curse of Kayin, which affects the earth's productivity. Teaching Torah to unworthy students can also result in lack of rain, associated with the honor of the Torah. An end to war and bloodshed is desired for peace and abundance. The curse of Cain in the Midrash is seen as a punishment for his crime, emphasizing the severity of murder and the consequences of greed. The Second Temple commentary explains Cain's punishment as causing fear and grief, contrasting skilled tillers with untrained workers. The Targums interpret Genesis 4:12 as the ground not yielding its strength to those who work it, leading to a wandering existence. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר קַ֖יִן אֶל־יְהֹוָ֑ה גָּד֥וֹל עֲוֺנִ֖י מִנְּשֹֽׂא׃|13 J|Cain said to יהוה, “My punishment is too great to bear!|

|הֵן֩ גֵּרַ֨שְׁתָּ אֹתִ֜י הַיּ֗וֹם מֵעַל֙ פְּנֵ֣י הָֽאֲדָמָ֔ה וּמִפָּנֶ֖יךָ אֶסָּתֵ֑ר וְהָיִ֜יתִי נָ֤ע וָנָד֙ בָּאָ֔רֶץ וְהָיָ֥ה כׇל־מֹצְאִ֖י יַֽהַרְגֵֽנִי׃|14 J|Since You have banished me this day from the soil, and I must avoid Your presence and become a restless wanderer on earth—anyone who meets me may kill me!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the ability of a Jew to elevate any place to God, regardless of its nature. Different commentators provide interpretations of Genesis 4:14, highlighting various aspects of Cain's punishment and banishment.

|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Kayin's face fell due to tainted light of tefilin, resulting in fault-finding behavior, symbolized by a shining horn as punishment [Chasidut]. Various commentators explain the punishment of Kayin differently, with Ramban suggesting a dog as a sign, Ibn Ezra mentioning a sevenfold punishment over generations, Sforno warning against killing Kayin, and others interpreting the punishment as a threat to restrain anyone from harming him [Commentary]. Rabbi Mordechai of Lekhovitz sees the mark on Cain as a sign of preservation for himself, while Akeidat Yitzchak discusses the rainbow as a symbol of the covenant and the changed nature of man on earth [Jewish Thought]. Midrash Tanchuma explains that Cain's descendants will be punished for eliminating Abel's descendants, while Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer discusses Cain's repentance and the reward given to the ravens for burying Abel [Midrash]. Tzipporah's purifying abilities are linked to offerings of birds for purification, and the "sign" given to Cain is interpreted as either the sun shining or a visible form of skin excema [Musar]. The Targum states that Adonoy placed a mark on Kayin to protect him from being killed [Targum]. 

|וַיֵּ֥צֵא קַ֖יִן מִלִּפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה וַיֵּ֥שֶׁב בְּאֶֽרֶץ־נ֖וֹד קִדְמַת־עֵֽדֶן׃|16 J|Cain left the presence of יהוה and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Cain settled in the land of Nod after being banished from God's presence, symbolizing repentance, while the term "east of Eden" signifies distance from God. The importance of the Holy Land in prophecy and divine connection is emphasized in Jewish thought, with examples like Mount Moriah and the burial of the patriarchs. Repentance and prayer are powerful tools for reversing decrees and seeking forgiveness, as seen with Cain, Hezekiah, and Saul in the Midrash. The story of Kayin and Hevel in Genesis 4:1-16 reflects themes of sibling hatred, sin, and consequences of disobedience, with Kayin's punishment of exile mirroring his father's expulsion from Eden in the Quoting Commentary. Exile is seen as atonement for sin in the Talmud, illustrated by Cain's punishment of wandering in the land of Nod. Additionally, Moses designated cities of refuge on the east side of the Jordan River for unintentional killers in the Tanakh, while the Targum describes Cain leaving God's presence for the land of Nod as a place of exile and wandering. 

|וַיֵּ֤דַע קַ֙יִן֙ אֶת־אִשְׁתּ֔וֹ וַתַּ֖הַר וַתֵּ֣לֶד אֶת־חֲנ֑וֹךְ וַֽיְהִי֙ בֹּ֣נֶה עִ֔יר וַיִּקְרָא֙ שֵׁ֣ם הָעִ֔יר כְּשֵׁ֖ם בְּנ֥וֹ חֲנֽוֹךְ׃|17 J|Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he then founded a city, and named the city after his son Enoch.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Cain built a city named Enoch for his son to symbolize his cursed nature and ongoing works, reflecting the wicked belief that their houses will endure forever but will become their graves. The Tower of Babel story illustrates the importance of moral perfection over physical togetherness, with G-d dispersing mankind to focus on higher moral objectives. The Torah commands abstention from lashon hara as people have the power to overcome the evil inclination and be righteous, paralleling the renaming of cities in the Bible to commemorate events. The Midrash of Philo emphasizes the existence of a life beyond the flesh and reflects on the punishment of Cain for fratricide, connecting his depravity to the building of a city named after his son Enoch in subversion of divine creation. 

|וַיִּוָּלֵ֤ד לַֽחֲנוֹךְ֙ אֶת־עִירָ֔ד וְעִירָ֕ד יָלַ֖ד אֶת־מְחֽוּיָאֵ֑ל וּמְחִיָּיאֵ֗ל יָלַד֙ אֶת־מְת֣וּשָׁאֵ֔ל וּמְתוּשָׁאֵ֖ל יָלַ֥ד אֶת־לָֽמֶךְ׃|18 J|To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael  begot Methusael, and Methusael begot Lamech.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The influence of Avraham on Yitzchok extended to the next generation, allowing Yaakov to unify their characteristics and serve God harmoniously. The descendants of Cain and Seth in Genesis 4 had names reflecting their roles in society, with a focus on material progress and artistic expression. The Midrash discusses the consequences of rebellion against God among the descendants of Adam. Radak explains the silent second letters in Hebrew words, while the Second Temple commentary interprets the meanings of the names of Cain's descendants in relation to their actions. The Targum provides a genealogy of Chanoch's descendants. 

|וַיִּֽקַּֽח־ל֥וֹ לֶ֖מֶךְ שְׁתֵּ֣י נָשִׁ֑ים שֵׁ֤ם הָֽאַחַת֙ עָדָ֔ה וְשֵׁ֥ם הַשֵּׁנִ֖ית צִלָּֽה׃|19 J|Lamech took to himself two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other was Zillah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Lemech married two women, Adah and Tzillah, for different purposes, leading to jealousy and discord. The practice of polygamy and giving barren potions to wives was common in that generation. God judges people through the heavens, punishing the wicked and providing for the righteous. Lamech's choice of two wives is seen as reprehensible compared to good men like Abraham, Jacob, and Aaron. Certain sexual acts not intended for procreation are considered sinful, with Lemekh's actions of taking two wives interpreted as focusing on beauty and children. In Genesis 4:19, Lemech is mentioned as marrying two women, Adah and Zillah. 

|וַתֵּ֥לֶד עָדָ֖ה אֶת־יָבָ֑ל ה֣וּא הָיָ֔ה אֲבִ֕י יֹשֵׁ֥ב אֹ֖הֶל וּמִקְנֶֽה׃|20 J|Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who dwell in tents and amidst herds.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaval was the first to dwell in tents and raise livestock, leading to a distinct culture of shepherding, while his brother used musical instruments for idol worship. The rise of Cainan as a wise ruler and the birth of his descendants are described in Sefer HaYashar, while Bereshit Rabbah 23:3 explains the origins of livestock herders, musicians, and weapon forgers among Cain's descendants. Ibn Ezra explains that Jacob was a keeper of herds and flocks who dwelled in tents to be close to his flocks, while Chizkuni interprets Jacob's tent-dwelling as tending sheep and making a livelihood as a shepherd. In the Second Temple commentary, Ada is associated with worthless things and mischief, representing lovers of pleasure and passions. Targum Jonathan on Genesis 4:20 states that Yaval was the leader of those who lived in tents and raised cattle. 

|וְשֵׁ֥ם אָחִ֖יו יוּבָ֑ל ה֣וּא הָיָ֔ה אֲבִ֕י כׇּל־תֹּפֵ֥שׂ כִּנּ֖וֹר וְעוּגָֽב׃|21 J|And the name of his brother was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all who play the lyre and the pipe.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the connection between shepherding and the creation of music, exemplified by figures like Yuval and King David. Commentary delves into Yuval's role as the first musician and inventor of musical instruments, while Midrash explores concepts of lending to the poor and descendants of Cain. Quoting Commentary discusses interpretations of various biblical passages, including the significance of monotheism and the custom of having two wives. Second Temple texts describe Jubal as a lawgiver and inventor of musical instruments, while Targum translations identify Yuval as a master of music. 

|וְצִלָּ֣ה גַם־הִ֗וא יָֽלְדָה֙ אֶת־תּ֣וּבַל קַ֔יִן לֹטֵ֕שׁ כׇּל־חֹרֵ֥שׁ נְחֹ֖שֶׁת וּבַרְזֶ֑ל וַֽאֲח֥וֹת תּֽוּבַל־קַ֖יִן נַֽעֲמָֽה׃|22 J|As for Zillah, she bore Tubal-cain, who forged all implements of copper and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Tuval Cain was a skilled forger of brass and iron, providing weapons for murderers, while his sister Naamah, possibly Noah's wife, was known for her good character and musical abilities. Tzilah, against her husband Lemech's wishes, gave birth to children, illustrating God's ability to perform miracles with barren women. In the Second Temple period, Thobel and Noeman symbolized self-conceit and materialism, leading to forgetfulness of God and spiritual weakness. Tzillah gave birth to Tuval Kayin, skilled in working with copper and iron, while Naamah excelled in music and song. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר לֶ֜מֶךְ לְנָשָׁ֗יו עָדָ֤ה וְצִלָּה֙ שְׁמַ֣עַן קוֹלִ֔י נְשֵׁ֣י לֶ֔מֶךְ הַאְזֵ֖נָּה אִמְרָתִ֑י כִּ֣י אִ֤ישׁ הָרַ֙גְתִּי֙ לְפִצְעִ֔י וְיֶ֖לֶד לְחַבֻּרָתִֽי׃|23 J|And Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; O wives of Lamech, give ear to my speech. I have slain a person for wounding me, And a lad for bruising me. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Lamech reassures his wives that they should not fear bearing children, claiming divine protection even greater than Cain's; Midrash texts emphasize divine justice and order in events such as the destruction of Jerusalem and Sodom and Gomorrah; Ramban discusses the involvement of celestial beings in certain verses; Lamech in the Midrash of Philo blames himself for Cain's death; a heretic questions Rabbi Yishmael about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Talmud; the speaker in the Tanakh does not want to be associated with violent actions like those of Reuben and Simeon; in the Targum, Lamech denies responsibility for killing a man or wounding a child. 

|כִּ֥י שִׁבְעָתַ֖יִם יֻקַּם־קָ֑יִן וְלֶ֖מֶךְ שִׁבְעִ֥ים וְשִׁבְעָֽה׃|24 J|If Cain is avenged sevenfold, Then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Lamech expresses anguish over killing his son, believes his punishment will be greater than Kayin's, Rashi explains Lemech's wives separated due to decree on Kayin's descendants and impending Flood, Lamech's argument for suspension of punishment is deemed absurd, Lamech reassures wives they won't be punished for bearing children, Talmud discusses contempt for the Eternal's Word, Targum states Kayin's punishment suspended for seven generations, Lemech's extended to seventy-seven generations. 

|וַיֵּ֨דַע אָדָ֥ם עוֹד֙ אֶת־אִשְׁתּ֔וֹ וַתֵּ֣לֶד בֵּ֔ן וַתִּקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ שֵׁ֑ת כִּ֣י שָֽׁת־לִ֤י אֱלֹהִים֙ זֶ֣רַע אַחֵ֔ר תַּ֣חַת הֶ֔בֶל כִּ֥י הֲרָג֖וֹ קָֽיִן׃|25 J|Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, meaning, “God has provided me with  another offspring in place of Abel,” for Cain had killed him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Miriam's role in watching over her brother Moses symbolizes distancing oneself from secular concerns to approach God, with Moses having a direct connection to God. The birth of Seth to Adam and Eve signifies a gift from God to compensate for the loss of Abel, with Seth considered the foundation of humanity. The significance of the Holy Land in Jewish tradition is emphasized, along with the spiritual preparation symbolized by Aaron and his sons' seven days of consecration. The Midrash discusses the giving of the Torah entirely of fire and the separation of the Jewish people from others. Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman notes the unique spelling of Toldot in Genesis 2:4 and the restoration of what God withdrew from Adam in the future. Seth is seen as a positive growth from Abel, symbolizing fruitfulness and moral excellence. The Talmud discusses the importance of having children and provides comfort to Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai after the loss of his son. Adam and Eve's son Sheis, also known as Sheth, is seen as a replacement for Hevel in Targum commentary. 

|וּלְשֵׁ֤ת גַּם־הוּא֙ יֻלַּד־בֵּ֔ן וַיִּקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ אֱנ֑וֹשׁ אָ֣ז הוּחַ֔ל לִקְרֹ֖א בְּשֵׁ֥ם יְהֹוָֽה׃|26 J|And to Seth, in turn, a son was born, and he named him Enosh. It was then that יהוה began to be invoked by name.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of observing Shabbat strictly, using mnemonic devices to remember the details. Halakhah discusses the rise of idol worship during Enosh's time and the few individuals who recognized the true God. Jewish Thought explores the significance of calling upon God's name in prayer and the importance of Sabbath observance. Liturgy details various events from the creation of the world to Yom Kippur rituals. Midrash discusses the generations starting with Enosh, leading to rebellion against God. Musar highlights the consequences of idol worship and evil speech. Quoting Commentary delves into Lemekh's challenge to God and interpretations of the Sabbath's blessings.

## Genesis 5

|זֶ֣ה סֵ֔פֶר תּוֹלְדֹ֖ת אָדָ֑ם בְּי֗וֹם בְּרֹ֤א אֱלֹהִים֙ אָדָ֔ם בִּדְמ֥וּת אֱלֹהִ֖ים עָשָׂ֥ה אֹתֽוֹ׃|1 R|This is the record of Adam’s line.—When God created humankind, it was made in the likeness of God;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah emphasizes the importance of desire for Torah study and careful consideration of holy works before publication, highlighting the essence of Chasidism in the actions of Chasidim. Rabbinic tradition discusses the greatest principles in the Torah, recognizing the sanctity of all human beings created in the image of God. Kabbalistic prayer for children draws strength from qualities of victory and majesty to influence growth in all living beings. The Midrash explores the significance of wind in the world and the creation and descendants of Adam, while Musar delves into the decline in spirituality during Enosh's lifetime. Radak explains that man is the crown jewel of creation with authority over all creatures, and Rabbeinu Bahya emphasizes the importance of the land of Israel in the calendar.

The Talmud explores the creation of man and woman as one entity, and Tosefta discusses marriage restrictions and fulfilling the mitzvah of procreation with two sons or a son and a daughter. 

|וַיְחִ֣י אָדָ֗ם שְׁלֹשִׁ֤ים וּמְאַת֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בִּדְמוּת֖וֹ כְּצַלְמ֑וֹ וַיִּקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ שֵֽׁת׃|3 R|When Adam had lived 130 years, he begot a son in his likeness after his image, and he named him Seth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the concept of drawing down G'd's largesse, comparing it to a potter creating a vase, with Israel's process likened to this.

Second Temple literature emphasizes the importance of purity in genealogy, choosing Seth over Cain. Talmud suggests that Adam bore creatures in his likeness only after 130 years of ostracism. Targum notes the likeness of Sheth to Adam, unlike his previous sons. 

|וַיִּֽהְי֣וּ יְמֵי־אָדָ֗ם אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־שֵׁ֔ת שְׁמֹנֶ֥ה מֵאֹ֖ת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|4 R|After the birth of Seth, Adam lived 800 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The first men in the Torah lived long lives due to perfect physical condition, with lifespans decreasing after the flood due to tainted air. The select few with long lifespans were exceptions, with varying circumstances. Lifespans decreased to about 70 years by the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reflecting spiritual decline. The Torah lists generations until the flood, omitting details of Adam and Seth's children. Ramban explains the "sons of God" in Genesis were descendants of Adam and Eve, leading to the Nephilim. Targum states Adam lived 800 years after Seth's birth and had sons and daughters. 

|וַיִּֽהְי֞וּ כׇּל־יְמֵ֤י אָדָם֙ אֲשֶׁר־חַ֔י תְּשַׁ֤ע מֵאוֹת֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּשְׁלֹשִׁ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃|5 R|All the days that Adam lived came to 930 years; then he died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains how the serpent convinced Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge, leading to the falling off of 288 sparks from the Shechinah. The lifespan of Adam was determined during his life, he lived for 930 years before dying due to sin. The five senses correspond to various aspects of Jewish tradition, with each finger serving a specific sense organ. In Midrash, the years from Adam to the Flood are detailed, along with interpretations of Adam and Eve's actions in the garden. In Musar, involuntary manslaughter is likened to Adam's expulsion from Eden. The Talmud discusses the creation of Adam from a spoonful taken from the place of the altar. According to Targum, Adam lived for 930 years before dying. 

|וַֽיְחִי־שֵׁ֕ת חָמֵ֥שׁ שָׁנִ֖ים וּמְאַ֣ת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־אֱנֽוֹשׁ׃|6 R|When Seth had lived 105 years, he begot Enosh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Seth, the ancestor of the Israelites, lived 105 years and fathered Enosh. The Midrash discusses the righteousness of biblical figures like Joseph, Elijah, Manasseh, and Gideon, emphasizing the importance of observing religious obligations and doing good works. Lemech did not immediately name his son Noach due to fear of idol-worshippers, but eventually did so because of his potential to save mankind. In the Second Temple text, Moses philosophically discusses the creation of man, animals, Eve, and the naming of Adam and Eve. 

|וַֽיְחִי־שֵׁ֗ת אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־אֱנ֔וֹשׁ שֶׁ֣בַע שָׁנִ֔ים וּשְׁמֹנֶ֥ה מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|7 R|After the birth of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Seth lived for 807 years after the birth of Enosh and had other children besides him. Rashi explains the significance of the Divine Name 'ה and Chizkuni discusses the naming of altars by biblical figures to symbolize the special relationship between God and Israel. Targum states that Sheis lived for 807 years after having Enosh and had other children as well. 

|וַיִּֽהְיוּ֙ כׇּל־יְמֵי־שֵׁ֔ת שְׁתֵּ֤ים עֶשְׂרֵה֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּתְשַׁ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃|8 R|All the days of Seth came to 912 years; then he died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Seth lived for 912 years before dying, and it is unclear if all the sons listed in the genealogical record were firstborns. The Torah may only mention the first son by name to divide the father's life into two periods. The family line continues through each son until the birth of Noah. Isaac had come by way of Beer-lahai-roi before he took Rebekah as his wife, leading Rabbi to interpret that Abraham had remarried Hagar. Rabbi believes Hagar and Keturah are the same person, as both are associated with Beer-lahai-roi. However, other masters believe Abraham took another wife after Sarah's death. Or HaChaim explains that the term אדם includes babies and women in the context of Leviticus 13:2:3, while Chizkuni clarifies that the repetition of Joseph in the descendants of Yaakov in Genesis 37:2:2 is due to an interruption in the narrative similar to that of Noach's sons in Genesis 5,8. Both Targums state that Sheth lived for 912 years before his death. 

|וַיְחִ֥י אֱנ֖וֹשׁ תִּשְׁעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־קֵינָֽן׃|9 R|When Enosh had lived 90 years, he begot Kenan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the difference between the innerness and externality of Yesod of Zeir Anpin, represented by Yosef and Noach respectively, who is also called "righteous" and "perfect" in Zohar. Enosh had a son named Kenan, emphasizing ownership and acquisition. Midrash Tanchuma highlights the importance of good deeds, having a mezuzah, and avoiding adultery which transgresses multiple commandments. Seder Olam Zutta stresses the significance of modesty and proper behavior for women. Both Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention Enosh having a son named Keinan. 

|וַיְחִ֣י אֱנ֗וֹשׁ אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־קֵינָ֔ן חֲמֵ֤שׁ עֶשְׂרֵה֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּשְׁמֹנֶ֥ה מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|10 R|After the birth of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Enosh lived for 815 years after Kenan was born and had other children, as stated in the commentary on Genesis 5:10. The Talmud teaches that the blood of a murdered person and their potential descendants cry out to God, emphasizing the severity of taking a human life. Rashi clarifies that the word "הפגרים" should be translated as "carcasses" and not "halves." The Targum confirms that Enosh lived 815 years after having Kenan and had additional children. 

|וַיִּֽהְיוּ֙ כׇּל־יְמֵ֣י אֱנ֔וֹשׁ חָמֵ֣שׁ שָׁנִ֔ים וּתְשַׁ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃|11 R|All the days of Enosh came to 905 years; then he died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Enosh lived for 905 years before he died, according to Steinsaltz on Genesis 5:11. The Seder Olam Zutta 2:1 credits Sarah, Miriam, Puah, and Yocheved with helping to redeem the Israelites from Egypt through their righteous actions, including providing hospitality, leading in song and dance, and defying Pharaoh's orders. Both Targums also confirm that Enosh lived for 905 years before his death. 

|וַיְחִ֥י קֵינָ֖ן שִׁבְעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־מַֽהֲלַלְאֵֽל׃|12 R|When Kenan had lived 70 years, he begot Mahalalel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Kenan, the son of Enosh and father of Mahalalel, lived for seventy years before Mahalalel was born. The Sabbath is considered equal to the entire law in Jewish tradition, with offerings symbolizing biblical figures and aspects of their lives. Rashi explains that "ימים" in Genesis 36:24 refers to mules, highlighting the importance of Timna and Abraham. The Targum states that Kenan lived for seventy years and had a son named Mahalalel. 

|וַיְחִ֣י קֵינָ֗ן אַחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־מַֽהֲלַלְאֵ֔ל אַרְבָּעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה וּשְׁמֹנֶ֥ה מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|13 R|After the birth of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Kenan lived for a total of 910 years, with 840 of those years being after the birth of his son Mahalalel. Rashi explains that in Genesis 7:16:1, God protected the Ark by surrounding it with bears and lions. In Genesis 8:5:1, Rashi argues that the tenth month mentioned refers to Ab, not Elul. Targum Jonathan also states that Kenan lived for 840 years after having Mahalalel and had sons and daughters. 

|וַיִּֽהְיוּ֙ כׇּל־יְמֵ֣י קֵינָ֔ן עֶ֣שֶׂר שָׁנִ֔ים וּתְשַׁ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃|14 R|All the days of Kenan came to 910 years; then he died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Kenan lived for 910 years before dying, with prophecy being linked to the Holy Land and its inhabitants, as seen with Abraham, Ezekiel, and Daniel. The genealogy of Esau's descendants, particularly Amalek, is discussed in Seder Olam Zutta 2:1, connecting them to cruelty and wickedness. The comparison is made between Lot's experience in Sodom and a dream, highlighting the Torah's teachings. Keinan lived for 910 years according to the Targum. 

|וַיְחִ֣י מַֽהֲלַלְאֵ֔ל חָמֵ֥שׁ שָׁנִ֖ים וְשִׁשִּׁ֣ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־יָֽרֶד׃|15 R|When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he begot Jared.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Mahalalel was sixty-five years old when he had a son named Yered. The Midrash in Seder Olam Zutta 2:1 interprets the creation of the world in six days as each day corresponding to a thousand years of human history, emphasizing the importance of observing the Sabbath day. The Targum simply states that Mahalalel lived 65 years and had a son named Yered. 

|וַיְחִ֣י מַֽהֲלַלְאֵ֗ל אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־יֶ֔רֶד שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה וּשְׁמֹנֶ֥ה מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|16 R|After the birth of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Mahalalel lived for 830 years after the birth of Yered and had other children. 

|וַיִּהְיוּ֙ כׇּל־יְמֵ֣י מַהֲלַלְאֵ֔ל חָמֵ֤שׁ וְתִשְׁעִים֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּשְׁמֹנֶ֥ה מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃|17 R|All the days of Mahalalel came to 895 years; then he died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Mahalalel lived for 895 years before he died, according to the Targum and Steinsaltz on Genesis 5:17. The Midrash in Seder Olam Zutta 2:1 also discusses the creation of the world in six days, the lifespan of Adam, the birth of Seth, and the genealogy of Adam's descendants up to Noah. 

|וַֽיְחִי־יֶ֕רֶד שְׁתַּ֧יִם וְשִׁשִּׁ֛ים שָׁנָ֖ה וּמְאַ֣ת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־חֲנֽוֹךְ׃|18 R|When Jared had lived 162 years, he begot Enoch.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yered lived 162 years and had Hanokh, the seventh generation associated with holiness and sanctity, as seen in other instances like David being the seventh son of Yishai. Jared's name means "descent" because in his time, angels came down to teach humanity how to serve God. Yered lived 162 years and had a son named Chanoch. 

|וַֽיְחִי־יֶ֗רֶד אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־חֲנ֔וֹךְ שְׁמֹנֶ֥ה מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|19 R|After the birth of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yered lived for 962 years, had sons and daughters after Hanokh, and lived for 800 years after that. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi explains Adam's concern about sharing with his donkey when told he would have to work for food. The earth brought forth grass according to its species, with a midrashic interpretation discussing the minister of the world, possibly Chanoch. Jared lived for 800 years after having Hanok and had other children. 

|וַיִּֽהְיוּ֙ כׇּל־יְמֵי־יֶ֔רֶד שְׁתַּ֤יִם וְשִׁשִּׁים֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּתְשַׁ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃|20 R|All the days of Jared came to 962 years; then he died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yered lived for 962 years before he died, according to Seder Olam Zutta 2:1 and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 5:20.

The Midrash Tanchuma Buber discusses tithing from Adam to Abraham, emphasizing its importance in the Torah and referencing verses from Deuteronomy and Malachi. The Seder Olam Zutta 2:1 commentary discusses the blessings of the Lord upon Israel in the world to come, as mentioned in Jeremiah 31:22. Rabbeinu Bahya explains the significance of the phrase "said to himself" in Esau's reaction, contrasting the control of the heart between the wicked and the righteous. Hanok lived 65 years and had a son named Methushelach according to the Targum. 

|וַיִּתְהַלֵּ֨ךְ חֲנ֜וֹךְ אֶת־הָֽאֱלֹהִ֗ים אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־מְתוּשֶׁ֔לַח שְׁלֹ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|22 R|After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years; and he begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Enoch, son of Jared, walked with God, living righteously and emulating His ways by performing acts of lovingkindness and issuing rebuke, possibly indicating his role as a prophet or exceedingly righteous man. Idol worship spread among the nations through false prophets, with a few righteous individuals like Chanoch, Metushelach, Noach, Shem, and Ever remaining faithful until the birth of Abraham. The process of refining impurity passed down through generations of righteous individuals like Sheth, Chanoch, Noach, Avraham, and Yitzchak, each further refining the contamination but still passing some on to the next generation. The highest service to the Creator is out of love, not fear, as exemplified by Abraham being called "My friend" and the pious being instructed to love God. Enoch lived 165 years before repentance, represented by a combination of odd and even numbers symbolizing imbalance and wickedness, while he lived 200 years after repentance, represented by a combination of even numbers symbolizing purification and virtue. 

|וַיְהִ֖י כׇּל־יְמֵ֣י חֲנ֑וֹךְ חָמֵ֤שׁ וְשִׁשִּׁים֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּשְׁלֹ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָֽה׃|23 R|All the days of Enoch came to 365 years.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chanoch lived for 365 years, symbolizing a connection to the sun and celestial luminaries, with a special illumination and connection to the original light from creation. In Midrash, Lamech accidentally kills Cain and Tubal-Cain, leading to his wives leaving him. Enoch's righteous behavior and separation from wickedness is emphasized in Seder Olam Zutta. In Second Temple texts, Enoch's pleasing of God after begetting Methuselah introduces penitence and repentance for divine indulgence. The Targum simply states that Enoch lived for 365 years among the people of the earth. 

|וַיִּתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ חֲנ֖וֹךְ אֶת־הָֽאֱלֹהִ֑ים וְאֵינֶ֕נּוּ כִּֽי־לָקַ֥ח אֹת֖וֹ אֱלֹהִֽים׃|24 R|Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, for God took him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the souls of tzaddikim in Atzilut remain connected to Divinity, while commentary suggests Enoch's removal from earth was a positive experience due to his righteousness. Halakhah describes the Garden of Eden as a reward for fulfilling mitzvot, and Jewish Thought emphasizes the importance of striving for a long life to deserve the world to come. Midrash discusses the significance of the number seven and God's judgment, while Musar explores the transformation of Noach and Chanoch into angels. Quoting Commentary includes interpretations by Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Ramban. Second Temple texts highlight Enoch's pleasing of God upon his death, and Tanakh mentions God's instruction to Ezekiel not to lament. Targum states that Hanok walked with the fear of Elohim and was taken by Elohim, becoming known as Metatron. 

|וַיְחִ֣י מְתוּשֶׁ֔לַח שֶׁ֧בַע וּשְׁמֹנִ֛ים שָׁנָ֖ה וּמְאַ֣ת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־לָֽמֶךְ׃|25 R|When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he begot Lamech.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Methuselah lived to be 187 years old and had a son named Lemekh, with the significance of the number seven highlighted in Jewish tradition, and Rashi explaining the naming of Eve by Adam and Jacob by God. 

|וַיְחִ֣י מְתוּשֶׁ֗לַח אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־לֶ֔מֶךְ שְׁתַּ֤יִם וּשְׁמוֹנִים֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּשְׁבַ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|26 R|After the birth of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Methuselah lived for 782 years after fathering Lamech and had other children besides Lamech. Enoch ruled over the people for 243 years with wisdom and justice before ascending to the heavens as ruler over the sons of God. Rashi interprets "ותגנב אתי" as "thou didst steal away my mind" and "בני עלית" as withdrawing from a murderous deed. Targum states that Methushelach lived for 782 years after having Lemech and had both sons and daughters. 

|וַיִּהְיוּ֙ כׇּל־יְמֵ֣י מְתוּשֶׁ֔לַח תֵּ֤שַׁע וְשִׁשִּׁים֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּתְשַׁ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃|27 R|All the days of Methuselah came to 969 years; then he died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Methuselah lived for 969 years, the longest lifespan recorded in the Bible [Steinsaltz on Genesis 5:27]. The Midrash provides specific ages of key figures from Adam to the Flood, including Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Abraham, and Eber, who prophetically named his son Peleg with the aid of the Holy Spirit. Rashi explains that the twins in Rebecca's womb will have different life paths, with one being wicked and the other leading a plain life. Both Targums confirm that Methuselah lived for 969 years before his death. 

|וַֽיְחִי־לֶ֕מֶךְ שְׁתַּ֧יִם וּשְׁמֹנִ֛ים שָׁנָ֖ה וּמְאַ֣ת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד בֵּֽן׃|28 R|When Lamech had lived 182 years, he begot a son.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that the term "בן" in Genesis 5:28:1 connotes building, indicating that Lemekh's son would be the one from whom the world was built up. Da'at Zekenim notes that the Torah did not mention Noach by name, hinting at his future importance as the survivor of the deluge. Chizkuni adds that Noach warranted an extra verse in the Torah due to the fact that the entire human race exists today thanks to him, as he was the only survivor of the flood along with his family. In Jewish antiquity and subsequent centuries, women were viewed as weak and incapable of world-building, leading to discriminatory treatment in society. Lamech named his son Noah, meaning "comfort, ease," because he was born circumcised, fulfilling the prophecy that a man-child already circumcised would bring comfort in their work. Moses questions if he, as a man, should be expected to relate to the Jewish people like a mother, suggesting that the verb ילד refers to a father's role in producing a child and הרה to a mother's input. He emphasizes the challenges and sacrifices mothers make in raising their children, comparing himself to a nurse carrying a suckling to illustrate his role. Targum: Lemech lived for 182 years and had a son. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֧א אֶת־שְׁמ֛וֹ נֹ֖חַ לֵאמֹ֑ר זֶ֞֠ה יְנַחֲמֵ֤נוּ מִֽמַּעֲשֵׂ֙נוּ֙ וּמֵעִצְּב֣וֹן יָדֵ֔ינוּ מִן־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵֽרְרָ֖הּ יְהֹוָֽה׃|29 J|And he named him Noah, saying, “This one will provide us relief  from our work and from the toil of our hands, out of the very soil which יהוה placed under a curse.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights Shabbat as a source of comfort and joy, emphasizing the unity underlying all phenomena and the ability to experience holiness and joy through praise, thanks, and Torah study even on weekdays. Jewish Thought explores the significance of Noach's name in bringing relief and rest to mankind, reflecting a shift towards spirituality away from materialism. Kabbalah connects Noach to the restoration of the earth to its original state, while Midrash discusses the symbolic meanings of famines throughout history and the impact of the presence of righteous individuals. Musar suggests a mystical transformation of Noach into the angel Matatron, and Talmud emphasizes the positive impact of righteous individuals like Noach in bringing comfort and relief. 

|וַֽיְחִי־לֶ֗מֶךְ אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־נֹ֔חַ חָמֵ֤שׁ וְתִשְׁעִים֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וַחֲמֵ֥שׁ מֵאֹ֖ת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|30 R|After the birth of Noah, Lamech lived 595 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbeinu Bahya calculates that Noach was born 1056 years after Adam, with Lemech naming him to signify consolation for their suffering. Lemech lived for 595 years after Noach's birth and had more children. 

|וַֽיְהִי֙ כׇּל־יְמֵי־לֶ֔מֶךְ שֶׁ֤בַע וְשִׁבְעִים֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וּשְׁבַ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃|31 R|All the days of Lamech came to 777 years; then he died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah provides historical records of wicked people's lifespans, including Lemekh who lived for 777 years. The Midrash recounts the wickedness of humanity during Noah's time, leading to the flood. Rashbam explains that specific lifetimes in the Bible help calculate key dates in Jewish history, such as the Judges and Kings during the first Temple period. The Targum also mentions Lemekh living for 777 years before his death. 

|וַֽיְהִי־נֹ֕חַ בֶּן־חֲמֵ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֣וֹלֶד נֹ֔חַ אֶת־שֵׁ֖ם אֶת־חָ֥ם וְאֶת־יָֽפֶת׃|32 R|When Noah had lived 500 years, Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the righteous individuals who serve individually or lead others to their Creator, contrasting Noach's lack of acquiring souls with Avraham's conversion of pagans. Commentary notes Noah's delay in having children out of fear for their fate, while Midrash highlights the significance of the lineage from Adam to Noah and the moral perfection symbolized by Hanokh's life span. Second Temple interprets the names Shem, Ham, and Japhet, and Talmud disputes the birth order of Noah's sons. Targum confirms that Noah was 500 years old when he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japhet. 

## Genesis 6

|וַֽיְהִי֙ כִּֽי־הֵחֵ֣ל הָֽאָדָ֔ם לָרֹ֖ב עַל־פְּנֵ֣י הָֽאֲדָמָ֑ה וּבָנ֖וֹת יֻלְּד֥וּ לָהֶֽם׃|1 J|When humankind began to increase on earth and daughters were born to them,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The story of the flood in Genesis highlights the consequences of intermingling divine and human species, leading to licentious behavior and ultimately the need for divine judgment. The Midrash warns against following the practices of Egypt and Canaan, emphasizing the importance of refraining from licentious behavior. The difference between Noach and Abraham is that Noach needed God's guidance while Abraham took the initiative in leading others to monotheism and good deeds. The increase in the human race before the deluge is seen as a sign of divine mercy, with blessings meant to prevent sin. The Talmud provides interpretations of the phrase "And it came to pass" in Genesis, highlighting negative consequences and debates on its meaning. 

|וַיִּרְא֤וּ בְנֵי־הָֽאֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת־בְּנ֣וֹת הָֽאָדָ֔ם כִּ֥י טֹבֹ֖ת הֵ֑נָּה וַיִּקְח֤וּ לָהֶם֙ נָשִׁ֔ים מִכֹּ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר בָּחָֽרוּ׃|2 J|the [males among the] divine beings  saw how pleasing the human women were and took wives from among those who delighted them.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The "sons of God" in Genesis 6:2 are interpreted as morally high-ranking human beings who abused their power, leading to moral decay and violence, ultimately resulting in the downfall of society. Lust leads to epidemics affecting both good and bad individuals, as seen in Reshit Chokhmah, and the mixing of divine and human beings leads to a distinction being established by God regarding human limitations in age, as mentioned in Leviticus and the Talmud. The generation of the Flood became haughty due to their arrogance and were ultimately destroyed by a flood, as warned by God in the Tosefta. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָ֗ה לֹֽא־יָד֨וֹן רוּחִ֤י בָֽאָדָם֙ לְעֹלָ֔ם בְּשַׁגַּ֖ם ה֣וּא בָשָׂ֑ר וְהָי֣וּ יָמָ֔יו מֵאָ֥ה וְעֶשְׂרִ֖ים שָׁנָֽה׃|3 J|יהוה said, “My breath shall not abide  in humankind forever, since it too is flesh; let the days allowed them be one hundred and twenty years.”—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses how Moses had clear visions of G'd while other prophets had blurred visions derived from Moses' experiences, emphasizing his importance in enabling holiness. Commentary from Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, and Sforno interprets Genesis 6:3, with discussions on God's spirit, man's physical nature, and the need for repentance. Halakhah emphasizes the need to acknowledge changes in wine with a new blessing, connecting joy and sorrow in life. Jewish Thought delves into hidden meanings in biblical verses, while Kabbalah explores consequences of human actions in relation to G'd. Liturgy stresses the importance of obeying commandments and teaching future generations. Midrash discusses Noah's righteousness and the exclusion of certain groups from the World-to-Come. Mishnah lists groups excluded from the World-to-Come and differing beliefs on the return of the ten tribes. Musar discusses righteous figures and the hierarchy of Kohanim, Leviim, and Israelites. Quoting Commentary includes interpretations from Rashi, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Haamek Sheilah. Second Temple and Talmud discuss the limitations of the divine spirit due to man's fleshly nature and the fate of wicked generations. Tanakh highlights God's frustration with the Israelites, while Targum emphasizes the grace period for repentance before judgment for the evil generation. 

|הַנְּפִלִ֞ים הָי֣וּ בָאָ֘רֶץ֮ בַּיָּמִ֣ים הָהֵם֒ וְגַ֣ם אַֽחֲרֵי־כֵ֗ן אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָבֹ֜אוּ בְּנֵ֤י הָֽאֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל־בְּנ֣וֹת הָֽאָדָ֔ם וְיָלְד֖וּ לָהֶ֑ם הֵ֧מָּה הַגִּבֹּרִ֛ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר מֵעוֹלָ֖ם אַנְשֵׁ֥י הַשֵּֽׁם׃|4 J|It was then, and later too, that the Nephilim appeared on earth—when divine beings cohabited with the human women, who bore them offspring. Such were the heroes of old, the men of renown.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of recognizing and working on one's deficiencies to be spiritually connected to God, while the Nephilim, descendants of fallen angels and human women, were giants who caused fear due to their imposing stature. Kabbalah discusses the limitations of angels in this world and their reliance on souls for sustenance, with the Erelim angels lacking when not drawn to inner souls. Midrash describes the rebellious nature of the Nephilim and their consequences, while Musar highlights the misuse of God's name leading to destruction. Quoting Commentary provides various interpretations of biblical giants and their significance, Second Temple texts explore the connection between fallen angels, giants, and the Flood, and Talmud discusses the descent of fallen angels and the reassurance of Moses before battling Og. Tanakh references describe the Nephilim as imposing figures, and Targum mentions the existence of giants on earth born from the union of fallen angels and human women. 

|וַיַּ֣רְא יְהֹוָ֔ה כִּ֥י רַבָּ֛ה רָעַ֥ת הָאָדָ֖ם בָּאָ֑רֶץ וְכׇל־יֵ֙צֶר֙ מַחְשְׁבֹ֣ת לִבּ֔וֹ רַ֥ק רַ֖ע כׇּל־הַיּֽוֹם׃|5 J|יהוה saw how great was human wickedness on earth—how every plan devised by the human mind was nothing but evil all the time.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text explores the two inclinations within a person, good and evil, and how God regretted creating humans due to their evil impulses but found favor in Noah. It discusses the impact of man's actions on the earth, the importance of free will in God's decision-making process, and the balance between sins and merits. The evil inclination continually renews itself, leading to evil thoughts and desires, with the generation of the flood and the people of Sodom considered wicked sinners. The sin of spilling seed in vain is connected to defilement and wickedness, and the Midrash emphasizes the constant battle against the evil inclination. The members of certain generations and groups are said to have no share in the World-to-Come, with the Talmud discussing the strength of the evil inclination and the grave sin of masturbation. 

|וַיִּנָּ֣חֶם יְהֹוָ֔ה כִּֽי־עָשָׂ֥ה אֶת־הָֽאָדָ֖ם בָּאָ֑רֶץ וַיִּתְעַצֵּ֖ב אֶל־לִבּֽוֹ׃|6 J|And יהוה regretted having made humankind on earth. With a sorrowful heart,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text explores the regret and sorrow God felt over the wickedness of humanity, leading to considerations of divine mercy and justice. It emphasizes the impact of human behavior on God's emotions and decisions, highlighting the importance of free will and the consequences of choices made. The blessing over wine reflects the balance between joy and sorrow in life, while the connection between the female aspect (Shechinah) and the male aspect (Zeir Anpin) in Kabbalah emphasizes the necessity of readiness to receive blessings. The regret over creating mankind due to their wickedness is seen in various instances, but there is no indication of taking back the gift of freedom given to humanity, emphasizing the concept of freedom without order leading to chaos. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָ֗ה אֶמְחֶ֨ה אֶת־הָאָדָ֤ם אֲשֶׁר־בָּרָ֙אתִי֙ מֵעַל֙ פְּנֵ֣י הָֽאֲדָמָ֔ה מֵֽאָדָם֙ עַד־בְּהֵמָ֔ה עַד־רֶ֖מֶשׂ וְעַד־ע֣וֹף הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם כִּ֥י נִחַ֖מְתִּי כִּ֥י עֲשִׂיתִֽם׃|7 J|יהוה said, “I will blot out from the earth humankind whom I created—humans together with beasts, creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I regret that I made them.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In the future, God will reveal His light and compassion, healing the righteous and judging the wicked based on their actions. The flood in Genesis was meant to wipe out all living creatures on earth due to man's sins, with only Noah and certain species surviving. The Torah's commandments are incomprehensible, emphasizing free will and God's foreknowledge. The concept of God's mercy is highlighted in various interpretations, with examples of punishment for sin and the importance of compassion. Noah, though righteous, was not complete in his righteousness, contrasting with Abraham's loyal heart. The destruction of mankind and animals was due to man's corruption, with God's anger symbolizing the consequences of human actions. 

|וְנֹ֕חַ מָ֥צָא חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|8 J|But Noah found favor with יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah's favor with God was due to his righteousness and refusal to partake in sinful behavior, contrasting with the wicked generation around him. Despite not attracting converts like Abraham, Noah's righteousness allowed for his survival and the continuation of humanity. The tribe of Levi was spared from punishment due to their faithfulness to God and dedication to His service. Rabbi Shimon highlights the importance of Abraham, David, and Israel in demonstrating principles of existence, reward and punishment, and the power of God. Rabbi Simlai warns against lust leading to destruction, praising Noah for his righteousness and connection to God symbolizing peace and comfort. The Talmud discusses restrictions on making scrolls of specific biblical passages for children. Noah's favor with God was due to his righteousness, as described in Targum Jonathan and Targum Jerusalem on Genesis 6:8.
