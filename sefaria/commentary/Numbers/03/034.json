T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> Numbers commences with several lists that serve to arrange and catalog the Israelite camp in the wilderness: first, the “accountings” of the Israelites fit for battle; then, the symmetrical arrangement of the camp itself, around the Tabernacle; and finally, the special listing of the Levite population, accompanied by an enumeration of its special tasks in the camp. The first part of Numbers thus takes place as it were in the shadow of Mount Sinai—that is, under the aegis of the priestly school of thinking, in which order is everything.", "There is a strong military bent to the arrangement. The census of Chapter 1 is not a head count of the entire Israelite population, but rather of those “twenty years of age and upward,” those eligible to serve in the army. The setup of the camp resembles that in ancient Egypt, with the sanctuary and ark (here “Dwelling” and “coffer”) in the center (in the Egypt of Raamses II—thought by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus—it was the king’s throne). The Levites, whom we have not encountered previously as a group with tasks distinct from those of the priests, emerge in this part of the book as caretakers and perhaps guardians of the sanctuary, in addition to their tasks of dismantling and transport of the “Holy-Shrine.” This military aspect reflects an ancient concept of Israel as the “forces of Y<small>HWH</small>,” surely a conquest image, which later becomes standardized in language in the phrase usually rendered “the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”", "Some of the material in this section might well have been put elsewhere. Chapters 5–7 would have fit nicely in Leviticus; Chapter 7, the listing of the tribal gifts brought to the sanctuary upon its dedication, could even have followed Ex. 40, where Moshe completes the erection of the structure. That these chapters are here therefore must be the result of a conscious decision, either to include material that did not find its way into the other books, or out of a feeling that they were appropriately placed in the book about Israel’s wanderings in the wilderness."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

תורת אמת", "text": "“For Gershon, the family of the Livnites [and the Shimites]” (Numbers 3:21) – why was it necessary to repeat their families; were they not stated above? Why did the verse need this? Because it says: “These are the sons of Aaron: the firstborn [Nadav, and Avihu, Elazar, and Itamar].… Nadav [and Avihu] died…” (Numbers 3:2–4) – although Aaron had four sons, only the two, Elazar and Itamar, established families; perhaps the same is true regarding the Levites. Although Gershon has two sons, Kehat four sons, and Merari two sons, perhaps not all of them established families. That is why the verse repeated when it came to enumerate the sons of Gershon, Kehat, and Merari. It specified that all their sons established families, as they were all righteous.  <br>The children of Levi are beloved, as the Omnipresent Himself dealt with each and every one of their families regarding their number, their location, their princes, and their service in the Tabernacle. The sons of Gershon, what does it say? “The number of all males counted…[were seven thousand five hundred]” (Numbers 3:22); thus the verse dealt in the number of the sons of Gershon. “The families of the Gershonites shall encamp behind the Tabernacle to the west” (Numbers 3:23) – that is their location. “The prince of the patrilineal house [of the Gershonites] was Elyasaf [son of Lael]” (Numbers 3:24) – that is their prince. “The commission of the sons of Gershon.… and the hangings of the courtyard…” (Numbers 3:25–26) – that is their service in the Tabernacle. <br>Likewise, the verse counts the sons of Kehat. That is what is written: “For Kehat, the family of the Amramites, [and the family of the Yitzharites, and the family of the Hevronites, and the family of the Uzielites]” (Numbers 3:27) – the verse apprised regarding the sons of Kehat that all of them established families, and not one of them perished. “In number, all males, [from one month old and above, eight thousand and six hundred, keepers of the commission of the sacred]” (Numbers 3:28) – that is their number. Why did the verse specify regarding the number of sons of Kehat “keepers of the commission of the sacred,” which is not stated regarding the number of the sons of Gershon nor regarding the number of sons of Merari; were the sons of Kehat “keepers of the commission of the sacred” from one month old and above? After all, one was not eligible for service until he was thirty years old. Why did it do so? It is because the Ark would purge from the sons of Kehat and would diminish their number, as it would shorten their lives.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">An improper action by somebody carrying the Ark could lead to his death.</i> Nevertheless, due to their affection for the sacred, the sons of Kehat would run after it. That is why He accorded them a reward as though they entered to serve from one month old, as it is written regarding Samuel the Ramatite: “Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life” (I Samuel 7:15). He, too, was of the descendants of Kehat. “The families of the sons of Kehat shall encamp on the side of the Tabernacle to the south” (Numbers 3:29) – that is their place. “And the prince of the patrilineal house [of the families of the Kehatites was Elitzafan son of Uziel]” (Numbers 3:30) – that is their prince. “Their commission: the Ark, [the Table, the Candelabrum, the altars, the sacred vessels with which they would serve, the screen, and all its work]” (Numbers 3:31) – that is their service in the Tabernacle.  <br>“The prince of the princes of the Levites [was Elazar son of Aaron the priest, the charge over the keepers of the commission of the sacred]” (Numbers 3:32) – why did it specify two princes for the sons of Kehat? It is because priests and Levites emerged from Kehat. Moses and Aaron emerged from Amram; Moses’s sons were Levites, and Aaron’s sons were priests. That is why it specified Elazar, who was from the priests, and he was overseer of the Levites of the sons of Kehat, and he would carry some of the sacred service [items] with the sons of Kehat. That is what is written: “The charge of Elazar, son of Aaron [the priest, is the illuminating oil, the fragrant incense, the meal offering of the daily offering, and the anointing oil; the charge of the entire Tabernacle, and of all that is in it, in the sacred, and in its vessels]” (Numbers 4:16). <br>Why did it not specify Itamar? After all, the commissions of the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari were entrusted to him. Why did it not enumerate him with them as a prince like it enumerated Elazar as a prince with the sons of Kehat? It is because Itamar did not participate in the service of the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari; that is why it did not enumerate him as a prince with them. However, Elazar participated in the burden of the sons of Kehat; that is why the verse enumerated him as a prince with them. <br>“For Merari, the family of the Maḥlites [and the family of the Mushites]” (Numbers 3:33) – the verse counted the sons of Merari, as not one of them died and they established families. “The number of all males counted…[were six thousand two hundred]” (Numbers 3:34) – it apprised of their number. “The prince of the patrilineal house [of the families of Merari was Tzuriel son of Aviḥayil]…” (Numbers 3:35) – that is their prince. “They shall encamp on the side of the Tabernacle to the north” (Numbers 3:35) – that is their place. “The appointed commission of the sons of Merari…” (Numbers 3:36) – that is their service in the Tabernacle.", "versionTitle": "The Sefaria Midrash Rabbah, 2022", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "58b1c554d6e4a937f999775e", "index_title": "Bamidbar Rabbah", "category": "Midrash", "type": "", "ref": "Bamidbar Rabbah 3:14", "anchorRef": "Numbers 3:34", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 3:34"], "sourceRef": "Bamidbar Rabbah 3:14", "sourceHeRef": "במדבר רבה ג׳:י״ד", "anchorVerse": 34, "sourceHasEn": true, "compDate": [1200], "commentaryNum": 3.0014, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Bamidbar Rabbah", "he": "במדבר רבה"}, "heTitle": "במדבר רבה", "he": "עַל פִּי ה' לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתָם כָּל זָכָר מִבֶּן חֹדֶשׁ וָמַעְלָה שְׁנַיִם וְעֶשְׂרִים אָלֶף <small>(במדבר ג, לט)</small>, אַתְּ מוֹצֵא שֵׁבֶט לֵוִי הָיוּ בַּפְּרָט עֶשְׂרִים וּשְׁנַיִם אֶלֶף וּשְׁלשׁ מֵאוֹת, מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהָיוּ אַרְבַּע מִשְׁפָּחוֹת, גֵּרְשׁוֹן וּקְהָת וּמְרָרִי וּמשֶׁה, וְאַתְּ קוֹרֵא כָּל מִשְׁפָּחָה וּמִשְׁפָּחָה בִּפְנֵי עַצְמָהּ וּמְחַשֵּׁב אוֹתָהּ. <small>(במדבר ג, כב)</small>: לְגֵרשׁוֹן שִׁבְעַת אֲלָפִים וַחֲמֵשׁ מֵאוֹת, <small>(במדבר ג, כח)</small>: וְלִקְהָת שְׁמוֹנַת אֲלָפִים וְשֵׁשׁ מֵאוֹת, <small>(במדבר ג, לד)</small>: לִמְרָרִי שֵׁשֶׁת אֲלָפִים וּמָאתַיִם, וְהֵם עוֹלִים עֶשְׂרִים וּשְׁנַיִם אֶלֶף וּשְׁלשׁ מֵאוֹת, וְכֵיוָן שֶׁהוּא כּוֹלֵל אֶת הַלְוִיִּם, הוּא עוֹשֶׂה אוֹתָם עֶשְׂרִים וּשְׁנַיִם אֶלֶף, הַשְּׁלשׁ מֵאוֹת הֵיכָן, אֶלָּא אוֹתָם שֶׁהִזְכִּיר בַּפְּרָט, לְהוֹדִיעַ כַּמָּה הָיוּ בְּכָל מִשְׁפָּחָה וּמִשְׁפָּחָה, וְאֵלּוּ שֶׁנִּכְלְלוּ עֶשְׂרִים וּשְׁנַיִם אֶלֶף וְחִסֵּר מֵהֶן שְׁלשׁ מֵאוֹת, לָמָּה עָשָׂה כֵן, אֶלָּא מִפְּנֵי שֶׁמְּנָאָן לְהַקִּישָׁן לִפְדּוֹת בְּכוֹרֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל, וּפִחֵת מֵהֶן שְׁלשׁ מֵאוֹת שֶׁהָיוּ בְּכוֹרוֹת שֶׁהָיוּ בַּלְּוִיִּם, שֶׁאֵין בְּכוֹר פּוֹדֶה בְּכוֹר, לְכָךְ הָיוּ בַּמִּשְׁפָּחוֹת עֶשְׂרִים וּשְׁנַיִם אֶלֶף וּשְׁלשׁ מֵאוֹת, וּבַכְּלָל עֶשְׂרִים וּשְׁנַיִם אֶלֶף, לִפְדוֹת בָּהֶן בְּכוֹרֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל.", "heVersionTitle": "Midrash Rabbah -- TE", "heLicense": "unknown", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "מדרש רבה - תורת אמת", "text": "“By the directive of the Lord, by their families, all males from one month old and above, were twenty-two thousand” – you find that the tribe of Levi in the detailed account was twenty-two thousand three hundred, because they were four families: Gershon, Kehat, Merari, and Moses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moses and Aaron had their own camp.

They total twenty-two thousand three hundred. When the verse includes all the Levites, it renders them twenty-two thousand. Where are the three hundred? Rather, those mentioned in the detailed count informed how many were in each and every family. Those who were included in the twenty-two thousand and had three hundred missing from them, why was this done? It was, because they were counted in order to be in parallel to, and to redeem, the firstborn of Israel. Three hundred from them that were firstborn among the Levites were subtracted, as a firstborn does not redeem a firstborn.

the Kehatite families from among the Levites” (Numbers 4:18). That is what is written: “Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him, on those who await His kindness, to deliver them from death, and to sustain them in famine” (Psalms 33:18–19). “Behold, the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him,” this is the tribe of Levi, who sit and hope for the kindness of the Holy One blessed be He. Do all people not long for the kindness of the Holy One blessed be He? It is, rather, more so regarding the tribe of Levi, as they did not receive a portion in the Land. Rather, they sit and pray that the Land of Israel will produce its produce so they can take tithes, as they have nothing in the world other than the kindness of the Holy One blessed be He. That is, “on those who await His kindness.” “To deliver them from death,” from death itself, “and to sustain them in famine,” these are twenty-four gifts of the priesthood, which were given to the tribe of Levi: ten in the Temple, ten in the provinces, and four in Jerusalem. That is, “and to sustain them in famine.” <br>Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat said: From what death were they delivered? If it was from death of this world, there is no creature that does not die. What is “to deliver them from death”? It is from death by the Ark. How so? Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: When Israel was traveling, two sparks of fire would emerge from the midst of the two staves of the Ark in order to smite their enemies. From where is it derived? It is as Moses said to Israel: ‘Why do you fear the giants; are they tougher than those who would come against us and the Ark would burn them?’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Deuteronomy 9:1–3 where Moses tell Israel not to fear the giants because of the devouring fire which passes before them.</i> Likewise, it says: “You shall know today that the Lord your God is He who passes before you, [a devouring fire]” (Deuteronomy 9:3). From here, you expound that two sparks would precede them. He said to them:<b> </b>“He will destroy them, and He will subdue them before you”<b> </b>(Deuteronomy 9:3). Since the sparks would emerge, the fire would graze the bearers of the Ark and they would be burned and decrease in number. <br>From where is it derived that the tribe of Kehat diminished in number? You find that three families would bear all the Tabernacle vessels. [The family of] Gershon bore all the woven materials: sheets, curtain, the screen, and the hangings. The family of Kehat would bear the Ark, the table, the candelabrum, the altars, and the sacred vessels. [The family of] Merari would bear the beams, the bars, the pillars, and the bases. You find that these four<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fourth family was Moses, Aaron and his children, who camped by themselves to the east of the Tabernacle.  They were included in the count of Kehat.</i> families were counted from one month old and from thirty years old. When he counts the Gershonites, he counts them from one month old, and finds them “seven thousand five hundred” (Numbers 3:22). He then counted them from thirty years old and finds them “two thousand six hundred and thirty” (Numbers 4:40). They were one hundred and thirty more than one-third. Likewise, Merari, he counts them from one month old, and their total comes to “six thousand two hundred” (Numbers 3:34). When he attributes them from thirty years old, he finds them “three thousand two hundred” (Numbers 4:44). They were one hundred more than half of them. But the family of Kehat, you find them most numerous of all the families, as from one month old he counts them and finds them “eight thousand six hundred” (Numbers 3:28). When he came from thirty years old, he finds them “two thousand seven hundred and fifty” (Numbers 4:36). They were less than one-third, by one hundred and seventeen. Why was it so? It is, rather, as Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: When Israel was traveling; two sparks of fire would emerge from the midst of the two staves and graze the bearers of the Ark and they would decrease in number. Each and every one of them was running; this one would take the table, this one would take the candelabrum, this one would take the altars, but they would flee from the Ark because it would harm them. It was as though the Ark was treated with contempt and the Holy One blessed be He would become angry with them, and again they would be eradicated. The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘How am I killing the sons of Kehat?I If they bear it, they decrease in number, if they do not bear it, there is anger directed at them.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses and to Aaron: ‘Institute a remedy for the sons of Kehat so they will not be cut off from the world, so they will not abandon and flee. “Do not cut off the tribe …” Rather, let Aaron and his sons come: “Assign them, each man to his service and to his burden” (Numbers 4:19), so that they will be unable to switch from service to service and from burden to burden.’ That is what is written: “But do this for them, and they will live, [and will not die upon their approaching the Holy of Holies. Aaron and his sons shall come, and assign them, each man to his service and to his burden]”<b> </b>(Numbers 4:19). <br>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: God forbid, the sons of Kehat would not abandon the Ark and run to the table and the candelabrum; rather, even though they would decrease in number, they would give their lives for the sake of the Ark. If so, why was He cautioning them: “Do not cut off the tribe…”? Rather, it was because they knew that anyone who bears the Ark, his reward is great; they would abandon the table, the candelabrum, and the altars, and they would all run to the Ark to receive a reward. As a result, this one would quarrel and say: ‘I will bear here,’ and that one would quarrel and say: ‘I will bear here,’ and as a result, they would act with levity and the Divine Presence would harm them. God said to Moses: ‘Institute a remedy for the sons of Kehat so they will not be eradicated from the world. “Do not cut off…” Rather, have them assigned to their service and to their burden so they will not quarrel with one another.’ Moses instituted a remedy, but they were quarreling with one another: This one would say: ‘I will bear the Ark,’ and that one would say: ‘I will bear it,’ and one would not know what was fixed for him, what was his burden. The Holy One blessed be He said, and consequently Aaron and his sons would enter and give each and every one his burden, as it is stated: “Aaron and his sons shall come, and assign them...”", "versionTitle": "The Sefaria Midrash Rabbah, 2022", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "5c214b1ddea4bb00682c48d3", "index_title": "Bekhorot", "category": "Talmud", "type": "", "ref": "Bekhorot 5a:8", "anchorRef": "Numbers 3:22-34", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 3:22", "Numbers 3:23", "Numbers 3:24", "Numbers 3:25", "Numbers 3:26", "Numbers 3:27", "Numbers 3:28", "Numbers 3:29", "Numbers 3:30", "Numbers 3:31", "Numbers 3:32", "Numbers 3:33", "Numbers 3:34"], "sourceRef": "Bekhorot 5a:8", "sourceHeRef": "בכורות ה׳ א:ח׳", "anchorVerse": 22, "sourceHasEn": true, "compDate": [450, 550], "commentaryNum": 9.0008, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Bekhorot", "he": "בכורות"}, "heTitle": "בכורות", "he": "שאל קונטרוקוס השר את רבן יוחנן בן זכאי בפרטן של לוים אתה מוצא עשרים ושנים אלף ושלש מאות בכללן אתה מוצא עשרים ושנים אלף ושלש מאות להיכן הלכו", "heVersionTitle": "Wikisource Talmud Bavli", "heLicense": "CC-BY-SA", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "תלמוד בבלי (ויקיטקסט)", "text": "§ With regard to the abrogation of the sanctity of the firstborn in the wilderness by the Levites, the Gemara relates that <b>Kontrokos the officer asked Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: In</b> the <b>individual</b> count <b>of</b> each family of <b>Levites you find</b> that there were <b>22,300</b> (see Numbers 3:22–34).
