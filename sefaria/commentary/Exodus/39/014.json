SHOHAM’ (ONYX STONES) ‘V’AVNEI MILU’IM’ (AND STONES FOR SETTING). “Because they used to make a setting for the stone in gold — a kind of indentation — and they placed the stone there to fill the indentation, they are called <i>avnei milu’im</i> (stones for filling-in), and the place of the indentation is called <i>mishbetzet</i> (setting). FOR THE EPHOD AND THE BREASTPLATE. The onyx stones were for the <i>ephod</i>, and the stones for setting were for the breastplate.” This is Rashi’s language. Similarly Rashi explained: “<i>They shall be inclosed in gold in their settings</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:20.</i> — surrounded by gold settings of such a depth that each setting shall be filled by the thickness of the stone. This is the meaning of the word <i>milu’otham</i> (their filling),<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:20.</i> and this is the meaning of every expression of <i>milui</i> (filling) mentioned in this connection.”<br>But it does not appear to me to be at all correct to say that Scripture calls them already now <i>avnei milu’im</i>, because in some time as yet in the future He was to command that the indentations made for them were to be filled with these stones! Moreover, the onyx stones were also <i>enclosed in settings of gold</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11 — in the case of the ephod.</i> and yet He did not call them <i>milu’im</i>. Again, our Rabbis have already said in the Gemara:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 48b.</i> “These stones<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The onyx stones for the ephod, and the stones for setting in the breastplate. Ramban will later suggest that the reference perhaps is only to the stones for setting in the breastplate. See further, Note 76.</i> are not incised with a chisel,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the purpose of writing the names of the tribes upon the stones (further, 28:12, and 21).</i> for it is said <i>b’milu’otham</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:20.</i> (in their filling).” Now if the explanation <i>b’milu’otham</i> would be, [as Rashi has it], that they fill the indentations with the stones, there would have been no proof at all from this verse that they should not incise the names [of the tribes] on them with a chisel. Besides, the manner of the setting of the stones which the Rabbi [Rashi] mentioned, namely that it was made in a kind of indentation, is not correct. Instead, it is as Onkelos rendered it: [<i>meshubatzim zahav</i> — inclosed in gold] <i>meramtzan didhav</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:20.</i> which means that they made at the bottom a gold setting according to the measure of the stone, and from it they projected a fork-like shape of three prongs which would hold the stone. [The word <i>meramtzan</i> mentioned by Onkelos] is similar to the expressions of the Sages: “and they take it out <i>beramtza</i> (with a pointed tool) made of iron;”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Niddah 62a.</i> “as when he bored a hole in it <i>beramtza</i> (with a pick) made of iron.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Shabbath 103a.</i> This is how they also do it today when they set precious stones in rings, in order that they be seen from all angles and that their beauty and splendor should not be hidden in the indentations. You may know that this is so, for the two gold chains inserted in the two rings of the breastplate were attached to the <i>mishb’tzoth</i> on the shoulder-pieces of the <i>ephod</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:24-25.</i> Now if <i>mishb’tzoth</i> were [as Rashi said] frames for the setting of the stone, how would they attach to them the chains? And even [if there were there other <i>mishb’tzoth</i> not for the setting of the stone but for the purpose of inserting the chains] how would the indentations serve that purpose [as they were not perforated for the chains to go through]? Rather, the <i>mishb’tzoth</i> are the fork-like prongs as we have said and the holes for the chains were made in them. Associated with the word <i>mishb’tzoth</i> is, in my opinion, [Saul’s expression, <i>Slay me</i>] <i>for ‘hashabatz’ hath taken hold of me</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 1:9.</i> these being the men who hold spear-like weapons with mounted forks on top to catch those that flee the battle-field, just as it is said, <i>and lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 6.</i><br>And the meaning of <i>musaboth mishb’tzoth</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:11.</i> is that he should fix the gold prongs “around it.” And in the opinion of Onkelos who translated [<i>musaboth</i> as] <i>meshak’on</i> [literally: “depressed,” “sunk”], the stones were sunk into the frames from which came forth prongs surrounding them above and holding them in place.<br>But the sense of the word <i>milu’im</i> is that the stones be whole as they were created, and that they should not be hewn stones which were cut from a large quarry, or from which anything has been chipped off. It is also known in the natural sciences that the complete powers of precious stones and the particular qualities that distinguish them, exist only when in their natural state, as when smooth stones are taken from the river. This is why Onkelos translated [<i>avnei milu’im — avnei</i>] <i>ashlamutha</i> (stones of perfection). But the term <i>milui</i> (filling of) vessels or an indentation [Onkelos] translates literally, — thus: <i><b>'va’t'malei'</b> (and she filled) her pitcher</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 24:16.</i> Onkelos translated: <i><b>u’mleiah</b></i> (and she filled), and similarly in all other cases — but here he translated the term <i>milui</i> to mean <i>shleimuth</i> (perfection). Similarly, he translated the verse, <i>‘milei’ (He filled) them with wisdom of heart</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 35:35.</i> — <i>ashleim</i> (“He perfected” them with wisdom of heart), as wisdom is not something that you can fill a vessel with, but instead it denotes perfection, that they [i.e. Bezalel and Oholiab — who did the workmanship of the Tabernacle] were perfect in wisdom. This is the intent of the verse, <i>and in cutting of stones <b>'l’maloth'</b></i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 31:5.</i> — that they knew how to engrave like the engravings of a signet upon stones in their [natural] perfect state.<br>Now in the case of the stones of the ephod it is said, however, <i>with the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones, according to the names of the children of Israel</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 11 — in the case of the ephod.</i> [but it does not say here <i>b’milu’otham</i> — “in their perfect state”], because they made an incision in them when writing the names [of the tribes upon them] as stone engravers do, and thus the stones were no longer in their [natural] perfect state. But in the case of the stones for the breastplate it is written, <i>‘umileitha’ in it ‘miluath’ of stone</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 28:17.</i> and again it is written of them, <i>they shall be ‘b’milu’otham;’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> <i>and the stones</i> [of the breastplate] <i>were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 38:14.</i> — not the work of engravers [who make incisions upon the stones]. Therefore Moses our teacher could find no way [of inscribing the names of the tribes of Israel upon the twelve stones in the breastplate] except by means of the <i>shamir</i> [a worm that cuts stones with its glance] which our Rabbis mentioned, just as they have said in Tractate Sotah:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Sotah 48b.</i> “These stones<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. the stones of the breastplate. See above Note 61.</i> are not written upon with ink, for it is said, <i>like the engravings of a signet</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:21. “And this means carving” (Rashi, <i>ibid.</i>, Sotah). — The verse is mentioned in connection with the stones of the breastplate.</i> and they are not incised with a chisel, for it is said <i>b’milu’otham</i> (in their perfect state).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20. — Also in connection with the stones of the breastplate.</i> But instead [Moses] brought the <i>shamir</i> and showed it the stones and they split of their own accord.” Now the word <i>b’milu’otham</i> is said only in connection with the stones of the breastplate. Do not be troubled by what is mentioned in the Agadah (homily, tradition) that the Rabbis said to Solomon:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gittin 68a. In preparing to build the Sanctuary, Solomon asked the Rabbis: “How shall I accomplish the cutting of the stones without using iron tools?” They replied: “There is the <i>shamir</i> etc.”</i> “There is the <i>shamir</i> with which Moses cut the precious stones of the <i>ephod</i>.” [From this you might argue that the stones of the <i>ephod</i> also had to be <i>b’milu’otham</i> — in their perfect natural state — which would be contrary to what we have said above, that this applied only to the stones of the breastplate! Do not be troubled by this statement,] for the breastplate is called ephod by the Rabbis by way of metaphor, because the breastplate is attached thereto. It is also written, <i>Bring hither the ephod</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I Samuel 23:9.</i> and it was of the breastplate that they asked [for guidance].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">81</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ramban further, 28:30.</i> Thus the explanation of the verse before us is as follows: “<i>onyx stones</i> three — two for the ephod<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">82</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 28:9.</i> and one for the breastplate;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">83</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 20.</i> and <i>stones of ‘milu’im’</i> for the breastplate.” And in case the opinion of our Rabbis was that the stones of the ephod also had to be in their full natural state [as the stones of the breastplate], then both <i>the onyx stones and the stones of ‘milu’im’</i> were for both, <i>for the ephod and for the breastplate</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">84</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In other words, if that be the opinion of the Rabbis that the stones of the ephod also had to be <i>b’milu’otham</i> (in their full natural state), then they derived it from this verse as explained in the text. For — the ephod and the breastplate — had both the onyx stones and the stones of <i>milu’im</i>. Of the ephod it is clearly written that it had two onyx stones (further, 28:9), and according to the Rabbis these were also <i>b’milu’otham</i> (in their full natural state). In the case of the breastplate <i>b’milu’otham</i> is clearly mentioned (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 20) and so is the onyx stone (<i>ibid.</i>). Thus the verse before us, <i>stones of onyx and stones of ‘milu’im’</i> means that both were <i>for the ephod and for the breastplate</i>.</i>", "versionTitle": "Commentary on the Torah by Ramban (Nachmanides).

G<small>ENESIS HAD CONCERNED</small> itself with the beginnings of the world, of human beings and their institutions, and of the people of Israel as a tribal family. Exodus continues this thrust as it recounts the origin of the people on a religious and political level (here inseparable as concepts). A number of biblical ideas receive their fullest early treatment in this book: God’s acting directly in history; making himself “known” to both Israelites and foreigners; covenant as a reciprocal agreement between God and humans; law as an expression of total worldview; and the use of sacred structure (Tabernacle or “Dwelling”) as a vehicle for and expression of perceived truths about the world. In addition, several biblical institutions make their first appearance in Exodus: Passover, Sabbath, rudimentary leadership/government, and cult/priesthood. All this is presented in a general narrative framework, raising the question as to whether what we have here is story or history. Is Exodus a fanciful reconstruction of what happened to Moshe (Moses) and his generation, riddled with anachronisms? Or is it a faithful and reliable handing-down of eyewitness data which only the cynical or irreligious would doubt?", "For the first position there are several supports. We possess virtually no extra-biblical references to the events recorded in our book, either in Egypt or elsewhere. Then, too, there seem to be inconsistencies of time within the story (Chaps. 16 and 18 appear to presuppose laws which were given later), and patterns within the telling of the tale that are too symmetrical (the Plagues) or too stereotyped (the constant use of stylized language) to be simple reporting of fact. Finally, Exodus is lacking in the citation of personal and geographical names, especially as compared to the books that precede and follow (Genesis and Numbers).", "For the second position, that of Exodus as a reliable historical record, there exist no methods of proof other than evaluation of literary form—that is, accepting that oral literature is able to preserve facts without later coloration. But even if it could be shown that Exodus is oral literature—an evaluation which is too sweeping, given the present form of the book—modern scholarship has come to cast doubt on the absolute historical reliability of oral tradition (see Vansina).", "Despite these observations, there is still something unsettling about writing Exodus off as a work of fiction, however pious that fiction may have been. For the rest of the Hebrew Bible abounds in emotional references to the experience of the exodus. At every stage of biblical literature, that experience is invoked for the purpose of directing behavior (see especially Judg. 2, I Sam. 8, II Sam. 7, II Kings 17, Neh. 9, and Ps. 78; and most of Deuteronomy is rhetorically grounded in it). The entire structure and emotional force of biblical law rest upon such exhortations as “A sojourner you are not to oppress:/you yourselves know (well) the feelings of the sojourner,/for sojourners were you in the land of Egypt” (Ex. 23:9) and such situations as that of the Hebrew serf (Ex. 21:2ff.). Apparently the experience of the exodus period was crucial in forming the group consciousness of the Israelites, and ever since it has provided a model from which both later Judaism and Christianity were to draw frequently and profoundly.", "A hypothetical analogy, based on American history, may help to shed light on the historicity of Exodus. Imagine a book based on the following outline: first, a section on the American Revolution, with some biographical material on a few of the Founding Fathers, focusing mostly on the outbreak of the war and key battles; second, a description of the Constitutional Convention, including some of the more important speeches and discussions; third, the text of the Constitution itself; and finally, L’Enfant’s original blueprints for the building of the new capital, Washington, D.C., interspersed with accounts of the first few presidents’ inaugural addresses. What would be the underlying message of such a book? We are certainly dealing here with more than a straight journalistic description of the events, more than a legalistic discussion of constitutional law, and more than a technical presentation for architects. Such a book would actually be presenting the ideals of America’s self-image: a nation founded on the willingness to fight for particular rights against Old World tyranny, established under democratic laws based on reason and providing governmental checks and balances, and whose ideals would be embodied in the construction of a brand-new, centrally located capital city that used classically grounded forms of architecture to express grace and reason as the basis for the new society.", "Now this portrayal is very simplistic, but it gets its point across (and I would be willing to wager that, somewhere in this country, there exists a school textbook written along these lines). In a similar manner, although with much more weight given to God’s role in the process, the book of Exodus unfolds. The dramatic story of Israel’s deliverance from bondage, coupled with Moshe’s own early development, is only the first part of the book, and accounts for less than half of it. It is followed by several stories of desert wanderings, and then by a presentation of the covenant made between God and Israel at Sinai, against a stunning natural backdrop. The second half of the book enumerates a series of laws which constitute the covenant, and the details of construction of a portable sanctuary designed both to symbolize and actually to accommodate God’s presence among the Israelites (with the interruption of a major rebellion). So, like our theoretical American model, Exodus conveys far more than information about events. It is, rather, the narration of a worldview, a laying out of different types of texts bearing the <i>meaning</i> of Israel’s historical experience.", "I stress the word “experience” because that is what is at stake here. Human memory is always selective. We remember what we wish to remember, giving weight to particular emotions, sometimes over and above the facts (or, as the poet Maya Angelou puts it autobiographically, “The facts sometimes obscure the truth”). The same thing appears to be true of group memory. What a people remembers of substance is not nearly as important as how they process their experience.", "In our Exodus text one can perceive a characteristically Israelite process at work. The book emerges as a mix of historical recollection, mythical processing, and didactic retelling, what Buber and others have called a “saga.” What is preserved in the book of Exodus, therefore, is a Teaching (Heb. <i>Tora</i>) based on a set of experiences, which became history for ancient Israel. Hence, to understand better the workings of the book, we need to turn to its themes and its structure. This will be more fruitful than trying to find the exact location of the Sea of Reeds or Mount Sinai, or the “Lost Ark,” or Moshe’s burial site— of whose location “no man has knowledge until this day” (Deut. 34:6). These have all receded into archeological oblivion. What has survived of ancient Israel is its approach to history and to life, and its literature. In that sense, the book of Exodus is an attempt to distill history and to learn from it, using echoes from the past to shape the present and the future.", "When we turn to a closer consideration of the structure of Exodus, we must proceed on the assumption that a work of art stems from both artful and unconscious design. Therefore, any structuring of such a book can only be hypothetical and must not limit itself to ironclad categories.", "With that said, a number of potential divisions of our book present themselves. The first emerges from a close look at the subject matter of the text. Strikingly, Exodus appears to be arranged in groups of a few chapters each (bearing in mind that the chapter divisions are historically late), resulting in the following scheme:", "1. Prologue in Egypt (Chap. 1)<br>2. Moshe’s Early Life and Call (Chaps. 2–4)<br>3. Moshe’s Mission in Egypt (5:1–7:13)<br>4. The First Nine Plagues (7:14–10:29)<br>5. The Tenth Plague and the Exodus (Chaps. 11–13)<br>6. In the Wilderness I: The Deliverance at the Sea (14:1–15:21)<br>7. In the Wilderness II: Early Experiences (15:22–18:27)<br>8. Covenant at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20)<br>9. The Terms (Laws) and Conclusion of the Covenant (Chaps. 21–24)<br>10. Details of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–27)<br>11. Details of the Cult (Chaps. 28–31)<br>12. Rebellion and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)<br>13. The Building of the Tabernacle, Priestly Vestments (Chaps. 35–39)<br>14. Conclusion (Chap. 40)", "Such a measured shifting of focus helps to maintain the flow of the text and our interest in it.", "A glance through this list will also lead to the positing of larger structures. The traditions collected in Exodus fall naturally into both geographical and thematic divisions. The first part of the book takes place in Egypt (1:1–15:21), the second in the wilderness (15:22–40:38); this could alternatively be viewed as the events preceding Mount Sinai (Chaps. 1–17/18) and those that take place there (Chaps. 18/19–40). One could also combine the geographical and thematic aspects, resulting in the structure (1) Israel in Egypt (1:1–15:21), (2) Israel in the Wilderness (15:22–24:18), and (3) Tabernacle and Calf (Chaps. 25–40).", "My own preference for structuring Exodus also combines these aspects, as follows:", "I. The Deliverance Narrative (1:1–15:21)", "II. In the Wilderness (15:22–18:27)", "III. Covenant and Law (Chaps. 19–24)", "IV. The Blueprints for the Tabernacle and Its Service (Chaps. 25–31)", "V. Infidelity and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)", "VI. The Building of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 35–40)", "These divisions exhibit a great deal of overlapping. In Part I, Israel’s life in Egypt (Chap. 1) paves the way for Moshe’s early years (Chaps. 2–4), then the account of his mission before Pharaoh and the Plagues (Chaps. 5–13), and the final victory (Chaps. 14–15); Part II is anticipated by some of what happens after the exodus itself (Chap. 14), and leads to Sinai (Chap. 19); the covenant and laws of Part III naturally lead to other prescriptions, this time the building instructions for the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–31); planning the sacred structure in Part IV is followed by the making of a forbidden construction, the Golden Calf (Chaps. 32–33); and the reconciliation between God and Israel (Chap. 34) restores Israel’s capacity to return to the actual building of the Tabernacle, and to complete it (Chaps. 35–40). So despite the presence of what must have been several very diverse traditions behind the final text of Exodus, it has been skillfully woven together to form a coherent whole. In addition to the above structures, it can be said that the book of Exodus rests on several textual backbones, inner structures and recurring themes and motifs that help to create a unified work. These may be listed by category:", "1. There are various climaxes which serve to highlight the action—the Encounter at the Bush (Chaps. 3–4), the Tenth Plague and Exodus (12:29–42), the Deliverance at the Sea (14–15:21), the Revelation at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20), the Calf Episode (Chap. 32), and Completion of the Tabernacle (Chap. 40). Anchoring these dramatic scenes, at the center of the book, is the Sinai Revelation. The Binding of Yitzhak (Isaac) in Chapter 22 of Genesis serves much the same focusing function.", "2. There exist three strategically placed accounts of God’s Presence accompanying the Israelites (13:21–22, 24:15–18, 40:34–38) which share a common vocabulary. Key words in these passages are “day/night,” “cloud,” “fire,” “dwell,” “Glory,” “cover,” “go up,” and “in the eyes of the Children of Israel/before the people” (it should be noted that not every passage uses all of these terms). These words chart God’s movement: first, following the Exodus; second, following the concluding of the covenant; and third, following the erection of the Tabernacle, at the end of the book. A variation of these Presence accounts occurs in Numbers 9:15–23, where it rounds out the picture—for it is at this point that the Israelites finally depart from Sinai (having spent about a year there), on their journey toward the Promised Land.", "3. Several leading words recur throughout the book and give it a sense of unity:", "<i>serve</i>— The Israelites pass from “servitude” to Pharaoh into the “service” of God; laws are given that warn against “serving” other gods, that specify how a “serf” is to be treated, and that detail the “service” (i.e., construction and dismantling) of a sanctuary where God is to be properly “served.”", "<i>Glory</i>—Liberated from Pharaoh’s “stubbornness” (Heb. <i>koved lev</i>), the Israelites experience God’s “Glory” (Heb. <i>kavod</i>) at the Sea of Reeds, and encounter it again at Sinai (Chap. 24) and when the Tabernacle is completed (Chap. 40). When Israel falters in Chapter 32, Moses begs to see God’s “Glory” as a sign of reassurance. This is one of the central issues of the book, receiving its clearest formulation in Chap. 17:7—“Is Y<small>HWH</small> in our midst, or not?” Without the accompanying Presence, the Israelites can survive neither in Egypt nor in the wilderness. That the book ends with the “Glory” taking up residence in the Tabernacle is a sign that all is well in this regard.", "<i>know</i>—The Plagues and the liberation take place so that Egyptian and Israelite alike will acknowledge God as the true ruler (who “knows” the slaves’ sufferings). The book as a whole portrays a God who is “known” by his compassion toward the oppressed.", "<i>see</i>—God “sees” and rescues the people early in the book (Chap. 3); they “see” his deliverance at the sea (Chap. 14) and the awesome display at Sinai (Chaps. 19-20); the Tabernacle blueprint is given to Moshe to “see” (Chaps 25ff.).", "4. Aside from theme words, there are also several thematic threads that run through the book. These may be listed as well:", "<i>distinction</i>—The Israelites learn what it is to be separated out, first for oppression and later for God’s service. This process occurs during the Plagues and throughout the legal sections, which are often based on the making of distinctions (the Hebrew word for “holy,” <i>kadosh,</i> may originally have had this connotation). In general, Exodus is a book that abounds in polarities and distinctions: between God and Pharaoh, life and death, slavery and freedom, Egyptianness and Israeliteness, city and wilderness, visible gods/magic and an invisible God who is not conjurable, doubt and trust.", "<i>construction</i>—The Israelites are enslaved as builders of Egyptian cities; they go on to build a society, a calf-god, and a Tabernacle.", "<i>rebellion</i>—From the beginning, God and Moshe are often unheeded, as the Israelites seek to maintain or return to their status as dependent slaves in Egypt (Chaps. 2, 5, 14, 15–17, 32).", "<i>Sabbath</i>—As a newly freed people, Israel is to adapt to a rhythm of work and sacred cessation, which celebrates both creation and freedom. The Sabbath is at issue immediately after liberation (Chap. 16) and is commanded three times (Chaps. 20, 31, 35); and the account of the Tabernacle’s completion echoes the vocabulary of God’s completed creation in Genesis 2, a passage which serves as one justification for observing the Sabbath (see Ex. 20:11).", "<i>origins</i>—We are told of the beginnings of the new covenant (distinct from that concluded with Abraham), the law system, the cult/priesthood, and the sacred calendar, but with the significant omission of the monarchy.", "<i>covenant</i>—God establishes a relationship with the people of Israel: if they will obey him and observe his laws, he will protect them and treat them as his “firstborn son.” This form of covenant is different from the ones in Genesis, and plays a significant role in subsequent books of the Bible.", "<i>God in History</i>—The God of Exodus actively intervenes to rescue a people, defeating their oppressors in battle; he leads them through the wilderness, meets them, and makes a covenant with them.", "5. The above themes are specifically Israelite themes. There are, however, motifs in Exodus that have a more universal ring. One could term these anthropological, since they employ standard aspects of human experience to convey the overall messages of the book.", "<i>Fire</i> is used frequently and in varied contexts (at the Burning Bush and later back at Mount Sinai, in the desert trek, in the Tabernacle service, and at the Calf incident), usually to make a statement about God. In contrast to conventional fire gods (e.g., the Norse trickster Loki), the God of Exodus is most often associated with the more positive aspects of fire: constancy, purity, and transformation. The fire at Sinai does not destroy Moshe and the people, but rather turns them into something new. At the same time it should not be forgotten that fire is used regularly to connote anger in the Bible, especially God’s, and especially in the later wilderness narratives.", "<i>Water</i> appears throughout Exodus, not as a backdrop but as an active medium which most often signifies life and death simultaneously. The Nile, into which the enslaved Hebrews’ babies are thrown, gently bears the infant Moshe to safety: the Nile, the giver of life in Egypt, is changed into blood, itself a major signifier of life in the Bible but useless here because it is undrinkable; the Sea of Reeds acts as a passageway of birth for the Israelites but as a graveyard for their Egyptian pursuers. The availability of water becomes a central issue in the wilderness, as an instrument for survival and for the testing of the Israelites’ faith. Finally, water creates the ritual purity necessary for the people at Sinai and their priests in the Tabernacle to approach God.", "<i>Desert/Wilderness</i> is the scene of the crucial second part of the book. Only in the desert, away from the massive influence of age-old Egyptian culture, can the new Israelite society be forged. Moshe, like many other real-life and fictional heroes, demonstrates this in his own early life. The desert acts as a purifying agent for him, changing the Egyptian prince into a member of his own true people. Similarly, the Israelites begin the process of transformation from bondage to self-rule, a process which is taught in the harsh reality of desert life and which will take an entire generation to complete.", "In point of fact, all these media—fire, water, and desert—suggest change as a major concern of the book of Exodus. Our text chronicles the start of Israel’s journey as a nation, a transformative journey which takes vastly changed circumstances, a whole generation in time, and indeed several books of recounting to complete. Exodus is very concerned with topography—not for the purposes of historical recollection (as Genesis was, apparently) but as an account of an inner journey. Thus the people travel to the boundary between Egypt and the desert, through the sea, to the great fiery mountain; and we know that they cannot but be on their way to a final goal. That goal, the Promised Land, will not be realized in Exodus, because in this book we stand only at the beginning of the journey. Change does not occur quickly, and the true molding of a people, like that of an individual, requires formative experiences over time. In Exodus, then, the People of Israel begins in adolescence, as it were. It has survived infancy in Genesis, a period marked by constant threats of physical extinction, and must now begin the tortuous process of learning to cope with adulthood—that is to say, people-hood—in a hostile world.", "That process will take us past the present text. Exodus stands at the beginning of a trilogy in the middle of the Torah. It takes us from slavery up to Sinai, inaugurating the law-giving process. Leviticus will concentrate almost exclusively on laws (of “holiness”), never budging geographically, while Numbers will see the conclusion of the Sinai experience and the traveling toward (and actually reaching) the land of Israel. Exodus is thus of great importance in the overall five-book pattern, introducing key elements of the wilderness books: law, institutions, rebellion, and—Moshe himself. It serves as a bridge between the great narratives of Genesis and the priestly code of Leviticus and the wanderings of Numbers (Green­berg 1972 notes how the opening of Exodus points back, to Gen. 46; and the closing points forward, to Num. 9). It in fact contains elements of all three books.", "Exodus is the basis not only of what follows in the Torah, but also sets the stage for the rest of the Hebrew Bible. What Israel understood of its God, and what that God expects of them, are set forth most directly and unforgettably in the memories enshrined in the book of Exodus."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.
