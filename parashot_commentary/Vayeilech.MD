## Deuteronomy 31

|וַיֵּ֖לֶךְ מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַיְדַבֵּ֛ר אֶת־הַדְּבָרִ֥ים הָאֵ֖לֶּה אֶל־כׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|1|Moses went and spoke  these things to all Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Moses' attachment to prayer letters and spiritual powers transferred to Joshua, Torah study and prayer for healing and cleansing. Commentary highlights Moses' farewell to the Israelites, comforting them and passing leadership to Joshua. Halakhah explains that debts are nullified at the end of the Sabbatical year. Midrash emphasizes the transition of power from Moses to Joshua. Quoting Commentary mentions Moses writing the Law and Song, instructing priests to place the Book of the Law by the ark. Targum describes Moses addressing Israel inside the tabernacle. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֗ם בֶּן־מֵאָה֩ וְעֶשְׂרִ֨ים שָׁנָ֤ה אָנֹכִי֙ הַיּ֔וֹם לֹא־אוּכַ֥ל ע֖וֹד לָצֵ֣את וְלָב֑וֹא וַֽיהֹוָה֙ אָמַ֣ר אֵלַ֔י לֹ֥א תַעֲבֹ֖ר אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֥ן הַזֶּֽה׃|2|He said to them: I am now one hundred and twenty years old, I can no longer be active.  Moreover, יהוה has said to me, “You shall not go across yonder Jordan.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses reached a state of completion where he could not lose what he had apprehended or gain anything further, symbolized by his statement "I can no longer go out or come in." His death on the seventh of Adar marked the end of the Mannah, and despite his pleas for mercy, he resigned himself to death. When G-d rejected Moses' prayers to avoid challenges, it signified his need to consult other Torah scholars as his intellectual powers declined. Moses hands leadership to Joshua, unable to enter the Promised Land, ensuring the Torah is passed down for generations. 

|יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ ה֣וּא ׀ עֹבֵ֣ר לְפָנֶ֗יךָ הֽוּא־יַשְׁמִ֞יד אֶת־הַגּוֹיִ֥ם הָאֵ֛לֶּה מִלְּפָנֶ֖יךָ וִירִשְׁתָּ֑ם יְהוֹשֻׁ֗עַ ה֚וּא עֹבֵ֣ר לְפָנֶ֔יךָ כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהֹוָֽה׃|3|It is indeed your God יהוה who will cross over before you, and who will wipe out those nations from your path; and you shall dispossess them.—Joshua is the one who shall cross before you, as יהוה has spoken.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses reassures the people that God will lead them, emphasizing the importance of Joshua as their new leader. Midrash highlights the significance of Torah in Moses' communication with God. Ramban discusses Jacob's sacrifices and Onkelos' translations in the Torah, while Targum emphasizes God and His Shekinah going before the Israelites with Joshua. 

|וְעָשָׂ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ לָהֶ֔ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֗ה לְסִיח֥וֹן וּלְע֛וֹג מַלְכֵ֥י הָאֱמֹרִ֖י וּלְאַרְצָ֑ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר הִשְׁמִ֖יד אֹתָֽם׃|4|יהוה will do to them as was done to Sihon and Og, kings of the Amorites, and to their countries, when [God] wiped them out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Lord will destroy the nations as He did with Sihon and Og, the Emorite kings, and their land, executing judgment on them. 

|וּנְתָנָ֥ם יְהֹוָ֖ה לִפְנֵיכֶ֑ם וַעֲשִׂיתֶ֣ם לָהֶ֔ם כְּכׇ֨ל־הַמִּצְוָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּ֖יתִי אֶתְכֶֽם׃|5|יהוה will deliver them up to you, and you shall deal with them in full accordance with the Instruction that I have enjoined upon you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra, Steinsaltz, and Chizkuni all agree that the Israelites were commanded to destroy the Canaanites and not allow any to remain alive in their land. Targum emphasizes that the Lord will deliver the enemies before the Israelites, who must follow the commandments given to them. 

|חִזְק֣וּ וְאִמְצ֔וּ אַל־תִּֽירְא֥וּ וְאַל־תַּעַרְצ֖וּ מִפְּנֵיהֶ֑ם כִּ֣י ׀ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ ה֚וּא הַהֹלֵ֣ךְ עִמָּ֔ךְ לֹ֥א יַרְפְּךָ֖ וְלֹ֥א יַעַזְבֶֽךָּ׃|6|Be strong and resolute, be not in fear or in dread of them; for it is indeed your God יהוה who marches with you: [God] will not fail you or forsake you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators, including Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Haamek Davar, Siftei Chakhamim, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz, interpret Deuteronomy 31:6 as emphasizing God's presence and support in battle, providing mental fortitude, protection, and not abandoning the people. The text emphasizes relying on God rather than material possessions, strengthening character traits, and reinforcing trust in God through memory joggers and constant reminders of mitzvot. In the Midrash, the Levites serve God in battle, with the Lord going before them. Ramban and Rabbeinu Bahya offer different perspectives on why Moses feared Og, with one focusing on Og's merits and the other on his longevity. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan convey the message of God's presence and support in Deuteronomy 31:6. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֨א מֹשֶׁ֜ה לִיהוֹשֻׁ֗עַ וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֵלָ֜יו לְעֵינֵ֣י כׇל־יִשְׂרָאֵל֮ חֲזַ֣ק וֶאֱמָץ֒ כִּ֣י אַתָּ֗ה תָּבוֹא֙ אֶת־הָעָ֣ם הַזֶּ֔ה אֶל־הָאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר נִשְׁבַּ֧ע יְהֹוָ֛ה לַאֲבֹתָ֖ם לָתֵ֣ת לָהֶ֑ם וְאַתָּ֖ה תַּנְחִילֶ֥נָּה אוֹתָֽם׃|7|Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel: “Be strong and resolute, for it is you who shall go with this people into the land that יהוה swore to their fathers to give them, and it is you who shall apportion it to them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses appoints Joshua as the leader of Israel, emphasizing strength and courage, with God instructing Joshua to lead alone, highlighting the importance of assertiveness in leadership. Moses charges Joshua to be strong in Torah and good deeds, while also discussing the timing of tithing festivals. God chooses Joshua as the leader of the Israelites, giving him authority to lead and instructing him to seek guidance from the Urim through Eleazar the priest. (Numbers 27:15-23) 

|וַיהֹוָ֞ה ה֣וּא ׀ הַהֹלֵ֣ךְ לְפָנֶ֗יךָ ה֚וּא יִהְיֶ֣ה עִמָּ֔ךְ לֹ֥א יַרְפְּךָ֖ וְלֹ֣א יַעַזְבֶ֑ךָּ לֹ֥א תִירָ֖א וְלֹ֥א תֵחָֽת׃|8|And it is indeed יהוה who will go before you. [God] will be with you—and will not fail you or forsake you. Fear not and be not dismayed!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, the Ba'al Shem Tov teaches that God is always present and will never abandon or distance oneself, as seen in Deuteronomy 31:8 and emphasized in the Targum's translation. In the Commentary, Moses reassures Joshua that God will go ahead of the Israelites and be with him, giving him the strength and authority needed to lead. In the Tanakh, the priests holding the Ark allowed the people to cross the Jordan quickly after receiving God's instructions from Joshua. The Targum further emphasizes God's support and presence, encouraging Joshua to not fear or be dismayed. 

|וַיִּכְתֹּ֣ב מֹשֶׁה֮ אֶת־הַתּוֹרָ֣ה הַזֹּאת֒ וַֽיִּתְּנָ֗הּ אֶל־הַכֹּֽהֲנִים֙ בְּנֵ֣י לֵוִ֔י הַנֹּ֣שְׂאִ֔ים אֶת־אֲר֖וֹן בְּרִ֣ית יְהֹוָ֑ה וְאֶל־כׇּל־זִקְנֵ֖י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|9|Moses wrote down this Teaching and gave it to the priests, sons of Levi, who carried the Ark of יהוה’s Covenant, and to all the elders of Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses wrote the entire Torah and gave it to the priests and elders of Israel, who carried and interpreted it, with the Torah scroll passed to the king for public reading. The Mishna establishes that a priest should read first followed by a Levite during Torah readings, based on Deuteronomy 31:9. The Targum confirms that Moses gave the Torah to the kohanim and elders of Israel, emphasizing the importance of the priests and Levites in carrying out this duty. 

|וַיְצַ֥ו מֹשֶׁ֖ה אוֹתָ֣ם לֵאמֹ֑ר מִקֵּ֣ץ ׀ שֶׁ֣בַע שָׁנִ֗ים בְּמֹעֵ֛ד שְׁנַ֥ת הַשְּׁמִטָּ֖ה בְּחַ֥ג הַסֻּכּֽוֹת׃|10|And Moses instructed them as follows: Every seventh year,  the year set for remission, at the Feast of Booths,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The festival of Succot during the Shemittah year emphasizes the insignificance of man's actions compared to God's will, with the commandment to read the Torah every seven years during Sukkot reinforcing the importance of Torah study. The Israelites were instructed to set up stones inscribed with the words of the Torah upon entering the promised land, and the Jewish people are commanded to gather after every Sabbatical year to hear Torah passages. King Agrippa would read specific sections of Deuteronomy during Sukkot, causing tears to flow from his eyes. The Gemara questions the exemption of women from positive, time-bound mitzvot, and explains that the years of produce are determined by the first third of their growth based on a verse linking the Sabbatical Year with Sukkot. In Exodus, it is advised to let the land rest every seventh year, and to rest on the seventh day, allowing animals and slaves to refresh themselves. Moshe commanded the people to gather during the Shemittah year at the feast of Tabernacles. 

|בְּב֣וֹא כׇל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל לֵֽרָאוֹת֙ אֶת־פְּנֵי֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ בַּמָּק֖וֹם אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִבְחָ֑ר תִּקְרָ֞א אֶת־הַתּוֹרָ֥ה הַזֹּ֛את נֶ֥גֶד כׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בְּאׇזְנֵיהֶֽם׃|11|when all Israel comes to appear before your God יהוה in the place that [God] will choose, you shall read this Teaching aloud in the presence of all Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment for Joshua to read the Torah publicly before all of Israel was given in Deuteronomy 31:11, with specific instructions detailed in Treatise Sotah 41a. The Hak'hel ceremony cannot be fulfilled nowadays due to the Temple's ruins, and all men are obligated to appear before God on festivals except for certain exemptions. The Torah's teachings are universal and consistent for all, regardless of age or wisdom, as stated in Devarim 31:12 and 31:11. Women, the deaf, and others are exempt from specific religious obligations based on their physical or health status, as specified in Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael, Tractate Kaspa 4:8. The defeat of the Canaanite nations and the commandment for every male Israelite to write a copy of the Torah emphasize the importance of learning and internalizing its teachings, as explained by the Arizal. The reading of the king on the last day of Tabernacles, the exemption of women from the mitzva of appearance on pilgrimage festivals, and the disagreement between the Rabbis and Rebbi Yose regarding Aaron's sons' coats are all discussed in various Talmudic texts. 

|הַקְהֵ֣ל אֶת־הָעָ֗ם הָֽאֲנָשִׁ֤ים וְהַנָּשִׁים֙ וְהַטַּ֔ף וְגֵרְךָ֖ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בִּשְׁעָרֶ֑יךָ לְמַ֨עַן יִשְׁמְע֜וּ וּלְמַ֣עַן יִלְמְד֗וּ וְיָֽרְאוּ֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֔ם וְשָֽׁמְר֣וּ לַעֲשׂ֔וֹת אֶת־כׇּל־דִּבְרֵ֖י הַתּוֹרָ֥ה הַזֹּֽאת׃|12|Gather the people—men, women, children,  and the strangers in your communities—that they may hear and so learn to revere your God יהוה and to observe faithfully every word of this Teaching.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Prayer should be done in the presence of the congregation, as stated in Numbers 20:8 and Deuteronomy 31:12, emphasizing the importance of communal prayer including men, women, and children who gather to listen, learn, and observe Torah commandments. The Torah should be read before all of Israel during the Festival of Sukkot every seven years, including men, women, children, and strangers. Specific texts are read on different holidays to commemorate events and emphasize the importance of Torah study for both men and women. The importance of fearing the Lord, humility, and following the teachings of one's teachers are emphasized in Kabbalah and Jewish Thought. The Midrash highlights the significance of learning from the wise and following the decrees of the righteous. The Talmud discusses the obligation of women in assembly and the importance of learning and teaching Torah. The Hak’hel ceremony was meant to include everyone, regardless of gender, age, or social status, to ensure equal access to education and the opportunity to follow community traditions. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan stress the importance of assembling all people to hear and learn to fear God and fulfill the Torah, including men, women, infants, converts, and sojourners. Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah and Rabbi Elazar ben Hisma discuss the teachings of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah on the commandment of Hakhel, emphasizing the reward for bringing children to learn and God's love for Israel. 

|וּבְנֵיהֶ֞ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־יָדְע֗וּ יִשְׁמְעוּ֙ וְלָ֣מְד֔וּ לְיִרְאָ֖ה אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֑ם כׇּל־הַיָּמִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתֶּ֤ם חַיִּים֙ עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר אַתֶּ֜ם עֹבְרִ֧ים אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֛ן שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|13|Their children, too, who have not had the experience, shall hear and learn to revere your God יהוה as long as they live in the land that you are about to cross the Jordan to possess.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Children too young to understand the Torah are present at the assembly to instill a fear of God from an early age, rewarding those who bring them and ensuring the transmission of the Torah to the next generation. The Torah reading cycle is completed every seven years at the Hakhel gathering, where all of Israel, including men, women, and children, hear the Torah read aloud to encourage faith, reverence, Torah study, and mitzva observance. Men are obligated to perform all mitzvot of a son with regard to his father, while women are exempt, but both are obligated to perform all mitzvot of a father with regard to his son. The covenant at Sinai included all people, emphasizing universal citizenship and rights, reflected in the mitzva of Hak’hel where all members of society, including women, were assembled to renew the covenant with God. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize the importance of children learning to fear and respect God while living in the land they are inheriting. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה הֵ֣ן קָרְב֣וּ יָמֶ֘יךָ֮ לָמוּת֒ קְרָ֣א אֶת־יְהוֹשֻׁ֗עַ וְהִֽתְיַצְּב֛וּ בְּאֹ֥הֶל מוֹעֵ֖ד וַאֲצַוֶּ֑נּוּ וַיֵּ֤לֶךְ מֹשֶׁה֙ וִיהוֹשֻׁ֔עַ וַיִּֽתְיַצְּב֖וּ בְּאֹ֥הֶל מוֹעֵֽד׃|14|יהוה said to Moses: The time is drawing near for you to die. Call Joshua and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may instruct him. Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God instructs Moses to appoint Joshua as his successor, symbolizing the passing of authority in the Tent of Meeting. Moses shows love for Joshua by willingly passing on his office, highlighting the importance of avoiding envy and jealousy. The Creator determines the length of each person's life, with the fear of the Lord potentially extending it. Moses was forewarned of his death, allowing time for preparation. God holds Moses accountable for his lack of faith and acknowledgment of His power. Various commentators discuss the significance of Moses and Joshua entering the Tent of Meeting together, the power of charity in extending life, and the influence of prayer on outcomes. Rabbi Ḥanin derives the number five from a verse indicating Moses' impending death, while the Targum emphasizes the pattern of righteous figures being informed of their approaching death and appointing successors. 

|וַיֵּרָ֧א יְהֹוָ֛ה בָּאֹ֖הֶל בְּעַמּ֣וּד עָנָ֑ן וַֽיַּעֲמֹ֛ד עַמּ֥וּד הֶעָנָ֖ן עַל־פֶּ֥תַח הָאֹֽהֶל׃|15|יהוה appeared in the Tent, in a pillar of cloud, the pillar of cloud having come to rest at the entrance of the tent.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The pillar of cloud at the entrance of the Tent signified God's presence, allowing Moses to communicate with Joshua and emphasizing Joshua's lower prophetic status. The clouds of glory were associated with Aaron as the connection between God and Israel. Musar emphasizes the importance of destroying lust to prevent sinful behavior. Radak, Ramban, and Targum discuss the significance of God's presence in the cloud at the Sanctuary and the role of free choice in controlling actions. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה הִנְּךָ֥ שֹׁכֵ֖ב עִם־אֲבֹתֶ֑יךָ וְקָם֩ הָעָ֨ם הַזֶּ֜ה וְזָנָ֣ה ׀ אַחֲרֵ֣י ׀ אֱלֹהֵ֣י נֵכַר־הָאָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר ה֤וּא בָא־שָׁ֙מָּה֙ בְּקִרְבּ֔וֹ וַעֲזָבַ֕נִי וְהֵפֵר֙ אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר כָּרַ֖תִּי אִתּֽוֹ׃|16|יהוה said to Moses: You are soon to lie with your ancestors. This people will thereupon go astray after the alien gods in their midst, in the land that they are about to enter; they will forsake Me and break My covenant that I made with them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Moshe embodying the three Patriarchs in the future resurrection, emphasizing the concept of "one is maintained by three." Commentary highlights the unique and divine nature of the Land of Israel, emphasizing the importance of following God's commandments there. Halakhah emphasizes human free will in choosing to follow God's ways, despite God's decrees. Jewish Thought discusses the threat of punishment for idolatry and the importance of God's presence with the Israelites in the desert. Midrash discusses vows and dedication to the Temple, contrasting Solomon with his father David. Quoting Commentary emphasizes the holiness of the Land of Israel and the need to observe laws strictly. Talmud discusses resurrection and divine knowledge, with Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya explaining these concepts to the Romans. Targum predicts Moshe's death and the people turning to foreign idols, forsaking the covenant with God. 

|וְחָרָ֣ה אַפִּ֣י ב֣וֹ בַיּוֹם־הַ֠ה֠וּא וַעֲזַבְתִּ֞ים וְהִסְתַּרְתִּ֨י פָנַ֤י מֵהֶם֙ וְהָיָ֣ה לֶאֱכֹ֔ל וּמְצָאֻ֛הוּ רָע֥וֹת רַבּ֖וֹת וְצָר֑וֹת וְאָמַר֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֔וּא הֲלֹ֗א עַ֣ל כִּי־אֵ֤ין אֱלֹהַי֙ בְּקִרְבִּ֔י מְצָא֖וּנִי הָרָע֥וֹת הָאֵֽלֶּה׃|17|Then My anger will flare up against them, and I will abandon them and hide My countenance from them. They shall be ready prey; and many evils and troubles shall befall them. And they shall say on that day, “Surely it is because our God is not in our midst that these evils have befallen us.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses how moderation in eating affects the hiding or revealing of God's countenance, with excess leading to concealment. Halakhah states that bad events are actions by God as a result of sin, highlighting the consequences of separation from God. Jewish Thought emphasizes divine presence and protection, while Kabbalah discusses neglecting Torah study leading to spiritual consequences. Midrash warns against the dangers of idol worship and adultery, and Musar stresses the importance of recognizing sins and repenting to avoid harsher punishment. Talmud mentions God hiding His face from the Jewish people due to their sins, while Targum describes the consequences of God forsaking and hiding His presence from the people. 

|וְאָנֹכִ֗י הַסְתֵּ֨ר אַסְתִּ֤יר פָּנַי֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֔וּא עַ֥ל כׇּל־הָרָעָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה כִּ֣י פָנָ֔ה אֶל־אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֲחֵרִֽים׃|18|Yet I will keep My countenance hidden on that day, because of all the evil they have done in turning to other gods.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the contrast between the redemptions of Egypt and Purim, highlighting the hiddenness of the Purim miracle and the importance of recognizing spiritual illness for healing. Various commentaries explore God hiding His face as a response to idol worship and the Israelites' actions, with implications for the length of exile. The Purim story reflects a time of Divine Presence concealment during exile, with the erasure of Amalek linked to the number of words in the Torah and verses in the Scroll of Esther. The Midrash discusses trouble in various historical periods, attributing calamities to leaders' actions, and the Talmud finds allusions to Esther and Mordecai in specific Torah verses. Additionally, both Targums explain divine withdrawal as punishment for Israel's sins. 

|וְעַתָּ֗ה כִּתְב֤וּ לָכֶם֙ אֶת־הַשִּׁירָ֣ה הַזֹּ֔את וְלַמְּדָ֥הּ אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל שִׂימָ֣הּ בְּפִיהֶ֑ם לְמַ֨עַן תִּֽהְיֶה־לִּ֜י הַשִּׁירָ֥ה הַזֹּ֛את לְעֵ֖ד בִּבְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|19|Therefore, write down this poem and teach it to the people of Israel; put it in their mouths, in order that this poem may be My witness against the people of Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses and Joshua wrote the song of Haazinu for the Israelites to recite with song and psalm, with Moses ensuring the proper writing, teaching, and recitation of the condensed poetic description of Israel's history. The Torah commands Jewish men to write a Torah scroll for themselves, with Torah study essential for all, and the Gemara providing clarity on laws and mitzvot. Joining a community and living according to the lessons of Sinai is crucial for sanctifying the Divine name, with Torah interpretations valued more than the original text. In the days of Moses, Torah was learned through repetition, with the Sages' words considered as important as the Torah itself. The phrase "b'etzem" emphasizes the significance of specific days and observances, and Moses writing a song is interpreted as a command to write a Sefer Torah. Rosh ruled that every man in Israel should write a copy of the Pentateuch, Mishnah, Gemara, and Rashi's commentary, in addition to a Sefer Torah, with achronim debating whether the commandment to write a Torah Scroll still applies. Rabbi Akiva teaches the obligation to teach Torah, the Gemara discusses Moses' command to teach the Torah or just the song of Ha’azinu, and both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain that the song serves as a witness against the Israelites. 

|כִּֽי־אֲבִיאֶ֜נּוּ אֶֽל־הָאֲדָמָ֣ה ׀ אֲשֶׁר־נִשְׁבַּ֣עְתִּי לַאֲבֹתָ֗יו זָבַ֤ת חָלָב֙ וּדְבַ֔שׁ וְאָכַ֥ל וְשָׂבַ֖ע וְדָשֵׁ֑ן וּפָנָ֞ה אֶל־אֱלֹהִ֤ים אֲחֵרִים֙ וַעֲבָד֔וּם וְנִ֣אֲצ֔וּנִי וְהֵפֵ֖ר אֶת־בְּרִיתִֽי׃|20|When I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey that I promised on oath to their fathers, and they eat their fill and grow fat and turn to other gods and serve them, spurning Me and breaking My covenant,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how the Israelites will turn to idolatry, primarily serving Baalim, leading to God's anger, but the Torah and song will guide them back to their duties and eventual spiritual resurrection. Satiety can lead to rebellion against God, as shown in Biblical examples. Rashi explains that God will accept prayers willingly like a fat burnt offering. The Book of Jubilees warns of the rebellious nature of the people before entering the promised land. The Talmud discusses laws regarding sancta during travel and tending the altar fire, while Rav Aḥa emphasizes the sin of filling one's stomach. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that the Israelites will turn to idolatry after becoming satisfied and prosperous in the land of milk and honey. 

|וְ֠הָיָ֠ה כִּֽי־תִמְצֶ֨אןָ אֹת֜וֹ רָע֣וֹת רַבּוֹת֮ וְצָרוֹת֒ וְ֠עָנְתָ֠ה הַשִּׁירָ֨ה הַזֹּ֤את לְפָנָיו֙ לְעֵ֔ד כִּ֛י לֹ֥א תִשָּׁכַ֖ח מִפִּ֣י זַרְע֑וֹ כִּ֧י יָדַ֣עְתִּי אֶת־יִצְר֗וֹ אֲשֶׁ֨ר ה֤וּא עֹשֶׂה֙ הַיּ֔וֹם בְּטֶ֣רֶם אֲבִיאֶ֔נּוּ אֶל־הָאָ֖רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּֽעְתִּי׃|21|and the many evils and troubles befall them—then this poem shall confront them as a witness, since it will never be lost from the mouth of their offspring. For I know what plans they are devising even now, before I bring them into the land that I promised on oath.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai's assurance that the Torah will not be forgotten by the Jewish people, connected to the Zohar's promise of redemption. Halakhah stresses the importance of charity and lending to the poor, while Jewish Thought highlights the need for fear of God and seeking divine assistance for understanding. Midrash discusses the incompleteness of joy in the Creation story, Musar links Torah to the crown of Israel and the final redemption, and Quoting Commentary explores various interpretations of promises and metaphors in Torah texts. Talmud mentions Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai's belief in the preservation of the Torah, criticism of Aḥaz for neglecting education, and concerns about troubles faced by the Jewish people. Tanakh notes God's promise to never again destroy the earth due to human evil, and Targum discusses a song as a testimony to the Israelites' actions. 

|וַיִּכְתֹּ֥ב מֹשֶׁ֛ה אֶת־הַשִּׁירָ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֑וּא וַֽיְלַמְּדָ֖הּ אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|22|That day, Moses wrote down this poem and taught it to the Israelites.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses wrote a song in Deuteronomy to attract worthy gentiles to convert to Judaism, emphasizing the importance of helping these "sparks" of holy spirits among them. The song was written on the day of Moses' death, with Joshua present, highlighting the importance of Torah knowledge and fidelity to God's law. The final exile will lead to increased Torah study among the Jewish people. Moses chanted the song opposite all of Israel, with ten songs mentioned in the text. Ramban explains that both Moses and Joshua were commanded to write the Song of Ha’azinu, with Moses being the principal writer and teacher of the song. Moshe wrote a song of praise on that day and taught it to the children of Israel. 

|וַיְצַ֞ו אֶת־יְהוֹשֻׁ֣עַ בִּן־נ֗וּן וַיֹּ֘אמֶר֮ חֲזַ֣ק וֶאֱמָץ֒ כִּ֣י אַתָּ֗ה תָּבִיא֙ אֶת־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֶל־הָאָ֖רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־נִשְׁבַּ֣עְתִּי לָהֶ֑ם וְאָנֹכִ֖י אֶהְיֶ֥ה עִמָּֽךְ׃|23|And [God] charged Joshua son of Nun: “Be strong and resolute: for you shall bring the Israelites into the land that I promised them on oath, and I will be with you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God commanded Joshua to lead the Israelites into the promised land, emphasizing His presence with Joshua. Joshua was instructed to be strong and courageous in the context of war, to consider the elders' opinion, resist idolatrous practices, and lead the people into the land even against their will. Rabbi Yoḥanan explained that God established Joshua as the sole leader, emphasizing the need for a single leader for each generation. Joshua is reminded to be strong and resolute in apportioning the land promised to the people by their fathers, with God promising to be with him wherever he goes. 

|וַיְהִ֣י ׀ כְּכַלּ֣וֹת מֹשֶׁ֗ה לִכְתֹּ֛ב אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֥י הַתּוֹרָֽה־הַזֹּ֖את עַל־סֵ֑פֶר עַ֖ד תֻּמָּֽם׃|24|When Moses had put down in writing the words of this Teaching to the very end,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses wrote the Law and Song, commanded the priests to place the complete book by the side of the ark of the covenant, ensuring no additions or subtractions. The Torah scroll was placed inside the Holy Ark next to the Ten Commandments, with the Song serving as a witness. The Israelites sang ten songs in gratitude for ten miracles, including those in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and at the well. All 613 commandments are contained within the Ten Commandments, as the Torah scroll was written by Moshe and not Hashem. Moses finished writing the Torah in a book, completing the words of the law on parchment until they were finished. 

|וַיְצַ֤ו מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶת־הַלְוִיִּ֔ם נֹ֥שְׂאֵ֛י אֲר֥וֹן בְּרִית־יְהֹוָ֖ה לֵאמֹֽר׃|25|Moses charged the Levites who carried the Ark of the Covenant of יהוה, saying:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses commanded the Levites, specifically the kohanim, who were the bearers of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, not addressing the entire tribe of Levites who were prohibited from touching the ark. He also addressed the tribes of Gad and Reuven using the pronoun "you" instead of "them" to imply that his commandment applies to all the tribes, similar to how he addresses the Levites but speaks to the whole people. Ibn Ezra explains that this is because the tribes of Gad and Reuven are included among all of Israel, just as the Levites are. The Targum states that Moses commanded the Levites who were carrying the ark of Adonoy's covenant. 

|לָקֹ֗חַ אֵ֣ת סֵ֤פֶר הַתּוֹרָה֙ הַזֶּ֔ה וְשַׂמְתֶּ֣ם אֹת֔וֹ מִצַּ֛ד אֲר֥וֹן בְּרִית־יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֑ם וְהָיָה־שָׁ֥ם בְּךָ֖ לְעֵֽד׃|26|Take this book of Teaching and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of your God יהוה, and let it remain there as a witness against you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Different opinions exist regarding the exact placement of the Torah scroll, with some suggesting it was inside the Ark and others proposing it was next to it, while a Midrash recounts how Moses personally wrote multiple Torah scrolls for each tribe before depositing one in the Ark. Halakhah emphasizes respectful behavior towards a Torah scroll, including not spitting, undressing, or scuffing one's feet in front of it, and sitting before it with the proper mindset, awe, and fear. The Rabbi explains that the Jewish people are like scattered limbs with a trace of vital power, better than lifeless bodies made of marble and plaster, with the root of all knowledge represented by the Ark and its contents. The Talmud presents different opinions on how the Torah was given and where the Torah scroll was placed near the Ark of the Covenant, with Rabbi Shimon arguing that the Torah was complete as is and dictated by God to Moses. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan discuss the placement of the Torah scroll as a witness against the people. 

|כִּ֣י אָנֹכִ֤י יָדַ֙עְתִּי֙ אֶֽת־מֶרְיְךָ֔ וְאֶֽת־עׇרְפְּךָ֖ הַקָּשֶׁ֑ה הֵ֣ן בְּעוֹדֶ֩נִּי֩ חַ֨י עִמָּכֶ֜ם הַיּ֗וֹם מַמְרִ֤ים הֱיִתֶם֙ עִם־יְהֹוָ֔ה וְאַ֖ף כִּי־אַחֲרֵ֥י מוֹתִֽי׃|27|Well I know how defiant and stiffnecked you are: even now, while I am still alive in your midst, you have been defiant toward יהוה; how much more, then, when I am dead!|

Chasidut: Moshe's prayer to enter the land of Israel elevated the prayers of the Children of Israel, serving as a fix for ineffective prayers and benefiting the people, even though it was not answered positively. 

Commentary: Ibn Ezra, Or HaChaim, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz provide interpretations of Moses' words in Deuteronomy, highlighting the ongoing struggle of the Israelites to maintain their connection with God and warning of future challenges to their faith.

Halakhah: Admonishment is crucial for repentance, and congregations are advised to appoint a respected sage to motivate the community towards Teshuvah. Five deeds can lock the paths of Teshuvah, including separating from the community and hating admonishment.

Midrash: Rabbi Yoḥanan lists ten deaths decreed for Moses, who prayed 515 times to enter the Land of Israel, engaging in a fierce struggle with the angel of death. The text also discusses the destruction of the Temple and presents a series of a fortiori inferences from biblical verses.

Quoting Commentary: Various interpretations of biblical verses in Exodus, Devarim, and Psalms are discussed, highlighting Moses' warnings to the Israelites about past mistakes and future corruption, as well as his criticism and doubts about their future.

Targum: The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 31:27 emphasize the rebelliousness and stubbornness of the people towards God, with different versions mentioning defiers, obduracy, and worsening behavior after Moses' death. 

|הַקְהִ֧ילוּ אֵלַ֛י אֶת־כׇּל־זִקְנֵ֥י שִׁבְטֵיכֶ֖ם וְשֹׁטְרֵיכֶ֑ם וַאֲדַבְּרָ֣ה בְאׇזְנֵיהֶ֗ם אֵ֚ת הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה וְאָעִ֣ידָה בָּ֔ם אֶת־הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֶת־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|28|Gather to me all the elders of your tribes and your officials, that I may speak all these words to them and that I may call heaven and earth to witness against them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes Bnei Yisrael's testimony to Hashem's power in creation and their role as protectors aligned with Shabbos. Moses did not use the trumpets on the day of his death, appointing Heaven and Earth as witnesses against the Israelites. Scribes follow traditional practices in Torah scroll layout not explicitly mentioned in the Talmud. Midrash texts discuss individual responsibility, repentance, and lack of control over death, while Rabbeinu Bahya and other commentaries interpret symbols like the Tablets of Testimony and trumpets made by Moses. Targum texts mention gathering judges and officers with heaven and earth as witnesses in Deuteronomy 31:28. 

|כִּ֣י יָדַ֗עְתִּי אַחֲרֵ֤י מוֹתִי֙ כִּֽי־הַשְׁחֵ֣ת תַּשְׁחִת֔וּן וְסַרְתֶּ֣ם מִן־הַדֶּ֔רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּ֖יתִי אֶתְכֶ֑ם וְקָרָ֨את אֶתְכֶ֤ם הָרָעָה֙ בְּאַחֲרִ֣ית הַיָּמִ֔ים כִּֽי־תַעֲשׂ֤וּ אֶת־הָרַע֙ בְּעֵינֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֔ה לְהַכְעִיס֖וֹ בְּמַעֲשֵׂ֥ה יְדֵיכֶֽם׃|29|For I know that, when I am dead, you will act wickedly and turn away from the path that I enjoined upon you, and that in time to come misfortune will befall you for having done evil in the sight of יהוה, whom you vexed by your deeds.|

In Chasidut, evil individuals receive nurture and vitality from the sitra achara. Moses warned the Israelites of future corruption, particularly idolatry, to prevent them from straying. Halakhah details traditions for scribes writing Torah scrolls. Jewish Thought discusses reversibility of natural phenomena by God's will and Moses' unique relationship with God. Midrash reflects on corruption, idolatry, and Moses' inability to enter the Land of Israel. Quoting Commentary includes interpretations from Sforno, Radak, Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Hasagot HaRa'avad, and Or HaChaim. Tanakh mentions Israel serving God during Joshua's time, while Targum predicts Israel's corruption after Moses' death. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֣ר מֹשֶׁ֗ה בְּאׇזְנֵי֙ כׇּל־קְהַ֣ל יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֥י הַשִּׁירָ֖ה הַזֹּ֑את עַ֖ד תֻּמָּֽם׃|30|Then Moses recited the words of this poem to the very end, in the hearing of the whole congregation of Israel: |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses recited a song/poem to the Israelites, known as Haazinu, which conveyed past, present, and future events with a focus on redemption from exile. He also set up family teaching and public reading of the Instruction every seven years, symbolizing a new stage in Israel's history (Deuteronomy 31:1-30; Covenant and Conversation). The book of Devarim contains speeches where Moses taught the law and history to the Israelites before his death, ensuring they understood before entering the land of Israel (Covenant and Conversation Family Edition, V'Zot HaBerachah, I). Moses spoke the words of the song to the entire assembly of Israel until they were finished (Onkelos Deuteronomy 31:30, Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 31:30).
