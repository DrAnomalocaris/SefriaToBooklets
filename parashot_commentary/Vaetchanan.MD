|אֲדֹנָ֣י יֱהֹוִ֗ה אַתָּ֤ה הַֽחִלּ֙וֹתָ֙ לְהַרְא֣וֹת אֶֽת־עַבְדְּךָ֔ אֶ֨ת־גׇּדְלְךָ֔ וְאֶת־יָדְךָ֖ הַחֲזָקָ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֤ר מִי־אֵל֙ בַּשָּׁמַ֣יִם וּבָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂ֥ה כְמַעֲשֶׂ֖יךָ וְכִגְבוּרֹתֶֽךָ׃|24|“O Lord יהוה, You who let Your servant see the first works of Your greatness and Your mighty hand, You whose powerful deeds no god in heaven or on earth can equal!|

|אֶעְבְּרָה־נָּ֗א וְאֶרְאֶה֙ אֶת־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַטּוֹבָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֖ר בְּעֵ֣בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּ֑ן הָהָ֥ר הַטּ֛וֹב הַזֶּ֖ה וְהַלְּבָנֹֽן׃|25|Let me, I pray, cross over and see the good land on the other side of the Jordan, that good hill country, and the Lebanon.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the significance of G'd's names in relation to the Jewish people's journey to the Holy Land and the need to fulfill commandments there, while Likutei Halakhot and Likutei Moharan focus on refining good points through communal prayer and connecting the unlearned to daat. The commentary emphasizes Moses' desire to see the Promised Land and fulfill commandments there, highlighting the importance of prayer and spiritual duties.

Lastly, Tosefta states that the Beracha of Zimun is a Torah obligation, corresponding to the first four Berachot of Birkat Hamazon. 

|וַיִּתְעַבֵּ֨ר יְהֹוָ֥ה בִּי֙ לְמַ֣עַנְכֶ֔ם וְלֹ֥א שָׁמַ֖ע אֵלָ֑י וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֤ה אֵלַי֙ רַב־לָ֔ךְ אַל־תּ֗וֹסֶף דַּבֵּ֥ר אֵלַ֛י ע֖וֹד בַּדָּבָ֥ר הַזֶּֽה׃|26|But יהוה was wrathful with me on your account and would not listen to me. יהוה said to me, “Enough! Never speak to Me of this matter again!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that God's anger towards Moses was due to the actions of the Israelites, leading to the decree that Moses would not enter the Promised Land. Despite his good deeds, Moses' request was only granted through prayer, exemplifying the importance of prayer over good deeds alone. Moses desired to enter the holiest part of the land of Israel to be closest to the holiest part of the celestial land, but God denied his request to prevent the people from being raised spiritually to his level. Ultimately, Moses accepts his fate and dies on the border before the Israelites enter the land, leaving readers in awe of God's mercy and rejection of complaints. 

|עֲלֵ֣ה ׀ רֹ֣אשׁ הַפִּסְגָּ֗ה וְשָׂ֥א עֵינֶ֛יךָ יָ֧מָּה וְצָפֹ֛נָה וְתֵימָ֥נָה וּמִזְרָ֖חָה וּרְאֵ֣ה בְעֵינֶ֑יךָ כִּי־לֹ֥א תַעֲבֹ֖ר אֶת־הַיַּרְדֵּ֥ן הַזֶּֽה׃|27|Go up to the summit of Pisgah and gaze about, to the west, the north, the south, and the east. Look at it well, for you shall not go across yonder Jordan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses is granted the ability to see the land of Israel from the top of Pisgah, but is not allowed to enter it due to his disowning of his land as an Egyptian. The Mishnah prohibits renting a house to a gentile for residence or a bathhouse to avoid idol worship or violating Shabbat. Moses' inability to enter the land despite intense prayers is attributed to a change in fate and a decree from God. Humility is emphasized as essential for survival, contrasting with arrogant leaders of other nations. Rabbi Elazar argues that prayer is greater than good deeds without prayer, exemplified by Moses' ability to see Eretz Yisrael through prayer. Targum texts emphasize Moses' ability to see the land with his own eyes from Pisgah. 

|וְצַ֥ו אֶת־יְהוֹשֻׁ֖עַ וְחַזְּקֵ֣הוּ וְאַמְּצֵ֑הוּ כִּי־ה֣וּא יַעֲבֹ֗ר לִפְנֵי֙ הָעָ֣ם הַזֶּ֔ה וְהוּא֙ יַנְחִ֣יל אוֹתָ֔ם אֶת־הָאָ֖רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר תִּרְאֶֽה׃|28|Give Joshua his instructions, and imbue him with strength and courage, for he shall go across at the head of this people, and he shall allot to them the land that you may only see.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses instructs Joshua to lead the people into the promised land, ensuring his authority and encouragement, as seen in the defeat at Ai. The passing of leadership is crucial for the success of the Israelites, as indicated in various instances throughout the Torah. Moses expresses disappointment in not crossing over with the Israelites, beseeching God to rescind the decree but being commanded to charge Joshua instead. The term "command" indicates immediate and future performance, galvanizing the Israelites for success. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize the importance of Moses instructing and encouraging Joshua to lead the people into the promised land and apportion the land to the Israelites. 

|וַנֵּ֣שֶׁב בַּגָּ֔יְא מ֖וּל בֵּ֥ית פְּעֽוֹר׃|29|Meanwhile we stayed on in the valley near Beth-peor.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

On Shabbat, refraining from routine ways allows for repentance and acceptance from God, symbolized by attaining Keter and God's outstretched right hand for repentance. Moses reminds Israelites of their idol worship near Beth Peor, emphasizing the need to heed God's statutes for forgiveness. Despite sins like idolatry at Peor, God's love for the Jewish people remains steadfast, highlighting the importance of following God's statutes. Moses reflects on his own sins and supplications not being forgiven, contrasting with Israel's sins being forgiven upon repentance. The Israelites' sins at Peor led to a plague, with Phinehas stopping it by taking action against idol worshipers. The Targum translations mention dwelling in the valley and weeping for sins, specifically mentioning joining worshippers of Peor.

Various commentators discuss the number of judges involved in the Baal-peor incident, with Ramban questioning the high number given in the Jerusalem Talmud. Or HaChaim suggests that the plague was a punishment for the sin of Baal-peor, leading to the death of those actively involved. In Numbers 25, the Israelites sin by engaging in idolatry and sexual immorality with Moabite women, resulting in God's anger and Phinehas stopping a plague by killing an Israelite man and a Midianite woman. The Targum emphasizes God's destruction of those who worshipped Baal Peor from within the community of Israel.

Tanakh mentions Cain settling in the land of Nod and the designation of six cities of refuge. Targum references Moshe designating three cities east of the Jordan River as places of refuge. 

|לָנֻ֨ס שָׁ֜מָּה רוֹצֵ֗חַ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִרְצַ֤ח אֶת־רֵעֵ֙הוּ֙ בִּבְלִי־דַ֔עַת וְה֛וּא לֹא־שֹׂנֵ֥א ל֖וֹ מִתְּמֹ֣ל שִׁלְשֹׁ֑ם וְנָ֗ס אֶל־אַחַ֛ת מִן־הֶעָרִ֥ים הָאֵ֖ל וָחָֽי׃|42|to which [a man]  who has killed someone  could escape, one who unwittingly slew another without having been an enemy in the past; he could flee to one of these cities and live:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Deuteronomy 4:42, cities of refuge are designated for unintentional murderers who do not hate their victim, with specific laws regarding who is exiled for killing whom, the actions of killers in the city of refuge, and the temporary shelter provided by the altar. Rashbam explains the different terms for killing in the Torah, emphasizing the distinction between deliberate murder and other types of killing. The Gemara discusses various scenarios related to unintentional murder, including the treatment of a slave in a city of refuge and the relationship between Torah scholars. In Tanakh, the establishment of cities of refuge and the consequences for intentional murder are detailed, with ransom not accepted for murderers. Targum translations also mention the provision for murderers to flee to specific cities for refuge. 

|אֶת־בֶּ֧צֶר בַּמִּדְבָּ֛ר בְּאֶ֥רֶץ הַמִּישֹׁ֖ר לָרֽאוּבֵנִ֑י וְאֶת־רָאמֹ֤ת בַּגִּלְעָד֙ לַגָּדִ֔י וְאֶת־גּוֹלָ֥ן בַּבָּשָׁ֖ן לַֽמְנַשִּֽׁי׃|43|Bezer, in the wilderness in the Tableland, belonging to the Reubenites; Ramoth, in Gilead, belonging to the Gadites; and Golan, in Bashan, belonging to the Manassites.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The cities of refuge were designated in specific locations for different tribes, with Bezer in the desert assigned to Reuven, Ramot in Gilad for the Gadites, and Golan in the Bashan for the Manassites, providing protection for unintentional human killers only. Moses and Joshua each designated three cities of refuge on opposite sides of the Jordan River, corresponding to the number of murderers in those areas, with the concept of exile and redemption tied to the idea of cities of refuge. The section of Deuteronomy serves as an introduction to the book, warning the new generation about the failings of their predecessors and setting the stage for the Deuteronomistic History that follows. Rabbi Yoḥanan states that a teacher of Torah who is exiled has his school exiled with him, aligning the status of Torah with that of a city of refuge, clarifying the distinctions between Bezer and Bozrah. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan list the cities of Betzer, Romos, and Golon as designated for the tribes of Reuven, Gadd, and Menasheh respectively. 

|וְזֹ֖את הַתּוֹרָ֑ה אֲשֶׁר־שָׂ֣ם מֹשֶׁ֔ה לִפְנֵ֖י בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|44|This is the Teaching that Moses set before the Israelites:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the sanctity differences between Prophets and Writings, with Zohar distinguishing between prophecy and ruach hakodesh. The Torah in Deuteronomy 4:44 is emphasized as a city of refuge, providing protection even to intentional wrongdoers. Kabbalah symbolizes the Torah with Tiferet, Nezaḥ, and Hod, and Liturgy highlights Adonoy's desire to make the Torah great. Midrash emphasizes the Torah's enduring nature, protection, and importance in the face of adversity. Musar discusses revealing new Torah insights and Gentiles claiming reward based on contributions to civilization, but being rejected by G-d. Quoting Commentary explains the curses for denying or rebelling against the Torah, and Talmud discusses the Torah as a potion of life or death, like a city of refuge, and emphasizes the importance of Torah study for reward. Targum mentions Moshe setting the Torah before the sons of Israel. 

|אֵ֚לֶּה הָֽעֵדֹ֔ת וְהַֽחֻקִּ֖ים וְהַמִּשְׁפָּטִ֑ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבֶּ֤ר מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּצֵאתָ֖ם מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃|45|these are the decrees, laws, and rules that Moses addressed to the people of Israel, after they had left Egypt,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses spoke testimonies to the Israelites when they left Egypt and reiterated them in the plains of Moab, with practical aspects of the Torah outlined in subsequent verses. The Tabernacle is considered a testimony to God, with disparaging the Torah seen as equivalent to disparaging God. The word "testimonies" can also mean "encounter" in this context, with the Tabernacle symbolizing the Torah and serving as a protection akin to a king safeguarding his daughter. The appearance of "משכן" twice in the text hints at the future existence of two permanent Temples, with numerical values indicating the years each Temple stood. 

|בְּעֵ֨בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּ֜ן בַּגַּ֗יְא מ֚וּל בֵּ֣ית פְּע֔וֹר בְּאֶ֗רֶץ סִיחֹן֙ מֶ֣לֶךְ הָֽאֱמֹרִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּחֶשְׁבּ֑וֹן אֲשֶׁ֨ר הִכָּ֤ה מֹשֶׁה֙ וּבְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּצֵאתָ֖ם מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃|46|beyond the Jordan, in the valley at Beth-peor, in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, whom Moses and the Israelites defeated after they had left Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Mount Abarim is in a different district from the plains of Moab, emphasizing the defeat of two kings during the Israelites' journey from Egypt, with the intention to defeat them since the Exodus. The mention of the Israelites inheriting these lands in the next verse confirms this interpretation. The names in Deuteronomy 1:1 are locations where parts of the Torah were revealed, "These are the words" refers to the commandments Moses will mention, and "in the desert, the Aravah" indicates Moses had already spoken to the Israelites about upcoming topics. Moshe led the Israelites to defeat King Sichon of the Emorites in the land of Cheshbon after crossing the Jordan River from Egypt. 

|וַיִּֽירְשׁ֨וּ אֶת־אַרְצ֜וֹ וְאֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ ׀ ע֣וֹג מֶֽלֶךְ־הַבָּשָׁ֗ן שְׁנֵי֙ מַלְכֵ֣י הָֽאֱמֹרִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֖ר בְּעֵ֣בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּ֑ן מִזְרַ֖ח שָֽׁמֶשׁ׃|47|They had taken possession of his country and that of King Og of Bashan—the two kings of the Amorites—which were on the east side of the Jordan|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses emphasized the importance of remaining loyal to God in the new territories after conquering Sihon and Og's lands, which were east of the Jordan River. The Torah passage in Va-es’hanan detailed laws, testimonies, and rules presented to the Israelites after their victory over Sichon, king of the Amorites, in Heshbon. The Israelites inherited the lands of Og, King of the Boshon, and Og, King of Mathnan, two Emorite kings located east of the Jordan River. 

|מֵעֲרֹעֵ֞ר אֲשֶׁ֨ר עַל־שְׂפַת־נַ֧חַל אַרְנֹ֛ן וְעַד־הַ֥ר שִׂיאֹ֖ן ה֥וּא חֶרְמֽוֹן׃|48|from Aroer on the banks of the wadi Arnon, as far as Mount Sion,  that is, Hermon;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The conquests of Israel on the eastern side of the Jordan River extended from Aroer on the Arnon Ravine to Mount Hermon, also known as Sirion and Senir, with different nations assigning different names to the mountain. The city of Dvir had four names, symbolizing the contention over it by four kings and highlighting the significance of Eretz Yisrael. The Targumim describe the geographical boundaries from Aroer to Mount Sion, emphasizing the importance of these locations in the land of Israel. 

|וְכׇל־הָ֨עֲרָבָ֜ה עֵ֤בֶר הַיַּרְדֵּן֙ מִזְרָ֔חָה וְעַ֖ד יָ֣ם הָעֲרָבָ֑ה תַּ֖חַת אַשְׁדֹּ֥ת הַפִּסְגָּֽה׃|49|also the whole Arabah on the east side of the Jordan, as far as the Sea of the Arabah, at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse in Deuteronomy 4:49 describes the land given to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh, including the Arava desert east of the Jordan River and the Dead Sea up to Mount Hermon. Rashbam clarifies that the Sea of Reeds borders the Philistines and the Dead Sea, facing the Aravah of Moav. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both describe the Arava region extending from the Jordan River to the east, with Onkelos mentioning Arava Lake and the Pisgah slopes, while Targum Jonathan refers to a sea in the plain under the spring of the heights.

## Deuteronomy 5

|וַיִּקְרָ֣א מֹשֶׁה֮ אֶל־כׇּל־יִשְׂרָאֵל֒ וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֗ם שְׁמַ֤ע יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֶת־הַחֻקִּ֣ים וְאֶת־הַמִּשְׁפָּטִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י דֹּבֵ֥ר בְּאׇזְנֵיכֶ֖ם הַיּ֑וֹם וּלְמַדְתֶּ֣ם אֹתָ֔ם וּשְׁמַרְתֶּ֖ם לַעֲשֹׂתָֽם׃|1|Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the laws and rules that I proclaim to you this day! Study them and observe them faithfully!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses gathered all of Israel to review the Ten Commandments and ensure understanding of the laws for future generations, emphasizing Torah study as a foundational aspect of Jewish life and a mitzvah for all men. The importance of love, good deeds, and Torah study is stressed in Jewish thought, while the Midrash discusses adherence to commandments and the appointment of judges for justice in Jerusalem. Engaging in performing mitzvot is considered Torah study in the Talmud, and Targum emphasizes the importance of studying and fulfilling the statutes and laws. 

|יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֗ינוּ כָּרַ֥ת עִמָּ֛נוּ בְּרִ֖ית בְּחֹרֵֽב׃|2|Our God יהוה made a covenant with us at Horeb.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The covenant made at Horeb (Sinai) between God and the Israelites establishes an exclusive relationship, with judges and law officers enforcing justice, passing down secret knowledge through generations, culminating in Abraham's circumcision. This covenant includes both Moses and Israel, with Moses singled out due to God's favor, leading to specific wording in Exodus 34:27. The covenant with Abraham and his descendants requires male circumcision (Genesis 17:10). The Targum confirms the covenant at Mount Horeb (Deuteronomy 5:2). 

|לֹ֣א אֶת־אֲבֹתֵ֔ינוּ כָּרַ֥ת יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶת־הַבְּרִ֣ית הַזֹּ֑את כִּ֣י אִתָּ֔נוּ אֲנַ֨חְנוּ אֵ֥לֶּה פֹ֛ה הַיּ֖וֹם כֻּלָּ֥נוּ חַיִּֽים׃|3|It was not with our ancestors that יהוה made this covenant, but with us, the living, every one of us who is here today.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God desires that the request to serve Him should be among the living, with departed tzaddikim found more in all worlds after death. The covenant was not only with the fathers but also with the current generation, extending to those alive at the time and future generations. The revelation at Mount Sinai, not miracles, is the true proof of Moses' prophecy. The Midrash discusses infants as guarantors for the Torah, emphasizing the importance of upholding it to avoid accountability and destruction. Adonoy made the covenant with all who are alive today. 

|פָּנִ֣ים ׀ בְּפָנִ֗ים דִּבֶּ֨ר יְהֹוָ֧ה עִמָּכֶ֛ם בָּהָ֖ר מִתּ֥וֹךְ הָאֵֽשׁ׃|4|Face to face יהוה spoke to you on the mountain out of the fire—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Avram's faith and unique status as a Jewish convert, the 33rd day of the Omer representing a longing for Torah, and Hashem's favoritism towards Bnei Yisrael. Halakhah emphasizes belief in Moses through the revelation at Mount Sinai. Jewish Thought explores the concept of direct communication with God, and Midrash delves into various teachings on angels at Sinai and the arrangement of tribes around the Tabernacle. Musar highlights sanctification, repentance, and the intimate relationship between the Jewish people and God. Quoting Commentary underscores the personal and direct communication between Hashem and the Jewish people, while Talmud discusses the oral teaching of 'aggadta. Tanakh prohibits worshiping other gods, and Targum describes the Lord's direct communication with the Israelites at the mountain. 

|אָ֠נֹכִ֠י עֹמֵ֨ד בֵּין־יְהֹוָ֤ה וּבֵֽינֵיכֶם֙ בָּעֵ֣ת הַהִ֔וא לְהַגִּ֥יד לָכֶ֖ם אֶת־דְּבַ֣ר יְהֹוָ֑ה כִּ֤י יְרֵאתֶם֙ מִפְּנֵ֣י הָאֵ֔שׁ וְלֹֽא־עֲלִיתֶ֥ם בָּהָ֖ר לֵאמֹֽר׃|5|I stood between יהוה and you at that time to convey יהוה’s words to you, for you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain—saying:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses acted as an intermediary between God and the Israelites at Mount Sinai, relaying the commandments to them due to their fear of approaching the Divine Glory. Halakhah prohibits bowing to false gods and requires permission to read from the Torah. Jewish Thought emphasizes Moses' unique relationship with God, showcasing G-d's power through miracles. Kabbalah discusses Understanding-Binah as an essential Sefirah for accessing higher realms, akin to Moses as a Trusted Interpreter. Midrash highlights Moses dissolving God's vow and risking his life for the Torah. Musar describes Moses reaching the fiftieth level of understanding, removing barriers between God and Israel. The Second Temple text portrays a sage as a mediator between God and humanity, ensuring peace and order. In the Talmud, Rebbi Samuel bar Rav Isaac stresses the importance of proper Torah translation protocol. Targum mentions Moses standing between God's word and the people due to their fear of the Divine presence. 

|אָֽנֹכִ֖י֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑֔יךָ אֲשֶׁ֧ר הוֹצֵאתִ֛יךָ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם מִבֵּ֣֥ית עֲבָדִ֑͏ֽים׃|6|I יהוה am your God who brought you  out of the land of Egypt, the house of bondage:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Different commentaries interpret the division and numbering of the Commandments differently, with some emphasizing the importance of recognizing God as the one who delivered the Israelites from Egypt. The first positive commandment is to know that there is one God, while the first negative commandment is not to consider the thought of another divinity aside from God. The Torah commands man to understand his Creator according to his intellectual level, and the Midrash discusses various commandments and their implications, including the importance of monotheism. In the Mishnah, priests recited the Shema and the Ten Commandments, among other blessings, in the Chamber of Hewn Stone. The repetition of the Ten Commandments serves as a memorial to God's wonders, demanding absolute allegiance to Him. In Exodus 20:1-2, God declares Himself as the one who brought the Israelites out of Egypt, as interpreted by both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan in Deuteronomy 5:6. 

|לֹ֣א־יִהְיֶ֥͏ֽה־לְךָ֛֩ אֱלֹהִ֥֨ים אֲחֵרִ֖֜ים עַל־פָּנָֽ͏ַ֗י׃|7|You shall have no other gods beside Me.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains the eternal commandment for Jews to worship only God, while Gentiles are not forbidden to worship other deities. Rashbam emphasizes the prohibition of using tangible symbols to contact God, while Halakhah outlines the prohibition against making idols. Jewish Thought highlights the importance of love, fulfilling commandments, and understanding the names of God. The Midrash discusses the interconnectedness of commandments and the prohibition against graven images. Radak and Siftei Chakhamim provide interpretations of key verses, emphasizing judgment and the importance of communal matters. Tanakh reiterates the exclusive worship of the LORD, while Targum emphasizes the prohibition against worshiping other gods. 

|לֹֽ֣א־תַעֲשֶֽׂ֨ה־לְךָ֥֣ פֶ֣֙סֶל֙ ׀ כׇּל־תְּמוּנָ֔֡ה אֲשֶׁ֤֣ר בַּשָּׁמַ֣֙יִם֙ ׀ מִמַּ֔֡עַל וַאֲשֶׁ֥ר֩ בָּאָ֖֨רֶץ מִתָּ֑͏ַ֜חַת וַאֲשֶׁ֥ר בַּמַּ֖֣יִם ׀ מִתַּ֥֣חַת לָאָֽ֗רֶץ׃|8|You shall not make for yourself a sculptured image, any likeness of what is in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters below the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against making idols or images for worship in Deuteronomy 5:8 is emphasized as important due to imminent exposure to polytheistic influences, encompassing all forms of idolatrous representations. The Mishneh Torah prohibits bowing down to false gods and worshiping them, with liability for those who commission or craft idols. The Shema Yisrael links the Oneness of God with His Majesty, serving as a reminder of the first two commandments. Fulfilling the reading of the Shema can prevent surrender to enemies, and idolatry is singled out as denying the Ten Commandments. The Targums emphasize the prohibition against creating images of celestial, earthly, or aquatic beings. 

|לֹא־תִשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֥֣ה לָהֶ֖ם֮ וְלֹ֣א תׇעׇבְדֵ֑ם֒ כִּ֣י אָנֹכִ֞י יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ אֵ֣ל קַנָּ֔א פֹּ֠קֵ֠ד עֲוֺ֨ן אָב֧וֹת עַל־בָּנִ֛ים וְעַל־שִׁלֵּשִׁ֥ים וְעַל־רִבֵּעִ֖ים לְשֹׂנְאָֽ֑י׃|9|You shall not bow down to them or serve them. For I your God יהוה am an impassioned God, visiting the guilt of the parents upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generations of those who reject Me,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries, halakhic interpretations, Midrash, Mishnah, Talmud, and Targum emphasize God's demand for exclusive worship and severe punishment for idolatry, including specific actions like bowing, slaughtering, offering burnt offerings, and pouring libations. The consequences of idol worship, adultery, and judgment of nations are discussed, with actions like hugging, kissing, cleaning idols being prohibited but not punishable by death. The importance of keeping God's commandments, remembering the Sabbath, and interpreting the concept of God visiting the sins of the fathers on the children are highlighted in these texts. 

|וְעֹ֥֤שֶׂה חֶ֖֙סֶד֙ לַֽאֲלָפִ֑֔ים לְאֹהֲבַ֖י וּלְשֹׁמְרֵ֥י ׃|10|but showing kindness to the thousandth generation of those who love Me and keep My commandments.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God's commandments are to be fulfilled as if they are the commands of a present being, showing exclusivity and great love for the faithful. The text prohibits taking an oath in vain, emphasizing the restriction on unnecessary swearing. In some cases, "the name of the Lord" represents the essence and reality of God or the word and command of God. Or HaChaim explains that God quantifies blessings more generously than curses, with Targum mentioning God's kindness and mercy to those who love Him and follow His commandments. 

|לֹ֥א תִשָּׂ֛א אֶת־שֵֽׁם־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לַשָּׁ֑וְא כִּ֣י לֹ֤א יְנַקֶּה֙ יְהֹוָ֔ה אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁר־יִשָּׂ֥א אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ לַשָּֽׁוְא׃|11|You shall not swear falsely by the name of your God יהוה; for יהוה will not clear one who swears falsely by God’s name.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment to not take the name of the Lord in vain encompasses using God's name for no purpose, with severe consequences for false oaths. Violating an oath is considered serious, with atonement processes outlined for false oaths in the tractate. Taking an oath concerning an unfulfillable matter transgresses a negative commandment, leading to lashes, while the observance of the Sabbath involves Torah-based and Prophetic commandments. The Midrash emphasizes following all commandments and explores the consequences of violations, cautioning against breaking vows and oaths. Musar highlights the importance of returning borrowed items, charity, and truthfulness in testimony, linking the Sabbath commandment to the Exodus from Egypt. The Talmud discusses interpretations and applications of Shabbat-related mitzvot, exploring punishments for transgressions like false oaths. The Targum emphasizes the prohibition against swearing falsely by the Name of the Lord in Deuteronomy 5:11. 

|שָׁמ֛֣וֹר אֶת־י֥וֹם֩ הַשַּׁבָּ֖֨ת לְקַדְּשׁ֑֜וֹ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוְּךָ֖֣ ׀ יְהֹוָ֥֣ה אֱלֹהֶֽ֗יךָ׃|12|Observe the sabbath day and keep it holy, as your God יהוה has commanded you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of understanding the intention behind keeping the Sabbath holy, connecting it to God as the Creator and achieving the level of "zachor." Commentary highlights that women are obligated to observe the Sabbath, while Halakhah discusses the dimensions of Sabbath observance and its connection to the Exodus from Egypt. Jewish Thought emphasizes the obligation for all Jews to relate the story of the Exodus, and Kabbalah discusses the significance of remembering and observing the Sabbath. Liturgy explains the discrepancy between the texts of the fourth commandment, while Midrash emphasizes the importance of the Sabbath and its connection to the Ten Commandments. Musar advises forgiveness and specific practices related to the Sabbath, while Talmud discusses various aspects of Sabbath observance and the giving of the Torah. Tanakh instructs individuals to remember and keep the Sabbath holy, while Targum emphasizes the importance of observing and sanctifying the Sabbath as commanded by God. 

|שֵׁ֤֣שֶׁת יָמִ֣ים֙ תַּֽעֲבֹ֔ד֮ וְעָשִׂ֖֣יתָ כׇּֿל־מְלַאכְתֶּֽךָ֒׃|13|Six days you shall labor and do all your work,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Halakhah prohibits work on the Sabbath, including carrying certain objects and moving muktzeh items to ensure a true day of rest, as stated in Deuteronomy 5:14. Rashi explains that resting animals on the Sabbath applies to all cattle and beasts, while Ibn Ezra discusses the preservation of meanings in Scripture. The Talmud clarifies that the term "stranger" refers to a ger toshav, not a righteous convert, and that the fourfold and fivefold payment for theft applies to all animals, not just oxen and sheep. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Deuteronomy 5:13 as emphasizing the command to work for six days. 

|וְי֨וֹם֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔֜י שַׁבָּ֖֣ת ׀ לַיהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑֗יךָ לֹ֣א תַעֲשֶׂ֣ה כׇל־מְלָאכָ֡ה אַתָּ֣ה וּבִנְךָֽ־וּבִתֶּ֣ךָ וְעַבְדְּךָֽ־וַ֠אֲמָתֶ֠ךָ וְשׁוֹרְךָ֨ וַחֲמֹֽרְךָ֜ וְכׇל־בְּהֶמְתֶּ֗ךָ וְגֵֽרְךָ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בִּשְׁעָרֶ֔יךָ לְמַ֗עַן יָנ֛וּחַ עַבְדְּךָ֥ וַאֲמָתְךָ֖ כָּמֽ֑וֹךָ׃|14|but the seventh day is a sabbath of your God יהוה; you shall not do any work—you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your ox or your ass, or any of your cattle, or the stranger in your settlements, so that your male and female slave may rest as you do.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the intention to cleave to God during Shabbat, with all commandments understood through the Oral Torah. The Sabbath rest reflects God's kindness and past servitude, ensuring rest for all, including animals and servants. Observing Shabbat is a way to remember God's creation and spiritual freedom, with prohibitions on activities to ensure rest for all household members. The Sabbath is a symbol of freedom and rest for the entire community, not limited to specific animals, as emphasized in various texts such as the Talmud and Tanakh. 

|וְזָכַרְתָּ֗֞ כִּ֣י־עֶ֤֥בֶד הָיִ֣֙יתָ֙ ׀ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔֗יִם וַיֹּצִ֨אֲךָ֜֩ יְהֹוָ֤֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֤֙יךָ֙ מִשָּׁ֔ם֙ בְּיָ֥֤ד חֲזָקָ֖ה֙ וּבִזְרֹ֣עַ נְטוּיָ֑֔ה עַל־כֵּ֗ן צִוְּךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ לַעֲשׂ֖וֹת אֶת־י֥וֹם הַשַּׁבָּֽת׃|15|Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and your God יהוה freed you from there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm; therefore your God יהוה has commanded you to observe the sabbath day.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes maintaining a proper perspective rooted in the fear of Hashem to transform distress into spiritual growth, as seen in the mitzvot to remember the exodus from Mitzrayim and observe Shabbos. Halakhah stresses the importance of resting on Shabbat to show spiritual freedom and connection to divine roots, while Jewish Thought highlights the significance of Passover, Shabbat, and other commandments as reminders of fundamental beliefs. The Talmud discusses the rewards and punishments for fulfilling or not following commandments, with Rabbi Ya’akov adding that belief in the resurrection of the dead is crucial for receiving rewards for mitzvot. The Targum explains the command to observe the Sabbath as a reminder of the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt. 

|כַּבֵּ֤ד אֶת־אָבִ֙יךָ֙ וְאֶת־אִמֶּ֔ךָ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוְּךָ֖ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ לְמַ֣עַן ׀ יַאֲרִיכֻ֣ן יָמֶ֗יךָ וּלְמַ֙עַן֙ יִ֣יטַב לָ֔ךְ עַ֚ל הָֽאֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לָֽךְ׃|16|Honor your father and your mother, as your God יהוה has commanded you, that you may long endure, and that you may fare well, in the land that your God יהוה is assigning to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment to honor father and mother is given at Marah, ensuring good days in this life and further reward in the world to come. Halakhah prohibits kidnapping and killing innocent people, with murder resulting in execution. Jewish Thought emphasizes the importance of love in completing life and becoming a blessing. Liturgy teaches that rewards for fulfilling mitzvot are bestowed in the World-to-Come. Midrash highlights the importance of fulfilling commandments, such as honoring parents. Mishnah states that men are obligated to perform all mitzvot regarding their fathers. Musar extends the duty to honor family members from the commandment to honor father and mother. Quoting Commentary discusses the importance of honoring parents and the promise of reward. Talmud emphasizes the reward for fulfilling mitzvot is dependent on the resurrection of the dead. Tanakh recounts Moses crying out to God at Marah and the command to honor parents. Targum stresses the importance of honoring parents for a long and prosperous life. 

|לֹ֥֖א תִּֿרְצָ֖͏ֽח׃ וְלֹ֣֖א תִּֿנְאָ֑͏ֽף׃ וְלֹ֣֖א תִּֿגְנֹֽ֔ב׃ וְלֹֽא־תַעֲנֶ֥ה בְרֵֽעֲךָ֖ עֵ֥ד שָֽׁוְא׃|17|You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment "Thou shalt not commit adultery" applies to married women, and bearing false witness includes submitting frivolous testimony that could harm a neighbor. The Torah emphasizes loyalty and honesty in testimony. Killing transgresses the commandment "Do not murder," and giving false testimony is prohibited, with violators facing lashes and retribution. The Midrash discusses the importance of following God's laws, resisting temptation, and ethical behavior. Ibn Ezra questions the wording of the Ten Commandments and emphasizes understanding the underlying meanings. The Targum expands on the commandments not to murder, commit adultery, kidnap, or bear false witness, emphasizing the importance of avoiding association with those who commit these sins. 

|וְלֹ֥א תַחְמֹ֖ד אֵ֣שֶׁת רֵעֶ֑ךָ וְלֹ֨א תִתְאַוֶּ֜ה בֵּ֣ית רֵעֶ֗ךָ שָׂדֵ֜הוּ וְעַבְדּ֤וֹ וַאֲמָתוֹ֙ שׁוֹר֣וֹ וַחֲמֹר֔וֹ וְכֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר לְרֵעֶֽךָ׃|18|You [men]  shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. Likewise, none of you shall crave your neighbor’s house, or field, or male or female slave, or ox, or ass, or anything that is your neighbor’s.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against coveting is a serious offense in Chasidut, Halakhah, Musar, and Tanakh, as it can lead to harmful actions and intentions towards others. Various commentaries, including Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Tur HaArokh, and Ramban, emphasize the importance of refraining from coveting and desiring, with distinctions made between the two concepts. The Ten Commandments are organized on two tablets to show their relationship, with the first tablet containing commandments related to divinity and the second tablet containing commandments related to interpersonal relationships. The Targum commentary warns against covetousness and the negative consequences it can bring, emphasizing the importance of maintaining purity and integrity within the community of Israel. 

|אֶֽת־הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֡לֶּה דִּבֶּר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֶל־כׇּל־קְהַלְכֶ֜ם בָּהָ֗ר מִתּ֤וֹךְ הָאֵשׁ֙ הֶֽעָנָ֣ן וְהָֽעֲרָפֶ֔ל ק֥וֹל גָּד֖וֹל וְלֹ֣א יָסָ֑ף וַֽיִּכְתְּבֵ֗ם עַל־שְׁנֵי֙ לֻחֹ֣ת אֲבָנִ֔ים וַֽיִּתְּנֵ֖ם אֵלָֽי׃|19|יהוה spoke those words—those and no more—to your whole congregation at the mountain, with a mighty voice out of the fire and the dense clouds. [God] inscribed them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me.|

Chasidut emphasizes the Torah's guidance ingrained in every Jewish soul, requiring preparation and desire from Bnei Yisrael to fully embrace its teachings, with every word offering protection contingent on awareness and commitment. Various interpretations of "ולא יסף" in Deuteronomy 5:19 include God's voice not pausing, the Ten Commandments heard to avoid distraction, and Moses being the intermediary between God and the Israelites. The Midrash discusses the story of Tamar, David, and the Torah at Sinai, highlighting modesty, humility, and the impact of observing commandments. Nachmanides explains the essence of the first two commandments heard directly from God, reconciling different views on the giving of the Torah. Shmuel the Elder interprets Judah's actions with Tamar for the sake of Heaven, while the Gemara and Jerusalem Talmud emphasize the eternal nature of the Torah and certain practices. Men with certain physical conditions are restricted from the congregation of יהוה, with uncertainty about the inclusion of women. Adonoy spoke to the assembly at the mountain with a great voice, writing the words on two tablets given to Moses. 

|וַיְהִ֗י כְּשׇׁמְעֲכֶ֤ם אֶת־הַקּוֹל֙ מִתּ֣וֹךְ הַחֹ֔שֶׁךְ וְהָהָ֖ר בֹּעֵ֣ר בָּאֵ֑שׁ וַתִּקְרְב֣וּן אֵלַ֔י כׇּל־רָאשֵׁ֥י שִׁבְטֵיכֶ֖ם וְזִקְנֵיכֶֽם׃|20|When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, you came up to me, all your tribal heads and elders,|

Rashi emphasizes the importance of humility in Musar, showing the significance of giving others the right of precedence. In Quoting Commentary, the vision of the Glory of the G-d of Israel was seen by the seventy elders due to the merit of Jacob, and the fiery law was interpreted as a law given with fire. In Tanakh, God tells Moses that no one can see His face and live. Targum highlights that the Israelites witnessed God's glory, greatness, and voice speaking from within the fire. 

|וְעַתָּה֙ לָ֣מָּה נָמ֔וּת כִּ֣י תֹֽאכְלֵ֔נוּ הָאֵ֥שׁ הַגְּדֹלָ֖ה הַזֹּ֑את אִם־יֹסְפִ֣ים ׀ אֲנַ֗חְנוּ לִ֠שְׁמֹ֠עַ אֶת־ק֨וֹל יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֵ֛ינוּ ע֖וֹד וָמָֽתְנוּ׃|22|Let us not die, then, for this fearsome fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of our God יהוה any longer, we shall die.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites feared death from hearing the voice of God due to its overwhelming nature and great fire, leading them to question the risk of continuing to listen. Fear of the Lord is essential for safeguarding actions in Torah and commandments, prioritizing fear over wisdom for lasting Torah study. Buber's interpretation of the Sinai encounter emphasizes the need to endure overwhelming divine revelation and be responsible for every moment. In Kabbalah, God tests individuals to see their strength in facing His greatness, ultimately leading to spiritual growth and the ability to behold His sweetness.

Sacrifice offerings reinforce God's unity and draw closer to Him in a kabbalistic interpretation, as explained by Rashbam. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize the fear of death if the people continue to hear the voice of God. 

|כִּ֣י מִ֣י כׇל־בָּשָׂ֡ר אֲשֶׁ֣ר שָׁמַ֣ע קוֹל֩ אֱלֹהִ֨ים חַיִּ֜ים מְדַבֵּ֧ר מִתּוֹךְ־הָאֵ֛שׁ כָּמֹ֖נוּ וַיֶּֽחִי׃|23|For what mortal ever heard the voice of the living God speak out of the fire, as we did, and lived?|

The Law promotes politeness, obedience, and good deeds, with slander and the punishment of the exodus generation discussed. In Kabbalah, "my sister" refers to the Shechinah, and in the Midrash, God responds to both affirmative and negative responses. Musar speaks of the ideal world when all of God's potential in man is realized, and Ramban explains the communication between Moses and God using the Proper Name. The text refutes claims alluding to Mohammed in Scripture and emphasizes the covenant with the descendants of Isaac and Jacob. The Israelites asked Moses to speak on behalf of God out of fear of direct communication. 

|וַיִּשְׁמַ֤ע יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־ק֣וֹל דִּבְרֵיכֶ֔ם בְּדַבֶּרְכֶ֖ם אֵלָ֑י וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֵלַ֗י שָׁ֠מַ֠עְתִּי אֶת־ק֨וֹל דִּבְרֵ֜י הָעָ֤ם הַזֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר דִּבְּר֣וּ אֵלֶ֔יךָ הֵיטִ֖יבוּ כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֵּֽרוּ׃|25|יהוה heard the plea that you made to me, and יהוה said to me, “I have heard the plea that this people made to you; they did well to speak thus.|

Moses' return to the people after receiving the law on Mount Sinai signifies the need for explicit revocation of decisions made by competent authority. The mitzva of ona in marriage is seen as a joyful commandment symbolizing the joy of marriage. Prophecy in Jewish thought involves mental understanding due to the incorporeal nature of the Almighty. Moses' actions, such as breaking the Tablets and separating from his wife, were based on his own reasoning in accordance with God's will. The commandment to procreate is reiterated to the Jewish people after the revelation at Mount Sinai. Moses separated from his wife after the revelation based on an a fortiori inference and God's command, while a leper is prohibited from marital relations based on the term "his tent" referring to his wife after the giving of the Torah. God rebukes Miriam and Aaron for speaking against Moses in Numbers 12:8. 

|וְאַתָּ֗ה פֹּה֮ עֲמֹ֣ד עִמָּדִי֒ וַאֲדַבְּרָ֣ה אֵלֶ֗יךָ אֵ֧ת כׇּל־הַמִּצְוָ֛ה וְהַחֻקִּ֥ים וְהַמִּשְׁפָּטִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר תְּלַמְּדֵ֑ם וְעָשׂ֣וּ בָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י נֹתֵ֥ן לָהֶ֖ם לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|28|But you remain here with Me, and I will give you the whole Instruction—the laws and the rules—that you shall impart to them, for them to observe in the land that I am giving them to possess.”|

|וּשְׁמַרְתֶּ֣ם לַעֲשׂ֔וֹת כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוָּ֛ה יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֖ם אֶתְכֶ֑ם לֹ֥א תָסֻ֖רוּ יָמִ֥ין וּשְׂמֹֽאל׃|29|Be careful, then, to do as your God יהוה has commanded you. Do not turn aside to the right or to the left:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text stresses the importance of observing God's commandments, particularly the Ten Commandments, without adding or subtracting from them to ensure a prosperous life in the promised land. The principle of free will in Torah and mitzvot highlights individuals' choice to do good or evil, as the Creator does not compel or decree actions. In the Midrash, various interpretations are given regarding God's actions with the Israelites, while Philo discusses sacrifices offered by Abel and Cain. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan underscore the significance of following God's commandments without deviation. 

|בְּכׇל־הַדֶּ֗רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֨ר צִוָּ֜ה יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֛ם אֶתְכֶ֖ם תֵּלֵ֑כוּ לְמַ֤עַן תִּֽחְיוּן֙ וְט֣וֹב לָכֶ֔ם וְהַאֲרַכְתֶּ֣ם יָמִ֔ים בָּאָ֖רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר תִּֽירָשֽׁוּן׃|30|follow only the path that your God יהוה has enjoined upon you, so that you may thrive and that it may go well with you, and that you may long endure in the land you are to possess.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandments and statutes aim to instill fear of the Lord, leading to a fulfilling life on earth and in the afterlife, with righteousness potentially leading to rewards even in this life. Moses' prophecy differed from other prophets in that he prophesied while awake and without metaphor, separating himself from worldly distractions to be ready for prophecy at all times. Halachah and Aggadah in the Talmud are derived from substantive contexts, with Halachah referring to God's commanded path and Aggadah emphasizing passing down historical knowledge. The Midrash discusses the burnt offering atoning for Israel's iniquities, compares Shmuel to Moshe, and explains the significance of the Israelites' route in the desert. The concept of choosing life in Sefer HaYashar 5:24 refers to the life after death for the righteous.

The Israelites captured fortified cities, houses, cisterns, vineyards, and enjoyed abundance from God's bounty. The Targum commentary on Deuteronomy 6:11 emphasizes the inheritance of houses, cisterns, vineyards, and olive stands without the need for labor. 

|הִשָּׁ֣מֶר לְךָ֔ פֶּן־תִּשְׁכַּ֖ח אֶת־יְהֹוָ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֧ר הוֹצִֽיאֲךָ֛ מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם מִבֵּ֥ית עֲבָדִֽים׃|12|take heed that you do not forget יהוה who freed you from the land of Egypt, the house of bondage.|

The commentators stress the importance of remembering the hardships of slavery in Egypt and God's role in delivering the Israelites, warning against becoming consumed by material wealth.

|כִּ֣י אֵ֥ל קַנָּ֛א יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ בְּקִרְבֶּ֑ךָ פֶּן־יֶ֠חֱרֶ֠ה אַף־יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ בָּ֔ךְ וְהִשְׁמִ֣ידְךָ֔ מֵעַ֖ל פְּנֵ֥י הָאֲדָמָֽה׃|15|for your God יהוה in your midst is an impassioned God—lest the anger of your God יהוה blaze forth against you, wiping you off the face of the earth.|

The text emphasizes the prohibition of testing God's promises, particularly regarding tithing, as seen in Deuteronomy 6:16 and Malachi 3:10. It is important to have faith in God's Torah and prophets without seeking proof or miracles, as true service to God should not be conditional on receiving benefits. Trusting in God's providence and following His commandments without doubt is crucial, while seeking forgiveness and atonement in dangerous situations can lead to divine favor. Additionally, the importance of tithing as a safeguard for wealth and prosperity is highlighted throughout various commentaries and texts. 

|שָׁמ֣וֹר תִּשְׁמְר֔וּן אֶת־מִצְוֺ֖ת יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֑ם וְעֵדֹתָ֥יו וְחֻקָּ֖יו אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוָּֽךְ׃|17|Be sure to keep the commandments, decrees, and laws that your God יהוה has enjoined upon you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the individual connection to fulfilling mitzvot, stressing the importance of not judging others' practices. The commandments in Deuteronomy 6:17 are meant to perpetuate God's miracles and benefit society, with the commandment not to test God applying to all laws. Targum highlights the significance of guarding and keeping God's commandments. 

|וְעָשִׂ֛יתָ הַיָּשָׁ֥ר וְהַטּ֖וֹב בְּעֵינֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה לְמַ֙עַן֙ יִ֣יטַב לָ֔ךְ וּבָ֗אתָ וְיָֽרַשְׁתָּ֙ אֶת־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַטֹּבָ֔ה אֲשֶׁר־נִשְׁבַּ֥ע יְהֹוָ֖ה לַאֲבֹתֶֽיךָ׃|18|Do what is right and good in the sight of יהוה, that it may go well with you and that you may be able to possess the good land that your God יהוה promised on oath to your fathers,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse in Deuteronomy 6:18 instructs individuals to do what is right and good in the eyes of God, emphasizing the importance of following His commandments and acting with kindness, fairness, and goodwill towards others. This principle of doing good beyond the requirements of the law is seen as key in interpersonal relationships, with practical solutions established by the Sages in the Talmud based on principles of not stealing, deceiving, or causing harm to others. The Torah commands observance of laws and statutes, while also encouraging acts of kindness and fairness beyond what is explicitly commanded, complementing the specific laws given in the Torah and providing a framework for moral behavior in complex situations. 

|לַהֲדֹ֥ף אֶת־כׇּל־אֹיְבֶ֖יךָ מִפָּנֶ֑יךָ כַּאֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהֹוָֽה׃|19|and that all your enemies may be driven out before you, as יהוה has spoken.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God promises to protect Israelites from their enemies if they follow His commandments, as stated in Exodus 23:27 and reiterated in Deuteronomy 6:19. The liturgy in Siddur Edot HaMizrach expresses the intention to fulfill the commandment of affixing a mezuzah in the name of all Israel, acknowledging God as King of the Universe. In the Tanakh, God promises to send terror before the Israelites, causing their enemies to panic and flee, demonstrating His power and protection. The Targum commentaries on Deuteronomy 6:19 emphasize the idea that God will defeat or drive out the enemies of the Israelites as promised. 

|כִּֽי־יִשְׁאָלְךָ֥ בִנְךָ֛ מָחָ֖ר לֵאמֹ֑ר מָ֣ה הָעֵדֹ֗ת וְהַֽחֻקִּים֙ וְהַמִּשְׁפָּטִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוָּ֛ה יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ אֶתְכֶֽם׃|20|When, in time to come, your children ask you, “What mean the decrees, laws, and rules that our God יהוה has enjoined upon you?”  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of understanding the reasons behind the Torah's laws, with God dwelling with the downtrodden and infusing life force through Torah (Psalms 39:5, Deuteronomy 6:20, Likutei Moharan 56:3:10).

The importance of telling the story of the Exodus is emphasized in liturgy and the Haggadah, with different responses given to the four sons. The Talmud teaches that the Passover Seder should begin with disgrace and end with glory, with different approaches suggested by Rav and Shmuel. The Targum translations emphasize that the Israelites were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, delivered by God with a strong hand. 

|וַיִּתֵּ֣ן יְהֹוָ֡ה אוֹתֹ֣ת וּ֠מֹפְתִ֠ים גְּדֹלִ֨ים וְרָעִ֧ים ׀ בְּמִצְרַ֛יִם בְּפַרְעֹ֥ה וּבְכׇל־בֵּית֖וֹ לְעֵינֵֽינוּ׃|22|יהוה wrought before our eyes marvelous and destructive signs and portents in Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his household;|
