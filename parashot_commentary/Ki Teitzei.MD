## Deuteronomy 21

|כִּֽי־תֵצֵ֥א לַמִּלְחָמָ֖ה עַל־אֹיְבֶ֑יךָ וּנְתָנ֞וֹ יְהֹוָ֧ה אֱלֹהֶ֛יךָ בְּיָדֶ֖ךָ וְשָׁבִ֥יתָ שִׁבְיֽוֹ׃|10|When you [an Israelite warrior] take the field against your enemies, and your God יהוה delivers them into your power and you take some of them captive,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, various texts emphasize the battle against the evil inclination, with different approaches to overcoming it. In Commentary, different commentators provide insights on the laws and limitations of war, particularly outside the borders of Israel. Jewish Thought explores various topics related to Jewish law and tradition, including marriage of captive women and wars of aggression. Midrash discusses the consequences of sin, the importance of good deeds, and the treatment of foes. In Musar, spiritual rehabilitation is achieved through repentance, prayer, and charity, with Torah study and mitzvah observance essential for victory. Quoting Commentary, Pharaoh's intentions towards Sarah are analyzed based on biblical text. In Talmud, the obligation to destroy non-Canaanite gentiles is discussed, with room for repentance and acceptance in Eretz Yisrael. Targum elaborates on the scenario of war and taking prisoners as delivered by God. 

|וְרָאִ֙יתָ֙ בַּשִּׁבְיָ֔ה אֵ֖שֶׁת יְפַת־תֹּ֑אַר וְחָשַׁקְתָּ֣ בָ֔הּ וְלָקַחְתָּ֥ לְךָ֖ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|11|and you see among the captives a beautiful woman and you desire her and would take her [into your household] as your wife,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of recognizing and reclaiming holiness taken by the evil inclination, leading to deeper repentance and repair of past transgressions. Halakhah details the procedure for a yefat to'ar, a beautiful captive woman, including a mourning period before marriage and waiting 90 days before marrying her captor. Jewish Thought discusses the events surrounding the Midianites and the victory over them. Liturgy highlights the complexity and mystery of divine laws, showcasing how what is forbidden can become permitted. Midrash explains God's permission of certain alternatives to forbidden things and the consequences of transgression. Musar discusses the subjugation and rehabilitation of Lilith and Machalat through harsh measures and conveying knowledge about God's goodness. Talmud debates whether the first act of intercourse with a captive woman is permitted, with Rav and Shmuel disagreeing on the matter. The Targum commentary on Deuteronomy 21:11 allows a man to take a beautiful woman among prisoners of war as his wife if he desires her. 

|וַהֲבֵאתָ֖הּ אֶל־תּ֣וֹךְ בֵּיתֶ֑ךָ וְגִלְּחָה֙ אֶת־רֹאשָׁ֔הּ וְעָשְׂתָ֖ה אֶת־צִפׇּרְנֶֽיהָ׃|12|you shall bring her into your household, and she shall trim her hair, pare her nails,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the commandment to remove external appearances of beauty to reveal inner goodness, regulations regarding a captive woman to eliminate previous influences, relations with a yefat toar only permitted in captivity, importance of showing regard to all creatures, and the interconnectedness of good deeds and transgressions in the Torah. Rashi explains the significance of letting nails grow in Deuteronomy 21:12, and Targum translations of shaving the head and growing nails in Deuteronomy 21:12 are discussed. Rav and Shmuel have differing opinions on the first act of intercourse with a female convert, and there is a debate between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva on the meaning of "do her nails" in relation to a beautiful female prisoner of war. 

|וְהֵסִ֩ירָה֩ אֶת־שִׂמְלַ֨ת שִׁבְיָ֜הּ מֵעָלֶ֗יהָ וְיָֽשְׁבָה֙ בְּבֵיתֶ֔ךָ וּבָ֥כְתָ֛ה אֶת־אָבִ֥יהָ וְאֶת־אִמָּ֖הּ יֶ֣רַח יָמִ֑ים וְאַ֨חַר כֵּ֜ן תָּב֤וֹא אֵלֶ֙יהָ֙ וּבְעַלְתָּ֔הּ וְהָיְתָ֥ה לְךָ֖ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|13|and discard her captive’s garb. She shall spend a month’s time in your household lamenting her father and mother; after that you may come to her and thus become her husband, and she shall be your wife.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the process outlined in Deuteronomy for a Jewish soldier who desires a beautiful captive woman, emphasizing the importance of mourning for her parents, waiting for her conversion to Judaism, and ensuring her acceptance of the faith before marriage. The Midrash teaches that the woman should be dressed in widows' weeds to eliminate her previous beauty and connection to idolatry. Ramban and Ibn Ezra explain that the rituals of mourning, shaving her head, and paring her nails are meant to facilitate her conversion and make her less attractive to her captor. The Talmud and Tosefta provide additional details on the waiting period before marriage and the process for a woman to remarry after divorce or widowhood. 

|וְהָיָ֞ה אִם־לֹ֧א חָפַ֣צְתָּ בָּ֗הּ וְשִׁלַּחְתָּהּ֙ לְנַפְשָׁ֔הּ וּמָכֹ֥ר לֹא־תִמְכְּרֶ֖נָּה בַּכָּ֑סֶף לֹא־תִתְעַמֵּ֣ר בָּ֔הּ תַּ֖חַת אֲשֶׁ֥ר עִנִּיתָֽהּ׃|14|Then, should you no longer want her, you must release her outright. You must not sell her for money: since you had your will of her, you must not enslave her.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the release of a captive woman in war, emphasizing that she cannot be sold or mistreated, and the captor must wait three months before marrying her. In Jewish thought, it is recommended to free a maidservant before cohabiting with her, and there are conditions to consider before taking a woman of beautiful appearance as a wife. The Midrash highlights the importance of not mistreating others, even if they were once powerful. Commandment 533 prohibits selling a prisoner of war once she becomes the soldier's wife, as stated in Deuteronomy 21:14. 

|כִּֽי־תִהְיֶ֨יןָ לְאִ֜ישׁ שְׁתֵּ֣י נָשִׁ֗ים הָאַחַ֤ת אֲהוּבָה֙ וְהָאַחַ֣ת שְׂנוּאָ֔ה וְיָֽלְדוּ־ל֣וֹ בָנִ֔ים הָאֲהוּבָ֖ה וְהַשְּׂנוּאָ֑ה וְהָיָ֛ה הַבֵּ֥ן הַבְּכֹ֖ר לַשְּׂנִיאָֽה׃|15|If a householder  has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have borne him sons, but the first-born is the son of the unloved one—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Babylonian Talmud discusses the law that if a man has two wives and one is loved and the other hated, the firstborn son of the hated wife is entitled to a double portion of the inheritance, even if he is not the favorite son, based on Deuteronomy 21:15-17. The Mishnah in Bekhorot outlines that a son born by Cesarean section or the son born after him are not considered "the firstborn," as sons must be sons from the moment of birth according to Deuteronomy 21:15. Hushai questions David's marriage to a 'beautiful woman' taken captive in war in connection to rebellious offspring in Deuteronomy 21:18, emphasizing the Torah's concession to human frailty but lack of approval for such unions. The Talmud discusses various scenarios regarding the firstborn son's entitlement to inheritance, including cases of caesarean section births and multiple sons. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain that the firstborn son will belong to the hated wife in a marriage with two wives according to Deuteronomy 21:15. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה בְּיוֹם֙ הַנְחִיל֣וֹ אֶת־בָּנָ֔יו אֵ֥ת אֲשֶׁר־יִהְיֶ֖ה ל֑וֹ לֹ֣א יוּכַ֗ל לְבַכֵּר֙ אֶת־בֶּן־הָ֣אֲהוּבָ֔ה עַל־פְּנֵ֥י בֶן־הַשְּׂנוּאָ֖ה הַבְּכֹֽר׃|16|when he wills his property to his sons, he may not treat as first-born the son of the loved one in disregard of the son of the unloved one who is older.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah prohibits favoring a beloved son over a hated son in inheritance, with exceptions for misconduct. The firstborn inherits the bequeather, and a double portion is granted even to a mamzer. Jewish thought prioritizes equity in inheritance, with laws favoring closest relatives. The Midrash discusses Jacob recognizing Reuben as his firstborn despite his shortcomings. Mishnah highlights the importance of proper judgment in inheritance cases, while Talmud discusses the timing of court trials. Tanakh mentions Haran's death in Ur of the Chaldeans, and Targum emphasizes equal inheritance rights for sons. Tosefta addresses specific cases affecting firstborn status for inheritance and redemption. 

|כִּי֩ אֶת־הַבְּכֹ֨ר בֶּן־הַשְּׂנוּאָ֜ה יַכִּ֗יר לָ֤תֶת לוֹ֙ פִּ֣י שְׁנַ֔יִם בְּכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־יִמָּצֵ֖א ל֑וֹ כִּי־הוּא֙ רֵאשִׁ֣ית אֹנ֔וֹ ל֖וֹ מִשְׁפַּ֥ט הַבְּכֹרָֽה׃|17|Instead, he must accept the first-born, the son of the unloved one, and allot to him a double portion  of all he possesses; since he is the first fruit of his vigor, the birthright is his due.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yaakov penalized Reuven for his sin by depriving him of the rights of the firstborn, while Yosef gained the rights by guarding the brit. The firstborn son is entitled to a double portion of the father's inheritance based on what is held in possession at the time of his death, with specific details outlined in Halakhah. The Mishnah discusses various scenarios related to inheritance rights, including the credibility of a father claiming his son is a mamzer and the distribution of property based on biblical laws. The Talmud explores rules of inheritance for firstborn sons and the credibility of individuals in identifying a firstborn. In the Tanakh, it is stated that a man must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn, emphasizing the importance of recognizing the rights of the firstborn. 

|כִּֽי־יִהְיֶ֣ה לְאִ֗ישׁ בֵּ֚ן סוֹרֵ֣ר וּמוֹרֶ֔ה אֵינֶ֣נּוּ שֹׁמֵ֔עַ בְּק֥וֹל אָבִ֖יו וּבְק֣וֹל אִמּ֑וֹ וְיִסְּר֣וּ אֹת֔וֹ וְלֹ֥א יִשְׁמַ֖ע אֲלֵיהֶֽם׃|18|If a householder  has a wayward and defiant son, who does not heed his father or mother and does not obey them even after they discipline him,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the execution of a stubborn and rebellious son, focusing on the father's emotions and God's involvement, highlighting the purpose of the law as a deterrent for future wrongdoing based on the son's potential actions rather than current deeds. The judgment process involves bringing the son to court with witnesses testifying to theft and disobedience, leading to lashes and possible stoning, within three months of maturity. The Law aims to reduce human desires to prevent intemperance, with capital punishment reserved for serious crimes. The Torah alludes to the celestial tribunal in dealing with the wayward son, emphasizing the importance of waging war against the evil urge. 

|וְתָ֥פְשׂוּ ב֖וֹ אָבִ֣יו וְאִמּ֑וֹ וְהוֹצִ֧יאוּ אֹת֛וֹ אֶל־זִקְנֵ֥י עִיר֖וֹ וְאֶל־שַׁ֥עַר מְקֹמֽוֹ׃|19|his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the public place of his community.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah allows for dealing with a rebellious son only if both parents testify against him, with forgiveness from either parent resulting in the son going free. Specific criteria must be met for the son to be considered rebellious, and if a parent is disabled, the son cannot be punished. The Talmud discusses the criteria for a rebellious son, including the involvement of elders in the process, while the Tosefta outlines the warning process before witnesses and the execution of rebellious individuals on a holiday. 

|וְאָמְר֞וּ אֶל־זִקְנֵ֣י עִיר֗וֹ בְּנֵ֤נוּ זֶה֙ סוֹרֵ֣ר וּמֹרֶ֔ה אֵינֶ֥נּוּ שֹׁמֵ֖עַ בְּקֹלֵ֑נוּ זוֹלֵ֖ל וְסֹבֵֽא׃|20|They shall say to the elders of his town, “This son of ours is disloyal and defiant; he does not heed us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 21:20 discusses the characteristics of a rebellious son, such as being a glutton and a drunkard, leading to impoverishment and violence, with punishment including lashes or stoning. The Oral Tradition outlines specific conditions for a rebellious son to be liable for stoning, involving stealing, eating meat and wine ravenously, and being part of base individuals, with requirements for parental consent and physical disabilities. The Law aims to curb excessive desires, including eating and drinking, to prevent moral decay, with commandments designed to counteract lustful behavior. Mishnah details the specific amounts of meat and wine that make a son rebellious, with conditions for parental consent and physical disabilities exempting the son from punishment. The Talmud clarifies that a stubborn son must disobey his parents, not just God, and must be physically capable of being brought to the elders. Proverbs 23:20 warns against excessive consumption of wine and meat. 

|וּ֠רְגָמֻ֠הוּ כׇּל־אַנְשֵׁ֨י עִיר֤וֹ בָֽאֲבָנִים֙ וָמֵ֔ת וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֥ הָרָ֖ע מִקִּרְבֶּ֑ךָ וְכׇל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל יִשְׁמְע֥וּ וְיִרָֽאוּ׃|21|Thereupon his town’s council  shall stone him to death. Thus you will sweep out evil from your midst: all Israel will hear and be afraid.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes self-education to nurture the divine soul and subdue the animal soul, highlighting the importance of obedience to Torah and authority figures to avoid rebelliousness. The law of the rebellious son aims to maintain societal order and teach obedience, with specific criteria and age limits to prevent disputes. Rav Moshe discusses the prohibition of smoking for those who started after 1981, linking it to the prohibition of indulging in frivolous pleasures. The story of the rebellious son in Deuteronomy underscores the importance of serving God out of love, contrasting Saul's errors with David's obedience. The Midrash discusses the consequences of marrying for beauty, the impact of good and bad deeds, and the significance of various commandments. The Mishnah lists crimes punishable by stoning, emphasizing preventive punishment for societal harm. Moses established the punishment for the rebellious son to remove evil from the community, highlighting the need to purge base tendencies. The Talmud discusses criteria for adulthood and other offenses punishable by stoning, while the Targum emphasizes the warning of stoning the rebellious son to instill fear and obedience. 

|וְכִֽי־יִהְיֶ֣ה בְאִ֗ישׁ חֵ֛טְא מִשְׁפַּט־מָ֖וֶת וְהוּמָ֑ת וְתָלִ֥יתָ אֹת֖וֹ עַל־עֵֽץ׃|22|If any party is guilty of a capital offense and is put to death, and you impale the body on a stake,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reish Lakish discusses the power of teshuva, explaining that intentional sins can become like unintentional sins or even merits, depending on the motivation behind the repentance. Hanging those who have been stoned is a form of degradation towards God and the king, with exceptions for the blasphemer and idolator. The Halakhah commands that those liable for hanging should be hanged, with the corpses of blasphemers and idolaters to be hung after execution. The Mishnah discusses halakhic differences between men and women, including actions related to leprosy, naziriteship, betrothal, and punishment for theft. The Talmud states that a man is hanged but a woman is not hanged, with differing opinions on this practice. Moses commanded the Israelites to stone a blasphemer outside the camp, which they did as commanded by יהוה. The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 21:22 all mention the act of hanging a man on a beam or crucifix after being guilty of a capital offense and condemned to death. 

|לֹא־תָלִ֨ין נִבְלָת֜וֹ עַל־הָעֵ֗ץ כִּֽי־קָב֤וֹר תִּקְבְּרֶ֙נּוּ֙ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֔וּא כִּֽי־קִלְלַ֥ת אֱלֹהִ֖ים תָּל֑וּי וְלֹ֤א תְטַמֵּא֙ אֶת־אַדְמָ֣תְךָ֔ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לְךָ֖ נַחֲלָֽה׃|23|you must not let the corpse remain on the stake overnight, but must bury it the same day. For an impaled body is an affront to God: you shall not defile the land that your God יהוה is giving you to possess.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the requirement to bury the body of a hanged person immediately to prevent defilement of the land and maintain human dignity, as stated in Deuteronomy 21:22-23. The Halakhah mandates the immediate burial of executed individuals to uphold respect for the deceased, with the prohibition against leaving a corpse hanging overnight applying to both Jews and non-Jews. The Mishnah describes the process of hanging a person after execution, emphasizing the importance of burying the body the same day to avoid desecrating the name of Heaven. The Talmud explores the sanctity of burial and the duty to honor the dead promptly, highlighting the significance of avoiding desecration of God's name.

## Deuteronomy 22

|לֹֽא־תִרְאֶה֩ אֶת־שׁ֨וֹר אָחִ֜יךָ א֤וֹ אֶת־שֵׂיוֹ֙ נִדָּחִ֔ים וְהִתְעַלַּמְתָּ֖ מֵהֶ֑ם הָשֵׁ֥ב תְּשִׁיבֵ֖ם לְאָחִֽיךָ׃|1|If you see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep gone astray, do not ignore it; you must take it back to your peer.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of returning lost items to their owners, emphasizing personal repentance and interconnectedness within the Jewish community. It highlights the obligation to help restore lost holiness in others and the spiritual lessons that can be learned from returning lost property. The commandment to return lost items extends to various scenarios, including animals, garments, and vessels, with exemptions based on circumstances and the nature of the finder and the item found. This obligation reflects the values of mercy, kindness, and social responsibility among the Jewish people, emphasizing the importance of justice and the ultimate restoration of lost property to their original owners. 

|וְאִם־לֹ֨א קָר֥וֹב אָחִ֛יךָ אֵלֶ֖יךָ וְלֹ֣א יְדַעְתּ֑וֹ וַאֲסַפְתּוֹ֙ אֶל־תּ֣וֹךְ בֵּיתֶ֔ךָ וְהָיָ֣ה עִמְּךָ֗ עַ֣ד דְּרֹ֤שׁ אָחִ֙יךָ֙ אֹת֔וֹ וַהֲשֵׁבֹת֖וֹ לֽוֹ׃|2|If your fellow Israelite does not live near you or you do not know who [the owner] is, you shall bring it home and it shall remain with you until your peer claims it; then you shall give it back.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of seeking a sage to reclaim lost items, contingent on the person's honesty. Commentary discusses the obligation to return lost items only when the owner seeks them, with measures to prevent fraudulent claims. Halakhah focuses on identifying lost objects and providing medical care, while Mishnah highlights the importance of returning lost animals. The Talmud addresses the obligation to save lives and return lost items based on identifying marks, with a need to scrutinize claimants. Midrash emphasizes the importance of rain and returning lost items even to unknown individuals, while Targum stresses the duty to keep lost items until the owner claims them. 

|וְכֵ֧ן תַּעֲשֶׂ֣ה לַחֲמֹר֗וֹ וְכֵ֣ן תַּעֲשֶׂה֮ לְשִׂמְלָתוֹ֒ וְכֵ֣ן תַּעֲשֶׂ֗ה לְכׇל־אֲבֵדַ֥ת אָחִ֛יךָ אֲשֶׁר־תֹּאבַ֥ד מִמֶּ֖נּוּ וּמְצָאתָ֑הּ לֹ֥א תוּכַ֖ל לְהִתְעַלֵּֽם׃|3|You shall do the same with that person’s ass; you shall do the same with that person’s garment; and so too shall you do with anything that your fellow Israelite loses and you find: you must not remain indifferent.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The concept of returning lost items to their rightful owners is emphasized in various Jewish texts, including the Torah, Mishnah, and Talmud, with obligations detailed for different scenarios and items. Failure to return lost items is considered a serious offense, with consequences such as reincarnation and impeding the arrival of Redemption. The importance of maintaining social capital and trust within a society is highlighted, with the duty to return lost items contributing to a good neighborhood and society. 

|לֹא־תִרְאֶה֩ אֶת־חֲמ֨וֹר אָחִ֜יךָ א֤וֹ שׁוֹרוֹ֙ נֹפְלִ֣ים בַּדֶּ֔רֶךְ וְהִתְעַלַּמְתָּ֖ מֵהֶ֑ם הָקֵ֥ם תָּקִ֖ים עִמּֽוֹ׃|4|If you see your fellow Israelite’s ass or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it; you must raise it together.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes developing empathy and strength to help others, while the duty of loading refers to reloading fallen burdens (Rashi), assisting a brother in need maintains brotherhood among Jews (Tur HaArokh), and the Torah commands helping unload and reload burdens from animals (Ibn Ezra, Ramban). The Torah underscores compassion and assistance towards others, regardless of distinctions, and emphasizes moderation in all aspects of life. The commandment to help a fellow Jew with a fallen animal includes both loading and unloading, with unloading being the primary focus (Midrash). It is forbidden to cause pain to living creatures and one must display empathy towards others, even enemies, by helping them in times of need (Musar). The Talmud discusses differing opinions on the Torah obligation to help load animals, with Rabbi Simeon ben Ioḥai asserting such an obligation, and addresses the concept of being remunerated for helping load animals (Talmud). Additionally, in Exodus 23:5, it is instructed to help lift the burden of your enemy's struggling donkey (Tanakh). The Targum commentaries on Deuteronomy 22:4 all stress the importance of assisting one's brother in need (Targum). 

|לֹא־יִהְיֶ֤ה כְלִי־גֶ֙בֶר֙ עַל־אִשָּׁ֔ה וְלֹא־יִלְבַּ֥שׁ גֶּ֖בֶר שִׂמְלַ֣ת אִשָּׁ֑ה כִּ֧י תוֹעֲבַ֛ת יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ כׇּל־עֹ֥שֵׂה אֵֽלֶּה׃|5|A woman must not put on man’s apparel, nor shall a man wear woman’s clothing; for whoever does these things is abhorrent to your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against women wearing men's clothing and vice versa in Deuteronomy 22:5 is aimed at preventing immorality and illicit sexual relations, with the prohibition extending to articles, ornaments, and accessories associated with the opposite gender, including cosmetic procedures. The prohibition serves to maintain divisions between men and women, prevent opportunities for marital infidelity, and maintain modesty. The Talmud discusses the prohibition of men removing hair for beautification purposes and addresses divorce and remarriage, while the Targum commentary emphasizes that wearing clothing or adornments of the opposite gender is considered an abomination before God. 

|כִּ֣י יִקָּרֵ֣א קַן־צִפּ֣וֹר ׀ לְפָנֶ֡יךָ בַּדֶּ֜רֶךְ בְּכׇל־עֵ֣ץ ׀ א֣וֹ עַל־הָאָ֗רֶץ אֶפְרֹחִים֙ א֣וֹ בֵיצִ֔ים וְהָאֵ֤ם רֹבֶ֙צֶת֙ עַל־הָֽאֶפְרֹחִ֔ים א֖וֹ עַל־הַבֵּיצִ֑ים לֹא־תִקַּ֥ח הָאֵ֖ם עַל־הַבָּנִֽים׃|6|If, along the road, you chance upon a bird’s nest, in any tree or on the ground, with fledglings or eggs and the mother sitting over the fledglings or on the eggs, do not take the mother together with her young.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment in Deuteronomy 22:6 prohibits taking a mother bird with its young to prevent cruelty and promote compassion towards animals, emphasizing the importance of respecting all living creatures. Various interpretations of this law emphasize the significance of maintaining spiritual balance and connection with the divine, as well as the importance of developing good character traits to avoid insensitivity and cruelty. The legislation aims to guide individuals towards righteousness and prevent the internalization of cruelty as a character trait, with the underlying purpose of promoting compassion towards all living beings. 

|שַׁלֵּ֤חַ תְּשַׁלַּח֙ אֶת־הָאֵ֔ם וְאֶת־הַבָּנִ֖ים תִּֽקַּֽח־לָ֑ךְ לְמַ֙עַן֙ יִ֣יטַב לָ֔ךְ וְהַאֲרַכְתָּ֖ יָמִֽים׃|7|Let the mother go, and take only the young, in order that you may fare well and have a long life.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text from Chasidut emphasizes the importance of following Torah principles and balancing worldly benefits with spiritual cleanliness, particularly through mitzvot like sending away the mother bird. Various commentaries discuss the compassion and rewards associated with this commandment, highlighting the significance of showing concern for all living beings. The Mishnah and Talmud delve into the details of this mitzvah, with Rabbi Judah and the Sages differing on the punishment for transgressions. The Mishnah also connects this commandment to others, emphasizing understanding the rewards for each mitzvah and the importance of belief in the resurrection of the dead. Additionally, the text explores the symbolism and significance of fulfilling commandments in Jewish thought, Kabbalah, liturgy, and Musar, showcasing the profound impact of individual actions on the community and the spiritual pleasures of the World to Come. 

|כִּ֤י תִבְנֶה֙ בַּ֣יִת חָדָ֔שׁ וְעָשִׂ֥יתָ מַעֲקֶ֖ה לְגַגֶּ֑ךָ וְלֹֽא־תָשִׂ֤ים דָּמִים֙ בְּבֵיתֶ֔ךָ כִּֽי־יִפֹּ֥ל הַנֹּפֵ֖ל מִמֶּֽנּוּ׃|8|When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof, so that you do not bring bloodguilt on your house if anyone should fall from it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah commands building a protective railing around a new house's roof as a reminder of gratitude towards God, emphasizing the importance of charity and good deeds over material wealth. Failing to do so violates both a positive and negative commandment, with the obligation extending to maintaining a safe environment beyond just the roof. The commandments apply to every aspect of man's life, guiding him in all matters, while righteous individuals are urged to strive for love, awe, fear, and humility in their relationship with God. Men are obligated to perform all mitzvot of a father with regard to his son, while women are exempt, and both must perform positive mitzvot that are not time-bound. The duty to avoid exposing oneself and others to danger, such as through negligence in safeguarding a house, is discussed based on the command to put a parapet around the roof in Deuteronomy 22:8. 

|לֹא־תִזְרַ֥ע כַּרְמְךָ֖ כִּלְאָ֑יִם פֶּן־תִּקְדַּ֗שׁ הַֽמְלֵאָ֤ה הַזֶּ֙רַע֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּזְרָ֔ע וּתְבוּאַ֖ת הַכָּֽרֶם׃|9|You shall not sow your vineyard with a second kind of seed, else the crop—from the seed you have sown—and the yield of the vineyard may not be used.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the souls of all nations, unclean animals, forbidden foods, and actions prohibited by Jewish law come from the same spiritual source. The prohibition of sowing vineyards with mixed seeds includes mixing wheat and barley with grape seeds, is based on the sanctity of the land, and reflects the importance of abiding by God's laws. The prohibition not to eat mixed species planted in a vineyard is derived from Deuteronomy 22:9, and mixing species in a vineyard is more severe than in a field. The purpose of God's commandments is debated among theologians, with some believing they serve a specific aim while others see them as ordinances with unknown purposes. The Midrash discusses various mitzvot and their significance, emphasizing the importance of performing these commandments and their link to blessings and curses. The Talmud delves into the prohibition of sowing diverse kinds in a vineyard, outlining specific requirements and consequences, while Leviticus 19:19 commands following God's laws, including not allowing cattle to mate with different kinds and not sowing fields with two types of seed. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also prohibit planting mixed species in vineyards to avoid impurity and the obligation to burn the mixed seed and produce. 

|לֹֽא־תַחֲרֹ֥שׁ בְּשׁוֹר־וּבַחֲמֹ֖ר יַחְדָּֽו׃|10|You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of fulfilling commandments before enjoying the fruits of labor, with Balak fearing the influence of successful Israelite converts on his people. Halakhah prohibits working with different species of animals together to prevent cruelty, reflecting a concern for animal welfare. Kabbalistic texts discuss the symbolism of the ox and donkey as representing demons that should not be joined together to prevent harm. Mishnah details various scenarios where multiple sets of lashes can be received for plowing in prohibited ways, including during the Sabbatical Year and on a Festival. Tanakh and Targum agree that plowing with animals of different species is forbidden due to the cruelty it imposes on the animals. 

|לֹ֤א תִלְבַּשׁ֙ שַֽׁעַטְנֵ֔ז צֶ֥מֶר וּפִשְׁתִּ֖ים יַחְדָּֽו׃|11|You shall not wear cloth combining wool and linen.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition of wearing sha'atnez applies to clothing made of wool and linen but not to non-clothing items, with the positive commandment of tzitzit requiring fringes on garments. Mishnah details the liability for wearing forbidden garments and multiple sets of lashes for certain actions. The Midrash emphasizes the importance of following commandments related to clothing to remind oneself of all commandments, while Musar discusses exceptions to laws such as wearing mixed fabrics in certain circumstances. The Talmud explores the prohibition of wearing diverse fibers and the obligation of ritual fringes, with different interpretations provided by rabbis. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Deuteronomy 22:11 as a prohibition against wearing garments of mixed wool and linen fibers. 

|גְּדִלִ֖ים תַּעֲשֶׂה־לָּ֑ךְ עַל־אַרְבַּ֛ע כַּנְפ֥וֹת כְּסוּתְךָ֖ אֲשֶׁ֥ר תְּכַסֶּה־בָּֽהּ׃|12|You shall make tassels on the four corners of the garment with which you cover yourself.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The biblical commandment prohibits wearing garments made of wool and linen together and requires wearing fringes on the four corners of clothing, with specific rules regarding materials, twisting, and number of strings. Tzitzit serve as a reminder of divine commandments, exempting wearers from the prohibition of mixing fabrics, and are associated with priesthood and holiness. The Talmud discusses the obligations of priests, exemptions for certain garments, and the use of diverse materials in ritual fringes, while the Tanakh emphasizes the significance of fringes as a reminder of God's commandments and liberation from Egypt. 

|כִּֽי־יִקַּ֥ח אִ֖ישׁ אִשָּׁ֑ה וּבָ֥א אֵלֶ֖יהָ וּשְׂנֵאָֽהּ׃|13|A householder  takes a woman [as his wife] and cohabits with her. Then he takes an aversion to her|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the consequences of a man marrying a wife and later claiming she was not a virgin, emphasizing the importance of avoiding forbidden relationships and maintaining the sanctity of marriage to ensure the presence of the Divine. The concept of virginity in relation to marriage and adultery is explored, highlighting the sanctity of marriage and the importance of maintaining purity and loyalty. The Halakhah states that sexual relations within marriage must be conducted in the presence of witnesses to make the woman a wife, and divorce can only take place through a formal document. In Jewish law, the principle of marriage is based on the husband acquiring the wife's services, with the ability to divorce being solely in the hands of the husband. The importance of sanctifying marriage through the husband's behavior during sexual intercourse is discussed, symbolizing the union between different emanations and ultimately the union between the concept of Israel and God. 

|וְשָׂ֥ם לָהּ֙ עֲלִילֹ֣ת דְּבָרִ֔ים וְהוֹצִ֥א עָלֶ֖יהָ שֵׁ֣ם רָ֑ע וְאָמַ֗ר אֶת־הָאִשָּׁ֤ה הַזֹּאת֙ לָקַ֔חְתִּי וָאֶקְרַ֣ב אֵלֶ֔יהָ וְלֹא־מָצָ֥אתִי לָ֖הּ בְּתוּלִֽים׃|14|and makes up charges against her and defames her, saying, “This is the party I took [to wife]; but when I approached her, I found that she was not a virgin.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 22:14 emphasizes the importance of presenting accusations in the presence of the opposing party, the requirement of two witnesses for an accusation, and the consequences of falsely accusing a woman of not being a virgin. In the Midrash, Moses receives God's attributes of compassion and grace, while the Talmud discusses the penalties for falsely accusing a wife of not being a virgin and the involvement of false witnesses. Additionally, Leviticus 19:17 commands not to hate one's kinsfolk but to reprove them without incurring guilt, and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 22:14 discusses a situation where a man falsely accuses a woman of not being a virgin. 

|וְלָקַ֛ח אֲבִ֥י הַֽנַּעֲרָ֖ וְאִמָּ֑הּ וְהוֹצִ֜יאוּ אֶת־בְּתוּלֵ֧י הַֽנַּעֲרָ֛ אֶל־זִקְנֵ֥י הָעִ֖יר הַשָּֽׁעְרָה׃|15|In such a case, the girl’s father and mother shall produce the evidence of the girl’s virginity before the elders of the town at the gate.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In cases of false slander against a Jewish maiden, the slanderer faces punishment by lashing and must pay the girl's father 100 sela'im of pure silver, unless the girl is below the age of majority or a bogeret. If a husband and wife cannot live in peace, the husband can issue a divorce document to prevent misunderstandings. Moses required a payment of fifty shekels of silver from those who worshipped the golden calf, based on laws concerning a violated woman. The Mishnah discusses cases where a virgin's vows are upheld and cannot be annulled, including if she is married as a minor and later becomes a widow or divorced, if she becomes an orphan, or if she reaches adulthood. In cases of rape of young women of flawed lineage, the Gemara questions the liability to pay a fine, citing verses from Deuteronomy to determine eligibility for payment. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain that the girl's parents must present evidence of her virginity before the city judges in the court or the door of the beth din. 

|וְאָמַ֛ר אֲבִ֥י הַֽנַּעֲרָ֖ אֶל־הַזְּקֵנִ֑ים אֶת־בִּתִּ֗י נָתַ֜תִּי לָאִ֥ישׁ הַזֶּ֛ה לְאִשָּׁ֖ה וַיִּשְׂנָאֶֽהָ׃|16|And the girl’s father shall say to the elders, “To this party I gave my own daughter to wife, but he has taken an aversion to her;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The father has the right to consecrate his daughter without her knowledge, making her forbidden to marry others until she becomes a bogeret, and his word is accepted in court regarding her consecration and marriage. The Mishnah and Talmud discuss the father's authority to betroth his daughter, while the Targum emphasizes the father's role in informing judges of his daughter's marriage. 

|וְהִנֵּה־ה֡וּא שָׂם֩ עֲלִילֹ֨ת דְּבָרִ֜ים לֵאמֹ֗ר לֹֽא־מָצָ֤אתִי לְבִתְּךָ֙ בְּתוּלִ֔ים וְאֵ֖לֶּה בְּתוּלֵ֣י בִתִּ֑י וּפָֽרְשׂוּ֙ הַשִּׂמְלָ֔ה לִפְנֵ֖י זִקְנֵ֥י הָעִֽיר׃|17|so he has made up charges, saying, ‘I did not find your daughter a virgin.’ But here is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity!” And they shall spread out the cloth before the elders of the town.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The spreading of the cloth in Deuteronomy 22:17 is interpreted figuratively by Rashi, literally by Nachmanides, and Rabbeinu Bahya, with the purpose of proving the daughter's virginity before the elders of the city, as explained in Steinsaltz's commentary. Mishneh Torah details laws regarding a husband's claim of a bride's adultery after consecration, while the Kabbalah likens the Torah to virginity and warns against speaking ill of its authenticity. In the Midrash, spreading a garment before the elders signifies the need for clarity, and the Talmud discusses cases of husbands accusing wives of not being virgins. The Targum states that evidence of a woman's virginity must be presented before city judges. 

|וְלָ֥קְח֛וּ זִקְנֵ֥י הָֽעִיר־הַהִ֖וא אֶת־הָאִ֑ישׁ וְיִסְּר֖וּ אֹתֽוֹ׃|18|The elders of that town shall then take that party and flog him,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The punishment of flogging for a man who falsely accuses his wife of adultery is discussed in Jewish law, with references to lashing, financial restitution, and the importance of respecting one's wife in marriage. The Mishneh Torah states that a person who slanders a Jewish maiden should be punished by lashing and financial restitution, while the Shulchan Arukh details laws surrounding flogging as a form of punishment. In the Talmud, lashes are administered to a stubborn son and those who commit transgressions punishable with lashes and monetary payment, with additional discussions on payment for eating heave and the father's interest in his daughter's money. The judges and sages are responsible for carrying out the punishment of flogging for the man's wrongdoing. 

|וְעָנְשׁ֨וּ אֹת֜וֹ מֵ֣אָה כֶ֗סֶף וְנָתְנוּ֙ לַאֲבִ֣י הַֽנַּעֲרָ֔ה כִּ֤י הוֹצִיא֙ שֵׁ֣ם רָ֔ע עַ֖ל בְּתוּלַ֣ת יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְלֽוֹ־תִהְיֶ֣ה לְאִשָּׁ֔ה לֹא־יוּכַ֥ל לְשַׁלְּחָ֖הּ כׇּל־יָמָֽיו׃|19|and they shall fine him a hundred [shekels of] silver and give it to the girl’s father; for [that householder] has defamed a virgin in Israel. Moreover, she shall remain his wife; he shall never have the right to divorce her.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the struggle between the divine and natural souls, urging for the divine soul to rule over the mundane desires. The punishment for falsely accusing a bride includes a fine and being unable to divorce her. The consequences for a man who falsely accuses his wife of not being a virgin on their wedding night include fines, chastisement, and being married to her for life. The Halakhah states that a man who slanders his wife is forbidden to divorce her and must remain married to her for his entire life. The Talmud explores various laws related to marriage, rape, and defamation, including the obligation for a rapist to marry his victim and distinctions in punishments for different offenses. 

|וְאִם־אֱמֶ֣ת הָיָ֔ה הַדָּבָ֖ר הַזֶּ֑ה לֹא־נִמְצְא֥וּ בְתוּלִ֖ים לַֽנַּעֲרָֽ׃|20|But if the charge proves true, the girl was found not to have been a virgin,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Jewish law, witnesses and legal warning are required to prove accusations of adultery against a bride, ensuring the punishment is justified (Deuteronomy 22:20:1, Siftei Chakhamim). In cases of a husband accusing his wife of adultery, witnesses play a crucial role in determining guilt, with penalties for false testimony (Halakhah). The written Torah is represented by two arms, symbolized by the two tablets given to Moses, with Zayin shape representing virginity-signs by mouth (oral Torah) (Kabbalah). The Midrash distinguishes between natural and unnatural coitus in relation to prohibitions (Midrash). In Musar, the term נערה is often used for girls, linked to the significance of נער in Pardes Rimonim. Rebbi Jehudah ben Pazi discusses the consequences of a definitively married woman entering different rooms before consummating the marriage in the Talmud, while the Gemara in Arakhin 15a:7 discusses the severity of defamation compared to actions. In Targum, if the accusation of adultery is proven true without witnesses to the girl's virginity, she may face stoning. 

|וְהוֹצִ֨יאוּ אֶת־הַֽנַּעֲרָ֜ אֶל־פֶּ֣תַח בֵּית־אָבִ֗יהָ וּסְקָל֩וּהָ֩ אַנְשֵׁ֨י עִירָ֤הּ בָּאֲבָנִים֙ וָמֵ֔תָה כִּֽי־עָשְׂתָ֤ה נְבָלָה֙ בְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לִזְנ֖וֹת בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑יהָ וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֥ הָרָ֖ע מִקִּרְבֶּֽךָ׃|21|then the girl shall be brought out to the entrance of her father’s house, and her town’s council  shall stone her to death; for she did a shameful thing in Israel, committing fornication while under her father’s authority. Thus you will sweep away evil from your midst.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries and texts discuss the punishment of stoning for adultery, detailing different aspects such as the location of the stoning, signs of virginity, the impact on family and society, and the public nature of the punishment to deter future transgressions. The Mishnah explains different punishments for adultery based on circumstances, including the distinction between a woman who converts before or after giving birth. The Talmud and Targum analyze specific linguistic and legal aspects related to adultery and punishment, emphasizing the severity of the consequences for such actions. 

|כִּֽי־יִמָּצֵ֨א אִ֜ישׁ שֹׁכֵ֣ב ׀ עִם־אִשָּׁ֣ה בְעֻֽלַת־בַּ֗עַל וּמֵ֙תוּ֙ גַּם־שְׁנֵיהֶ֔ם הָאִ֛ישׁ הַשֹּׁכֵ֥ב עִם־הָאִשָּׁ֖ה וְהָאִשָּׁ֑ה וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֥ הָרָ֖ע מִיִּשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|22|If a man is found lying with another man’s wife, both of them—the man and the woman with whom he lay—shall die. Thus you will sweep away evil from Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries on Deuteronomy 22:22 discuss the meaning of "gam shneihem" in cases of adultery, with interpretations including the offspring of the adulterers, those who commit adultery with the pair after them, unnatural sexual acts, or minors involved. Chukkim emphasize respect for all beings as God's possessions, with individuals called to fulfill the holy purpose of the human race. The Sifrei Devarim discusses liability for the death penalty in cases of a man found with a betrothed woman, while the Mishnah and Magen Avraham detail punishments for sins like rape and defamation. The Talmud addresses betrothal through sexual intercourse, punishment for adultery, and various scenarios related to sexual relations and marriage. Tanakh verses prohibit murder, adultery, and false witness, while Targum interpretations call for death for both parties in adultery cases. 

|כִּ֤י יִהְיֶה֙ נַעֲרָ֣ בְתוּלָ֔ה מְאֹרָשָׂ֖ה לְאִ֑ישׁ וּמְצָאָ֥הּ אִ֛ישׁ בָּעִ֖יר וְשָׁכַ֥ב עִמָּֽהּ׃|23|In the case of a virgin who is engaged to someone  —if another man comes upon her in town and lies with her,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 22:23-27 discusses the scenario of witnesses seeing a man and a maiden in the city, with different interpretations on the woman's guilt based on her location. Halakhah details the laws regarding consuming a limb cut off from a living animal, the punishment for a consecrated maiden committing adultery, and the consequences of false accusations of adultery. Kabbalah mentions the erasure of the male if male and female are not together. Midrash explains the conditions for a man to be liable to stoning. Musar discusses the Jewish servant maid leaving her employ under certain circumstances. Quoting commentary includes explanations on the creation of luminaries, the consequences of falsely accusing a wife, and the order of Festivals. Talmud provides explanations on the punishment of stoning for certain scenarios involving young women. Targum discusses the scenario of a virgin girl being encountered by another man in the city. 

|וְהוֹצֵאתֶ֨ם אֶת־שְׁנֵיהֶ֜ם אֶל־שַׁ֣עַר ׀ הָעִ֣יר הַהִ֗וא וּסְקַלְתֶּ֨ם אֹתָ֥ם בָּאֲבָנִים֮ וָמֵ֒תוּ֒ אֶת־הַֽנַּעֲרָ֗ עַל־דְּבַר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־צָעֲקָ֣ה בָעִ֔יר וְאֶ֨ת־הָאִ֔ישׁ עַל־דְּבַ֥ר אֲשֶׁר־עִנָּ֖ה אֶת־אֵ֣שֶׁת רֵעֵ֑הוּ וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֥ הָרָ֖ע מִקִּרְבֶּֽךָ׃|24|you shall take the two of them out to the gate of that town and stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry for help in the town, and the man because he violated his neighbor’s wife. Thus you will sweep away evil from your midst.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various texts and commentaries explore the concept of calling out for help, consent during assault, and the punishment of stoning for transgressions such as adultery or idolatry. Laws and commandments are discussed in relation to historical events, ethical principles, and spiritual connection with God. The Mishnah addresses the nullification of vows by a yavam, while the Talmud examines prior warning before punishment, methods of execution, and reasons for a solar eclipse. The Tanakh discusses the annulment of vows for a betrothed woman, while the Targums emphasize the importance of eliminating evil from the community through punishment. 

|וְֽאִם־בַּשָּׂדֶ֞ה יִמְצָ֣א הָאִ֗ישׁ אֶת־הַֽנַּעֲרָ֙ הַמְאֹ֣רָשָׂ֔ה וְהֶחֱזִֽיק־בָּ֥הּ הָאִ֖ישׁ וְשָׁכַ֣ב עִמָּ֑הּ וּמֵ֗ת הָאִ֛ישׁ אֲשֶׁר־שָׁכַ֥ב עִמָּ֖הּ לְבַדּֽוֹ׃|25|But if the man comes upon the engaged girl in the open country, and the man lies with her by force, only the party who lay with her shall die,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah distinguishes between rape in a city and rape in a field, with different considerations for each scenario, including the presence of witnesses and the victim's ability to cry out for help. Betrothal creates a connection and mutual obligation between a couple, but a full marriage requires a wedding ceremony. The Midrash connects Esau's transgressions to the downfall of his family and the destruction of God's house. Radak explains the term ויעניה in Genesis 34:2 as implying a gentle seduction rather than violent rape. The Talmud discusses punishments for rape, false accusations, and intercourse with betrothed individuals, with differing opinions on the age of the victim. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that only the man who violates a married woman in the field should be punished with death. 

|וְלַֽנַּעֲרָ֙ לֹא־תַעֲשֶׂ֣ה דָבָ֔ר אֵ֥ין לַֽנַּעֲרָ֖ חֵ֣טְא מָ֑וֶת כִּ֡י כַּאֲשֶׁר֩ יָק֨וּם אִ֤ישׁ עַל־רֵעֵ֙הוּ֙ וּרְצָח֣וֹ נֶ֔פֶשׁ כֵּ֖ן הַדָּבָ֥ר הַזֶּֽה׃|26|but you shall do nothing to the girl. The girl did not incur the death penalty, for this case is like that of one party attacking and murdering another.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah and Halakhah emphasize the innocence of a woman who is raped, likening her to a murder victim and permitting any means necessary to save her, even if it involves killing the perpetrator. Various commentaries and texts discuss the exemption from punishment for those forced to sin, the duty to prefer death over committing certain crimes, and the obligation to save those in danger, as derived from verses in Deuteronomy. The Talmud further elaborates on the principle of choosing death over forbidden acts, even in cases of coercion. 

|כִּ֥י בַשָּׂדֶ֖ה מְצָאָ֑הּ צָעֲקָ֗ה הַֽנַּעֲרָ֙ הַמְאֹ֣רָשָׂ֔ה וְאֵ֥ין מוֹשִׁ֖יעַ לָֽהּ׃|27|He came upon her in the open; though the engaged girl cried for help, there was no one to save her.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes prioritizing not harming others over hearing Kedushah and Barchu, with the chazzan able to fulfill obligations for those under duress, similar to fulfilling obligations in the fields. Commentary on Deuteronomy 22:27 stresses aiding those in need, even with extreme measures. Halakhah discusses the obligation to prevent harm, including the possibility of killing a pursuer to save a victim. Mishnah details when individuals pursuing certain sins may be killed to prevent transgressions. Talmud delves into the circumstances regarding a raped woman's status, with distinctions for different situations. 

|כִּֽי־יִמְצָ֣א אִ֗ישׁ נַעֲרָ֤ בְתוּלָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־אֹרָ֔שָׂה וּתְפָשָׂ֖הּ וְשָׁכַ֣ב עִמָּ֑הּ וְנִמְצָֽאוּ׃|28|If a man comes upon a virgin who is not engaged and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Deuteronomy 22:28 addresses rape of a young virgin who is not betrothed as adultery, with differing laws for seduction. The Babylonian Talmud states that a man who seduces such a woman must pay her father and marry her, while Mishneh Torah specifies fines for rapists based on the age of the victim. Midrash discusses interpretations of the law, while Mishnah outlines penalties for seducers and rapists. Ramban explains seduction as winning over someone by falsehood, with different penalties for seducers and rapists. The Talmud and Jerusalem Talmud debate who receives fines for raping young women, and Targum translations describe the act in Deuteronomy 22:28. 

|וְ֠נָתַ֠ן הָאִ֨ישׁ הַשֹּׁכֵ֥ב עִמָּ֛הּ לַאֲבִ֥י הַֽנַּעֲרָ֖ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים כָּ֑סֶף וְלֽוֹ־תִהְיֶ֣ה לְאִשָּׁ֗ה תַּ֚חַת אֲשֶׁ֣ר עִנָּ֔הּ לֹא־יוּכַ֥ל שַׁלְּחָ֖הּ כׇּל־יָמָֽיו׃|29|the party who lay with her shall pay the girl’s father fifty [shekels of] silver, and she shall be his wife. Because he has violated her, he can never have the right to divorce her.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the Biblical law that if a man seduces a virgin and is discovered, he must pay a fine to the girl's father and marry her, with no option for divorce. This law is found in Deuteronomy 22:28-29. The Mishnah outlines the penalties and fines for rape and seduction, including a 50-shekel fine for the rapist or seducer, additional payments for shame and injury, and the requirement for the rapist to marry the victim and pay compensatory damages. The Talmud discusses various laws related to rape and seduction, citing specific verses from Deuteronomy 22:29 to support these laws, such as the requirement for a rapist to pay fifty shekels of silver and marry the victim, as well as the need for additional compensation for humiliation and degradation beyond the fine.

## Deuteronomy 23

|לֹא־יִקַּ֥ח אִ֖ישׁ אֶת־אֵ֣שֶׁת אָבִ֑יו וְלֹ֥א יְגַלֶּ֖ה כְּנַ֥ף אָבִֽיו׃|1|No householder  shall take his father’s former wife [as his own wife], so as to remove his father’s garment.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that a man cannot legally marry his father's wife, Ibn Ezra clarifies this refers to a woman his father raped, Rashbam notes the offspring would be a mamzer, and Chizkuni emphasizes this law applies to avoid mamzerim. Halakhah prohibits a eunuch from marrying a Jewish woman, Ibn Ganaḥ interprets "kenaf" as "concealing," while Kabbalah warns against uncovering one's father's skirt. The Midrash discusses marrying a ravished wife of one's father, Mishnah details lineage following the father, and Second Temple texts expel eunuchs and polytheists. The Talmud delves into marriage prohibitions, Tanakh forbids uncovering family members' nakedness, and Targum warns against marrying a woman violated by one's father. 

|לֹֽא־יָבֹ֧א פְצֽוּעַ־דַּכָּ֛א וּכְר֥וּת שׇׁפְכָ֖ה בִּקְהַ֥ל יְהֹוָֽה׃|2|No man whose testes are crushed or whose member is cut off shall be admitted into the congregation  of יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries, Halakhic rulings, Jewish thought, Midrashim, Mishnah discussions, Musar teachings, and Talmudic interpretations explore the implications of Deuteronomy 23:2, which prohibits certain individuals with genital injuries from marrying Jewish women. The law applies to those with maimed testicles, severed members, and other reproductive system impairments, with exceptions for marrying converts or freed slaves. The prohibition aims to maintain the sanctity of the Jewish community by excluding those unable to fulfill the procreative purpose of marriage, as outlined in the Torah and elaborated upon in subsequent Jewish texts. 

|לֹא־יָבֹ֥א מַמְזֵ֖ר בִּקְהַ֣ל יְהֹוָ֑ה גַּ֚ם דּ֣וֹר עֲשִׂירִ֔י לֹא־יָ֥בֹא ל֖וֹ בִּקְהַ֥ל יְהֹוָֽה׃|3|No one misbegotten  shall be admitted into the congregation of יהוה; no descendant of such, even in the tenth generation, shall be admitted into the congregation of יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

A mamzer, born from forbidden relationships, is excluded from marrying an Israelite but can marry a convert. The prohibition against mamzerim entering the assembly of the Lord extends for generations. Specific laws in the Mishnah address the criteria for mamzer status and other forbidden relationships, with rabbis differing on the permissibility of certain marriages. The Torah emphasizes the importance of maintaining purity within the community to ensure divine protection. Additionally, the Talmud discusses the lineage of mamzerim and their marriage eligibility, with varying opinions on their status. 

|לֹֽא־יָבֹ֧א עַמּוֹנִ֛י וּמוֹאָבִ֖י בִּקְהַ֣ל יְהֹוָ֑ה גַּ֚ם דּ֣וֹר עֲשִׂירִ֔י לֹא־יָבֹ֥א לָהֶ֛ם בִּקְהַ֥ל יְהֹוָ֖ה עַד־עוֹלָֽם׃|4|No Ammonite or Moabite  shall be admitted into the congregation of יהוה; no descendants of such, even in the tenth generation, shall ever be admitted into the congregation of יהוה,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The fear of the Moabites towards the Israelites in Numbers led to concerns about potential conversion to Judaism. The Torah prohibits Ammonites and Moabites from joining the congregation of the Lord due to past actions, with male Ammonites and Moabites forbidden from marrying Israelite women forever, while female members are allowed to convert and marry Israelite men. Maimonides grouped prohibitions together to reach the required number of negative commandments, despite objections. The Talmud discusses disqualifications for entering the assembly of the Lord, including Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, Idumeans, and others. Ruth's marriage to Boaz highlights changes in the law regarding Moabite women marrying Israelites. 

|עַל־דְּבַ֞ר אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹא־קִדְּמ֤וּ אֶתְכֶם֙ בַּלֶּ֣חֶם וּבַמַּ֔יִם בַּדֶּ֖רֶךְ בְּצֵאתְכֶ֣ם מִמִּצְרָ֑יִם וַאֲשֶׁר֩ שָׂכַ֨ר עָלֶ֜יךָ אֶת־בִּלְעָ֣ם בֶּן־בְּע֗וֹר מִפְּת֛וֹר אֲרַ֥ם נַהֲרַ֖יִם לְקַֽלְלֶֽךָּ׃|5|because they did not meet you with food and water on your journey after you left Egypt, and because they hired Balaam son of Beor, from Pethor of Aram-naharaim, to curse you.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The nations of Ammon and Moab are forbidden from marrying into Bnei Yisrael due to their lack of connection and attempts to harm Bnei Yisrael, as seen in their failure to greet with bread and water and hiring Bilam to curse. Hashem's protection of Bnei Yisrael from Bilam's curse resulted in a blessing for them and a curse rebounding onto Ammon and Moab. The exclusion only applies to the males of these nations, as it is customary for men to offer food and water, while women are busy in their homes. Ammonite and Moabite converts are permanently prohibited from entering the congregation and marrying Jewish women, while their female counterparts are permitted immediately. Lot's descendants were compared to Sodom and Gomorrah, facing destruction for their actions. The Talmud discusses the prohibition for Ammonite or Moabite men to enter the congregation but not women, with Rabbi Yehuda deriving the halakha from the masculine form of the terms, while Rabbi Shimon focuses on the reason for the prohibition. 

|וְלֹֽא־אָבָ֞ה יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ לִשְׁמֹ֣עַ אֶל־בִּלְעָ֔ם וַיַּהֲפֹךְ֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֧יךָ לְּךָ֛ אֶת־הַקְּלָלָ֖ה לִבְרָכָ֑ה כִּ֥י אֲהֵֽבְךָ֖ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|6|But your God יהוה refused to heed Balaam; instead, your God יהוה turned the curse into a blessing for you, for your God יהוה loves you.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of seeking the prayers of tzaddikim, contrasting haughty individuals who do not ask for them. God's love for the Israelites is shown by turning curses into blessings, as seen in the case of Balaam. The Sefer HaChinukh prohibits marriage with Ammonites and Moabites, even after conversion, while laws of mourning allow curses to be transformed into blessings through prayer. The Midrash highlights the power of speech, the consequences of cursing or blessing others, and the influence of divine intervention on bodily functions. Musar discusses how curses can be turned into blessings through repentance and G-d's love, as seen in the case of Balaam's failed curse. The Talmud and Tanakh also illustrate instances where curses were transformed into blessings by God's intervention. 

|לֹא־תִדְרֹ֥שׁ שְׁלֹמָ֖ם וְטֹבָתָ֑ם כׇּל־יָמֶ֖יךָ לְעוֹלָֽם׃|7|You shall never concern yourself with their welfare or benefit as long as you live.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse in Deuteronomy 23:7 prohibits seeking peace with the Ammonites and Moabites, allowing for war and capture of their cities. This prohibition is rooted in a broken covenant of brotherhood, with similar restrictions placed on the Egyptians and Edomites. Onkelos attempted to convert through witchcraft, seeking advice from Balaam, who warned against joining Israel. Honoring the wicked for peace is considered flattery, except in cases like Haman. Balaam warned against seeking peace with the Jewish people, and is punished in the afterlife for causing licentious behavior. The Ammonite officials questioned David's intentions, while Hanun showed some goodness in purging the land. Targum translations emphasize the prohibition of seeking peace and benefit from certain nations forever. 

|לֹֽא־תְתַעֵ֣ב אֲדֹמִ֔י כִּ֥י אָחִ֖יךָ ה֑וּא לֹא־תְתַעֵ֣ב מִצְרִ֔י כִּי־גֵ֖ר הָיִ֥יתָ בְאַרְצֽוֹ׃|8|You shall not abhor an Edomite, for such is your kin. You shall not abhor an Egyptian, for you were a stranger in that land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Deuteronomy 23:8 highlights reasons not to abhor the Edomites and Egyptians, emphasizing familial ties, acts of kindness, and gratitude. Halakhah permits third-generation descendants of Edomites and Egyptians to marry among the Jewish people, while the Talmud discusses prohibitions and exceptions for intermarriage with different nations. The Torah emphasizes the importance of treating others kindly, extending moral obligations to strangers, as seen in the commandments regarding the Edomites and Egyptians. In Kabbalah, Yitzchak's decision to give Esav blessings was to protect the Jewish people from harsh judgment by heathen nations. The Midrash stresses hospitality and kindness towards strangers, while Musar discusses the historical development of Abraham's descendants and the refinement of the Jewish people in Egypt. Ramban clarifies the lineage of Esau's descendants, while Ibn Ezra explains the concept of a "generation" in biblical contexts. Tanakh traces the lineage of Esau, known as Edom, and Targum emphasizes not despising the Edomites and Egyptians as they are considered brothers. 

|בָּנִ֛ים אֲשֶׁר־יִוָּלְד֥וּ לָהֶ֖ם דּ֣וֹר שְׁלִישִׁ֑י יָבֹ֥א לָהֶ֖ם בִּקְהַ֥ל יְהֹוָֽה׃|9|Children born to them may be admitted into the congregation of יהוה in the third generation.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against marrying Egyptians and Edomites who convert to Judaism applies to the first and second generations, with the third generation permitted to marry within the Jewish people. The Mishnah discusses various scenarios where individuals affect the eligibility of women to partake in teruma, including non-priests who commit sexual offenses or slaves who engage in intercourse. The Talmud examines lineage restrictions on proselytes from specific nations, with a focus on the third generation being allowed to enter the congregation. Additionally, the Mishnah outlines eternal prohibitions on mamzerim and Gibeonites from marrying Jewish women. 

|כִּֽי־תֵצֵ֥א מַחֲנֶ֖ה עַל־אֹיְבֶ֑יךָ וְנִ֨שְׁמַרְתָּ֔ מִכֹּ֖ל דָּבָ֥ר רָֽע׃|10|When you [men] go out as a troop against your enemies, be on your guard against anything untoward.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of protecting oneself from the evil inclination during battles, highlighting the need to devote all desires to Hashem's will and value small merits. It warns against committing sins during war to maintain purity and holiness, with specific guidelines for dealing with impurity. The prohibition against impure thoughts and actions is underscored, with a focus on avoiding evil behaviors like adultery. The sin of emitting semen in vain is discussed as damaging the Brit and associated with impurity, emphasizing the importance of studying Torah before sleeping to prevent negative thoughts. The text also touches on lineage requirements for roles within the community, highlighting the importance of purity and sanctity. 

|כִּֽי־יִהְיֶ֤ה בְךָ֙ אִ֔ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹא־יִהְיֶ֥ה טָה֖וֹר מִקְּרֵה־לָ֑יְלָה וְיָצָא֙ אֶל־מִח֣וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה לֹ֥א יָבֹ֖א אֶל־תּ֥וֹךְ הַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃|11|If anyone among you has been rendered impure by a nocturnal emission, he must leave the camp, and he must not reenter the camp.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of guarding oneself from evil when going out to war, emphasizing the need to stay away from areas of study that are not one's portion and connects impurity from a nocturnal emission to looking into words of Torah not meant for the individual. The prohibition of impure individuals from entering the camp of the Levites is outlined, paralleling the Temple Mount for all time, with various sources reiterating this commandment and addressing the implications of seminal emissions on purity and participation in religious activities. Amalek is compared to an evil serpent seeking to defile both the Temple above and the people below, and Rabbinical teachings emphasize the importance of speaking clean language and avoiding impure words. The text warns against impure thoughts leading to impurity, discusses the differentiation between impurity laws for menstruation and abnormal blood flow, and explains the prohibition of thinking sexual thoughts at night, deriving warnings from Deuteronomy 23:11. Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai discuss ritual purity in relation to the eighty-first day, interpretations of the verse in Deuteronomy 23:11 are discussed, and the need for impure individuals due to nocturnal emissions to stay outside the camp is explained. In Numbers 5:2, the Israelites are instructed to remove anyone with an eruption, discharge, or defiled by a corpse from camp, while Leviticus 15:16 details the purification process for a man with an emission of semen. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 23:11 state that a man unclean due to a nocturnal incident must leave the camp and not enter the tents. 

|וְהָיָ֥ה לִפְנֽוֹת־עֶ֖רֶב יִרְחַ֣ץ בַּמָּ֑יִם וּכְבֹ֣א הַשֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ יָבֹ֖א אֶל־תּ֥וֹךְ הַֽמַּחֲנֶֽה׃|12|Toward evening he shall bathe in water, and at sundown he may reenter the camp.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that immersion after a seminal emission should be close to sunset, while Ibn Ezra elaborates on the timing of "when evening cometh on." Halakhah states that those obligated to immerse may do so during the day, except for a nidah and a woman after childbirth, who must immerse at night. The law concerning preparing a place outside the camp aims to maintain holiness and prevent immoral behavior, emphasizing the importance of serving God and maintaining a good social order. The Talmud discusses the purification process for a zav who experiences a seminal emission, with a dispute between the first tanna and Rabbi Yosei. The Targum translations of Deuteronomy 23:12 emphasize the need to wash with water in the evening before entering the camp. 

|וְיָד֙ תִּהְיֶ֣ה לְךָ֔ מִח֖וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶ֑ה וְיָצָ֥אתָ שָּׁ֖מָּה חֽוּץ׃|13|Further, there shall be an area for you outside the camp, where you may relieve yourself.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes valuing small merits and good deeds to repair actions, performing mitzvot to counteract evil inclination, and atonement through permissible actions. Halakhah mandates setting up a designated place outside the camp for bodily needs to prevent impurity, with the Torah remaining pure despite physical filth. Musar interprets the punishment of manna as an act of mercy from God, while Second Temple uses the metaphor of a shovel to represent reason controlling passions. Talmud debates waste disposal in the camp and covering excrement outside, while Tanakh instructs removing defiled individuals from the camp. Ibn Ezra and Chizkuni interpret "large enough" as "large places," and Targum mentions the need for a designated place outside the camp for excretion. 

|וְיָתֵ֛ד תִּהְיֶ֥ה לְךָ֖ עַל־אֲזֵנֶ֑ךָ וְהָיָה֙ בְּשִׁבְתְּךָ֣ ח֔וּץ וְחָפַרְתָּ֣ה בָ֔הּ וְשַׁבְתָּ֖ וְכִסִּ֥יתָ אֶת־צֵאָתֶֽךָ׃|14|With your gear you shall have a spike, and when you have squatted you shall dig a hole with it and cover up your excrement.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Soldiers in the Jewish camp were required to have a shovel or peg to bury excrement for cleanliness and holiness, as commanded in Deuteronomy 23:14. The presence of excrement is considered unclean, and reciting sacred prayers like the Shema must not be done in its presence. Scholars see affinities between the nazarite and a warrior, highlighting special conduct for special tasks. The ideal state of assimilation was shown in the desert when the Israelites consumed manna without producing excrement. Bar Kappara suggests putting fingers in ears to avoid hearing unseemly things, emphasizing the importance of holiness in engaging with Torah and prayer. The Tosefta stresses showing respect to elders and provides guidelines for relieving oneself in different locations. 

|כִּי֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהֶ֜יךָ מִתְהַלֵּ֣ךְ ׀ בְּקֶ֣רֶב מַחֲנֶ֗ךָ לְהַצִּֽילְךָ֙ וְלָתֵ֤ת אֹיְבֶ֙יךָ֙ לְפָנֶ֔יךָ וְהָיָ֥ה מַחֲנֶ֖יךָ קָד֑וֹשׁ וְלֹֽא־יִרְאֶ֤ה בְךָ֙ עֶרְוַ֣ת דָּבָ֔ר וְשָׁ֖ב מֵאַחֲרֶֽיךָ׃|15|Since your God יהוה moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you, let your camp be holy; let [God] not find anything unseemly among you and turn away from you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes maintaining purity to ensure God's presence among the Israelites during times of war. Halakhah prohibits reciting sacred matters in impure settings and addresses conduct in intimate relations. Jewish Thought highlights divine presence among soldiers in war and the importance of upholding Torah teachings. Kabbalah focuses on the Divine quality of Kingship-Malchut in Yehudah and the holiness of the land of Israel. Musar stresses the importance of cleanliness in body and speech to maintain holiness, while the Talmud discusses Hanukkah lights, Divine Presence withdrawal due to sin, and reasons for exile. The Targum explains that God's presence in the camp protects against enemies, emphasizing the need for holiness and cleanliness. 

|לֹא־תַסְגִּ֥יר עֶ֖בֶד אֶל־אֲדֹנָ֑יו אֲשֶׁר־יִנָּצֵ֥ל אֵלֶ֖יךָ מֵעִ֥ם אֲדֹנָֽיו׃|16|You shall not turn over to the master a slave who seeks refuge with you from that master.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment not to deliver an escaped slave to his master, whether Israelite or gentile, ensures the slave's freedom and protection, reflecting a concern for human dignity and international humanitarian values. Halakhah prohibits returning a slave who fled to Eretz Yisrael to his master in the Diaspora, requiring the slave to be freed. The law concerning the first-born of man and cattle prescribes acts of mercy and protection for the poor, while the Talmud discusses the prohibition against delivering a slave to his master in cases where emancipation was intended. The legislation highlights the sanctity of the land of Israel, with the freed slave allowed to live anywhere except Jerusalem. 

|עִמְּךָ֞ יֵשֵׁ֣ב בְּקִרְבְּךָ֗ בַּמָּק֧וֹם אֲשֶׁר־יִבְחַ֛ר בְּאַחַ֥ד שְׁעָרֶ֖יךָ בַּטּ֣וֹב ל֑וֹ לֹ֖א תּוֹנֶֽנּוּ׃|17|Such individuals shall live with you in any place they may choose among the settlements in your midst, wherever they please; you must not ill-treat them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Deuteronomy 23:17 prohibits mistreating foreign residents, emphasizing fair treatment and the opportunity to earn a livelihood. The Halakhah prohibits oppressing fleeing slaves and emphasizes not wronging converts and slaves who have accepted the Torah. The Talmud discusses the conditions for gentiles to dwell in Eretz Yisrael and the treatment of Hebrew slaves and ger toshav. The Targum commentary emphasizes teaching foreigners the commandments and providing them with opportunities for employment and education. 

|לֹא־תִהְיֶ֥ה קְדֵשָׁ֖ה מִבְּנ֣וֹת יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְלֹֽא־יִהְיֶ֥ה קָדֵ֖שׁ מִבְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|18|No Israelite woman shall be a prostitute,  nor shall any Israelite man be a prostitute. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition against k'deishah and kadeish in Deuteronomy 23:18 emphasizes the importance of maintaining holiness and propriety within the Jewish community, with k'deishah referring to women who engage in illicit intercourse and kadeish to men involved in such activities, including pederasty. The Halakhah prohibits sexual relations without a marriage contract and ceremony, male homosexuality, relations with forbidden women, offering certain animals as sacrifices, and sexual relations with a mamzer. In Jewish Thought, the importance of justice and moral behavior is highlighted through comparisons to the sins of Sodom and Givah, and the need for purification from sin before punitive actions. Kabbalah considers idol worship, homosexual intercourse, and prostitution as abominations, while the Midrash discusses punishments for illicit relations, emphasizing the severity of these actions. Musar interprets punishments for sins as a means of cleansing and benefiting the sinner, guiding individuals towards repentance and improvement. The Talmud addresses the prohibition of homosexual intercourse, bestiality, and meat cooked in milk, deriving the basis for these prohibitions from various verses in the Torah. The Tanakh warns against degrading daughters and causing them to become harlots, while the Targum emphasizes the prohibition against Israelites engaging in prostitution or sexual immorality. 

|לֹא־תָבִיא֩ אֶתְנַ֨ן זוֹנָ֜ה וּמְחִ֣יר כֶּ֗לֶב בֵּ֛ית יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לְכׇל־נֶ֑דֶר כִּ֧י תוֹעֲבַ֛ת יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ גַּם־שְׁנֵיהֶֽם׃|19|You shall not bring the fee of a whore or the pay of a dog  into the house of your God יהוה in fulfillment of any vow, for both are abhorrent to your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah prohibits bringing the earnings from prostitution or the price of a dog into the House of God for any vow, as they are considered abominations, and this extends to their processed products. Interest is warned against as it leads to moral degradation, and women are cautioned against negative traits. The Shekhinah removes itself from Israel due to slander but appears when charity is given. Rabbi Elazar was exonerated after a misunderstanding regarding a Torah verse, and the Mishnah states that animals born from certain contexts are invalid for sacrifice. The Talmud debates the use of animals given as payment to a prostitute or in exchange for a dog as offerings in the Temple, with differing opinions on their status. 

|לֹא־תַשִּׁ֣יךְ לְאָחִ֔יךָ נֶ֥שֶׁךְ כֶּ֖סֶף נֶ֣שֶׁךְ אֹ֑כֶל נֶ֕שֶׁךְ כׇּל־דָּבָ֖ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִשָּֽׁךְ׃|20|You shall not deduct interest from loans to your fellow Israelites, whether in money or food or anything else that can be deducted as interest;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text prohibits lending money with interest to fellow Jews, with blessings promised for following this commandment. Halakhah prohibits borrowing with interest, forbids Israelites from lending or borrowing with interest but allows it with gentiles, and outlines additional restrictions during loans. The Midrash emphasizes the negative consequences of charging interest and praises Torah scholars. The Mishnah details how various parties involved in loans can violate prohibitions of interest, while the Talmud discusses the broader application of interest to loans of money and food. The Tanakh prohibits charging interest to the poor among God's people, and Targum translations also prohibit usury on loans to one's neighbor. 

|לַנׇּכְרִ֣י תַשִּׁ֔יךְ וּלְאָחִ֖יךָ לֹ֣א תַשִּׁ֑יךְ לְמַ֨עַן יְבָרֶכְךָ֜ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֗יךָ בְּכֹל֙ מִשְׁלַ֣ח יָדֶ֔ךָ עַל־הָאָ֕רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֥ה בָא־שָׁ֖מָּה לְרִשְׁתָּֽהּ׃|21|but you may deduct interest from loans to foreigners. Do not deduct interest from loans to your fellow Israelites, so that your God יהוה may bless you in all your undertakings in the land that you are about to enter and possess.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah permits charging interest to gentiles but prohibits it among fellow Jews, emphasizing brotherly love and avoiding desecrating God's name. It is a positive commandment to lend money to gentiles at interest, as stated in Deuteronomy 23:21, and prohibited to delay in paying vows to charity. Lending with interest is seen as fair with non-Jews and a form of charity within the Jewish community. Maimonides' view on charging interest to Gentiles as a positive commandment is discussed, contrasting with the prohibition within the Jewish community. The lending of charity-funds upon a definite rate of interest is not permitted, as charity-funds are considered money belonging to "thy brother." Interest taken by a Jew from a gentile will ultimately reach the government treasury, with the Talmud discussing the implications for the lender, borrower, guarantor, and witness. 

|כִּֽי־תִדֹּ֥ר נֶ֙דֶר֙ לַיהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ לֹ֥א תְאַחֵ֖ר לְשַׁלְּמ֑וֹ כִּֽי־דָרֹ֨שׁ יִדְרְשֶׁ֜נּוּ יְהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ מֵֽעִמָּ֔ךְ וְהָיָ֥ה בְךָ֖ חֵֽטְא׃|22|When you make a vow to your God יהוה, do not put off fulfilling it, for your God יהוה will require it of you, and you will have incurred guilt;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of making a Unification before performing a mitzvah to ensure prompt fulfillment. Commentary highlights the consequences of delaying vows to God, with punishment potentially including loss of loved ones or possessions. Halakhah stresses the need to fulfill vows and pledges promptly to avoid transgressions, with violations of the Torah's commands resulting from delays. Jewish Thought discusses the importance of respecting all beings as God's possessions and fulfilling duties towards oneself, others, and God. Midrash warns against delaying vows, with severe consequences such as death or transgressions. Mishnah establishes different New Year dates and addresses rules for vows and offerings. Musar emphasizes the need to promptly fulfill vows and charity to avoid punishment, with vows only to be made in times of distress. Quoting Commentary highlights the importance of fulfilling vows promptly, with consequences for delays. Talmud discusses the prohibition against delaying vows and offerings, and the ability of fathers and husbands to nullify vows made by daughters and wives. Tanakh outlines offerings to be made to God at specified times. Targum emphasizes the accountability individuals have for fulfilling vows to God promptly. Tosefta specifies that vows must be fulfilled within a year, with festivals observed in order. 

|וְכִ֥י תֶחְדַּ֖ל לִנְדֹּ֑ר לֹֽא־יִהְיֶ֥ה בְךָ֖ חֵֽטְא׃|23|whereas you incur no guilt if you refrain from vowing.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the consequences of making vows to God and the importance of fulfilling them to avoid sin. It is advised to avoid making vows altogether to prevent negative outcomes, as unfulfilled vows can lead to various sins. The Law allows for sacrifices in place of vows, emphasizing the importance of promptly fulfilling obligations. The Sages dissolved four types of vows without the need for a halakhic authority, and it is better not to vow at all to avoid sin and negligence. Fulfilling vows and charity promptly is emphasized, as delays can result in punishment. 

|מוֹצָ֥א שְׂפָתֶ֖יךָ תִּשְׁמֹ֣ר וְעָשִׂ֑יתָ כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר נָדַ֜רְתָּ לַיהֹוָ֤ה אֱלֹהֶ֙יךָ֙ נְדָבָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּ֖רְתָּ בְּפִֽיךָ׃|24|You must fulfill what has crossed your lips and perform what you have voluntarily vowed to your God יהוה, having made the promise with your own mouth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of guarding speech, Torah study, and charity in forming the holy mouth of the tzaddik. Halakhah stresses the fulfillment of verbal commitments, including vows, sacrifices, and charity, as commanded in Deuteronomy 23:24. The Mishnah discusses nuances of vow offerings and gift offerings, while Musar emphasizes sanctifying the mouth and upholding one's word. The Talmud delves into the significance of fulfilling verbal commitments and the intentions behind them, citing Deuteronomy 23:24. Jephthah's vow in Judges 11:30-31 exemplifies the seriousness of vows, while Targum Jonathan expands on the importance of keeping promises made to God. 

|כִּ֤י תָבֹא֙ בְּכֶ֣רֶם רֵעֶ֔ךָ וְאָכַלְתָּ֧ עֲנָבִ֛ים כְּנַפְשְׁךָ֖ שׇׂבְעֶ֑ךָ וְאֶֽל־כֶּלְיְךָ֖ לֹ֥א תִתֵּֽן׃|25|When you enter a fellow [Israelite]’s vineyard, you may eat as many grapes as you want, until you are full, but you must not put any in your vessel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the metaphor of entering a friend's vineyard to eat grapes as representing intellectual engagement with Torah, emphasizing learning for the purpose of serving Hashem rather than for intellectual pleasure, aligning with the mitzvah of not muzzling an ox on the threshing floor to elevate our animalistic soul and material possessions through service to Hashem. Workers hired to harvest grapes are allowed to eat while working but not excessively or take any home, respecting boundaries and obligations in relation to property rights and labor agreements. Laborers are entitled to eat while working in the field, specifically from what grows from the ground and only during the task at hand, with the Mishnah detailing the conditions under which a worker may eat. The Talmud discusses the halakha that laborers may eat from produce attached to the ground based on Deuteronomy 23:25, exploring interpretations and rights of the laborer to eat from the produce. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 23:25 discuss the permissibility of eating grapes while working in a neighbor's vineyard until satisfaction but prohibiting taking any home in a container. 

|כִּ֤י תָבֹא֙ בְּקָמַ֣ת רֵעֶ֔ךָ וְקָטַפְתָּ֥ מְלִילֹ֖ת בְּיָדֶ֑ךָ וְחֶרְמֵשׁ֙ לֹ֣א תָנִ֔יף עַ֖ל קָמַ֥ת רֵעֶֽךָ׃|26|When you enter a fellow [Israelite]’s field of standing grain, you may pluck ears with your hand; but you must not put a sickle to your neighbor’s grain.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Workers hired to work with produce can eat from it while working, exempting them from tithing, as stated in Deuteronomy 23:25-26. The Torah emphasizes actively seeking peace and pursuing it, as seen in Israel's actions in seeking peaceful passage through Sichon's land. The Mishnah and Talmud discuss the rights of laborers to eat from the produce they work with, with different perspectives on who is allowed to eat and when, based on specific verses in Deuteronomy 23:26. The law of not muzzling an ox while it is treading grain is paralleled by a similar law for humans working in fields, emphasizing the importance of allowing workers and animals to benefit from the food they are working with.

## Deuteronomy 24

|כִּֽי־יִקַּ֥ח אִ֛ישׁ אִשָּׁ֖ה וּבְעָלָ֑הּ וְהָיָ֞ה אִם־לֹ֧א תִמְצָא־חֵ֣ן בְּעֵינָ֗יו כִּי־מָ֤צָא בָהּ֙ עֶרְוַ֣ת דָּבָ֔ר וְכָ֨תַב לָ֜הּ סֵ֤פֶר כְּרִיתֻת֙ וְנָתַ֣ן בְּיָדָ֔הּ וְשִׁלְּחָ֖הּ מִבֵּיתֽוֹ׃|1|A man  takes a woman [into his household as his wife] and becomes her husband. She fails to please him because he finds something obnoxious about her, and he writes her a bill of divorcement, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the use of a "sefer of separation" and bitter waters in Jewish divorce proceedings, while Commentary emphasizes the respect for women in the divorce process. Guides and Halakhah detail the requirements for a valid bill of divorce, while Jewish Thought discusses the importance of love and mutual assistance in relationships. Midrash explores scenarios leading to divorce, Mishnah outlines various rules and scenarios related to divorce, and Musar emphasizes the spiritual significance of divorce. Quoting Commentary and Talmud provide further interpretations of divorce requirements, and Targum explains the process of divorce based on biblical texts. 

|וְיָצְאָ֖ה מִבֵּית֑וֹ וְהָלְכָ֖ה וְהָיְתָ֥ה לְאִישׁ־אַחֵֽר׃|2|she leaves his household and becomes [the wife] of another man  ;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various Jewish commentaries, Halakhah, and Talmudic texts explore the implications of divorce, marriage, and adultery based on Deuteronomy 24:2. Rabbi Mordecai Jaffe emphasizes the reasons for divorce, while Mishnah Ketubot and Kiddushin detail the process of acquiring and dissolving marriage bonds. Jewish thought highlights the partnership between man and woman, and Midrashic texts discuss consequences of adultery. The Talmud discusses the mitzva of divorcing a wife found to have done something unseemly, and Targum interpretations allow a woman to leave her husband's home to marry another man. Rabbi Meir's Tosefta compares attitudes towards women to food reactions, emphasizing the importance of following Torah commands to prevent negative consequences. 

|וּשְׂנֵאָהּ֮ הָאִ֣ישׁ הָאַחֲרוֹן֒ וְכָ֨תַב לָ֜הּ סֵ֤פֶר כְּרִיתֻת֙ וְנָתַ֣ן בְּיָדָ֔הּ וְשִׁלְּחָ֖הּ מִבֵּית֑וֹ א֣וֹ כִ֤י יָמוּת֙ הָאִ֣ישׁ הָאַחֲר֔וֹן אֲשֶׁר־לְקָחָ֥הּ ל֖וֹ לְאִשָּֽׁה׃|3|then this latter man rejects her, writes her a bill of divorcement, hands it to her, and sends her away from his household; or the man dies who had last taken her as his wife.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the power of prayer to change decrees, leading Moses to pray for himself. Commentary delves into the implications of divorce, with specific requirements for valid documents. Halakhah outlines the process of divorce, a positive commandment for separation. Midrash explores redemption through money, consequences of adultery, and the severity of the act. Mishnah details invalid bills of divorce and differing opinions on pre-written documents. Quoting Commentary discusses defilement during divorce, women's exemption from certain mitzvot, and requirements for divorce documents. Responsa addresses double indecision in Jewish law. Talmud clarifies the rules for inheritance and bills of divorce, while Targum and Tosefta offer additional insights on divorce and consequences for mistreating one's wife. 

|לֹא־יוּכַ֣ל בַּעְלָ֣הּ הָרִאשׁ֣וֹן אֲשֶֽׁר־שִׁ֠לְּחָ֠הּ לָשׁ֨וּב לְקַחְתָּ֜הּ לִהְי֧וֹת ל֣וֹ לְאִשָּׁ֗ה אַחֲרֵי֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הֻטַּמָּ֔אָה כִּֽי־תוֹעֵבָ֥ה הִ֖וא לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה וְלֹ֤א תַחֲטִיא֙ אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ נֹתֵ֥ן לְךָ֖ נַחֲלָֽה׃|4|Then the first husband who divorced her shall not take her [into his household] to become his wife again, since she has been defiled  —for that would be abhorrent to יהוה. You must not bring sin upon the land that your God יהוה is giving you as a heritage.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The verse in Deuteronomy 24:4 prohibits a husband from remarrying his divorced wife if she had committed adultery or been defiled by another man to prevent wife exchange and maintain marriage sanctity. Various laws related to marriage and divorce prohibit certain relationships and encourage holiness. The Law aims to balance extremes and guide the soul towards moderation and virtue. Mishnah discusses offspring from forbidden marriages, while Musar draws parallels between taking back a remarried wife and soul reincarnation. The Talmud explores scenarios of marriage, divorce, and remarriage, including cases where a woman remarries her first husband after marrying another. Jeremiah 3:1 questions if a man can return to his wife after she marries another, likening it to defilement, and Targum states that a defiled divorced woman cannot remarry her first husband. 

|כִּֽי־יִקַּ֥ח אִישׁ֙ אִשָּׁ֣ה חֲדָשָׁ֔ה לֹ֤א יֵצֵא֙ בַּצָּבָ֔א וְלֹא־יַעֲבֹ֥ר עָלָ֖יו לְכׇל־דָּבָ֑ר נָקִ֞י יִהְיֶ֤ה לְבֵיתוֹ֙ שָׁנָ֣ה אֶחָ֔ת וְשִׂמַּ֖ח אֶת־אִשְׁתּ֥וֹ אֲשֶׁר־לָקָֽח׃|5|When a man  has newly taken a woman [into his household as his wife], he shall not go out with the army or be assigned to it for any purpose; he shall be exempt one year for the sake of his household, to give happiness to the woman he has taken.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses two levels of righteous people serving God out of awe or love, as mentioned in the Zohar. Halakhah mandates a groom to focus on his new wife for a year, exempting him from military service. The Midrash tells a story of a widow saved by her understanding of this exemption. The Talmud explores blessings at weddings, exemptions from military service for various reasons, and the punishment of King Asa. The Tosefta discusses laws regarding betrothal and marriage, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling marital obligations within a specific timeframe. 

|לֹא־יַחֲבֹ֥ל רֵחַ֖יִם וָרָ֑כֶב כִּי־נֶ֖פֶשׁ ה֥וּא חֹבֵֽל׃|6|A handmill or an upper millstone shall not be taken in pawn, for that would be taking someone’s life in pawn.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah prohibits taking a man's life as collateral, including the lower or upper millstone, as stated in Deuteronomy 24:6. This prohibition extends to items used in food preparation, with each utensil taken as collateral considered independently liable for transgression. The Law serves to create humility, perpetuate memory of past events, and promote kindness and mercy towards others. Mishnah Bava Metzia expands on this, stating that anything necessary for food, like a millstone, cannot be taken as a pledge. The Gemara addresses the liability for each individual item taken as collateral separately. 

|כִּי־יִמָּצֵ֣א אִ֗ישׁ גֹּנֵ֨ב נֶ֤פֶשׁ מֵאֶחָיו֙ מִבְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְהִתְעַמֶּר־בּ֖וֹ וּמְכָר֑וֹ וּמֵת֙ הַגַּנָּ֣ב הַה֔וּא וּבִֽעַרְתָּ֥ הָרָ֖ע מִקִּרְבֶּֽךָ׃|7|If a party is found to have kidnapped—and then enslaved or sold—a fellow Israelite, that kidnapper shall die; thus you will sweep out evil from your midst.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah specifies that a man found stealing a person among his brethren of the children of Israel must be witnessed and warned before being liable to the death penalty, treating the victim as a slave is necessary for the penalty to apply, and the victim must be healthy enough to grow up to be a man for the legislation to apply, excluding babies under 30 days old. The Babylonian Talmud states that if a man steals a fellow Israelite and treats him as a slave or sells him, the thief shall be put to death to eliminate evil from the community. The Mishnah in Sanhedrin 11:1 lists the transgressors who are subject to the court-imposed death penalty by strangulation, including those who abduct Jewish individuals. Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis have differing opinions on certain cases, such as abduction of a half-slave half-freeman. Rashi explains that both men and women who steal and sell a person are punishable by death. The Talmud discusses the liability for one who abducts slaves or half-slave half-freemen, as well as the distinction between "of the Children of Israel" and "of his brothers" in relation to liability for abduction. 

|הִשָּׁ֧מֶר בְּנֶֽגַע־הַצָּרַ֛עַת לִשְׁמֹ֥ר מְאֹ֖ד וְלַעֲשׂ֑וֹת כְּכֹל֩ אֲשֶׁר־יוֹר֨וּ אֶתְכֶ֜ם הַכֹּהֲנִ֧ים הַלְוִיִּ֛ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּיתִ֖ם תִּשְׁמְר֥וּ לַעֲשֽׂוֹת׃|8|In cases of a skin affection  be most careful to do exactly as the levitical priests instruct you. Take care to do as I have commanded them.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah emphasizes the importance of following the instructions of the priests, particularly in dealing with leprosy, with circumcision being a significant mitzvah that supersedes the prohibition against removing signs of tzara'at. Slander is considered a severe sin, leading to leprosy as seen in the case of Miriam, highlighting the need to guard one's tongue against evil speech. Mishnah discusses different restrictions and rules regarding cleanliness and uncleanness, while the Talmud explores various prohibitions related to leprosy and the importance of following instructions from the priests. Tanakh instructs reporting skin afflictions to the priests for examination, emphasizing the divine origin of these instructions. 

|זָכ֕וֹר אֵ֧ת אֲשֶׁר־עָשָׂ֛ה יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ לְמִרְיָ֑ם בַּדֶּ֖רֶךְ בְּצֵאתְכֶ֥ם מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃|9|Remember what your God יהוה did to Miriam on the journey after you left Egypt.  |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The positive commandment to remember Miriam's punishment for speaking slander serves as a warning against engaging in harmful speech, highlighting the consequences of lashon hara. Various afflictions like tzara'at are linked to speaking negatively about others, cautioning against gatherings of wicked individuals who engage in undesirable speech. The importance of guarding one's speech and avoiding slander is underscored throughout the commentary, emphasizing the power of words to heal or harm. Miriam's punishment serves as a lesson on the severity of gossiping and speaking lashon hara, with specific reminders to avoid slander as it can lead to severe consequences both in this world and the next. 

|כִּֽי־תַשֶּׁ֥ה בְרֵֽעֲךָ֖ מַשַּׁ֣את מְא֑וּמָה לֹא־תָבֹ֥א אֶל־בֵּית֖וֹ לַעֲבֹ֥ט עֲבֹטֽוֹ׃|10|When you make a loan of any sort to your compatriot, you must not enter the house to seize the pledge.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains "כי תשה ברעך" as exacting a debt, while Ibn Ezra interprets "משאת מאומה" as any type of debt. Sforno emphasizes the inclusion of compensating for small tasks, while Rabbeinu Bahya stresses the dignity of borrowers by prohibiting lenders from entering their homes for collateral. Halakhah prohibits taking collateral by force and requires its return promptly, while the Talmud debates various scenarios related to debt collection and collateral. The Responsa detail conflicting opinions on forcefully taking possession of a debtor's valuables. The Mishnah explains the consequences of transgressing negative commandments without fulfilling corresponding positive ones. 

|בַּח֖וּץ תַּעֲמֹ֑ד וְהָאִ֗ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֤ר אַתָּה֙ נֹשֶׁ֣ה ב֔וֹ יוֹצִ֥יא אֵלֶ֛יךָ אֶֽת־הַעֲב֖וֹט הַחֽוּצָה׃|11|You must remain outside, while the party to whom you made the loan brings the pledge out to you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Halakhah prohibits taking surety from a debtor by force, requiring a judge's command for this action, and warns against entering a debtor's home to seize property. The Mishnah states that a creditor can only take collateral through a court-appointed agent, not on his own, and cannot take essential items like a pillow or plow. The Talmud discusses the rules for collecting collateral, with Torah law allowing collection from inferior-quality land and the Sages permitting collection from intermediate-quality land to encourage lending. Rashbam emphasizes that a pledge should not be something the debtor cannot do without, and Bartenura explains that only the lowest quality land should be collected as payment. 

|וְאִם־אִ֥ישׁ עָנִ֖י ה֑וּא לֹ֥א תִשְׁכַּ֖ב בַּעֲבֹטֽוֹ׃|12|If that party is needy, you shall not go to sleep in that pledge;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the prohibition of a creditor sleeping with a debtor's pledge, especially if the debtor is poor and has no alternative pledge, in which case the creditor must return one of two similar items used as security. The collateral must be returned to the owner when needed, as stated in Deuteronomy 24:12, with failure to do so violating multiple negative commandments, including "Do not sleep with his collateral." Utilizing the Daughter of a Voice leads to wealth, even for the poor who engage in hidden wisdom according to Kabbalah. In Mishnah Gittin 5:1, it is stated that the court appraises superior-quality land for payment to injured parties, while a creditor can collect a debt from the debtor's intermediate-quality land. The failure to return a pledge when needed may provoke the angel of death into making a "mistake" in returning souls to God, as seen in the example of the nursery teacher, highlighting the importance of treating debtors fairly, especially in cases involving poor individuals according to Musar. 

|הָשֵׁב֩ תָּשִׁ֨יב ל֤וֹ אֶֽת־הַעֲבוֹט֙ כְּב֣וֹא הַשֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ וְשָׁכַ֥ב בְּשַׂלְמָת֖וֹ וּבֵֽרְכֶ֑ךָּ וּלְךָ֙ תִּהְיֶ֣ה צְדָקָ֔ה לִפְנֵ֖י יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶֽיךָ׃|13|you must return the pledge at sundown, that its owner may sleep in the cloth and bless you; and it will be to your merit before your God יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of promptly returning collateral to a borrower is emphasized in various texts, highlighting acts of righteousness and compassion towards debtors. Different sources discuss the significance of returning pledges at appropriate times, such as sunset or sunrise, to ensure the well-being of the borrower and avoid hindering God's generosity. The concept of tzedaka is portrayed as more than legal justice, emphasizing kindness and moral duties towards others, with the focus on spiritual growth over material wealth. Various blessings and rewards for righteousness are highlighted, with the importance of returning collateral to debtors promptly to show compassion for the poor. The Talmud explores the obligations of a creditor in returning collateral to a debtor, emphasizing acts of righteousness and the nuances of different types of collateral based on specific situations and verses in the Torah. King Munbaz's example of storing treasures in heaven through charity and lovingkindness is presented as a model for all, regardless of social status, to fulfill their moral duties towards others. 

|לֹא־תַעֲשֹׁ֥ק שָׂכִ֖יר עָנִ֣י וְאֶבְי֑וֹן מֵאַחֶ֕יךָ א֧וֹ מִגֵּרְךָ֛ אֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּאַרְצְךָ֖ בִּשְׁעָרֶֽיךָ׃|14|You shall not abuse a needy and destitute laborer, whether a fellow Israelite or a stranger in one of the communities of your land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of not wronging poor, needy, or hired workers, extending the law to all workers, including strangers, widows, and orphans. The prohibition against exploitation includes withholding owed wages from a worker, as stated in Leviticus 19:13 and Deuteronomy 24:14, with transgressors facing consequences equivalent to robbers. Justice is highlighted as the first requisite for living in a Divine world, respecting all beings as creations of God and fulfilling their rightful claims. The severity of holding back wages from hired laborers is discussed in various texts, emphasizing fair treatment and prompt payment. 

|בְּיוֹמוֹ֩ תִתֵּ֨ן שְׂכָר֜וֹ וְֽלֹא־תָב֧וֹא עָלָ֣יו הַשֶּׁ֗מֶשׁ כִּ֤י עָנִי֙ ה֔וּא וְאֵלָ֕יו ה֥וּא נֹשֵׂ֖א אֶת־נַפְשׁ֑וֹ וְלֹֽא־יִקְרָ֤א עָלֶ֙יךָ֙ אֶל־יְהֹוָ֔ה וְהָיָ֥ה בְךָ֖ חֵֽטְא׃|15|You must pay out the wages due on the same day, before the sun sets, for the worker is needy and urgently depends on it; else a cry to יהוה will be issued against you and you will incur guilt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of paying wages promptly to hired laborers is emphasized in various texts, including Chasidut, Commentary, Guides, Halakhah, Jewish Thought, Midrash, Mishnah, Musar, Quoting Commentary, Responsa, Talmud, and Targum. The texts highlight the significance of timely payment to ensure the well-being of the worker, avoid exploitation, and fulfill obligations according to Jewish law, with references to biblical passages and rabbinic teachings supporting this principle. Failure to pay on time is considered a violation, risking harm to the worker and potential sin. 

|לֹֽא־יוּמְת֤וּ אָבוֹת֙ עַל־בָּנִ֔ים וּבָנִ֖ים לֹא־יוּמְת֣וּ עַל־אָב֑וֹת אִ֥ישׁ בְּחֶטְא֖וֹ יוּמָֽתוּ׃|16|Parents shall not be put to death for children, nor children be put to death for parents: they shall each be put to death only for their own crime.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Zohar emphasizes consoling mourners with truthful words, while the Talmud addresses theodicy by stating that the prosperity of the righteous indicates their righteousness. The Torah prohibits punishing fathers for children's sins, and vice versa, with a focus on individual accountability. Mishnah Sanhedrin discusses disqualifying relatives from serving as witnesses, while Musar highlights the importance of raising an orphan for the right reasons. Various commentaries and texts explore the consequences of parental actions on children, emphasizing divine justice and individual responsibility. The Talmud and Tanakh reinforce the principle that each person is accountable for their own actions, not those of their family members. 

|לֹ֣א תַטֶּ֔ה מִשְׁפַּ֖ט גֵּ֣ר יָת֑וֹם וְלֹ֣א תַחֲבֹ֔ל בֶּ֖גֶד אַלְמָנָֽה׃|17|You shall not subvert the rights of the stranger or the fatherless; you shall not take a widow’s garment in pawn.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The texts emphasize the importance of justice and fairness, prohibiting the taking of collateral from widows and highlighting the vulnerability of the defenseless, as seen in Deuteronomy 24:17. The Mishnah and Talmud discuss specific laws and consequences related to these prohibitions, with a focus on protecting widows from potential harm to their reputation and dignity. Additionally, the texts stress the acceptance of divine authority and the yoke of Torah as essential for fulfilling one's obligations and avoiding servitude. 

|וְזָכַרְתָּ֗ כִּ֣י עֶ֤בֶד הָיִ֙יתָ֙ בְּמִצְרַ֔יִם וַֽיִּפְדְּךָ֛ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖יךָ מִשָּׁ֑ם עַל־כֵּ֞ן אָנֹכִ֤י מְצַוְּךָ֙ לַעֲשׂ֔וֹת אֶת־הַדָּבָ֖ר הַזֶּֽה׃|18|Remember that you were a slave in Egypt and that your God יהוה redeemed you from there; therefore do I enjoin you to observe this commandment.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes the importance of remembering past slavery in Egypt to cultivate empathy, compassion, and observance of God's statutes, even at a financial cost. The Halakhah specifies the mixing of wine with water for the four cups, emphasizing the importance of freedom in its consumption. Jewish Thought stresses the equal treatment and love for strangers, rejecting xenophobia and hatred towards outsiders. The Midrash interprets Psalm 18:19 as referencing Pharaoh and Amalek, with support from God for the righteous. Rabbeinu Bahya explains the prohibition of cutting fruit-bearing trees as essential for human life and livelihood. The Targum commentary on Deuteronomy 24:18 underscores the importance of remembering past slavery in Egypt and God's redemption. 

|כִּ֣י תִקְצֹר֩ קְצִֽירְךָ֨ בְשָׂדֶ֜ךָ וְשָֽׁכַחְתָּ֧ עֹ֣מֶר בַּשָּׂדֶ֗ה לֹ֤א תָשׁוּב֙ לְקַחְתּ֔וֹ לַגֵּ֛ר לַיָּת֥וֹם וְלָאַלְמָנָ֖ה יִהְיֶ֑ה לְמַ֤עַן יְבָרֶכְךָ֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ בְּכֹ֖ל מַעֲשֵׂ֥ה יָדֶֽיךָ׃|19|When you reap the harvest in your field and overlook a sheaf in the field, do not turn back to get it; it shall go to the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow—in order that your God יהוה may bless you in all your undertakings.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that forgotten sheaves in the field should be left for the poor, bringing blessings from God, while Rav Hirsch emphasizes the importance of sharing with others. Halakhah prohibits taking forgotten sheaves and applies to grapes and underdeveloped clusters, with specific guidelines for various scenarios. Jewish Thought emphasizes kindness and compassion in fulfilling mitzvot, while the Mishnah discusses rules for forgotten sheaves and gifts for the poor. The Talmud clarifies obligations for proselytes regarding gleanings and forgotten sheaves, and the Tosefta discusses scenarios where forgotten produce does not qualify as Shikcha, highlighting the importance of fulfilling commandments. 

|כִּ֤י תַחְבֹּט֙ זֵֽיתְךָ֔ לֹ֥א תְפַאֵ֖ר אַחֲרֶ֑יךָ לַגֵּ֛ר לַיָּת֥וֹם וְלָאַלְמָנָ֖ה יִהְיֶֽה׃|20|When you beat down the fruit of your olive trees, do not go over them again; that shall go to the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries, halakhic discussions, Midrash teachings, Mishnah laws, and Talmudic debates emphasize the importance of leaving some produce for the poor, not mistreating trees, and promoting peace in agricultural practices. The Targum commentary highlights the significance of leaving fruit for the less fortunate when harvesting olive trees. 

|כִּ֤י תִבְצֹר֙ כַּרְמְךָ֔ לֹ֥א תְעוֹלֵ֖ל אַחֲרֶ֑יךָ לַגֵּ֛ר לַיָּת֥וֹם וְלָאַלְמָנָ֖ה יִהְיֶֽה׃|21|When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, do not pick it over again; that shall go to the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains that ollelot are grape clusters without arms or drippings, belonging to the vineyard owner, not the poor, while Siftei Chakhamim clarifies which grapes go to the poor. The poor are entitled to three clusters that will produce a revi'it of wine, and the obligation to leave incompletely formed grape clusters and the corner of the vineyard is derived from Deuteronomy 24:21. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva have differing opinions on defective clusters, with Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel disagreeing on the laws of the added fifth and removal. Leviticus 19:10 emphasizes leaving some produce for the poor and strangers, reflecting generosity and consideration for those in need. 

|וְזָ֣כַרְתָּ֔ כִּי־עֶ֥בֶד הָיִ֖יתָ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם עַל־כֵּ֞ן אָנֹכִ֤י מְצַוְּךָ֙ לַעֲשׂ֔וֹת אֶת־הַדָּבָ֖ר הַזֶּֽה׃|22|Always remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore do I enjoin you to observe this commandment.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra notes Deuteronomy 24:22 is about helping strangers, not widows or orphans. Sforno stresses the importance of remembering past neediness, even for unripe grapes. Steinsaltz points out the Torah's reminder of slavery in Egypt to understand and fulfill the commandment of helping the impoverished. The text instructs leaving parts of the harvest for the alien, fatherless, and widow as a reminder of slavery in Egypt and a command to show compassion. The rationale is supported by Exodus 22:23-24. The Targum commentary emphasizes the Israelites' slavery in Egypt as the reason for following certain laws.

## Deuteronomy 25

|כִּֽי־יִהְיֶ֥ה רִיב֙ בֵּ֣ין אֲנָשִׁ֔ים וְנִגְּשׁ֥וּ אֶל־הַמִּשְׁפָּ֖ט וּשְׁפָט֑וּם וְהִצְדִּ֙יקוּ֙ אֶת־הַצַּדִּ֔יק וְהִרְשִׁ֖יעוּ אֶת־הָרָשָֽׁע׃|1|When there is a dispute between two parties and they go to law, and a decision is rendered declaring the one in the right and the other in the wrong—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban explains that stripes are for transgressions, not civil cases, while Rashi highlights negative consequences of quarrels. Ibn Ezra and Tur HaArokh discuss judgment in quarrel cases, and Rav Hirsch details laws on lashes. Siftei Chakhamim interprets texts for lash punishments. Halakhah dictates punishment for collusive witnesses. Jewish Thought stresses respect for all beings. Midrash shows quarrels' negative impact, Mishnah details slave acquisition and lash judgments, Musar warns against quarrels leading to strife. Quoting Commentary analyzes Noah and Yehudah. Talmud discusses flogging conspiring witnesses. Tanakh warns against association with the wicked. Targum explains dispute resolution through courts. 

|וְהָיָ֛ה אִם־בִּ֥ן הַכּ֖וֹת הָרָשָׁ֑ע וְהִפִּיל֤וֹ הַשֹּׁפֵט֙ וְהִכָּ֣הוּ לְפָנָ֔יו כְּדֵ֥י רִשְׁעָת֖וֹ בְּמִסְפָּֽר׃|2|if the guilty one is to be flogged, the magistrate shall have the person lie down and shall supervise the giving of lashes, by count, as warranted by the offense.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the significance of reciting thirty-nine words in a verse as a symbol of God's compassion reducing punishment, particularly the thirty-nine lashes. Halakhah commands the whipping of the wicked, with lashes given based on the severity of transgressions and not exceeding forty. Mishnah outlines regulations for flogging, including the position of the person receiving lashes and the strength of the administration. Talmud discusses the derivation of the halakha for flogging conspiring witnesses, the exemption from payment for those liable to receive lashes, and the requirement for twenty-three judges in cases concerning lashes. 

|אַרְבָּעִ֥ים יַכֶּ֖נּוּ לֹ֣א יֹסִ֑יף פֶּן־יֹסִ֨יף לְהַכֹּת֤וֹ עַל־אֵ֙לֶּה֙ מַכָּ֣ה רַבָּ֔ה וְנִקְלָ֥ה אָחִ֖יךָ לְעֵינֶֽיךָ׃|3|The guilty one may be given up to forty lashes, but not more, lest being flogged further, to excess, your peer be degraded before your eyes.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The repetition of "Tabernacle, the Tabernacle" in Exodus 38:21 corresponds to the thirty-nine works deduced from the construction of the Tabernacle, with guarding the brit resulting in works akin to the Tabernacle when built up, while defiling the brit leads to works akin to the Tabernacle when destroyed. Faith in the sages is emphasized, even when their actions may seem to go against the Torah, as they have the authority to interpret it. The square is concealed within the circle, with the main power of the samekh coming from the mem in the aspect of "give him forty lashes" in Deuteronomy 25:3. The custom of reciting thirty-nine words instead of forty in the verse with thirteen Hebrew words is seen as an expression of God's compassion reducing the punishment from forty lashes to thirty-nine. The Torah prohibits exceeding forty lashes when administering punishment, with the number of lashes being a heavenly decree and not based on the judge's discretion. The lashes are to be administered to the chest and back, with each blow being significant and symbolic, as the guilty party must endure the exact number of lashes without adding more to avoid humiliation. The guilty party is referred to as "your brother" after receiving the lashes, and the lashes serve as an atonement for sin, with the number 39 having symbolic significance. The Torah emphasizes not degrading the guilty party and not exceeding the prescribed number of lashes. The exile to a city of refuge for an unwitting murderer serves as a form of atonement, protection, and punishment. The punishment of lashes is reserved for those who intentionally violate a prohibition by Torah law, serving as a means of punishment, deterrence, and atonement. The public administration of lashes adds humiliation to the physical pain, serving as a deterrent, while also allowing for the transgressor to be reintegrated into the community as atonement for their sins, even for severe transgressions punishable by excision from the World-to-Come [karet]. Restoring rabbinic ordination is seen as a way to restore the atonement aspect of the lashes. The prohibition against adding lashes when whipping a person liable for punishment is derived from Deuteronomy 25:3. The Torah also prohibits striking a father or mother, with an emphasis on not exceeding the prescribed number of lashes. The judge must assess the ability of the person being lashed to endure the punishment. The Torah prohibits excessive flogging, and even striking a righteous person should not exceed the appropriate punishment. The prohibition against adding lashes applies to all Israelites, not just those liable for punishment. The Torah also prohibits injuring oneself or another person, with a focus on not causing harm beyond what is necessary. The Sanhedrin administers lashes according to the strength of the person, ensuring that the number of lashes does not exceed the prescribed limit. The Torah emphasizes the importance of not causing harm to others, even unintentionally, and the need for proper assessment before administering punishment. In the Guide for the Perplexed, Maimonides categorizes the precepts of the Law based on the punishment for their transgression into four classes, ranging from death sentences to no punishment at all for certain transgressions that involve no act. In Akeidat Yitzchak, it is explained that the honor due to Torah is primary in nature, but the honor due to the Torah scholar is primary in terms of study, as the scholar is the one who enlightens. The Talmud points out the importance of honoring Torah scholars over the Torah itself, as the benefits of Torah come through contact with the scholar. The number forty symbolizes punishment and completion in 

|לֹא־תַחְסֹ֥ם שׁ֖וֹר בְּדִישֽׁוֹ׃|4|You shall not muzzle an ox while it is threshing.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The prohibition of muzzling animals while working, as outlined in Deuteronomy 25:4, applies to all animals and beasts to ensure their benefit. This prohibition is discussed in various commentaries, including the importance of compassion towards animals and the consequences of violating this law. The Mishnah and Talmud elaborate on the rules for laborers eating from produce, the types of animals used for labor, and the application of lashes for violations. The law of not muzzling an ox while threshing grain parallels other laws allowing workers to eat from their neighbor's fields, emphasizing the importance of treating animals and humans with kindness. 

|כִּֽי־יֵשְׁב֨וּ אַחִ֜ים יַחְדָּ֗ו וּמֵ֨ת אַחַ֤ד מֵהֶם֙ וּבֵ֣ן אֵֽין־ל֔וֹ לֹֽא־תִהְיֶ֧ה אֵֽשֶׁת־הַמֵּ֛ת הַח֖וּצָה לְאִ֣ישׁ זָ֑ר יְבָמָהּ֙ יָבֹ֣א עָלֶ֔יהָ וּלְקָחָ֥הּ ל֛וֹ לְאִשָּׁ֖ה וְיִבְּמָֽהּ׃|5|When brothers dwell together and one of them dies and leaves no offspring,  the wife of the deceased  shall not become that of another party, outside the family. Her husband’s brother shall unite with her: he shall take her as his wife and perform the levir’s duty.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Zohar emphasizes the importance of true comfort for mourners over simply speaking the truth, while the Talmud discusses theodicy and the idea that a righteous person who suffers may not be perfectly righteous. Levirate marriage is a requirement in cases where a man dies childless, with the Torah specifying that the brother-in-law must marry the widow, and the Mishnah covers various scenarios related to levirate marriage, inheritance, and impurity. The prohibition of marrying a brother's wife is biblical, and the law in Leviticus prohibits uncovering the nakedness of one's brother's wife. 

|וְהָיָ֗ה הַבְּכוֹר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תֵּלֵ֔ד יָק֕וּם עַל־שֵׁ֥ם אָחִ֖יו הַמֵּ֑ת וְלֹֽא־יִמָּחֶ֥ה שְׁמ֖וֹ מִיִּשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|6|The first child that she bears shall be accounted to the dead brother, that his name may not be blotted out in Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary discusses the laws of Chaliza and Levirate marriage, as outlined in Deuteronomy 25:5-6, and how they apply in various situations, such as childless widows, barren women, and the inheritance rights of the levir. The Talmud addresses cases of forbidden women in levirate marriage, including exemptions for aylonit and the rights of inheritance for the brother who consummates the marriage. In the Tanakh, Boaz fulfills the role of kinsman-redeemer for Ruth's deceased husband, while the Targum emphasizes the importance of the firstborn ensuring the deceased brother's name is not forgotten. 

|וְאִם־לֹ֤א יַחְפֹּץ֙ הָאִ֔ישׁ לָקַ֖חַת אֶת־יְבִמְתּ֑וֹ וְעָלְתָה֩ יְבִמְתּ֨וֹ הַשַּׁ֜עְרָה אֶל־הַזְּקֵנִ֗ים וְאָֽמְרָה֙ מֵאֵ֨ן יְבָמִ֜י לְהָקִ֨ים לְאָחִ֥יו שֵׁם֙ בְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לֹ֥א אָבָ֖ה יַבְּמִֽי׃|7|But if that party does not want to take his brother’s widow [to wife], his brother’s widow shall appear before the elders in the gate and declare, “My husband’s brother refuses to establish a name in Israel for his brother; he will not perform the duty of a levir.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the different ways G'd's largesse is manifested in the universe, with Jewish people receiving it directly while other nations receive it through nature. The Torah contrasts the development of Ishmael's descendants with the Jewish people, highlighting the Jewish people's connection to G'd's will. In the Halakhah, the Chalitsah ceremony involves specific steps, including the recitation of certain texts and the removal of a shoe, with the order being important for validity. The Mishnah discusses various aspects of the mitzvah of ḥalitza, such as the procedure, requirements for valid ḥalitza, and cases where ḥalitza is not applicable. The Talmud addresses the proper order of the ceremony, eligibility of individuals for levirate marriage and ḥalitza, the role of the court in conducting ḥalitza, and the language in which the ceremony must be conducted. 

|וְקָֽרְאוּ־ל֥וֹ זִקְנֵי־עִיר֖וֹ וְדִבְּר֣וּ אֵלָ֑יו וְעָמַ֣ד וְאָמַ֔ר לֹ֥א חָפַ֖צְתִּי לְקַחְתָּֽהּ׃|8|The elders of his town shall then summon him and talk to him. If he insists, saying, “I do not want to take her,”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Chalitsah ceremony involves specific steps such as the removal of the shoe, spitting, and statements, with the yavam stating his refusal to marry the yevamah, and the ceremony being invalid if either party is mute or a minor. The Mishnah states that certain recitations, including during the ḥalitza ritual, must be said in Hebrew, with Rabbi Hyrkanus establishing the custom of reciting the entire Torah passage during ḥalitza. In the Talmud, discussions include whether a man must stand during ḥalitza, the advice of Elders in cases of levirate marriage, and the process of ḥalitza involving specific verses in Hebrew and the removal of the shoe. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention that the judges of the city will call the man to speak with him in Deuteronomy 25:8. 

|וְנִגְּשָׁ֨ה יְבִמְתּ֣וֹ אֵלָיו֮ לְעֵינֵ֣י הַזְּקֵנִים֒ וְחָלְצָ֤ה נַעֲלוֹ֙ מֵעַ֣ל רַגְל֔וֹ וְיָרְקָ֖ה בְּפָנָ֑יו וְעָֽנְתָה֙ וְאָ֣מְרָ֔ה כָּ֚כָה יֵעָשֶׂ֣ה לָאִ֔ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־יִבְנֶ֖ה אֶת־בֵּ֥ית אָחִֽיו׃|9|his brother’s widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, pull the sandal off his foot, spit in his face, and make this declaration: Thus shall be done to the man  who will not build up his brother’s house!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The levirate ceremony involves spitting in the face of the brother-in-law who refuses to marry the widow to symbolize the lack of offspring and blessings left behind by the deceased husband, as outlined in Chasidut and Commentary. The act of chalitzah, removing the brother-in-law's shoe, and spitting before him is a public shaming meant to emphasize the importance of family ties and inheritance within the community, as seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz. The Mishneh Torah, Shulchan Arukh, and Talmud detail the regulations and procedures for chalitzah, including the significance of spitting in the ceremony. The Tosefta mentions the visibility of certain substances in purification waters and the spittle of a Yevama to the Elders. 

|וְנִקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖וֹ בְּיִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל בֵּ֖ית חֲל֥וּץ הַנָּֽעַל׃|10|And he shall go in Israel by the name of “the family of the unsandaled one.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The chalitzah ceremony involves the removal of the shoe by the brother's wife in the presence of elders, condemning the refusal to marry a deceased brother's wife, and is a significant halachic procedure. The law of marrying a deceased brother's wife is explained in Deuteronomy 25:5, perpetuated by custom and the Torah, and the ceremony of haliẓah was introduced to avoid disgrace. In Kabbalistic interpretation, the act of removing the shoe symbolizes unity with the Shekhinah. The Mishnah discusses various scenarios related to marriage contracts and levirate marriage, with consequences outlined for women who remarry based on invalid bills of divorce. The Gemara discusses the consequences of ancestral sin and the importance of righteous acts. In Deuteronomy 25:10, different Targums refer to the House of the Unshod or the House of him whose shoe was loosed in the chalitzah ceremony. 

|כִּֽי־יִנָּצ֨וּ אֲנָשִׁ֤ים יַחְדָּו֙ אִ֣ישׁ וְאָחִ֔יו וְקָֽרְבָה֙ אֵ֣שֶׁת הָֽאֶחָ֔ד לְהַצִּ֥יל אֶת־אִישָׁ֖הּ מִיַּ֣ד מַכֵּ֑הוּ וְשָׁלְחָ֣ה יָדָ֔הּ וְהֶחֱזִ֖יקָה בִּמְבֻשָֽׁיו׃|11|If two parties are fighting—one man with another—and the wife of one comes up to save her husband from his antagonist and puts out her hand and seizes him by his genitals,|
