29,9,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 29:9:1,"YE ARE STANDING THIS DAY ALL OF YOU BEFORE THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D. The meaning thereof is that you are standing and ready before G-d to be initiated into His covenant. For, in order to accept the Torah with its interpretation, they had gathered before him [Moses], or they may have stood before the ark of G-d. The covenant was the oath and imprecation which he mentioned — that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the Eternal thy G-d, and into His oath. (Verse 11.)  It is possible that he made another covenant with them like the first covenant which he made with them at Mount Sinai, (Exodus 24:4-5.)  namely, that he offered a burnt-offering on their behalf, and took half of the blood to sprinkle upon the altar and he sprinkled half of the blood upon the people, but it was unnecessary for him to mention this. And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], I have already informed you of [the secret of] this covenant. (See Ramban to Leviticus 26:12.) "
29,9,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:9:1,"אתם נצבים YE ARE STANDING THIS DAY [ALL OF YOU BEFORE THE LORD] — This teaches that Moses assembled them in the presence of the Omnipresent on the day of his death, in order to initiate them into a covenant with Him."
29,9,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:9:2,ראשיכם שבטיכם means as much as ראשיכם לשבטיכם YOUR HEADS OF YOUR TRIBES.
29,9,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:9:3,"זקניכם ושטריכם YOUR ELDERS AND YOUR OFFICERS — The more prominent were in front (i.e. they stood before the Lord in the order of their rank), and afterwards: “all the men of Israel”."
29,9,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 29:9:1,YE ARE STANDING THIS DAY. Around the ark.
29,9,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 29:9:2,"YOUR HEADS. Roshekhem (your heads) is similar to haohelah (the tent) in into the tent Sarah his mother (Gen. 24:67) (Translated literally. According to I. E. into the tent Sarah his mother is short for into the tent, the tent of Sarah his mother. Similarly, your heads is short for your heads the heads of. See I.E. on Gen. 24:67 (Vol. 1, p. 243).)  and even the prophecy, Odad the prophet (Translated literally.)  (II Chron. 15:8). (According to I.E. even the prophecy, Odad the prophet is short for even the prophecy, the prophecy of Odad the prophet. See I.E. on Gen. 24:67 (Vol. 1, p. 243).)  Roshekhem shivtekhem (your heads, your tribes) is to be interpreted as your heads, who are the heads of your tribes. (Roshekhem shivtekhem is short for roshekhem roshe shivtekhem.)  Roshekhem (your heads) is like the word va-niram (we have shot at them) (Num. 21:30). (Num. 21:30 reads, va-niram avad cheshbon (we have shot at them, Heshbon is destroyed). According to I.E. this is to be interpreted as And their king, the king of Heshbon was destroyed. See I.E. on Num. 21:30 (Vol. 4, p. 175).)  The word is to be so interpreted for the princes (The heads of the tribes.)  were closest to the ark. (According to I.E. our verse records the hierarchical arrangement of the Israelites before the ark, when the covenant was made. If we take our verse literally the word “tribes” breaks up the arrangement. Hence I.E. insists that our verse reads, your heads, the heads of your tribes.)  After them came the elders, followed by the officers, after whom came all the men of Israel, that is, the males, followed by the male little ones, after whom came the women, followed by the strangers."
29,9,Targum,Onkelos Deuteronomy 29:9,"‘‘You stand, this day all of you before Adonoy, your God; your tribal chieftains, your elders and your law officers, every man of Yisroel."
29,9,Targum,Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 29:9,"MOSHEH the prophet said: I have called you not in secret, but while standing this day all of you before the Lord your God; the princes of your sanhedrin, the chiefs of your tribes, your elders and your officers, all men of Israel, 
"
29,9,Mishnah,Mishnah Makkot 3:14,"and the court crier recites the verses: “If you do not observe to perform all the words of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious and awesome name, the Lord your God. And the Lord will make your plagues [makkotekha] outstanding, and the plagues of your descendants, and even great plagues, and of long continuance, and severe sicknesses, and of long continuance” (Deuteronomy 28:58–59). And then he returns to the beginning of the verse. He also recites: “And you shall observe the matters of this covenant, and do them, that you may make all that you do to prosper” (Deuteronomy 29:8), and concludes with the verse: “And He is merciful and shall atone for transgression, and destroys not; and many a time does He turn His anger away, and does not stir up all His wrath” (Psalms 78:38), and then returns to the beginning of the verse that starts: “If you do not observe to perform.” If the one being flogged dies at the hand of the attendant, the latter is exempt, because he acted at the directive of the court. If the attendant added for him an additional lash with a strap and he died, the attendant is exiled to a city of refuge on his account, as an unwitting murderer. If the one being flogged involuntarily sullies himself, due to fear or pain, whether with excrement or with urine, he is exempt from further lashes. Rabbi Yehuda says that the threshold of shame for men and women is different: The man is exempted if he sullies himself with excrement, and the woman is exempted even with urine. "
29,9,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:9:1,"אתם נצבים היום, ""You are standing today, etc."" We have to analyse what these words are meant to tell us. Besides, why did Moses have to single out ראשיכם, טפכם, ""your heads and your children,"" and did not simply say כלכם, ""all of you?"" Moreover, what was the reason for this covenant? Just a few lines ago (28,69) Moses had written: ""these are the words of the covenant, etc."" If Moses was anxious to include what is written in this portion in the covenant, he should have written this chapter sooner and everything would have been included in what are described as ""the words of the covenant in 28,69."" "
29,9,Commentary,Rashbam on Deuteronomy 29:9:1,"אתם נצבים היום כולכם, as we know from verse 1:'ויקרא משה את כל ישראל וגו "
29,9,Midrash,Shemot Rabbah 15:6,"“This month shall be for you the first of months; it shall be the first month of the year for you” (Exodus 12:2).  Another interpretation: “This month shall be for you” – that is what is written: “Who is she who appears like the dawn [shaḥar], [beautiful as the moon, pure as the sun, fearsome as banners of a host?]” (Song of Songs 6:10). There are four terms of praise of Israel here, corresponding to the four exiles. For during the four exiles that Israel experienced, they did not deny the Holy One blessed be He. In the Babylonian exile, from where [can this be seen]? It is as it is stated: “Who is she who appears like the dawn?” Nebuchadnezzar prostrated himself to the sun, as it is stated: “How have you fallen from the heavens, glowing morning [shaḥar] star” (Isaiah 14:12). (“Morning star” refers to Nebuchadnezzar.)  Daniel (Daniel lived during the Babylonian exile.)  would rise early [shoḥer] and pray to the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “And windows were open for him in his upper chamber facing Jerusalem” (Daniel 6:11), evening, morning, and noon. Why would he rise early and pray? It was so the Holy One blessed be He would have mercy upon Israel. In his regard, Solomon said: “He who seeks [shoḥer] good seeks favor” (Proverbs 11:27). God was present for them in their time of distress, as it is stated: “I love those who love me…” (Proverbs 8:17).  Likewise, we find, when Daniel was cast into the lions’ den, he was not harmed, as it is stated; “God sent His angel and closed the lions’ mouths, and they did not harm me” (Daniel 6:23). Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya were cast into the fiery furnace and were not harmed, as it is stated: “The hair of their heads was not singed [. . .] and the odor of fire did not cover them” (Daniel 3:27). Rather, they illuminated the world like the dawn, which illuminates the world. Therefore, “who appears like the dawn.” They caused the idolaters to acknowledge the Holy One blessed be He and to praise Him, as Nebuchadnezzar said when Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya emerged from the furnace: “Blessed is the God of Shadrakh, Meshakh, and Aved Nego” (Daniel 3:28), (These are the Babylonian names of Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya.)  “the servants of the exalted God” (Daniel 3:26). Likewise, Darius said after Daniel fell into the lions’ den “to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, who is the living God” (Daniel 6:27); therefore, it is written: “Who is she who appears like the dawn?”  “Beautiful as the moon” (Song of Songs 6:10) – in the Median [Persian] exile; you find during the night that if the moon is not seen in the sky, there is darkness in the world, and a person is unable to walk, even in the city. When the moon is seen in the sky, everyone is glad, and they walk on the road. So, during the days of Aḥashverosh, when they decreed against the Jews to “destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13), and Esther came and illuminated for Israel, as it is stated: “The Jews had light and gladness, [and joy and honor]” (Esther 8:16); that is why it is written: “Beautiful as the moon,” about the Median exile. If your wish is to know why Esther was likened to the moon: Just as the moon is reborn after thirty days, so too, Esther said: “But I have not been summoned to the king these thirty days” (Esther 4:11); that is why “beautiful as the moon” is in the Median exile.  “Pure as the sun” (Song of Songs 6:10) – during the Greek kingdom. Sandrios eim Ulios: (This phrase is in corrupted Greek, and two interpretations of it have been given. (1) The Sanhedrin against the sun, i.e., the Jewish Sanhedrin stands in opposition to the Greeks, represented by the sun (Mirkin); and (2) Alexander, son of Helios, i.e., Alexander the original Macedonian emperor, is the son of the god of the sun, Helios (Jastrow).)  The sun [ḥama] is its name, and the sun is called a strong man [gibor], as it is stated: “Rejoices as a strong man [gibor] to run its course” (Psalms 19:6). (The verse is referring to the movement of the sun on its course.)  During the summer, who can withstand the sun; everyone flees from it, as it is stated: “And nothing hides from its heat [meḥamato]” (Psalms 19:7). So, with regard to the Greek kingdom, everyone fled from it, and Matitya the priest and his sons were steadfast in their faith in the Holy One blessed be He, and the troops of Greece fled from before them and were all killed. So, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: “Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears; the weak will say: I am mighty [gibor]” (Joel 4:10). And it says: “So may all Your enemies perish, Lord…” (Judges 5:31), to fulfill what is stated: “Pure as the sun.”  “Fearsome as banners” (Song of Songs 6:10) – in [reference to the hegemony of] Edom [Rome]; why is it [Israel] called fearsome? It is because it remains steadfast in a kingdom that inspires fear, as it is stated: “And behold a fourth beast, dreadful and fearsome, and strong” (Daniel 7:7). What is “fearsome as banners?” You find that there are twelve constellations in the sky. Just as the heavens cannot endure without the twelve constellations, so, the world cannot endure without the twelve tribes, as it is stated: “If [these] statutes depart [from before Me, says the Lord, then the descendants of Israel will also cease from being a nation before Me forever]” (Jeremiah 31:35).  “Fearsome as banners” – banners are nothing other than armies, as it is stated: “The banner of the camp…and their host and their numbered” (Numbers 2:3–4). Likewise, the banners of the heavens are the angels, and the banners of the earth are Israel. The hosts of the heavens are angels, as it is stated: “And the entire host of the heavens standing…” (II Chronicles 18:18). The hosts of the earth are Israel, as it is stated: “All the hosts of the Lord emerged from the land of Egypt” (Exodus 12:41). The Master of them both is the Holy One blessed be He. Just as everyone fears the Holy One blessed be He and the angels, so too, the idolaters fear Israel, as it is stated: “And all the peoples of the land will see that the name of the Lord [is called upon you, and they will fear you]” (Deuteronomy 28:10). This is why it is stated: “Fearsome as banners,” because the Holy One blessed be He likened Israel to the angels.  Regarding angels it is stated: “Seraphim were standing above Him” (Isaiah 6:2), and regarding Israel it is stated: “You are standing today” (Deuteronomy 29:9). The angels say each day: “Holy, holy, holy [is the Lord of hosts]” (Isaiah 6:3), and Israel says: The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. (At the beginning of the Amida prayer. Both the angels and Israel praise God with a threefold prayer.)  Angels are called fire, as it is written: “The flaming fire His servants” (Psalms 104:4), and Israel likewise, as it is written: “The house of Jacob will be fire” (Obadiah 1:18). Angels are renewed every morning, and praise the Holy One blessed be He and then return to the river of fire from which they emerged; and the Holy One blessed be He again renews them and restores them as they had been initially, as it is stated: “They are new every morning” (Lamentations 3:23). So, [the people of] Israel sink into iniquities due to the evil inclination that is in their bodies, and they repent. Each year, God forgives their iniquities and renews their hearts to fear Him, as it is stated: “I will give you a new heart” (Ezekiel 36:26). That is why it is written: “Fearsome as banners.”"
29,9,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 26:42:1,"THEN WILL I REMEMBER MY COVENANT WITH JACOB. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that this [is a case where a word] draws along with itself another [similar] word, thus meaning: “Then will I remember My covenant, the covenant with Jacob. (The reason for this explanation is that the word brithi (My covenant) is grammatically equivalent to saying habrith sheli (the covenant of Mine). Now since a noun that is preceded by the definite article cannot be in the construct state, it follows that there is a word implied here, which makes it: eth brithi ‘brith’ Ya’akov (My covenant, the covenant of Jacob). A similar explanation applies to the following two verses which Ramban mentions.)  Similarly: the prophecy of Oded the prophet; (II Chronicles 15:8. Here too the meaning is: v’hanevuah ‘nevuath’ Oded hanavi’ (and the prophecy — a prophecy of Oded the prophet).)  your heads of your tribes. (Deuteronomy 29:9. The meaning here too is: rasheichem ‘rashei’ shivteichem (your heads — heads of your tribes).)  And the Land I will remember. The meaning thereof is that I will remember the Land, and that it was paid its Sabbaths and lay forsaken without them, and I will remember that they have atoned for their iniquity.” It is possible according to the way of Truth, [the mystic doctrines of the Cabala], that He is saying: “And I will remember Jacob and Isaac and Abraham, who are the men of the covenant,” for all attributes are so called when they are in the covenant; “v’ha’aretz (and the earth), (See Ramban above, 25:2 (towards the end) about the meaning of the word ha’aretz.)  which is composed of them all, I will remember among them.” Our Rabbis have so alluded. Thus they said: (Vayikra Rabbah 36:7.)  “And why does He mention the merit of ha’aretz with them? Said Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: This is like the case of a master who had three daughters, and one maidservant who raised them. Whenever the master asked about the welfare of his daughters, he would say: ‘Ask on my behalf about the welfare of she who raises them.’”"
29,9,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 29:9:1,"אתם נצבים...לפני ה' אלוקיכם , so that anyone who is capable of misleading me cannot mislead Him. You will accept this covenant in His presence, on His authority, not merely on mine."
29,9,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 29:9:2,"ראשיכם שבטיכם זקניכם ושוטריכם, the people Moses describes as ראשיכם, are those who are heads of their tribes, elsewhere referred to as נשיאים, “princes. The term ראשalways includes the people who wield authority. זקניכם, your judges. ושוטריכם, the law enforcers empowered by the judges to enforce their judgments. Each one of these categories of people have the duty to teach the people (within the parameters of their special competence) how much better it is for them to accept Torah law than to defy it or neglect it. "
29,9,Quoting Commentary,Sforno on Genesis 18:1:1,"וירא אליו ה' באלוני ממרא, because this was where Avraham had circumcised himself at that time. His whole household had been circumcised with him at the time. This is where G’d manifested Himself as a sign that He stood by the covenant, similar to the verse at the beginning of Deuteronomy 29,9-11, commencing with the words אתם נצבים היום, and to Kings II 23,3 ויכרות לפני ה'. He appeared to Avraham seeing he was the individual most deserving to be the recipient of such a vision. We have a similar occurrence in Exodus 4,24 ויפגשהו ה', where G’d “met” with Moses without delivering an oral message. At that time G’d’s purpose was to ensure that Moses would circumcise his son, to maintain the covenant which was to be an eternal covenant with the descendants of Avraham as spelled out in Genesis 17,11-12. Perhaps this is the reason why a chair is prepared at the occasion of the circumcision (Pirkey de Rabbi Eliezer 29, as well as Zohar Bereshit 13,10) This chair alludes to the fact that hopefully, the presence of G’d will attend this marking of the sign of the covenant by a new member of the Jewish people."
29,9,Jewish Thought,Netzach Yisrael 11:18,"It has become clear to you that that which God, may He be blessed, took the Jewish people for Himself is not because of the righteousness of the Jewish people or their deeds. Rather it was a more encompassing choice. And this thing is explained in several places, and the faithful sages [also] came [to discuss] it in several places. Hence it is not fit to say that with the removal of the cause – which is the righteousness of the Jewish people – the result would also be removed, meaning His taking them as a people for Himself. And even though their deeds, good or bad, caused there to be more or less attachment [to God], as this is certainly according to the majority of [their] deeds, such that there would be more or less [of it] – nevertheless, [God's] actual choice was not because of any deed at all.  "
29,9,Midrash,Midrash Tehillim 78:2,"They struck the rock and water gushed forth, as Moses struck the rock, blood dripped, as it says, ""and water gushed forth."" Rabbi Yosei bar Hanina said it was like what is written (Leviticus 15:25), ""when a woman has a discharge, her discharge of blood flows."" Thus, it says, ""and water gushed forth."" And the rivers flowed. The rivers washed away much water, and the scoffers of the generation said, ""Now we will remove the rock,"" but it immediately swallowed them up, and the heavens commanded. Rav Kahana said in the name of Rabbi Zevadya ben Levi that for a thousand years, manna descended upon Israel every day. Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said that it is written here, ""the doors of heaven opened."" And there, it is written (Genesis 7:11), ""the floodgates of the sky were opened."" The sages taught that the flood lasted for twelve months, and here, the doors of heaven opened for only eight. This is because four doors were for rain, and the measure of mercy exceeded the measure of punishment by five hundred times. Thus, for two thousand years, manna descended upon them every day, as it says, ""and He rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them the grain of heaven."" Rabbi Acha said, ""He (i.e. a person) should not have short arms (i.e. stingy), as it is written in Proverbs 10:22, 'The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow therewith.'"" Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, ""And behold, upon the face of the desert, a thin flake-like layer, which is mentioned in Exodus 16:14, 'And when the layer of dew was gone up, behold upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar frost on the ground.' Had there been one who had a need for pinching off (i.e. taking only a small amount of) the manna, it would have been as fine as flour, as it is written without the letter 'vav' (which represents the number six) - that it was swallowed up in 248 limbs of a person, as it is said, 'Every man had eaten the bread of the mighty' (Psalms 78:25)."" Another explanation of 'the bread of the mighty' is that it was made by angels. 'Every man' refers to the Israelites, as it is said, 'Every man of Israel' (Deuteronomy 29:9). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, ""The Israelites would complain, saying, 'You have a woman who gives birth and eats, yet she does not produce milk; you see your waters providing wheat to the Egyptians, but you do not produce flour.' The Holy One, blessed be He, replied, 'I have treated them with kindness and made them like angels,' but they would complain against Him and say, 'Our soul is dried up; there is nothing at all; we have nothing but manna to look to' (Numbers 21:5). How much longer will they despise Me, in their midst, in the womb of their bellies, that they eat and produce nothing?"" Rabbi Ibu said: At the sixth hour, Jethro came and received his portion of manna. The manna that he received was equivalent to sixty myriads and corresponded to all of his limbs. The manna was like ""bread of heroes,"" which each person ate. How was the manna brought down to them? The wind would blow and honor the wilderness, and then dew would descend upon it, as it says, ""And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night"" (Exodus 16:13). All of Israel would go out and collect the manna until the sun rose, so that it would not melt, as it says, ""And it came to pass that the sun waxed hot, and it melted"" (Exodus 16:21). The manna was divided into three parts: one-third for the wise men, one-third for Mordechai and Esther, and one-third for the construction of the Temple, as it says, ""For the Lord hears the needy and does not despise his own who are prisoners"" (Psalms 69:33). ""His own who are prisoners"" refers to the beams of the Temple that the Holy One, Blessed be He, keeps track of. Rabbi Nehemiah said that the matter is not stated explicitly. Rabbi Acha in the name of Rabbi Jonathan said that there are three keys: the key of rain, the key of resurrection, and the key of compassion, and they are only in His hands. The key of compassion is derived from the verse, ""And the Lord saw, and opened her womb"" (Genesis 29:31). The key of resurrection is derived from the verse, ""And you shall know that I am the Lord when I open your graves"" (Ezekiel 37:13). Regarding rain, it is said (Deuteronomy 28:12), ""The Lord will open for you His good treasure, the heavens, to give your land rain."" When God desires, He gives rain to the righteous. Regarding barrenness, God gave a son to Elisha, as it is said (2 Kings 4:16-17), ""Now the woman conceived and bore a son at that season next year, as Elisha had said to her."" God also gave the power to raise the dead to Elijah, who brought back to life the son of the widow of Zarephath, as it is said (1 Kings 17:21-22), ""Then he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried out to the Lord and said, 'O Lord my God, I pray, let this child’s soul come back to him.' The Lord heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came back to him, and he revived."" Similarly, Elisha raised the son of the Shunammite woman, as it is said (2 Kings 4:34), ""And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm."" And also, in Ezekiel 37:1-3, ""The hand of the Lord came upon me and brought me out in the Spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones...So I prophesied as He commanded me, and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army."" God gave Elijah the key to rain, as it is said (1 Kings 17:1), ""Now Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, 'As the Lord God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, except at my word.'"" And when he prayed for rain, it is said (1 Kings 18:41), ""Then Elijah said to Ahab, 'Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.'"" It is written (Psalm 18:7), ""The Lord is for me among those who help me; therefore, I shall see my desire upon those who hate me."" There is no one whom God helps like Moses and Aaron, and through their saying ""Hear now, you rebels,"" they did not enter the land. Therefore, the young men of Israel were judged on a scale of merit and were found wanting."
29,9,Chasidut,"Kedushat Levi, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 1","Deuteronomy 29,9., “All of you are standing assembled ‎this day in the presence of the Lord your G’d;” the ‎paragraph commencing here with “in the presence etc.,” appears ‎to contain unnecessary words. [Our author refers ‎especially to the words: “in the presence of the Lord your G’d,” ‎seeing that when Moses addressed the people in the name of the ‎Lord during their stay in the desert they had always been “in the ‎presence” of the Lord. Ed.] It helps us understand a ‎statement in Rosh Hashanah 34, according to which the ‎blowing of the shofar as well as the recital of certain ‎benedictions in the prayer service are mandatory on New Year’s ‎Day and on Yom Kippur, (Jubilee year) as opposed to other ‎occasions, such as public fast days decreed by the Rabbis. This is ‎based on G’d having requested that on these days we proclaim ‎Him as 1) King, 2) as the One Who remembers all that has ‎occurred in history, every individual’s thoughts, words and deeds, ‎and 3) has promised that by doing so through blowing the shofar, ‎this will beneficially effect how we are going to be judged on these ‎days. [Most of you are aware that the Mussaph ‎amidah on New’ Year’s day includes 10 verses from Scripture ‎referring to these three elements, malchiyot, zichronot, ‎‎shofarot, that distinguish this Day. Ed.]‎ As we have repeated on many occasions, G’d is interested in ‎the dispensing of His largesse to mankind, and especially us, His ‎people; the word ‎פנים‎, usually translated as “face, or presence,” ‎alludes to G’d being in a benevolent frame of mind vis a vis ‎mankind or His people, whereas the word ‎אחור‎, usually translated ‎as “rear, or backward,” allude to times when G’d is angry at ‎mankind or, G’d forbid, His people.‎ By addressing the whole nation as “standing” ‎לפני‎ (from ‎פנים‎) ‎before the Lord when He is in benevolent frame of mind, Moses ‎hints that the reason that G’d is in such a frame of mind is ‎because He is not only G’d, but “your G’d,” i.e. you have related to ‎Him as your Patron. The author adds another nuance of the word ‎פנים‎, tracing it to the root ‎פנה‎, to turn, change direction. G’d is ‎looking for a reason to aim His largesse in your direction. ‎[Seeing that in verse 17 the Torah uses the word ‎פנה‎ ‎also negatively, i.e. as turning away from G’d, when it writes: ‎אשר ‏לבבו פונה היום מעם ה' אלוקינו‎, “whose heart turns away from being ‎with the Lord our G’d,” and we do not find the word ‎אחור‎ in that ‎context, it is difficult to accept the author’s definition of ‎פנים ‏ואחור‎. Ed.]‎"
29,9,Jewish Thought,"Kol Dodi Dofek, Mournful Thoughts of Confession 1","Let us pose a simple question: Did we not sin with respect to the first covenant, the Covenant ‎of ‎Shared Fate (as in the Covenant of Encampment-Nation), with regard to our obligation ‎to ‎participate in the pain of the nation and to see and feel its suffering: as it is said, “And ‎He ‎witnessed their burdens” (Exodus 2:11)? Let us be honest. During the terrible Holocaust, ‎when ‎European Jewry was systematically destroyed in gas chambers and crematoria, the ‎American ‎Jewish community did not rise to the occasion, and did not acquit itself as a community ‎with the ‎collective consciousness of shared fate, shared suffering and shared action with which it ‎should ‎have been expected to act. We did not properly sense the suffering of the nation, and we ‎did ‎precious little to save our unfortunate brethren. It is hard to know what we could ‎have ‎accomplished had we been more active. I personally think we could have saved many. No ‎doubt, ‎however, if we had properly felt the pain of our brothers; had we raised our voices and ‎shaken ‎worlds, that Roosevelt issue a sharp warning of protest accompanied by action, we would ‎have ‎been able to significantly slow the process of mass destruction. We witnessed the most ‎horrible ‎tragedy in our history, and we were silent. I shall not now dwell on the particulars. It is ‎an ‎extremely painful chapter. We all sinned by our silence in the face of the murder of millions. Do ‎we ‎not all stand before God’s seat of judgment charged with the grievous sin of “You shall not ‎stand ‎idly by the blood of your neighbor” (Leviticus 19:16), especially when the sin applies not only ‎to one ‎individual but to millions? When I say “we” I mean all of us: including myself, the members ‎of ‎rabbinic and lay organizations both Orthodox and secular, and Jewish political organizations of ‎all ‎persuasions. “Your leaders, tribal heads, elders, and policemen, every person in Israel … from ‎the ‎hewers of your wood to the drawers of your water” (Deuteronomy 29:9–10). Do you know ‎why ‎we were so indifferent? I think it is because our sense of nationhood was damaged. We did ‎not ‎grasp the notion of the experience of Shared Fate and the essence of peoplehood. We ‎were ‎missing the attribute of loving-kindness that Job, at first, also lacked. Job, who suffered, ‎was ‎devoid of a sense of shared experience and therefore did not know how to pray for his ‎brothers. ‎His concern was only for his own and his family’s wellbeing. We were also devoid of the ‎sense of ‎‎[the Covenant of] Encampment-Nation and therefore did not offer heart-felt prayers, nor ‎did we ‎take any bold measures to save our brothers.‎"
29,9,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 2","“You are standing here today .…” (Devarim, 29:9) “You are standing” after all the acceptance of punishment, which serves to clarify who will stand on his faith and accept it, not weakening in his resolve. Whoever does not truly believe will not want to accept warnings and punishments, for falsehood does not endure but the truth endures."
29,10,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 3","“… your heads, your tribes, your elders and officers, each man in Israel, your infants and women, your convert that is in the midst of your camps, from your wood choppers to your water carriers .…” (Devarim, 29:9) The verse mentions ten levels, five against five, and all as one are included among Israel. “Your head,” means those possessing Chochma (wisdom) are placed in juxtaposition to the infants (also small children), for infant, taf in Hebrew, is connected to the word for “drop,” tipah in Hebrew, meaning that they possess only a small amount of consciousness (da’at, also “knowledge”). Then accordingly, when any mistake happens even to the youngest children, it affects even the heads, for the taf possessed a little consciousness from the head. “Your tribes,” meaning expansion, for all of Israel were hidden in the root of Yaakov Avinu, and there they were as one soul. Thus when they were divided into tribes certain souls in different generations experienced expansion. This is in juxtaposition to the women, because all expansion comes from birth, for when the child is hidden and included in the soul of the father then there is no expansion; only when the child is born does it begin to expand. “Your elders” means the one who has acquired wisdom. “Your elders,” is juxtaposed to “your convert,” for according to the original insights into the Torah made among Israel, so will converts come to and increase among Israel. The more we increase words of Torah, and thus experience greater expansion, then correspondingly the holiness of Israel extends even to the souls of the nations, and they will be gathered among Israel. (See Likutei Moharan 17, “His (Mordechei’s) fame spread through the provinces” (Ester 9:4) how his words of Torah traveled through the spiritual network and reached the nations: Causing, “Many of the people of the land became Jewish” (Ibid 8:17) [Hagahot Peretz])  “Your officers” are the God fearing, and they are placed in juxtaposition to the “wood choppers,” for “chopping” represents anger, and on this the Holy One, blessed be He, testifies that within all the anger in Israel there is the fear of God. (The great energy they expend in chopping comes the quality of gevurah – from whose fallen aspect comes anger. [Hagahot Peretz])  “Every man of Israel” means the attribute of the love of God, and this is placed against the “water carriers,” for water is compared to desire, as said in various places, (See note 23.)  and all desire and love in Israel comes from God."
29,9,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 29:9:1","אתם נצבים ....ראשיכם שבטיכם, “You are standing…. The heads of your tribes, etc.” Rashi understands this verse as referring to ”the heads of your tribes,” as if the Torah had written לשבטיכם.
    Nachmanides interprets the grammatical anomaly differently. The word כלכם, “all of you,” is to be understood as a headline, whereas with the words ראשיכם Moses begins to enumerate the different groups of people that are made up by the term כלכם, “all of you.” He understands the words: זקניכם ושוטריכם as meaning that the elders and the law-enforcers are the ones who constitute the people’s heads. Moses had first referred to as ראשיכם, “your heads.” An elderly, white-haired person is normally considered as the “head” of the community in which he resides, [when there was such a thing as a patriarchal society. Ed.] Moreover, anyone who has been endowed by the people with a degree of administrative power is considered part of the “heads of the people.” Moses adds that the entire people were present down to the youngest members, the טף, and even recent proselytes. The latter were the surviving members of the ערב רב, the mixed multitude that had climbed on the Jewish bandwagon at the Exodus. Moses also divides the people into social strata, that is why he points out that even the lowest social strata, the choppers of wood and the carriers of water, were present on the occasion mentioned. Everyone present was included in the covenant, and, as we shall hear shortly, even the as yet unborn. Quite possibly, Moses considered that the very presence of even the infants ensured that they too received credit for wanting to be included in this covenant, similar to the interpretation by our sages that the reason why the mothers brought their small children was in order to hear the king or the High Priest read the Torah publicly once in seven years on the second day of the Sukkot festival, the occasion known as Hakhel. Our sages, (Tanchuma among others) some of whom feel that there were isolated cases of Canaanites wanting to convert to Judaism even while the Israelites were still in the desert, say that these are the ones described here as hewers of wood and carriers of water. Although Moses did not make a treaty with them, he accepted them as slaves and they had undertaken to observe the seven commandments applicable to all of mankind. The difference between those and the Gibeonites in the days of Joshua, was that the latter deceived the Israelites by misrepresenting their origin. The former simply wanted to make peace with the Jews, as they would have had an opportunity to do prior to an attack on them.

Then will I remember My covenant with Jacob (Our verse literally reads, “Then will I remember My covenant Jacob.” Hence I.E.’s comment.)  is to be interpreted as if written, Then will I remember My covenant, My covenant with Jacob. Compare, even the prophesy, Oded the prophet (Translated literally.)

The Gaon says that the reason Scripture mentions Jacob first (Scripture usually lists the patriarchs in order. It starts with Abraham and concludes with Jacob. However, here it starts with Jacob. Hence I.E.’s comment.)  is that all of his years were in the covenant. (The covenant that God made with Abraham. See Gen. 17:1-14. Jacob was born after God entered into the covenant with Abraham. Thus Jacob spent his entire life under the covenant. This was not the case with Abraham. Isaac also was born under the covenant. However, Scripture did not start with him, for one cannot start a list from the middle.) "

And they exist now, for it is said: Ye are standing this day (Deut. 29:9), But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive, every one of you this day (ibid. 4:4); that they will exist in the future is indicated in the verse And they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in the day that I do make, even Mine own treasure; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him (Mal. 3:17)."

Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, Rabbi Yishmael taught: “The enemy said: I will pursue, I will overtake” (Exodus 15:9), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the song. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “it was on the eighth day” (Leviticus 9:1), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “you are standing today” (Deuteronomy 29:9), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “The Lord said to Joshua: This day I will begin to exalt you” (Joshua 3:7), it would have been appropriate for this to be written at the beginning of the book. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “hear, kings, listen, princes” (Judges 5:3), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the song. Why is it written here? It is because there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “in the year of the death of King Uziyahu” (Isaiah 6:1), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book, but there is no chronological order in the Torah. Similarly, “Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem” (Jeremiah 2:2), it would have been appropriate for this to be the beginning of the book, but there is no chronological order in the Torah.

Rabbi Onya said: Commoner, king, commoner; fool, wise man, fool; poor man, wealthy man, poor man. What is the reason? “I, Kohelet, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.” (This is stated in past tense, implying that Solomon is recalling the days when he was king.

29,9,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 13:2","Ezra instituted the practice of having the Jews read the ""curses"" found in the Book of Leviticus before Shavuot, and those found in the Book of Deuteronomy before Rosh HaShanah. It is common custom to read [the sidrah,] Bemidbar Sinai before Shavuot, [the sidrah,] Va'etchanan after Tish'ah B'Av, [the sidrah,] Attem nitzavim before Rosh HaShanah, and [the sidrah,] Tzav et Aharon before Pesach in an ordinary year. Therefore, there are Sabbaths on which two sedarim are read: for example, [the sidrah,] Ishah ki tazria and [the sidrah,] Vezot tih'yeh torat hametzora [are often combined. Similarly, the sidrah,] Im bechukotai [is often combined] with [the sidrah,] Behar Sinai, so that [the reading of the Torah] will be completed in a year, and the sedarim will be read at the appropriate times."
29,9,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Blessings 2:3","The blessing for Eretz Yisrael should include an acknowledgement of thanks [to God] at its beginning and at its conclusion. (In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam relates that this blessing begins, ""We offer thanks to You, God, our Lord..."" and states, shortly before its conclusion, ""For all these, God, our Lord, we give thanks to You."" An omission of the second mention of thanks, however, does not require the repetition of grace (Shulchan Aruch HaRav 187:4).)  It should conclude: ""[Blessed are You, God,] for the land and for the sustenance."" (This is a single expression of thanks, acknowledging God's gift of ""a land which produces sustenance"" (Berachot 49a).)  Whoever does not include the phrase ""a precious, good, and spacious land"" (This expression is a combination of the praises of Eretz Yisrael mentioned in Jeremiah 3:19 and Exodus 3:8.)  in the blessing for Eretz Yisrael does not fulfill his obligation. (Unless one mentions these qualities, one has not adequately expressed one's appreciation for Eretz Yisrael. The omission of this phrase requires the repetition of the grace. See Halachah 12.)  A person must mention the covenant [of circumcision] (Rashi (Berachot 48b) explains that the mitzvah of circumcision is connected with God's promise of Eretz Yisrael to Abraham, as Genesis 17:8-10 states: ""I will give you and your descendants... the entire land of Canaan.... You shall keep My covenant.... Circumcise every male."")  and the Torah [in this blessing], (Rashi (loc. cit.) notes that a similar connection applies with regard to the Torah, as Deuteronomy 8:1 states: ""Observe all the mitzvot which I am commanding you... so that you will... inherit the land that God promised to your ancestors."" The phraseology used by the Rambam indicates that he does not require the repetition of the grace if either of these points is omitted. Other authorities (including the Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 187:3) differ and require the repetition of grace in such an instance.)  mentioning the covenant before the Torah. [The reason for this order (which gives priority to the covenant)  is] that the covenant mentioned in the blessing for Eretz Yisrael refers to the covenant of circumcision, concerning which thirteen covenants [are mentioned in the Torah]. (Note the conclusion of Hilchot Milah, where the Rambam enumerates these thirteen expressions.)  In contrast, [the Torah mentions only] three covenants with regard to the Torah, as [Deuteronomy 28:69] states: ""These are the words of the covenant... in addition to the covenant He established with you at Chorev,"" and [Deuteronomy 29:9-11] states: ""You are standing... to establish a covenant."" (The Lechem Mishneh notes that there are several other verses that refer to a covenant with regard to the Torah. These three, however, are unique in that they refer to the establishment of a covenant regarding the bond between the Jews and the Torah.1. Berachot 49a mentions both these possibilities. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam quotes the former expression.2. The beginning of a blessing must share the same theme as its conclusion. Nevertheless, the rebuilding of Jerusalem shares a connection with God's showing mercy to the people of Israel, since the rebuilding of Jerusalem is an expression of God's mercy to the Jewish people (Berachot, loc. cit.).3. Although Berachot (loc. cit.) mentions that two different concepts should not be mentioned in the conclusion of a blessing, this version of the blessing does not contradict that rule. The intent is a single request that Israel be granted the ultimate comfort, the rebuilding of Jerusalem.4. Rashi, Berachot 48b, mentions another reason for the mention of the House of David. It was David who conquered Jerusalem and established the holiness of the city. 5. Since an integral element of our celebration of the Sabbath and festivals is eating festive meals, the sacred element of the day should be mentioned in the grace recited after partaking of those meals. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the day does not require a blessing in its own right, nor is it made the essential element of the third blessing. Therefore, one begins and concludes that blessing in the same manner as is done during the week (Rashi, Tosafot, Berachot 48b).6. The order in which these alternatives are mentioned in this halachah is the reverse of that mentioned in the previous halachah. It can be explained that in the previous halachah, the Rambam mentioned the text he considered most appropriate first. The order he mentions in this halachah, however, is closer to the expression used by our Sages in Berachot (loc. cit.), the source for this halachah.7. Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. With regard to Rosh HaShanah, see the commentary on Halachah 13.8. Shabbat 24a explains that since an additional sacrifice (korban musaf) is offered on these days, they possess an element of sanctity that is worthy of mention. As obvious from the contrast of Halachah 12 to Halachah 13, however, there is a difference between the obligation to mention these days and the obligation to mention Sabbaths and festivals. 9. Since Chanukah and Purim are Rabbinic holidays which are not associated with an additional sacrificial offering, they are not mentioned in the third blessing. The second blessing is more appropriate for the mention of the miracles of these holidays, since it is an expression of thanks to God (Shabbat 24a). The Kessef Mishneh and the Lechem Mishneh note that from Shabbat (loc. cit.), it would appear that while permission is granted to mention Chanukah and Purim in the second blessing, it is not an obligation to do so. In contrast, the Rambam requires that they be mentioned. They explain that since the Sages of the Talmud were wont to mention these holidays in grace, and the Jerusalem Talmud (Berachot 7:6) considers their mention a binding obligation, the Rambam established their mention as a requirement. See also Halachah 13 and commentary.10. Precedence is given to the Sabbath because it occurs more frequently than the festivals and is on a higher spiritual level (Kessef Mishneh). 11. ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, 16King13 of the Universe, the God, who is our Father and our 16King13... the 16King13 who is good."" The reason for this stress on God's sovereignty in this blessing is that the blessing recited previously mentions the sovereignty of the House of David, and the Sages wanted to emphasize how all earthly kings are subordinate to a higher authority (Berachot 49a).12. The blessing mentioned is quoted from Berachot 46a. That source also contains additions to the blessing that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi would recite. 13. The Rambam's words are quoted from Berachot 46b, which relates that Mar Zutra recited this blessing. The Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah 379:14) relates that this blessing should be recited throughout the seven days of mourning by the mourners and by all who recite grace together with him when there is a zimun. Other opinions (based on Ketubot 8a) state that this blessing should be recited only when ten people recite grace together. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 207:7 writes that it is Ashkenazic custom to rely on this opinion, and hence, this blessing is generally not recited.14. Berachot (loc. cit.) relates several additions Mar Zutra made on the above occasion.15. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam includes several requests beginning with the word Harachaman (May the Merciful One...) in his text of grace. These requests were additions to the grace made by the Geonim, who lived in the era subsequent to the Talmud. 16. This refers to the final blessing quoted in Halachah 11.17. Nisu'in (marriage) is marked by the entry of a bride and groom into a private chamber together. This ceremony is referred to as chuppah and is accompanied by a celebration. See Hilchot Ishut, Chapter 10, and commentaries. As mentioned at the conclusion of the following halachah, according to the Rambam this blessing is recited only when ten adult males are present. The Shulchan Aruch (Even HaEzer 62:4) differs and maintains that it should be recited even when fewer than ten people are present. Note the Ramah (Even HaEzer 62:7) who states that today this blessing is never recited alone. If ""new faces"" - people who had not attended the wedding celebrations previously - are present, all seven blessings are recited. If no ""new faces"" are present (although ten males are), the meal is considered like a meal eaten by the bridegroom alone, and the blessing is not recited.18. The same laws applying to a widow or widower apply to a person who has been divorced. Significantly, in Hilchot Ishut 10:12, the Rambam states that even if a woman has been married before, her husband should celebrate with her for three days.19. Surely, this also applies when neither the bride nor groom have been married before. Hilchot Ishut (loc. cit.) states: ""The Sages ordained that everyone who marries a maiden should celebrate with her for seven days."" The differences between the time limits mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, are worthy of comparison. See the commentary on that halachah.20. Ketubot 8a states that after the first day of the wedding celebrations, Rav Ashi would recite the wedding blessings only when ""new faces"" were present. In his responsa, the Rambam's son states that his father required only two ""new faces."" Note the Beit Shmuel 64:7 who requires only one ""new face."" The Hagahot Maimoniot write that on the Sabbath the presence of new guests is not necessary, since the Sabbath itself is considered as ""guests.""21. Ketubot 7b derives this rule from the account of the wedding between Ruth and Boaz. Ruth 4:2 relates that Boaz invited ten men to witness the marriage. 22. Only six blessings are mentioned below; the seventh blessing is the blessing over the wine. (See Hilchot Ishut 10:4.)23. Rashi (Ketubot 7b) explains that this blessing is in praise of the creation of Adam, the first man. In Hilchot Ishut, where the text of the wedding blessings is repeated, this blessing follows the blessing ""who has created all things for His glory."" This order is the sequence in which these blessings are recited today. It appears more appropriate, particularly according to Rashi's commentary (loc. cit.), which explains that the blessing ""who has created all things..."" is not directly connected to the wedding itself, but rather is recited in appreciation of the guests who have come to celebrate together with the new couple. [The repetition of the text of the blessings in two separate halachot, something very out of character for the Rambam in the Mishneh Torah, has aroused the attention of the commentaries. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the text of the blessings here was added by the printers, and not by the Rambam himself.]24. Despite the fact that this blessing follows two (or three) blessings which begin with ""Blessed...,"" it also begins with ""Blessed...."" Among the explanations offered is that the first blessings are short, and if the line ""Blessed..."" were not mentioned, they would appear as a single blessing (Tosafot, Ketubot, loc. cit.).25. Rashi (loc. cit.) interprets this as a reference to the creation of woman, who was created from man (""his own self""), and gives him the potential for reproduction (""a structure that will last for all time"").26. ""The barren one"" refers to Jerusalem. Psalms 137:6 states: ""Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy."" Thus, at the height of the wedding celebration, we recall the holy city and pray that it be rebuilt. 27. This is a prayer that the bride and groom enjoy the happiness experienced by Adam in Eve before the first sin. Several manuscripts and early printings of the Mishneh Torah mention a different conclusion for this blessing, ""Blessed are You, God, who brings joy to His people, Israel, and rebuilds Jerusalem."" (In this context, note the commentary of the Lechem Mishneh.)28. The blessing joins our wishes for the happiness of the particular couple with our hope for the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The ultimate marriage relationship is the bond between God and the Jewish people, which will be realized in the Messianic age. Thus, the two themes, marriage and redemption, share an intrinsic link.29. Rashi, Ketubot 8a, explains the difference between the last two blessings. The fifth of the blessings concludes with a request that the bride and groom enjoy a lifetime of happiness and success together. The sixth and final blessing concludes with a request that they find happiness in each other, that their wedding joy be extended throughout their lives. Alternatively, the final blessing is a blessing for the Jewish people as a whole who find fulfillment in married life.) "
29,9,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Circumcision 3:9","Come and see how severe a matter circumcision is. Moses, our teacher, was not granted even a temporary respite from [fulfilling this mitzvah]. (As Exodus 4:24-26 relates, when Moses returned to Egypt, he took his newborn son, Eliezer, with him. He did not circumcise him immediately and, therefore, an angel came in the form of a snake and swallowed him. Tziporah his wife realized the source of the problem and circumcised her son. After this, the angel retracted. (See Nedarim 32a.))  The Torah mentions only three covenants regarding all its mitzvot, as [Deuteronomy 28:69] states: ""These are the words of the covenant that God commanded... in addition to the covenant that He established with you in Chorev."" And [Deuteronomy 29:9-11] states: ""You are all standing today... to enter into a covenant with God, your Lord."" Thus, there are three covenants. In contrast, thirteen covenants were established with Abraham, our Patriarch, with regard to circumcision: (In the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 49, the Rambam writes that the brit is a sign of the covenant of the oneness of God. ""When a person is circumcised he enters into the covenant of Abraham which obligates him to know [God's] unity."" This covenant of unity defines the nature of the Jewish people. It is natural that when people share a common sign, love and mutual assistance among them grow.)  ""I will place My covenant between Me and you"" [Genesis 17:2], ""And I, behold, My covenant is with you"" [ibid.:4], ""I will establish My covenant between Me and you"" [ibid.:7], ""For an eternal covenant"" [ibid.], ""And you shall observe My covenant"" [ibid.:9], ""This is My covenant which you shall observe"" [ibid.:10], ""It will be a sign of the covenant"" [ibid.:11], ""My covenant will be in your flesh"" [ibid.:13], ""For an eternal covenant"" [ibid.], ""He will have nullified My covenant"" [ibid.:14], ""And I will establish My covenant with Him"" [ibid.:19], ""For an eternal covenant"" [ibid.], ""And I will establish My covenant with Isaac"" [ibid.:21]."

He overturned the works of the Egyptians, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Exod. 14:28): AND NOT SO MUCH AS ONE OF THEM REMAINED. He overturned the works of Babylon, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Is. 14:22): AND FROM BABYLON I WILL CUT OFF NAME, REMNANT, OFFSPRING, AND POSTERITY…. Moreover, David has said about all of them (in Ps. 36:13 [12]): THERE THE EVILDOERS HAVE FALLEN; THEY ARE THRUST DOWN AND CANNOT RISE. When Israel falls, however, it stands up , as stated (in Micah 7:8): REJOICE NOT OVER ME, O MY ENEMY; WHEN I FALL, I SHALL ARISE…. It also says (in Mal. 3:6): FOR I THE LORD DO NOT CHANGE; AND YOU, O CHILDREN OF JACOB, ARE NOT DESTROYED (rt.: KLH). R. Hanina bar Pappa said: The Holy One said: I have never smitten a people and restored them, but you children of Jacob are not destroyed, as stated (in Deut. 32:23): I WILL USE UP (rt.: KLH) MY ARROWS ON THEM. My arrows are used up (rt.: KLH) but they are not destroyed (rt.: KLH). And so has the assembly of Israel said (in Lam. 3:12): HE HAS BENT HIS BOW; HE HAS SET ME AS A TARGET FOR THE ARROW. To what is the matter comparable? To a warrior who raises up the  post and shoots the arrows at them (sic). The arrows are used up (rt.: KLH), but the post stands. So it is also with Israel. Every time that afflictions came upon them, the afflictions ended, and they were standing in their place. Ergo it is stated (in Prov. 12:7): THE WICKED ARE OVERTURNED AND ARE NO MORE. [….]"
29,9,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nitzavim 2:1","[(Deut. 29:9 [10]:) YOU ARE STANDING TODAY.] Hezekiah the son of R. Hiyya said: Why is this parashah next to the parashah on curses (i.e., Deut. 27:11–28:69 [29:1]). (Tanh., Deut. 8:1, cont.; Rashi on Deut. 29:12.)  Because Israel heard a hundred curses less two in this parashah, apart from the forty-nine which are uttered in the Priestly Torah (i.e., in Leviticus). They immediately turned green in the face and said: Who can withstand these ? Moses called them immediately (in Deut. 29:1 [2]) and pacified them with words (i.e., with Deut. 29:9 [10].)"
29,9,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nitzavim 3:1","What is written above on the matter (in Deut. 29:1–2, 6 [2–3, 7])? THEN MOSES SUMMONED ALL THE {ELDERS OF} ISRAEL [AND SAID UNTO THEM]: YOU HAVE SEEN  …, THE GREAT TRIALS …. WHEN YOU CAME UNTO THIS PLACE, . Now in your case, for what reason were you not destroyed? After all, you did not heed my voice, and you uttered words before me for which you deserved destruction. Still I did not wreak destruction upon you, when it is stated (in Ps. 106:7): WHEN OUR ANCESTORS WERE IN EGYPT, THEY DID NOT CONSIDER YOUR WONDROUS WORKS…. And not only that but they said of the calf (in Exod. 32:4): THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL. Now if you should say: For what reason are the nations of the world deserving destruction, while we are remaining alive? It is because, when afflictions come upon them, they kick against them and do not recognize the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 79:6): POUR OUT YOUR WRATH UPON THE NATIONS THAT HAVE NOT KNOWN YOU,…. In the case of Israel, however, when afflictions come upon them, they submit, as stated (in Ps. 116:3–4): I FOUND TROUBLE AND SORROW, BUT I SHALL INVOKE THE NAME OF THE LORD. Therefore the Holy One said: even though maledictions were coming upon you, they themselves were raising you up; and so it says (in Deut. 8:16):  IN ORDER TO HUMBLE YOU AND IN ORDER TO TEST YOU, SO AS TO BENEFIT YOU IN THE END. Thus did Moses say to Israel: Even though afflictions come upon you, you have a standing. (Amidah. This word is also the name of the central Eighteen Benedictions in the daily liturgy, which are always recited standing. The implication is that Israel always has a standing before the Holy One through liturgical prayer.)  It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): YOU {it is therefore stated: YOU} ARE STANDING."
29,9,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nitzavim 4:1","Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9 [10]): YOU ARE STANDING TODAY . Just as TODAY (literally: THE DAY) sometimes darkens and sometimes lightens, so it is with you. Although you have darkness, the Holy One is going to shine on you with light eternal, as stated (in Is. 60:19): FOR THE LORD SHALL BE YOUR EVERLASTING LIGHT. When? When you all become one group, as stated (in Deut. 4:4): [BUT YOU WHO CLUNG TO THE LORD YOUR GOD] ARE ALL ALIVE TODAY. According to universal custom, if one takes a group of reeds, will he be able to break them at one stroke! But if he takes them one by one, even an infant can break them. So also you find that Israel was not redeemed until they became one group, as stated (in Jer. 50:4): IN THOSE DAYS AND AT THAT TIME, SAYS THE LORD, THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, THEY AND THE CHILDREN OF JUDAH, SHALL COME TOGETHER. It also says (In Jer. 3:18): [IN THOSE DAYS] THE HOUSE OF JUDAH SHALL GO WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL, AND THEY SHALL COME TOGETHER FROM THE LAND OF THE NORTH. When they are united, they shall welcome the face of the Divine Presence."
29,9,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nitzavim 5:1","(Deut. 29:9 [10]:)  YOUR TRIBAL LEADERS, . Although I have appointed for you heads, judges, elders, and law officers, you shall all be equal before me, since it is stated (ibid., cont.): EVERY PERSON IN ISRAEL. (Tanh., Deut. 8:2.) "
29,9,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nitzavim 5:2","Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9 [10]): All of you are responsible for each other. Even though there is  one righteous person among you, you all shall survive (literally: stand) through his merit; and not only you, but the whole world in toto, as stated (in Prov. 10:25): BUT A RIGHTEOUS PERSON IS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE WORLD. (A more common translation would be: BUT A RIGHTEOUS PERSON IS AN EVERLASTING FOUNDATION.)  However, when one sins, the whole generation is stricken, and so you find in the case of Achan (in Josh. 22:20): WAS IT NOT ACHAN BEN ZERAH WHO COMMITTED [EMBEZZLEMENT] IN THE PROSCRIPTION (i.e., the herem of Jericho)? YET  WRATH CAME UPON THE WHOLE [CONGREGATION OF] ISRAEL, SINCE HE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE TO DIE FOR HIS SIN. If when the measure of punishment was small, the  generation was seized, how much the more , when the measure of  favor is great. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): EVERY PERSON IN ISRAEL; and not only the great ones who are among us, but (according to vs. 10 [11]) YOUR LITTLE ONES, YOUR WIVES, AND THE ALIEN. It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10]): EVERY PERSON. Now flesh and blood shows more mercy over males than over females, but the Holy One is not like that. Rather (according to Ps. 145:9),  AND HIS MERCY IS UPON ALL HIS WORKS, upon males and upon females, upon the righteous and upon the wicked, as stated (in Deut. 29:9 [10], cont.): FROM THE ONE WHO CHOPS YOUR WOOD TO THE ONE WHO DRAWS YOUR WATER. R. Isaac ben Tavlay said:  teaches that, when the Gibeonites came to [Moses he did not accept them; but when they came to] Joshua, he did accept them. (According to Josh. 9:27, Joshua gave these menial tasks to the Gibeonites.)  Thus it is stated (in Josh. 9:4): AND THEY ALSO ACTED WITH CUNNING. What is the meaning of THEY ALSO?  teaches that they had come to Moses, and he had not accepted them."
29,9,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 26:37:1","וכשלו איש באחיו, “they will stumble over one another, etc.” According to Sanhedrin 27 the Torah means that they will stumble each over the sins committed by the other, i.e. their reciprocal responsibility which they disregarded became their undoing. This is also what Moses had in mind in Deut. 29,9 when he described each Israelite as “standing upright” at that time, (i.e. not stumbling over his fellow’s sins). The example for this reciprocal responsibility was illustrated most powerfully when because of failure to admonish Achan who had taken money from the loot of Jericho declared sacred for the Temple, this sin became the cause of Israel losing its first campaign after the capture of Jericho. (compare Joshua chapter seven with special emphasis on verse 11) [Contrary to Moses who had asked G’d in connection with Korach why the sin of one man should cause G’d’s anger against a whole nation, in Achan’s case G’d spelled out that it did. Ed.] G’d tells Joshua that “Israel has sinned;” He did not tell him that “an Israelite had sinned.” The whole nation was held responsible for the sin of an individual. An accessory after the fact, i.e. someone who does not admonish the sinner has made himself his partner. Seeing that what Achan had done could not have been concealed completely, there had already been many accessories.  This incident prompted the sages in Shir Hashirim Rabbah 6,16 to comment that the use of the word ""nut” in אל גנת האגוז ירדתי, “I went down to the nut-grove” (Song of Songs 6,11), describes that just as it is impossible to pluck one walnut without making the whole tree shake, so it is impossible for an individual to commit a sin without ripples of what he did affecting the entire Jewish people. This is what had bothered Moses in Numbers 16,22: “one man sinned and You are angry at the whole congregation!”"
29,9,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:9:3-4","אתם נצבים היום כלכם, ראשיכם, שבטיכם וזקניכם ושוטריכם כל איש ישראל, “You are all standing upright here his day, your chiefs, your tribes, all the men of your elders, your law-enforcers, all the men of Israel.” All of the Israelites were assembled there in one place in anticipation of the renewal of the covenant just as they had all been assembled on the occasion of the first covenant at Mount Sinai. Seeing the people had been unfaithful to the first covenant when they had said (about the golden calf) “these are your gods O Israel” (Exodus 32,4), there had arisen the need to conclude a second covenant with this generation in the wilderness of Moav which the people had to confirm with an oath and a curse in the event that they would again dishonour their commitment. This is the reason Moses used the preamble: “you are standing here upright, all of you in the presence of the Lord your G’d.” Moses meant to compare the present assembly to the one 40 years earlier at Mount Sinai. Whereas on that occasion Israel’s word, unsupported by an explicit oath, had been deemed sufficient, this time they were required to confirm their undertaking by an oath. It is possible to understand that our verse contains 2 promises: 1) that the Jewish people would endure and would never become extinct but would survive (as a people) all future catastrophes befalling mankind. 2) that the people would merit life in the hereafter if they would observe the commandments of the Torah. The need to give the people this assurance arose out of the fact that if they were to experience the full brunt of the curses mentioned in the previous portion, they would surely think that this spelled their doom. Moses therefore reminded them that just as they were all standing before him upright and well now, so they would emerge from even the worst aspects of the afflictions listed in the Torah and would be rehabilitated. The effect of the afflictions suffered in this life would be to erase the impact of their sins so that their claim to a life in the world to come would remain intact. This is what was meant when the Torah wrote in Deut. 6,25: “it will be a merit for us if we are careful to perform this entire commandment before Hashem.” This is the assurance of life in the hereafter. This is also a meaning of the word כלכם which is an allusion to the statement of the sages in Sanhedrin 90 that כל ישראל יש להם חלק בעולם הבא, that “the entire Jewish nation has a share in the hereafter.” A Midrashic view (Tanchuma Nitzavim 1) of the words: “you are all standing here upright this day;” just as this day commences in darkness, the darkness later giving way to light, so the darkness that you find yourself in as a result of enduring the afflictions listed previously will be replaced by bright light,” as described by Isaiah 60,19: “the Lord will become for you an eternal light and your G’d will be your source of splendour.”"
29,9,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:9:5","ראשיכם שבטיכם, “your heads (leaders), your tribes, etc.” The meaning is: “your heads, who are the leaders of your respective tribes.” Moses listed the more distinguished people first, afterwards the adult males, followed by the male children who were under age, followed by the women, concluding with the proselytes."
29,9,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:9:6","כל איש ישראל, “every man in Israel.” The sages in Tanchuma Nitzavim 1 use this expression to teach us that every man in Israel is co-responsible for the sin of every other Israelite. They bring practical proof for this from Joshua 7,11 where G’d told Joshua that the sin of one man, Achan ben Karmi, was the reason that the entire people had suffered a military setback at the hands of a small town, Ai. The words describing Achan’s sin are: “Israel has sinned.” This spells out the extent to which every Israelite shares in the sin of another Israelite. [Obviously, there are degrees in such sharing of another Israelite’s sin. Ed.] This is also why we read in Leviticus 26,37: וכשלו איש באחיו, “they shall stumble one over the other.” Our sages in Sanhedrin 27 interpret these words as meaning “they shall stumble over the sins of one another.” This teaches the principle of reciprocal responsibility of one Israelite for the conduct of (all) other Israelites. If such reciprocal responsibility extends to all Israelites sharing misfortune on account of the sins committed by a few, how much more so will it apply to the reciprocal entitlement to enjoyment by all Israelites of good fortune (life in the hereafter), the entitlement to which was merited by the few! This is the meaning of the words of Eliphaz to Job ימלט אי נקי, “he will deliver the guilty; He will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.” (Job 22,30) In other words, a single individual with “clean” hands can be the instrument through which all the inhabitants of an island are saved. One single individual whose lifestyle is beyond reproach may save [for a period of time, Ed.] all his peers from impending doom. It follows that seeing while a righteous person is alive he saves his compatriots from doom, the death of such a man is a signal for all his compatriots to repent their sins, as they have been deprived of the protective merit of this righteous person. We have a principle that מדה טובה מרובה על מדת פורענות, that the range of the application of measures of good exceeds the range of the application of measures of evil. Hence if the righteous shares in the guilt of the sinner, the sinner benefits even more strongly from the merits accumulated by the righteous (Sotah 11)."
29,9,Talmud,Shevuot 29a:12,"The Gemara suggests: Come and hear a baraita: And so we found that when Moses administered an oath to Israel that they would keep the Torah (see Deuteronomy 29:9–12), he said to them: Know that I am not administering this oath according to your understanding but according to the understanding of the Omnipresent and according to my understanding. And why not let him simply say to them: Keep that which God said? Is it not that he insisted on admonishing them because he was concerned lest they direct the oath in their minds to idolatry, saying that they are taking an oath of loyalty to God but privately intending the oath to be for idolatry? This indicates that the content of an oath can be affected by an oath taker’s private meaning."
29,9,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:9:1","This teaches that Moshe gathered them, etc. You might ask: From where does Rashi know this? Perhaps he did not gather them but rather each one remained in his encampment and Moshe stood in the middle? Furthermore, why does Rashi explain To introduce them into the covenant”? This is explicitly written in the verse? The answer is that he explains to introduce them into the covenant as this proves that he gathered them together, since one cannot make a covenant except through a rite of passage as we see later (v. 11). If so, since the verse writes that He introduced them into a covenant, Moshe must have uprooted them from their place and gathered them together, in order to perform this rite of passage with them into the covenant. "
29,9,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:9:2","On the day that he died, to introduce them into the covenant. Since it is written this day it implies, this day my years are complete, i.e., this day I will die. ([See] Re”m). Alternatively, if you do not say this, why did he gather them now more than during the entire forty years? It is understandable if it was the day of his death, because if not now, then when? But if it was not the day of his death, why [do it] now more than the entire forty years? "
29,9,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:9:3","Your chieftains of your tribes. Otherwise, if it means your chieftains and your tribes, each category by itself, why mention the chieftains at all? Once it writes your tribes the chieftains are included? And also, why mention the other details since all are included in your tribes”? This is no difficulty if the verse means your chieftains of your tribes, for you can say that the verse first mentions your chieftains, then your elders, afterwards your law officers, and afterwards all of Yisrael, i.e., the more prominent being listed first. But if your chieftains and your tribes are two entities, why mention chieftains at all? And if you ask: Why does it write ראשיכם (your chieftains) and not ראשי שבטיכם (the chieftains of your tribes)? The answer is to teach us that the prince of the generation is equal to the entire generation. "
29,9,Musar,"Shemirat HaLashon, Book I, Epilogue 7:2","And, in truth, how great is this mitzvah in the eyes of the Blessed L-rd, it being written (Michah 6:8): ""He has told you, O man, what is good, and what the L-rd requires of you — but to do justice and to love chesed, etc."" And Chazal have said (Succah 49b): ""'to do justice' — this is din; 'and to love chesed' — this is gemiluth chasadim."" And he also fulfills in this the mitzvah of (Devarim 29:9): ""And you shall walk in His ways,"" as we find in Sifrei on the verse (Ibid. 10:12): ""'to walk in all His ways' — these are the ways of the Holy One Blessed be He, as it is written (Shemoth 34:6): 'Hashem, Hashem, the G-d who is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in chesed, etc.'"" And Chazal say (Bava Metzia 30b): ""R.

29,9,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:9:2,"It appears that what Moses wanted with this new covenant was to make the Israelites responsible for one another in their מצוה-performance. Each Jew has to see to it that his fellow Jew does not stumble and commit sins. The proof that this is what Moses had in mind here is to be found in verse 28 of our chapter where the Israelites are relieved of their responsibility when the nature of the sin committed is one that is secret. The Torah emphasises הנגלות, ""publicly committed sins,"" must be dealt with by ourselves. It is clear that that verse speaks of the mutual responsibility of one Jew for the conduct of another. Naturally, the degree to which we have to carry out this responsibility varies with our position in the community."
29,9,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:9:3,"Let us now understand the meaning of the words: ""you are standing here today."" We may best understand this by referring to Ruth,2,5 נצב על הקוצרים, ""the one standing over the reapers."" The word in Ruth means ""the one appointed over the reapers."" Moses added the word כלכם, ""all of you,"" to make plain that the mutual responsibility with which he charged each member of the people applied to one and all. We have been taught in Shabbat 54 that anyone who is in a position to protest a sin being committed by a fellow Jew, and who does not exercise his power of protest will be considered as an accessory to that sin. Some people's authority extends to their entire city whereas others may have authority to do this only within the walls of their own houses. Every Jew is responsible in the parameter where he can enforce his will. ראשיכם refers to the highly placed individuals in society. Such people share in the responsibility of the conduct of the whole nation. שבטיכם refers to heads of tribes, whereas זקניכם ושוטריכם, refers to heads of households, ""your elders and law enforcement officers."" Finally, כל איש ישראל, every man of this people possesses some influence over other members of his household. At this point the Torah interrupts before continuing with its reference to children, women, and proselytes. They are listed separately as they are the ones who will not become accessories when they do not admonish fellow Jews about their duties to perform the commandments. Children are not culpable as they do not understand the meaning of sin. How could they be expected to call their elders to order? The same applies to the women. Proselytes most certainly cannot be expected to call to order Jews who are natural born Jews. Our sages explained in Yevamot 45 that Deut. 17,15 שום תשים עליך מלך, is restrictive and means that only a fellow Jew may be appointed over you. However, we know from Niddah 13 that there is an obligation for Jews to call proselytes to order, and that Jews who fail to do so may find themselves culpable as accessories if the proselyte commits a sin."
29,9,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:9:4,"Something deeper hinted to in the meaning of the words you all standing... is that all those who are distant from holiness (transgressors), their 'standing' is lowly and their heads are sullen; however for THIS it is written 'you all standing...' to be standing in front of Hashem--to be before Hashem...[even they] should stand and raise their heads!"

29,9,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Nitzavim 1:1","(Deut. 29:9:) “You are standing today.” This text is related (to Prov. 12:7), “The wicked are overturned (rt.: hpk) and are no more, but the house of the righteous shall stand.” Every time that the Holy One, blessed be He, looks at the works of the wicked and turns (rt.: hpk) them over (examines them), there is no recovery for them. He turned over the works of the generation of the flood, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Gen. 7:23), “And he wiped out all living things.” He turned over the works of the Sodomites, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Gen. 19:25), “And he overturned those cities.” He turned over the works of the Egyptians, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Exod. 14:28), “and not so much as one of them remained.” He turned over the works of Babylon, and there was no recovery for them, as stated (in Is. 14:22), “and from Babylon i will cut off name, remnant, offspring, and posterity.” Moreover, David has said about all of them (in Ps. 36:13), “There the evildoers have fallen; they are thrust down and cannot rise.” When Israel falls, however, it stands up [again], as stated (in Micah 7:8), “Rejoice not over me, O my enemy; when I fall, I shall arise….” It also says (in Mal. 3:6), “For I the Lord do not change; [and you, O Children of Jacob, are not destroyed (rt.: klh).” R. Hanina bar Pappa said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘I have never smitten a people and [restored] them, but (according to Mal. 3:6), “you Children of Jacob are not destroyed,”’ This is as stated (in Deut. 32:23), ‘I will use up (rt.: klh) My arrows on them,’ [meaning that] My arrows are used up (rt.: klh) but they are not destroyed (rt.: klh).” And so has the assembly of Israel said (in Lam. 3:12), “He has bent his bow; he has set me as a target for the arrow.” To what is the matter comparable? To a warrior who raises up the [target] post and shoots the arrows at them. The arrows are used up (rt.: klh), but the post stands. So it is also with Israel. Every time that afflictions came upon them, the afflictions ended, and they were standing in their place. Ergo it is stated (in Prov. 12:7), “The wicked are overturned and are no more.” Hezekiah the son of R. Hiyya said, “Why is this parashah next to the parashah about curses (i.e., Deut. 27:11-28:69)? (Rashi on Deut. 29:12.)  Because Israel heard a hundred curses less two in this parashah, apart from the forty-nine which are uttered in the priestly Torah (i.e., in Leviticus). They immediately turned green in the face and said, ‘Who can withstand these [curses]?’ Moses called them immediately (in Deut. 29:1) and pacified them with [the words from Deut. 29:9].” What is written above the matter (in Deut. 29:1-2, 6)? “Then Moses summoned all of Israel [and said unto them, ‘You have seen all that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt,] …. The great trials [which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders]. When you came unto this place, [Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to engage us in battle; but we defeated them].” And you did not heed My voice, and you uttered words before Me for which you deserved destruction. Still I did not wreak destruction upon you, when it is stated (in Ps. 106:7), “When our ancestors were in Egypt, they did not consider Your wondrous works….” And not only that, but they said of the calf (in Exod. 32:4), “This is your god, O Israel.” Now if you should say, “For what reason did the [other] nations deserve destruction, while we are remaining alive?” It is because when afflictions come upon them, they kick against them and do not mention the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, as stated (in Ps. 79:6), “Pour out your wrath upon the nations that have not known you, [upon the kingdoms that do not invoke Your name].” In the case of Israel, however, when afflictions come upon them, they make submit and pray, as stated (in Ps. 116:3-4), “I found trouble and sorrow, but I shall invoke the name of the Lord.” Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Even though these maledictions come upon you, they [themselves] stand you up; and so it says (in Deut. 8:16), ‘in order to humble you and in order to test you, [so as to benefit you in the end].’” Thus did Moses say to Israel, “Even though afflictions come upon you, you have a standing.” It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9), “You are standing today, all of you.” Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9), “You are standing (nizavim) today”: Why did Moshe make them into a pillar (mazevah) (A type of altar generally used for idolatry, but always forbidden by the Torah. See Deut. 16:22.) ? Because they would [change] from one opinion to another opinion: from the opinion of Moshe to the opinion of Joshua; from the opinion of Joshua to the opinion of the elders. And Joshua also made them into a pillar, as stated (in Josh. 24:1), “Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Schechem, [and he summoned Israel’s elders and commanders, magistrates and officers; and they presented (yityazvu) themselves].” And Samuel – since they [changed] from his opinion to the opinion of the kings – also made them into a pillar, as stated (in I Sam. 12:7), “And now stand (hityazvu) and I will judge you.” Another interpretation (of Deut. 29:9), “You are standing today”: Just as today (literally: the day) sometimes darkens and sometimes lightens, so it is with you. Although you have darkness, the Holy One, blessed be He, is going to shine on you with light eternal, as stated (in Is. 60:19), “for the Lord shall be your everlasting light.” When? When you all become one group, as stated (in Deut. 4:4), “are all alive today.” According to universal custom, if one takes a group of reeds, will he be able to break them at one stroke! But if he takes them one by one, even an infant can break them. So also you find that Israel was not redeemed until they became one group, as stated (in Jer. 50:4), “’In those days and at that time,’ says the Lord,’ the children of Israel, they and the children of Judah, shall come together.’” When they are united, they shall welcome the face of the Divine Presence."

However, when one sins, the whole generation is stricken, and so you find in the case of Achan (in Josh. 22:20), “Was it not Achan ben Zerah who committed [embezzlement] in the proscription (i.e., the herem of Jericho)?” If with the measure of punishment which is small, the [whole] generation was seized, how much the more [will the generation prosper], with the measure of [divine] favor which is great! It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9), “every person in Israel”; and not only the great ones who are among us, but (according to vs. 10) “Your infants, your wives, and your alien.” It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:9), “every person.” Now flesh and blood shows more mercy over males than over females, but the Holy One, blessed be He, is not like that. Rather (according to Ps. 145:9), “His mercy is upon all his works,” upon males and upon females, upon the righteous and upon the wicked, as stated (in Deut. 29:10, cont.), “from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water.” (Deut. 29:10, cont.), “From the one who chops your wood.” R. Isaac ben Tavlay said, “[This] teaches that, when the Gibeonites came to [Moses he did not accept them; but when they came to] Joshua, he did accept them. (According to Josh. 9:27, Joshua gave these menial tasks to the Gibeonites.)  Thus it is stated (in Josh. 9:4), ‘And they also acted with cunning.’ What is the meaning of ‘they also?’ [This] teaches that they had come to Moses, and he had not accepted them.”"
29,9,Talmud,Tractate Soferim 18:6,"On the day when R. Eleazar b. ‘Azariah was appointed head of the academy, he began his discourse by saying: Ye are standing this day all of you … your little ones, your wives, (Deut. 29, 9f.)  the men came to listen, the women came to receive a reward for their journey, (lit. ‘steps’. Even if the women did not understand the discourse, they were entitled to reward for their attendance and bringing their children with them. The corresponding passage in Ḥag. 3a (Sonc. ed., p. 9) reads ‘men came to learn, women came to listen’.)  but why did the little ones come? That a reward may be given to those who bring them. From this the young daughters of Israel learnt the practice of coming to the Synagogue so that a reward may be granted to those who bring them while they would [in due course] (When they reach womanhood.)  also receive their reward. (As the result of their early training and practice. In childhood one is subject neither to reward nor punishment.) "
29,9,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 31:1:3","וילך משה וידבר את הדברים האלה אל כל ישראל. בן מאה ועשרים שנה אנכי היום, וגו', “Moses went and spoke these words to all of Israel. ‘I am 120 years old this day.’” It is possible that the 120 years Moses lived corresponded to the 120 days he spent on Mount Sinai. During the first 40 days he received the first set of Tablets. During the second 40 days he pleaded for G’d to forgive the people the sin of the golden calf; he spent the next 40 days on the mountain in order to receive the second set of Tablets. This may be the reason why he used the term אנכי instead of אני.  Our sages in Sotah 13 feel that he meant to say that on that day he was precisely 120 years old, i.e. that he died on the same day of the same month as he had been born. This may also be the reason why he used the word היום at the beginning of the previous Parshah, so that all these speeches took place on the same day. The day in question was the seventh day of Adar at the end of the Israelites 40th year in the desert. We have further proof of this in 34,8 where the Torah reported that the people mourned Moses for 30 days during which they did not journey. The Torah states explicitly that the days of Moses’ mourning came to an end. It is proper to read this verse in conjunction with Joshua 1,10: “Joshua commanded the law-enforcement officers of the people: ‘prepare for yourselves provisions for in another three days you will cross the river Jordan.’” Anyone reading these two verses together will realize that Joshua would not command the people to prepare these provisions until the mourning period for Moses had passed. To make this plain, the Torah had to write the verse: “the days of crying for (the death of) Moses had concluded.” The Book of Joshua 4,19 reports that the Jewish people completed crossing the river Jordan on the tenth of the first month, i.e. 3 days after the conclusion of the mourning period for Moses. By counting backwards you will arrive at the date of the 7th Adar as the date on which Moses had died. When the Torah in Exodus 2,3 reported that Moses’ mother was unable to hide him any longer, the date referred to is the 6th of Sivan, the day on which the revelation at Mount Sinai took place 80 years later. On that day, the light which filled only his parents’ home on the day he was born became so powerful that it shone for the whole Jewish nation. The light which had filled the house of Amram had already forecast the eventual greatness of the boy that had been born to Yocheved. The reason Yocheved had to hide Moses in a basket, well insulated, was that the light surrounding the baby had become so much stronger that it represented a danger to the family. The Torah speaks of Yocheved having hidden Moses for שלשה ירחים ‘three lunar months,” rather than שלשה חדשים, “three months,” (Exodus 2,2) to indicate that these were lunar months. The months Adar, Nisan, and Iyar are 29,30, and 29 days long, respectively. This gives us a total of 88 days during which Moses was kept “hidden” at home, or it takes us back to the 7th day of Adar as Moses’ birthday. From all this it becomes clear that Moses died on the same day of the same month on which he had been born. The word חדש implies a period which equals 1/12th of the year, something not subject to variation either by adding or subtracting from it. The same is not true of the period known as ירח, a period which may comprise either 29 or 30 days. The reason why the Torah used the term ירחים in the verse mentioned was to enable us to calculate the precise date on which Moses was born. This prompted our sages in Kiddushin 38 to state that G’d completes the life cycle of the righteous from day to day (to grant them whole years) something they base on Exodus 23,26: את מספר ימיך אמלא, “I will fill (round out) the number of your days (meaning “years”)."
29,9,Midrash,Sifrei Devarim 48:9,"An analogy: Two men meet, and they do not separate from each other until one has walked a mil, and the other, a mil, at which time they are found to be at a distance of two mills from each other. Variantly: Lest you say: There are the sons of the elders, there are the sons of the great ones, there are the sons of the prophets (i.e., Let them study the Torah!) It is, therefore, written ""For if keep, you (plural [i.e., all of you]) shall keep all of this mitzvah."" We are hereby taught that all are equal in (the mitzvah of studying) Torah. And thus is it written (Devarim 33:4) ""Torah was commanded to us by Moses, the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob"": It is not written ""Cohanim, Levites, and Israelites,"" but ""the congregation of Jacob."" And thus is it written (Ibid. 29:9) ""You are standing this day, all of you, before the L-rd your G-d, your heads of your tribes, your elders and your officers, all the men of Israel."" If not for (all of) these, who stood and fulfilled Torah in Israel, would Torah not have been forgotten in Israel? And if Shafan in his time (viz. II Kings 22) and Ezra in his time and R. Akiva in his time had not stood up (on behalf of Torah), would Torah not have been forgotten in Israel? And it is written (Proverbs 15:3) ""A thing in its time — how good!"" The thing that this one (i.e., each one of those in his time) said is over and against all! It is written (Amos 8:12) ""They will wander to seek the word of the L-rd and they will not find it"": As a tourist, who goes from city to city and from province to province, so is a woman destined to make the rounds of the houses of prayer and the houses of study about a sheretz (a creeping thing) that had touched a loaf to determine whether (this is an instance of) first-degree or second-degree tumah (uncleanliness). R. Shimon b. Yochai says: G-d forbid (to say) that Torah will be forgotten from Israel. Is it not written (Devarim 31:21) ""for it will not be forgotten from the mouth of their seed""? How, then, am I to understand ""They will wander to seek the word of the L-rd and they will not find it""? They will not find a clear halachah in one place, but one man will forbid, and another permit; one man will rule unclean, and another, clean, and they will not find a clear thing."
29,9,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 44:5:1,"5. {“Today you are standing, all of you, before God your Lord—your leaders, your tribal heads, [your elders and your law enforcers, all the men of Israel, your children, your women, and the proselytes in your camp; even your woodcutters and water drawers]” (Deuteronomy 29:9) . } Today you are standing — “Standing” is nothing other than prayer (Berakhot 6b)."
29,9,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 181:1:8,"All the words spoken against the true tzaddik and his followers are [really] very great favors, physically and spiritually. As we find in the Midrash (Tanchuma) on the verse, “You are standing” (Deuteronomy 29:9): It is juxtaposed to the portion of The Curses to teach that all these curses are the very things that stand you up."
29,9,Midrash,Eikhah Rabbah 3:1,"“I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of His fury” (Lamentations 3:1). “I am the man” – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina began: “Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Barukh son of Neriyahu, the scribe, and he wrote on it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book that Yehoyakim, king of Judah, had burned in the fire, and many more similar matters were also added to them” (Jeremiah 36:32). The verse need not have stated “similar.” Why does the verse state “similar”? Rav Kahana said: “Many more similar matters were also added to them”: “Matters” – “how does [the greatly crowded city] sit” (Lamentations 1:1), “how [the Lord] has clouded” (Lamentations 2:1), “how has [gold] tarnished” (Lamentations 4:1). (Rav Kahana interprets “matters” to allude to chapters 1, 2, and 4 of Lamentations.)  “Many” – “remember, Lord” (Lamentations 5:1). (The word “many” alludes to chapter 5 of Lamentations.)  “Similar” – “I am the man,” which is three verses each. (In the third chapter of Lamentations there are three verses for each letter of the alphabet.)  That is what is written: “Did I not write it for you three times [shalishim]” (Proverbs 22:20) – words [organized] in a threefold manner. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: What is shalishim? It is mighty men, just as it says: “And shalishim over them all” (Exodus 14:7), and we translate it: “And mighty men were appointed over them all.” (The midrash is referencing Onkelos, an ancient Aramaic translation of the Torah.)  Alternatively: Shalishim – “I am the man” – as it is three verses each. Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: “I am the man” – it is I who is well versed in suffering, what is pleasing to You is pleasing for me. (This statement is an acceptance of God’s judgment despite being unable to understand the need for such intense suffering (Matnot Kehuna). Others explain differently such that this statement introduces the upcoming analogy, and interpret this line to mean: I have received benefit by having benefited You by accepting Your Torah. Accordingly, this line is bitter and sarcastic, as the speaker complains that the great suffering is due only to Israel’s acceptance of the Torah, which brought them a higher level of accountability than other nations (Etz Yosef).)  This is analogous to a king who became angry at the queen and shoved her and expelled her from the palace. She went and concealed her face behind a pillar. (She hoped to catch a glimpse of the king as he passed.)  The king was passing and saw her. He said to her: ‘You have been impudent.’ She said to him: ‘My lord the king, is this [treatment] appropriate for me, is this becoming for me, is this befitting of me? No woman accepted you other than me.’ He said to her: ‘It was I who disqualified all the women in favor of you.’ She said to him: ‘If so, why did you enter such and such alleyway, such and such courtyard, and such and such place? Was it not for such and such a woman, and she did not accept you?’ So too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘You have been impudent.’ They said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, is this appropriate for me, is this becoming for me, is this befitting of me? No other nation accepted Your Torah other than me.’ He said to them: ‘It is I who disqualified all the nations in favor of you.’ They said to Him: ‘If so, why did You offer the Torah to all the nations but they did not accept it?’ As it is taught: Initially, He revealed himself to the children of Esau; that is what is written: “He said: The Lord came from Sinai, and shone from Seir for them” (Deuteronomy 33:2), (Seir is the land of Esau; see Genesis 36:8.)  but they did not accept it. He offered it to the children of Ishmael, but they did not accept it; that is what is written: “He appeared from Mount Paran” (Deuteronomy 33:2). (Ishmael dwelled in Paran; see Genesis 21:21.)  Ultimately, He offered it to Israel and they accepted it, as it is written: “And He came from the holy myriads, from His right, a fiery law to them” (Deuteronomy 33:2), and it is written: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform and we will heed” (Exodus 24:7). Another matter: “I am the man [hagever]” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: It is I who is the man. I am Job, as it is stated: “Who is a man [gever] like Job, who drinks scoffing like water” (Job 34:7). “Who has seen affliction [ani]” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The congregation of Israel said: Since He saw me impoverished of mitzvot, impoverished of good deeds, He brought “the rod of His fury” upon me. Rabbi Berekhya said: He fortified me to withstand them all. What do you find written after the ninety-eight rebukes in the book of Deuteronomy? (See Deuteronomy 28:15–69.)  “You are standing today, all of you” (Deuteronomy 29:9), and we translate it: “You exist this day, all of you,” mighty to withstand them all. “He conducted and led me in darkness and not light. Indeed, against me He will again turn His hand all day” (Lamentations 3:2–3). “He conducted [and led] me” in this world, which is called “darkness and not light.” “Indeed, against me He will again turn His hand all day” – Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: This teaches that the Holy One blessed be He despairs of the righteous in this world, but then has mercy on them. That is what is written: “Indeed, against me He will again [turn His hand].”"
29,9,Midrash,Eikhah Rabbah 3:4,"“He is like a bear in ambush to me, a lion in hiding” (Lamentations 3:10). “He is like a bear in ambush to me” – this is Nebuchadnezzar. “A lion in hiding” – this is Nevuzaradan. Alternatively: “A bear in ambush” – this is Vespasian; “a lion in hiding” – this is Trajan. “He has twisted my ways and mauled me; He rendered me desolate” (Lamentations 3:11). “He has twisted my ways and mauled me [vaifashḥeni]” – split me, as we say: A tree that was split [nifshaḥ], one may tie it during the Sabbatical Year. (Mishna Sheviit 4:6.)  “He drew His bow, and set me as the target for the arrow” (Lamentations 3:12). “He drew His bow, and set me as the target for the arrow” – there were two amora’im; one said: Like a shield for arrows, (Although the shield blocks the arrows, the arrows pierce and damage the shield (Maharzu).)  and one said: Like a beam for arrows that everyone fires at it but it remains standing. Rabbi Yudan said: He fortified me to withstand them all. What do you find written after the ninety-eight rebukes in the book of Deuteronomy? “You are standing today, all of you” (Deuteronomy 29:9), and we translate it: “You exist this day, all of you,” mighty to withstand them all."
29,9,Chasidut,"Tiferet Shlomo, on Torah, Nitzavim 2","Deuteronomy 29:9: It appears to me to say the following about this verse: it says earlier in the Torah [in the previous chapter] that ""...until this day, Hashem did not give you a heart to know, ear to hear, eye to see"" [Deuteronomy 29:3]. [This means that] the entire service of Moshe Rabbeinu was for the Jewish people to hear all mitzvot from his mouth; his intent was to imbue their hearts with the power of holiness of Hashem with his holy words. The Shechina would speak from his throat, and the goal was that the Jewish people would not be able to transgress anything in the Torah. It says in the Torah, ""just like snow comes from heaven and never returns... so, too, My words will not return empty-handed [Isaiah 55:10]. This was the level that Moshe spoke [to Hashem], and Hashem answered him [directly] with a voice and He wanted to place a holiness within him so that [listening to Moshe's words would] be equal to hearing them from Hashem. This is the meaning of the previous verse, ""Hashem did not give you a heart to know..."": The Jewish people were lifted up to a very lofty level after 4o years [of being in the desert], and it says ""...on this day, you've become a people for G-d"" [Deuteronomy 27:9]. [This means that] at the end [of the Jewish people's journey], when Moshe Rabbainu would speak, the experience was that of  Mount Sinai (--of G-d speaking--) and thus the Torah would never be removed from their mouth. This is also explains the verse: ""I heard the voice of my G-d and did according to all that was commanded me"" [Deuteronomy 26:14]. ""I heard to voice..."" means that I did what G-d commanded and I'm listening now just like I did at Mount Sinai; I did all that I'm commanded and I haven't missed anything. [Moses] successfully elevated you so that you can stand before Hashem without any separation. Moshe Rabbainu expresses this covenant with everyone, not just the generation of the desert [Deuteronomy 29:14]. In the future of the generation, the tzaddik of the generation will also be speaking. This is [literally as if] Moshe Rabbainu [is speaking to you], which, [in turn, is as if] you're hearing it from G-d. As it says in the original verse, all will stand before G-d [meaning] in every future generation through the tzaddik."
29,9,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 29:9:2,"RASHEICHEM SHIVTEICHEM.’ In the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra this means rasheichem rashei shivteichem (“your heads, the heads of your tribes”), (Since a noun in the construct form cannot have a pronoun suffix, the term rasheichem cannot mean “your heads of.” Therefore Ibn Ezra adds the words rashei, interpreting the phrase as “your heads, ‘the heads of’ your tribes.” See Vol. IV, p. 115, Note 283 for the same principle as applied to another example.)  like and the prophecy of Oded the prophet (Chronicles 15:8. Here the point is that a noun in the construct form cannot have the prefix hei indicating the definite article. Hence the word v’hanevuah cannot mean “and the prophecy of.” We must therefore add the word nevuath, meaning: “and the prophecy, ‘a prophecy of’ Oded.” See Vol. IV, p. 115, Note 284 where the same example is mentioned.)  [which means “and the prophecy, the prophecy of Oded the prophet”]. (Chronicles 15:8. Here the point is that a noun in the construct form cannot have the prefix hei indicating the definite article. Hence the word v’hanevuah cannot mean “and the prophecy of.” We must therefore add the word nevuath, meaning: “and the prophecy, ‘a prophecy of’ Oded.” See Vol. IV, p. 115, Note 284 where the same example is mentioned.)  In my opinion the verse generalizes and then specifies. The generalization is: “your heads and all your tribes,” and then it specifies your elders, and your officers who are your heads, for the elder and the man of rank, he is the head. (Isaiah 9:14.)  Similarly, he stated Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, (Further 31:28.)  for any person who has authority and appointive power over the public is called rosh (head). Thus it is said of the princes [of the tribes], they were ‘the heads of’ the thousands of Israel, (Numbers 1:16.)  for they were the highest rank of all the thousands of Israel. And it is stated of the spies, [all of them were] ‘heads of’ the children of Israel, (Ibid., 13:3.)  meaning they were “among” the heads of the children of Israel, not the heads of all the children of Israel — and they were all included in the term your heads. He then stated again even all the men of Israel who comprise your tribes. Then he mentioned further the little children, the women, the strangers, the hewers of wood and drawers of water (Verse 10.)  whom they had from among the mixed multitude. (Exodus 12:38.)  He had made them bring the little ones, in order to include them in the covenant, for he made the covenant even with the future generations, (Verses 13-14.)  or [the children may have been brought] to make them [i.e., the parents] deserving of Divine reward for bringing them, like the reason the Rabbis gave regarding [the commandment of] the Assembly. (See Ramban further 31:13.)  And our Rabbis have said (So mentioned by Rashi. Ramban himself further on refers to a similar text from the Tanchuma. See further, Note 18.)  that some Canaanites [posing as proselytes] came in Moses’ days just as they came in Joshua’s days (Joshua 9:2-27.)  and Moses made them hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the Tabernacle of G-d. (Ibid., Verse 27. The verse there states: for ‘the altar of’ G-d.)  Now, the intent of the Rabbis is not to state that these Canaanites deceived Moses [as they misled Joshua]; instead, they came to him to make peace with him, for such is the law as we have explained. (See above, 20:11.)  Thus I found in Midrash Tanchuma: (Tanchuma, Nitzavim 2.)  “This teaches you that they [the Canaanites] came before Moses and he did not accept them.” That is to say, they could not deceive him into making a covenant with them, but he immediately made them hewers of wood and drawers of water."
29,9,Jewish Thought,"Unity in Judaism, Unity in the Midst of Plurality 23","The need for unity is much greater in Israel than in the Jewries of the Diaspora, since the intensity of the ideological confrontation in Israel may endanger the very foundations of the State. There is a comment by our sages on the subject that seems to speak to the present situation in Israel. The first verse in the weekly portion of Nitzavim reads: “You stand today all of you, before the Eternal One, your God.” Said the rabbis: “When is it that you are standing? When all of you become one entity. When should it happen? Today!” (Yalkut Shimoni on Deut. 29:9)."
29,9,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on I Chronicles 28:8:2,"and in the ears of our God Before our God, similar to (Deut. 29:9): “You are standing today, all of you, before the Lord your God.” Also, (II Kings 23:3): “And the king stood on his place, etc. before the Lord.”"
29,9,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Horayot 3:5:8,"Rebbi Joshua ben Levi said: A head (The learned in the law, i. e., the rabbinic authorities.)  and an Elder (The tribal heads, paradigms for later political office holders.) , the (Elder) [head] (The text in parentheses is that of L, the one in brackets that of B,G.

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

Mosche unterbrach die Verkündung der nationalen Zukunft, um, wie wir zu Kap. 28, 69 bemerkt, durch Erinnerung an erlebte Tatsachen die gerechte Würdigung der bis dahin gegebenen Segen- und Fluchverkündigung zu veranlassen und durch einige Erläuterungen eine missverstehende Auffassung derselben zu verhüten. Die Tatsachen, auf welche hingewiesen werden sollte, sind Verse 1-8 enthalten; hier, Verse 9-20, folgen nun die Erläuterungen. Verse 9-14 begegnen dem Missverständnis einer etwaigen Beschränkung der Bundesverpflichtung zum Gesetze auf bestimmte Stände und Geschlechter oder auf bestimmte Zeit. Vielmehr wird der Bund und der Eid für alles, was zu Israel zählt, und für alle Folgegeschlechter ausgesprochen. Verse 15-20 wird dem Irrtum begegnet, als ob die Segen- und Unsegenverkündigungen nur den nationalen Abfall im Auge hätten und somit der einzelne sich einen Freipass für ein gesetzwidriges Leben ausstellen könnte, so lange die Gesamtheit als solche Gott und seinem Gesetze die Treue hält. Dieser verderbliche Irrtum dürfte umsomehr ins Auge zu fassen gewesen sein, da Kap. 27 vor dem Auseinandergehen der Volksgesamtheit in die vereinzelnde Niederlassung im Lande gerade die bleibende Zusammenhörigkeit und die solidarische Verpflichtung aller für die Aufrechthaltung und Erfüllung des Gesetzes ausgesprochen worden war, so daß der einzelne mit der pflichtgetreuen Führung seines Einzellebens seine Aufgabe nimmer als gelöst betrachten konnte, wenn er nicht voll das Seinige für die Aufrechthaltung und Erfüllung des Gesetzes in dem ganzen Kreise seiner Gesamtheit getan hatte, daher ja auch Kap. 28 durch die ברכות und קללות, insbesondere die letzteren, wie wir bemerkt, dem einzelnen fühlbar zum Bewusstsein gebracht wurde, wie herb seine Mitleidenschaft sich gestalten könnte, wenn er dem Gesamtabfall und dem damit drohenden Gesamtruin gleichgültig zuschauen würde. Da war denn auch eine irrtümliche Auffassung der anderen Seite der Solidarität nahe gelegt, daß der einzelne für sein Heil genug getan haben könnte, wenn er das Gesetz als Gesamtanliegen gebührend aufrecht zu halten mitgewirkt, sein Einzelleben aber der Herrschaft des göttlichen Gesetzes entzogen hätte; sein Teil an dem Gesamtsegen, dürfte er glauben, bliebe ihm gesichert, wenn auch sein Einzelleben das prüfende Gottesauge nicht ertrüge.

II Chronicles 32:1.) —which it is not possible to explain properly in writing—it follows that the Shechinah is referred to as “heart,” and the souls as “limbs.” This teaches us that when all the souls are attached and bound together, the circulation and flow of the vivification and of the effluence “turns around and around,” and “their culmination is wedged in their beginning” to bind and join them all to “the L–rd (who) is One” to be attached to Him, blessed be He. And thus it is written: (Deuteronomy 29:9, 10.)  “You are standing this day, all of you, before the L–rd your G–d—[stating expressly: “all of you,” and stating expressly: “before”]—your heads…from the hewer of your wood….” (Cf. above, Epistle 22b, and the notes, ad loc.)

29,9,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:9:1-2","טובה תוכחת מגולה מאהבה מסוטרת, “Better an open rebuke than love which is concealed.” (Prov.27,5) In his Book of Proverbs Solomon taught us important principles about the nature of rebukes and how to administer them. He taught the people that life itself is closely linked to rebukes and the ability to accept same, whereas death is inextricably involved with people who resent being rebuked and are unwilling to accept rebukes. We know that life is closely linked to rebukes from Proverbs 6,23: “instructive rebukes are a way to life.” We also have a verse expressing similar sentiments in Proverbs 10,17: “he who accepts rebukes is on the way to the path of life.” Yet another verse from Scripture dwelling on the same subject is found in Proverbs 15,4: ”a healing tongue is a tree of life,” i.e. the way to heal a tongue (which has wagged) is to rebuke the owner. On the other hand, death attaches itself to people who hate being rebuked as we know from Proverbs 15,10: “Harsh discipline is needed for those who abandon the right path; he who hates rebuke will die.” He who departs from the right path (of Torah) only temporarily but does not hate being rebuked will be judged by harsh discipline in order to make him abandon the path of evil; the one who hates rebukes, however, cannot be brought back to the right path by afflictions. There is no hope for him. As a result, such a person will be sentenced to death (by the celestial court)  A love to accept rebukes is a strong indication that the person in question possesses fine qualities, generally. A negative attitude to rebukes indicates that such a person also suffers from other negative traits. This is the reason Solomon says (Proverbs 9,8) “do not rebuke a scoffer lest he will hate you, rather rebuke a wise man and he will love you.” When rebuking a fellow human being one must reveal sincerity and not engage in flattery. One should give him credit for whatever good points he has, and at the same time restrict oneself to point out such a person’s shortcomings, for the righteous and the wicked are two total opposites. When someone has escaped the path of wickedness he does not automatically qualify for the appellation of צדיק, a righteous person, until he has embraced the path of righteousness in his lifestyle. This is because the character of a wicked person is so totally different from that of a righteous person. When such a wicked person has abandoned his former path in life he has only reached the half-way mark separating him from the truly righteous person. This is why the rebuker has to be candid and explain to him the whole truth and not indulge in flattery, praising him for abandoning the path of evil, thereby lulling him into the belief that he has already completely rehabilitated himself. This is what prompted Solomon to say: “better open rebuke than concealed love.” He may appear to reveal hatred by rebuking so candidly; however, better to appear in that guise than to appear as loving the subject of the rebuke by suppressing further guidance and congratulating the subject as if he already had completed the path of rehabilitation. R' David Kimchi, (Radak) quoting his father, takes a different view of the meaning of our introductory verse. He understands Solomon as saying that an open rebuke is good; however it is so only if the rebuker reveals underlying love for the rebuked by speaking to him privately, not exposing him to embarrassment. A Midrashic approach mentioned in Devarim Rabbah (Lieberman edition item 8) states that the “open” rebukes are the ones addressed by Moses to his people, whereas the ones described as “from hidden love,” refer to the rebukes of Bileam who flattered Israel by pronouncing blessings, whereas in his heart he hated the very people upon whom he showered all his blessings. For instance, when he complimented the people on preserving each other’s privacy by saying: “how goodly are your tents O Yaakov,” etc., (Numbers 24,5) what he really wanted to say was: “how goodly are your tents O Moav, your dwellings, children of Ammon.” Had G’d not twisted his mouth this is what would have come out of it. There is yet another way to understand this saying by Solomon. The words: “open rebuke,” refer to the rebukes we read in Leviticus chapter 26, whereas the ones in Deuteronomy, all of whom originate with the Lord Himself, though the wording may have been Moses’, were approved by G’d as we explained already. The words מאהבה מסוטרת, may mean: “from the One whose love is not manifest, i.e. G’d, the attribute Shechinah.” This attribute is often referred to as אהבה, “love,” such as in Proverbs 15,17: “better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened ox where there is hate.” The “love” referred to in that verse is a reference to the Presence of the Shechinah. The basis for such exegesis is found in Song of Songs 2,7: אם תעירו ואם תעוררו את האהבה, “do not dare to arouse the love,” [a reference to premature attempts to secure the redemption, return to Israel of the Shechinah. Ed.] The word באהבה in Song of Songs 8,7 “that vast floods cannot quench love,” also refers to the Shechinah. Similarly, the word אהבה, love, is used in our liturgy when we say להודות לך וליחדך באהבה, “to give thanks to You and to declare Your unity in the form of the Shechinah,” (prior to reciting the Kriyat Shema). [The reason the word באהבה in that paragraph is not taken at face value, is presumably that the same word occurred immediately before the word להודות already, thus making it redundant unless it meant something different than usual. Ed.] Therefore, Solomon describes open rebuke as emanating from G’d’s attribute Shechinah. Wherein then is the goodness of which Solomon speaks manifest? Even though the Israelites had violated so many of the commandments that G’d had been forced to bring upon them all the various afflictions mentioned both in Leviticus chapter 26 and in Deuteronomy chapter 28 so that the people were progressively deprived of the first Temple and the second Temple, all this was for their own good. Moses explained this to the people already in Deut. 8,21 when he said that G’d starved the Jewish people “in order to afflict you, to subject you to trials in order to treat you well in your distant future.” All afflictions serve an educational purpose, to ensure that in the end you will become worthy of your lofty destiny. Although all the curses have been exhausted (fulfilled) i.e. Israel deserved the afflictions, the Jewish people have not ceased to exist. This is the meaning of Maleachi 3,7: “I the Lord have not changed, and you the Children of Yaakov have not perished.” Our sages in Tanchuma Nitzavim 1 comment on this verse that when the Gentile nations experience a single series of afflictions this results in their demise from history, whereas the Jewish people, in spite of having experienced one holocaust after another, are still around and flourishing. They cite Micah 7,8 as proof of this. We read there: “Do not rejoice over me, O my enemy! though I have fallen, I rise again, though I sit in darkness the Lord is my light.” Deut. 32,23 proclaims the same message when the Torah writes: “My arrows I have used up against them, yet they have not perished.” The matter can be compared to a warrior who erects a beam shooting all his arrows at the beam. In the end, the warrior finds that he has exhausted his supply of arrows but that the beam is still standing. Although Israel has collapsed frequently under the afflictions G’d has disciplined it with, it always emerged from these afflictions and was rehabilitated. This is also the meaning of Jeremiah in Lamentations 3,12: “He has bent His bow and made me the target of His arrows.”  This is also what Moses said in his admonitions here in the following verse:"
29,10,Midrash,"Mekhilta DeRabbi Yishmael, Tractate Pischa 16:9","Once, the disciples spent a Sabbath in Yavneh, R. Yehoshua not among them.

Yehoshua: ""Who spent the Sabbath there?"" They: ""R. Elazar b. Azaryah."" R. Yehoshua: ""Is it possible that R. Elazar b. Azaryah spent the Sabbath there without telling you something novel?""

29,9,Chasidut,"Sefat Emet, Deuteronomy, Vayeilech 1:3","The Chidushei Harim explained the pasuk (Devarim 31:28), “...and I will make the heavens and earth bear witness against them.” This is because Bnei Yisrael clarify and rejoice in the inner essence of creation, testifying that everything is the power of Hashem. This concept aligns with Shabbos, called a testimony. When one says “Vayechulu” on Friday night, he becomes a partner in creation, affirming that everything is Hashem. The truth is that as one realizes this, nothing remains hidden. The souls of Bnei Yisrael are above nature, and hence nature cannot truly conceal this fact. This is the meaning of (Devarim 29:9), “You are standing here today before Hashem your G-d,” indicating that Bnei Yisrael, as the source of life force, stand directly before Hashem. They are the first step through which everything descends. Rashi (Devarim 29:12) explains that Hashem told the parsha of Nitzavim after the curses to console Bnei Yisrael, whose faces had turned pale. Hashem reassured them, saying that just as the day turns from dark to light, so too will He bring light to them. This aligns with the idea that Bnei Yisrael, being the initial conduit for divine light, have the power to transform everything. The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 8:1) states, “everything is created in its time,” meaning the beginning of the spreading of life force from Hashem into the realm of time. The Zohar elaborates on this (Zohar 3:58a) with the phrase “And he shall not enter at any time,” referring to the sanctity of timing in divine service. This concept is mirrored in the act of standing in prayer, as in “Atem nitzavim” (Devarim 29:9). When one acknowledges and humbles himself before Hashem, he aligns himself with Klal Yisrael, who are always standing before Hashem, nullifying himself to divine will."

Then we had three stages. 1) Adam as he had been in Eden before the sin. 2) Adam after the sin, when he hid from G'd, having absorbed sin into his system. 3) Adam's quest for forgiveness for 130 years after having heard the penalty that had been decreed. Our Parshah begins at that point. ""You are standing today upright in the presence of the Lord your G'd.” Just as Adam had stood upright in Paradise, so the Jewish people had their hour of being able to stand upright before the Lord. All man had to do at that time was to bridge the natural gap between him and G'd, since he did contain matter that came from that part of creation most remote from the pure Spirit. However, when under the guidance of ""your elders, your judges, your tribal heads,"" the attainment of closeness to G'd would seem assured. The message is that leadership can accomplish for the nation, what virtues accomplish for the individual in this context. In this context, the word ""head"" refers to the intellectual leadership; ""elders"" refers to leadership by those who no longer allow their yetzer hara, evil urge to dominate them. ""Police"" refers to the ability to retain one's composure even when under provocation. (The task of the police is to maintain discipline) Moses goes on to say ""every Jewish man"". He means that anyone who is guided by the four principles we have listed, qualifies for the title ""a Jewish man."" There were also present all those that had not yet matured, i.e. ""your children, your wives, your strangers;"" the latter are on the threshold of attaining their perfection and are all ""marching"" along with the covenant of G'd. (Deut 29, 9-11) "

Similar expressions are used when the Torah speaks of משור ועד שה, oxen as well as lambs, meaning the most expensive animals of your livestock to the least expensive.

R. Chiya b. Abba said in the name of R. Jochanan: ""Rather let one word of the Torah become impotent, than have the Heavenly name publicly profaned."" (II Sam. 21, 10) And Rizpah the daughter of Ayah took sack cloth, and spread it out for herself upon the rock, from the beginning of the harvest until water dropped down upon them out of heaven, and she suffered neither the birds of heaven to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. Behold it is written (Deut. 21, 23) Then shall his body not remain all night on the tree. R. Jochanan in the name of R. Simon b. Jehozadak said: ""It is worth while that one letter of the Torah become impotent, if only the Heavenly name should [through it] be sanctified publicly: [for, whoever passed by the corpse] asked: 'What is the nature of these? Are they not princes, and what [crime] have they committed?' Because they had raised their hands against self-made converts (not formally admitted),' [the reasons were given.] The inquirers then would remark: 'There is no other nation that is more fitting to be associated with than this (Israel); for, if to princes they gave such punishment how much more so to an ordinary man; and if they so protect self-made converts, how much more so will they protect real Israelites (duly admitted proselytes)?' The result therefrom was that Israel was increased by one hundred and fifty thousand [proselytes], as it is said (I King 5, 29) And there belonged to Solomon seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand stone cutters in the mountains."" But perhaps these were Israelties? You cannot possibly think so, for it is written (Ib. 9, 22) Yet of the children of Israel did Solomon make no one a servant. But perhaps the above were merely salaried employees? We must therefore say that the above is inferred from here (II Chr. 2, 16) And Solomon numbered all the gerim (proselytes) that were in the land of Israel, etc., and they were found to be one hundred and fifty thousand. And he made of them seventy thousand bearers of burdens, etc. And was then the decree against the Gibeonites issued by David? Behold! Moses issued the decree, as it is written (Deut. 29, 10) from the hewer of the wood, etc. Moses merely decreed it for that generation, but David decreed it for all generations. Again has not Joshua decreed concerning them? For it is written (Josh. 9, 27) And Joshua appointed them only that day hewers of the wood, etc. Joshua's decree was only for the period during which the Temple existed, but David's decree was issued for the period beyond the destruction of the Temple.

29,10,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 1","“You are standing today … from your wood choppers to your water carriers .…” (Devarim, 29:9) On this King Shlomo said (Mishlei, 30:19), “the way of a man with woman.” (This is one of the four matters that perplexed King Shlomo, that one involved in promiscuity would not fear God and look at the end of his actions [Ibn Ezra]. Almah is here translated as “woman,” but it really means a young woman no longer a virgin [Metsudat Tsion], and he is also perplexed that no signs of the action remain for either involved, as would be recognizable with a virgin [Metsudat David]. The Holy Isbitser will interpret this in a different realm from these commentators.)  This is as it was with Yiftach, of whom our sages said (Rosh Hashanah, 25b), “Yiftach was in his generation as Shmuel was in his.” This means that Yiftach has completed all that God asked from him in this world as Shmuel had done in his generation. This perplexed King Shlomo, and he said (Mishlei, 30:18), “three things are beyond me, and four I did not know … the way of man with woman.” This means the choicest elements in Israel, like the one who completes God’s will, and in this way, “with the young woman [b’almah],” meaning it is so also with the meekest of Israel. This is the explanation of “You are standing.” That is to say, you are connected to God. “Your leaders,” meaning those at the greatest level; “your water carriers,” to the lowest level; “all of you” are bound up with God. “Your wood choppers” means those with the least fear of Heaven, and “your water carriers” are those with the least love of God. (Simply put, all, from the highest to the lowest, are deeply connected to God, and it seems that “the way of man with woman” is being taken out of the context of physical union, to say that it is a wonder to King Shlomo how all elements in Israel at their core experience an intense spiritual union with God.)  (“Wood choppers” cut to pieces and thereby utilize the attribute of gevurah [power] to have the strength to chop to bits, and this brings yirah (awe and reverence) to the Soul. “Water carriers”: water always naturally flows and represents pleasure, which draws one after itself, associated with the attribute of chesed (kindness) (Tanya). Since here they are mentioned at the bottom of the list, it implies those who are deficient in there qualities. Nonetheless, they are still really linked Above. [Hagahot Peretz]) "
29,10,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 3","“… your heads, your tribes, your elders and officers, each man in Israel, your infants and women, your convert that is in the midst of your camps, from your wood choppers to your water carriers .…” (Devarim, 29:9) The verse mentions ten levels, five against five, and all as one are included among Israel. “Your head,” means those possessing Chochma (wisdom) are placed in juxtaposition to the infants (also small children), for infant, taf in Hebrew, is connected to the word for “drop,” tipah in Hebrew, meaning that they possess only a small amount of consciousness (da’at, also “knowledge”). Then accordingly, when any mistake happens even to the youngest children, it affects even the heads, for the taf possessed a little consciousness from the head. “Your tribes,” meaning expansion, for all of Israel were hidden in the root of Yaakov Avinu, and there they were as one soul. Thus when they were divided into tribes certain souls in different generations experienced expansion. This is in juxtaposition to the women, because all expansion comes from birth, for when the child is hidden and included in the soul of the father then there is no expansion; only when the child is born does it begin to expand. “Your elders” means the one who has acquired wisdom. “Your elders,” is juxtaposed to “your convert,” for according to the original insights into the Torah made among Israel, so will converts come to and increase among Israel. The more we increase words of Torah, and thus experience greater expansion, then correspondingly the holiness of Israel extends even to the souls of the nations, and they will be gathered among Israel. (See Likutei Moharan 17, “His (Mordechei’s) fame spread through the provinces” (Ester 9:4) how his words of Torah traveled through the spiritual network and reached the nations: Causing, “Many of the people of the land became Jewish” (Ibid 8:17) [Hagahot Peretz])  “Your officers” are the God fearing, and they are placed in juxtaposition to the “wood choppers,” for “chopping” represents anger, and on this the Holy One, blessed be He, testifies that within all the anger in Israel there is the fear of God. (The great energy they expend in chopping comes the quality of gevurah – from whose fallen aspect comes anger. [Hagahot Peretz])  “Every man of Israel” means the attribute of the love of God, and this is placed against the “water carriers,” for water is compared to desire, as said in various places, (See note 23.)  and all desire and love in Israel comes from God."
29,10,Talmud,Yevamot 79a:12,"The Gemara returns to the main issue under discussion. As for the Gibeonites, was it David who issued a decree against them that they may not enter the congregation? Wasn’t it Moses who issued a decree against them, as it is written: “From the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water” (Deuteronomy 29:10), which indicates that there was a distinct class of wood hewers and water drawers already in the time of Moses. This class must have been composed of insincere converts who constituted a separate group unto themselves, apart from the rest of the Jewish people. The Gemara answers: Moses issued a decree only with regard to that generation that they must remain separate, whereas David decreed for all generations."
29,10,Midrash,Shir HaShirim Rabbah 7:3:3,"Another matter, “your belly is a pile of wheat,” but would one of pine cones not be fairer than one of wheat? But it is possible for the world to exist without pine cones, but it is not possible for the world to exist without wheat. Rabbi Idi said: Just as this wheat kernel is cleft, so Israel’s circumcision is cleft. (This is a reference to peria, the process in which the membrane under the foreskin is split and pulled back (Maharzu).)  Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥananya said: Just as wheat absorbs, so too Israel absorbs the property of the nations of the world. That is what is written: “You shall devour all the peoples…” (Deuteronomy 7:16), and it is written: “You will consume the wealth of the nations and in their glory you will revel” (Isaiah 61:6). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Just as with wheat, its waste is measured with it, so too Israel, “from the hewer of your wood to the drawer of your water” (Deuteronomy 29:10). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Just as these wheat kernels, when they go out for sowing go out by measure, and when they enter from the grain pile they enter by measure, so too Israel, when they descended to Egypt they descended by number, as it is stated: “With seventy people, your ancestors descended to Egypt” (Deuteronomy 10:22), and when they ascended, they ascended by number, as it is stated: “some six hundred thousand men on foot” (Exodus 12:37). Rabbi Ḥonya said regarding the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Just as the landowner does not monitor boxes of manure, and not boxes of hay, and not boxes of straw, and not chaff; why? Because they are considered worthless; so too, the Holy One blessed be He does not monitor the nations of the world, why, because they are considered worthless, as it is stated: “All the nations are like nothing before Him…” (Isaiah 40:17). Whom does He monitor? Israel, as it is stated: “When you take a census of the children of Israel…” (Exodus 30:12), “take a census of the entire congregation of Israel” (Numbers 1:2). Rabbi Neḥemya [said] in the name of Rabbi Avun: The nations of the world have no planting, have no sowing, and have no root, and the three of them are in one verse: “It is as though they were not planted, as though they were not sown, as though their trunk had not taken root in the earth” (Isaiah 40:24). However, Israel has planting, as it is stated: “I will plant them in this land” (Jeremiah 32:41), and it is written “I will plant them upon their land” (Amos 9:15). They have sowing, as it is stated: “I will sow her for Me in the land” (Hosea 2:25). They have root, as it is stated: “It is coming that Jacob will take root” (Isaiah 27:6). To what is this matter comparable? Hay, chaff, and straw were deliberating with each other. This one said: The land was sown for my sake, and that one said: The field was sown for my sake. The wheat said to them: Wait until the [time for] threshing arrives and we will know for whose sake the field was sown. The time of the threshing arrived, and when they entered the threshing floor, the field owner emerged to winnow it. The chaff went with the wind, he took the hay and cast it to the ground, he took the straw and burned it, and he took the wheat and made it into a pile. People would pass and everyone who saw it would kiss it, just as it says: “Kiss the grain” (Psalms 2:12). So too the nations of the world; these say: We are the true Israel, and the world was created for our sake, and those say: We are the true Israel and the world was created for our sake. Israel said to them: Wait until the day the Holy One blessed be He will arrive and we will know for whose sake the world was created. That is what is written: “For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven [and all the wicked people and all the evildoers will be like straw; and that coming day will burn them]” (Malachi 3:19), and it is written: “You will winnow them and the wind will carry them” (Isaiah 41:16). However, it is stated in Israel’s regard: “But you will rejoice in the Lord, you will be glorified in the Holy One of Israel” (Isaiah 41:16)."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

Yehoshua: ""Who spent the Sabbath there?"" They: ""R. Elazar b. Azaryah."" R. Yehoshua: ""Is it possible that R. Elazar b. Azaryah spent the Sabbath there without telling you something novel?"" They: He expounded this principle (Devarim 31:12) ""Gather the people — the men, the women, and the children."" Now do little children know the difference between good and evil?

At this, he said to them: ""What can be more novel than this? I am seventy years old, and I never merited hearing such a thing until this day!

29,10,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 29:10:2,"עד שואב מימיך, “to the ones drawing your water, i.e. the female slaves.” This is what is meant in Job 3,19: קטון וגדול שם הוא ועבד חפשי מאדוניו, “small and great alike are there, both slaves and free men.” The word קטון, there refers to David, whereas the word גדול there refers to Moses. (Compare these attributes being used for David in Samuel 1 17,14, and for Moses in Exodus 11,3.) An alternate interpretation for the line: ועבד חפשי מאדוניו, “the slave who is free from his master;” this line refers to Israel. As long as one is alive one is free to carry out the will of one’s Creator, but once dead it is too late to do so, i.e. one is free from the obligation to perform G–d’s commandments. (Talmud tractate Shabbat folio 30) Still another interpretation “You are all standing here alive,” in spite of all the curses that have befallen your enemies, you have been spared. Both the gentiles have been in the habit of erecting monuments of stone to serve them as deities, but you, i.e. Joshua and Samuel who have both been reported as erecting stone monuments –upon which the text of the Torah has been inscribed-have been successful in that endeavour. It is not the “monument,” that G–d hates but the use it has been put to by the gentiles. (Compare Samuel I 12,7) Still another explanation of this assembly by Moses: This is the last time that all the people could be assembled in one place. Once they would cross the Jordan be dispersed each to his tribe’s ancestral land plot, it would be impossible to address them all at the same time. "

29,11,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 100:1:9,"In our Parshah, Moses presents a threefold picture of the moral platform of the Jewish people, parallel to what emerged at creation. Then we had three stages. 1) Adam as he had been in Eden before the sin. 2) Adam after the sin, when he hid from G'd, having absorbed sin into his system. 3) Adam's quest for forgiveness for 130 years after having heard the penalty that had been decreed. Our Parshah begins at that point. ""You are standing today upright in the presence of the Lord your G'd.” Just as Adam had stood upright in Paradise, so the Jewish people had their hour of being able to stand upright before the Lord. All man had to do at that time was to bridge the natural gap between him and G'd, since he did contain matter that came from that part of creation most remote from the pure Spirit. However, when under the guidance of ""your elders, your judges, your tribal heads,"" the attainment of closeness to G'd would seem assured. The message is that leadership can accomplish for the nation, what virtues accomplish for the individual in this context. In this context, the word ""head"" refers to the intellectual leadership; ""elders"" refers to leadership by those who no longer allow their yetzer hara, evil urge to dominate them. ""Police"" refers to the ability to retain one's composure even when under provocation. (The task of the police is to maintain discipline) Moses goes on to say ""every Jewish man"". He means that anyone who is guided by the four principles we have listed, qualifies for the title ""a Jewish man."" There were also present all those that had not yet matured, i.e. ""your children, your wives, your strangers;"" the latter are on the threshold of attaining their perfection and are all ""marching"" along with the covenant of G'd. (Deut 29, 9-11) "
29,10,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, Vaetchanan, The Politics of Responsibility 12","1. It is a politics of collective responsibility. The parties to the covenant are, said Moses, “your leaders, your tribes, your elders and officials, all the men of Israel, your children, your wives, the strangers in your camp, from woodcutter to water-drawer” (Deut. 29:9–10). This is what is meant in the preamble to the American Constitution by the phrase, “We, the people.”"
29,11,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:11:1,"לעברך means THAT THOU SHOULDEST PASS [INTO THE COVENANT]. It would not, however, be correct to explain it as meaning “to make thee pass” (when the suffix would be objective), but it must be explained like (Deuteronomy 4:14) לעשתכם אתם, “that ye may do them”."
29,11,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:11:2,"לעברך בברית THAT THOU SHOULDEST PASS INTO THE COVENANT — The way of “passing” was as follows: those who made a covenant used to make a partition (i.e. used to place objects in a straight line) on one side and a partition on the other and passed between them, as it is said, (Jeremiah 34:18—20) “[And I will give the men which have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me] when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts thereof … [into the hands of their enemies]”."
29,11,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 29:11:1,"THAT THOU SHOULDEST ENTER INTO THE COVENANT. Le-ovrekha (that thou shouldest enter) is an infinitive. (With the pronominal suffix.)  It is like va-ya’avru (and passed) in and passed between the parts thereof (Jer. 34:18). (In other words, le-ovrekha (that thou shouldest enter) means that you should pass, i.e., that you should enter the covenant, for they used to cut an animal in half when making a covenant and walk between the halves.)  Observe, the word avar (passed) minus the bet (Following it.)  has the opposite meaning. (The word avar preceding brit means to violate the covenant. Hence our verse reads, le-ovrekha bi-verit. Had our verse read, le-ovrekha berit, it would have meant that you should violate the covenant.) "

29,11,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 29:11:1,"לעברך בברית, you are all arranged in this order in order to signal your acceptance of the forthcoming covenant. It is clear from Moses’ addressing all the assembled, that they were of one mind at the time, all willing and eager to accept the covenant."
29,11,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:11:1,"לעברך בברית…ובאלתו, ""for you to enter (pass) into the covenant…and His curse"" (if need be). The reason Moses added the word ובאלתו, ""and His curse,"" will become clearer when we have explained the need for the covenant. Why was the Torah not satisfied with all the admonitions and curses which have already been recorded in the Torah? Some clever people who want to escape the cumulative curses and punishments recorded in chapter 28 may decide to commit a single transgression, such as violating the Sabbath or the laws of idolatry and to thereby become guilty of only a single one of all these penalties seeing that those laws are considered the cornerstones of Judaism. Such people prefer this to first accepting the authority of G'd and the Torah which would make them potentially liable to as many as 36 penalties of Karet. Moses acted astutely when he persuaded these people to accept upon themselves the covenant so that in the future they would be liable for each transgression separately. The oath (curse) would apply if any of these people deliberately flouted the laws he had undertaken to observe as a result of embracing this covenant. Once they had done this, even the intention of violating a fundamental law of Judaism would not safegaurd them against becoming culpable for each transgression separately."
29,11,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Genesis 26:29:1,"IF THOU WILT DO US HURT, AS WE HAVE NOT TOUCHED THEE. The king is saying: “If you will do us hurt [and we could do nothing against you], just as we have not touched you because thou art now the blessed of the Eternal and we do not have it in our power to harm you, the time will yet change on account of the violence you will do against us and you will need to return to our land. Then we will requite you accordingly.” The meaning of the phrase, We have not touched thee, is: “We did not persuade our hearts concerning your wife, causing her to be touched by one of them.” This is similar in expression to the verse, He that toucheth this man or his wife. (Verse 11 here.)  “We have done thee nothing but good, guarding whatever you had, by our commanding the people to beware of you. And we have sent thee away in peace for even when we were jealous of you we took nothing of all the wealth you amassed with us, and we sent you away in peace with all you had.” The reason for their being fearful of him could hardly have been the apprehension of the king of the Philistines lest Isaac come to war against him. Instead, it was because Abraham had promised them a covenant, “to him, to his son, and his son’s son,” (Above, 21:23.)  and now they thought, “Since we annulled our covenant with Isaac and sent him away from us, he too will annul his covenant with us, and his children will drive our children from the land.” This was why they made a new covenant with him, excusing themselves by telling him that they did not annul the first covenant, since they have done him nothing but good. And this is the meaning of their saying, Let there now be an oath between us: (Verse 28 here.)  “We will now come with you in oath to express a ban upon whoever will transgress the covenant.” This is similar in meaning to the verse, That thou shouldst enter into the covenant of the Lord thy G-d, and into His oath. (Deuteronomy 29:11.)  It is possible that Abraham was very great and mighty in power, having in his household three hundred men (Above, 14:14.)  that drew sword, and also many confederates; and he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, (II Samuel 17:10. The verse refers to David, but Ramban uses it also in connection with Abraham, since as pointed out he was also mighty in battle.)  and he chased after four powerful kings and subdued them. (Above, 14:14-15.)  When they saw Abraham’s success which clearly was from G-d, the king of the Philistines was then fearful of him lest he conquer his kingdom, since this would be easier than the war against the four kings. Perhaps the king of the Philistines had also heard the matter of G-d having given the land to Abraham. Hence he made a covenant with him, making him swear that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son, (Above, 21:23.)  it being considered an act of falsehood if Abraham were to rebel against the king, and considering it possible that Abraham might live until his grandson will rule, [he also mentioned my sons’s son]. And as the fathers are, so are the sons. Isaac was as great as his father, and the king therefore feared lest Isaac war against him because he had driven him from his land."
29,11,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 29:11:2,"'אשר ה' אלוקיך כורת עמך היום, למען הקים אותך וגו, G’d’s objective in concluding this covenant with you this day is to reaffirm that you are His people and that He is your G’d. By entering into this covenant with Him you acquire eternal life, life beyond the death of your bodies. Seeing that the purpose of the covenant is of such importance, is of so elevated a nature, it is necessary that you embrace it wholeheartedly."
29,11,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 28:69:1,לכרת את בני ישראל [THE COVENANT WHICH THE LORD COMMANDED …] TO MAKE WITH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL — that they will take upon themselves the observance of the Torah under an imprecation and oath (cf. Deuteronomy 29:11).

Rashi’s intention in this is in order to explain that the covenant is dealing with the realm of thought, as it says later (verse 28), “the secret things [meaning thoughts] belong unto Hashem our God.” (Where Rashi seems to say that God may punish an individual for his thoughts.) But in truth, God does not punish one for his thoughts. Nonetheless, even though God ony punishes for actions, still, one is not considered close to God if his thoughts are not cleaving to God. Therefore Rashi explains “that you should enter,” meaning that just as He gives you the ability to choose for yourself, free of any warning of punishment, so may you (choose to be) a servant of God even in your thoughts."
29,11,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 29:11:1","לעברך בברית, “for you to enter the covenant;” Nachmanides writes that the word “covenant” here is another word for “oath.” 
    It is possible, however, (author speaking) that the people now entered a new reciprocal covenant. Such a covenant would have paralleled the one the Jewish people entered into at Mt Sinai. At that time the covenant was sealed by a total offering, sprinkling of its blood on the people, etc. There was no need to spell out these details here.

29,11,Midrash,Vayikra Rabbah 6:5,"Rabbi Pinḥas interpreted the verse regarding Israel before Mount Sinai. “And if a person will sin” – “I saw, and, behold, you had sinned” (Deuteronomy 9:16). “And hear the voice of adjuration” – “and His voice we heard from the midst of the fire” (Deuteronomy 5:21). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They made a commitment between them that He would not disavow them and they would not disavow Him. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: When a king administers an oath to his legions, he administers the oath only with a sword, as though to say, anyone who violates these conditions, this sword will pass over his neck. So too, “Moses took half the blood” (Exodus 24:6).   How did Moses know how much was half the blood? Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Ilai said: The blood divided on its own. Rabbi Natan said: Its appearance changed; half of it became black and half of it was red. Bar Kappara said: An angel descended in the image of Moses and divided it. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: A voice was emerging from Mount Ḥorev and saying: Half the blood is until here. Rabbi Yishmael taught: Moses was well versed in the halakhot of blood, and he divided it. (Due to his expertise in the halakhot concerning the blood of sacrifices and the fact that he needed to conduct the ceremony at Mount Sinai, Moses was given Divine aid in dividing the blood (see Etz Yosef). )  “He placed it in the basins [baaganot]” (Exodus 24:6) – Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Avin: It is written baaganat. (The plural word “basins [baaganot]” is written without the vav and can therefore be read in the singular [baaganat], implying that the basins were as one, in that they were the same size.)  This one was not larger than that one, and that one was not larger than this one. Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘What shall be done with Your portion?’ He said to him: ‘Sprinkle it upon the people.’ ‘What shall be done with their portion?’ He said to him: ‘Sprinkle it upon the altar.’ “And half the blood he sprinkled on the altar.”  Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina: He took an oath to them and they took an oath to Him. He took an oath to them, “I took an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you; the utterance of the Lord God” (Ezekiel 16:8). They took an oath to Him, to the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “To pass you into the covenant of the Lord your God and into His ala” (Deuteronomy 29:11). From where is it derived that ala is nothing other than an oath? Rabbi Neḥemya and Rav Naḥman of Yafo in the name of Rabbi Yaakov of Caesarea: From this: “The priest shall administer to the woman the oath of the ala” (Numbers 5:21). When they violated the conditions made at Mount Sinai, the Holy One blessed be He said to them: “I, too, will do so to you” (Leviticus 26:16). Rabbi Pinḥas said: It is written: “But they, like men, have violated the covenant” (Hosea 6:7); however, here, “for I am God and not man” (Hosea 11:9).  Rabbi Ahava bar Ze’eira said: It is written: “The Lord has done what He devised” (Lamentations 2:17), just as it is written in His Torah: “I will punish [you] additionally” (Leviticus 26:18). Did He do so? Heaven forbid. Rather, “He implemented His statement” (Lamentations 2:17). What is: “He implemented [bitza] His statement [emrato]”? He made a compromise. (The word bitza can mean “he halved.” Thus, the verse would be saying that God implemented only half of His statement concerning the punishment to which Israel would be subject. )  Rabbi Yaakov of Kefar Ḥanin said: He rent [biza] His royal garment. (Imra is the Aramaic term for the hem of a garment.)   Rabbi Berekhya cites it from this: “I will bring upon you a sword avenging the vengeance of the covenant” (Leviticus 26:25). Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: There is vengeance that is for the covenant and vengeance that is not for the covenant. Which is the vengeance that is not for the covenant? Rabbi Azarya and Rabbi Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: This is the blinding of the eyes, as they blinded the eyes of the king of Judah, (The Babylonians blinded Zedekiah, king of Judah (II Kings 25:7). )  as it is stated: “So said the Lord God: As I live, if not My oath that he scorned [and My covenant that he breached I will place upon his head]” (Ezekiel 17:19) – this is the oath that he took to Nebuchadnezzar. (Zedekiah had violated an oath of allegiance he had taken to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylonia. He was punished for this in addition to being punished for violating the covenant between God and Israel. )  “And My covenant that he breached” – this is the covenant of Mount Sinai. “I will place upon his head” – and the rest of the body was not afflicted? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: This is the blinding of the eyes, which are located on the head.  Once they were exiled to Babylon, they said to Nebuchadnezzar: “Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need [to answer you].… Behold our God.… Behold; if not, let it be known to you, king, that we will not worship your gods” (Daniel 3:16–18). (This statement was made by Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya in response to Nebuchadnezzar’s threat that if they would not bow to his idol he would have them thrown into a fiery furnace. )  The Holy One blessed be He said to them: (Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya.)  “You too, for the blood of your covenant” (Zechariah 9:11), I have remembered that blood that was in Sinai; therefore, “I have released [your prisoners from the pit] in which there is no water” (Zechariah 9:11). Rabbi Pinḥas said: It shall no longer be that “they spilled their blood like water around Jerusalem” (Psalms 79:3).  “And he is a witness” – this is Israel: “You are My witnesses, the utterance of the Lord, and I am God” (Isaiah 43:12). “Who either saw [raa]” – “you have been shown [horeita] in order to know” (Deuteronomy 4:35). “Or knew” – “you shall know this day” (Deuteronomy 4:39). “If he does not tell, he shall bear his iniquity” – if you do not tell of My divinity to the nations of the world, I will exact vengeance against you. When? “When they say to you: Seek the necromancers” (Isaiah 8:19)."

(In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam relates that this blessing begins, ""We offer thanks to You, God, our Lord..."" and states, shortly before its conclusion, ""For all these, God, our Lord, we give thanks to You."" An omission of the second mention of thanks, however, does not require the repetition of grace (Shulchan Aruch HaRav 187:4).)  It should conclude: ""[Blessed are You, God,] for the land and for the sustenance."" (This is a single expression of thanks, acknowledging God's gift of ""a land which produces sustenance"" (Berachot 49a).)  Whoever does not include the phrase ""a precious, good, and spacious land"" (This expression is a combination of the praises of Eretz Yisrael mentioned in Jeremiah 3:19 and Exodus 3:8.)  in the blessing for Eretz Yisrael does not fulfill his obligation. (Unless one mentions these qualities, one has not adequately expressed one's appreciation for Eretz Yisrael. The omission of this phrase requires the repetition of the grace. See Halachah 12.)  A person must mention the covenant [of circumcision] (Rashi (Berachot 48b) explains that the mitzvah of circumcision is connected with God's promise of Eretz Yisrael to Abraham, as Genesis 17:8-10 states: ""I will give you and your descendants... the entire land of Canaan.... You shall keep My covenant.... Circumcise every male."")  and the Torah [in this blessing], (Rashi (loc. cit.) notes that a similar connection applies with regard to the Torah, as Deuteronomy 8:1 states: ""Observe all the mitzvot which I am commanding you... so that you will... inherit the land that God promised to your ancestors."" The phraseology used by the Rambam indicates that he does not require the repetition of the grace if either of these points is omitted. Other authorities (including the Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 187:3) differ and require the repetition of grace in such an instance.)  mentioning the covenant before the Torah. [The reason for this order (which gives priority to the covenant)  is] that the covenant mentioned in the blessing for Eretz Yisrael refers to the covenant of circumcision, concerning which thirteen covenants [are mentioned in the Torah]. (Note the conclusion of Hilchot Milah, where the Rambam enumerates these thirteen expressions.)  In contrast, [the Torah mentions only] three covenants with regard to the Torah, as [Deuteronomy 28:69] states: ""These are the words of the covenant... in addition to the covenant He established with you at Chorev,"" and [Deuteronomy 29:9-11] states: ""You are standing... to establish a covenant."" (The Lechem Mishneh notes that there are several other verses that refer to a covenant with regard to the Torah. These three, however, are unique in that they refer to the establishment of a covenant regarding the bond between the Jews and the Torah.1. Berachot 49a mentions both these possibilities. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam quotes the former expression.2. The beginning of a blessing must share the same theme as its conclusion. Nevertheless, the rebuilding of Jerusalem shares a connection with God's showing mercy to the people of Israel, since the rebuilding of Jerusalem is an expression of God's mercy to the Jewish people (Berachot, loc. cit.).3. Although Berachot (loc. cit.) mentions that two different concepts should not be mentioned in the conclusion of a blessing, this version of the blessing does not contradict that rule. The intent is a single request that Israel be granted the ultimate comfort, the rebuilding of Jerusalem.4. Rashi, Berachot 48b, mentions another reason for the mention of the House of David. It was David who conquered Jerusalem and established the holiness of the city. 5. Since an integral element of our celebration of the Sabbath and festivals is eating festive meals, the sacred element of the day should be mentioned in the grace recited after partaking of those meals. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the day does not require a blessing in its own right, nor is it made the essential element of the third blessing. Therefore, one begins and concludes that blessing in the same manner as is done during the week (Rashi, Tosafot, Berachot 48b).6. The order in which these alternatives are mentioned in this halachah is the reverse of that mentioned in the previous halachah. It can be explained that in the previous halachah, the Rambam mentioned the text he considered most appropriate first. The order he mentions in this halachah, however, is closer to the expression used by our Sages in Berachot (loc. cit.), the source for this halachah.7. Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. With regard to Rosh HaShanah, see the commentary on Halachah 13.8. Shabbat 24a explains that since an additional sacrifice (korban musaf) is offered on these days, they possess an element of sanctity that is worthy of mention. As obvious from the contrast of Halachah 12 to Halachah 13, however, there is a difference between the obligation to mention these days and the obligation to mention Sabbaths and festivals. 9. Since Chanukah and Purim are Rabbinic holidays which are not associated with an additional sacrificial offering, they are not mentioned in the third blessing. The second blessing is more appropriate for the mention of the miracles of these holidays, since it is an expression of thanks to God (Shabbat 24a). The Kessef Mishneh and the Lechem Mishneh note that from Shabbat (loc. cit.), it would appear that while permission is granted to mention Chanukah and Purim in the second blessing, it is not an obligation to do so. In contrast, the Rambam requires that they be mentioned. They explain that since the Sages of the Talmud were wont to mention these holidays in grace, and the Jerusalem Talmud (Berachot 7:6) considers their mention a binding obligation, the Rambam established their mention as a requirement. See also Halachah 13 and commentary.10. Precedence is given to the Sabbath because it occurs more frequently than the festivals and is on a higher spiritual level (Kessef Mishneh). 11. ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, 16King13 of the Universe, the God, who is our Father and our 16King13... the 16King13 who is good."" The reason for this stress on God's sovereignty in this blessing is that the blessing recited previously mentions the sovereignty of the House of David, and the Sages wanted to emphasize how all earthly kings are subordinate to a higher authority (Berachot 49a).12. The blessing mentioned is quoted from Berachot 46a. That source also contains additions to the blessing that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi would recite. 13. The Rambam's words are quoted from Berachot 46b, which relates that Mar Zutra recited this blessing. The Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah 379:14) relates that this blessing should be recited throughout the seven days of mourning by the mourners and by all who recite grace together with him when there is a zimun. Other opinions (based on Ketubot 8a) state that this blessing should be recited only when ten people recite grace together. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 207:7 writes that it is Ashkenazic custom to rely on this opinion, and hence, this blessing is generally not recited.14. Berachot (loc. cit.) relates several additions Mar Zutra made on the above occasion.15. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam includes several requests beginning with the word Harachaman (May the Merciful One...) in his text of grace. These requests were additions to the grace made by the Geonim, who lived in the era subsequent to the Talmud. 16. This refers to the final blessing quoted in Halachah 11.17. Nisu'in (marriage) is marked by the entry of a bride and groom into a private chamber together. This ceremony is referred to as chuppah and is accompanied by a celebration. See Hilchot Ishut, Chapter 10, and commentaries. As mentioned at the conclusion of the following halachah, according to the Rambam this blessing is recited only when ten adult males are present. The Shulchan Aruch (Even HaEzer 62:4) differs and maintains that it should be recited even when fewer than ten people are present. Note the Ramah (Even HaEzer 62:7) who states that today this blessing is never recited alone. If ""new faces"" - people who had not attended the wedding celebrations previously - are present, all seven blessings are recited. If no ""new faces"" are present (although ten males are), the meal is considered like a meal eaten by the bridegroom alone, and the blessing is not recited.18. The same laws applying to a widow or widower apply to a person who has been divorced. Significantly, in Hilchot Ishut 10:12, the Rambam states that even if a woman has been married before, her husband should celebrate with her for three days.19. Surely, this also applies when neither the bride nor groom have been married before. Hilchot Ishut (loc. cit.) states: ""The Sages ordained that everyone who marries a maiden should celebrate with her for seven days."" The differences between the time limits mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, are worthy of comparison. See the commentary on that halachah.20. Ketubot 8a states that after the first day of the wedding celebrations, Rav Ashi would recite the wedding blessings only when ""new faces"" were present. In his responsa, the Rambam's son states that his father required only two ""new faces."" Note the Beit Shmuel 64:7 who requires only one ""new face."" The Hagahot Maimoniot write that on the Sabbath the presence of new guests is not necessary, since the Sabbath itself is considered as ""guests.""21. Ketubot 7b derives this rule from the account of the wedding between Ruth and Boaz. Ruth 4:2 relates that Boaz invited ten men to witness the marriage. 22. Only six blessings are mentioned below; the seventh blessing is the blessing over the wine. (See Hilchot Ishut 10:4.)23. Rashi (Ketubot 7b) explains that this blessing is in praise of the creation of Adam, the first man. In Hilchot Ishut, where the text of the wedding blessings is repeated, this blessing follows the blessing ""who has created all things for His glory."" This order is the sequence in which these blessings are recited today. It appears more appropriate, particularly according to Rashi's commentary (loc. cit.), which explains that the blessing ""who has created all things..."" is not directly connected to the wedding itself, but rather is recited in appreciation of the guests who have come to celebrate together with the new couple. [The repetition of the text of the blessings in two separate halachot, something very out of character for the Rambam in the Mishneh Torah, has aroused the attention of the commentaries. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the text of the blessings here was added by the printers, and not by the Rambam himself.]24. Despite the fact that this blessing follows two (or three) blessings which begin with ""Blessed...,"" it also begins with ""Blessed...."" Among the explanations offered is that the first blessings are short, and if the line ""Blessed..."" were not mentioned, they would appear as a single blessing (Tosafot, Ketubot, loc. cit.).25. Rashi (loc. cit.) interprets this as a reference to the creation of woman, who was created from man (""his own self""), and gives him the potential for reproduction (""a structure that will last for all time"").26. ""The barren one"" refers to Jerusalem. Psalms 137:6 states: ""Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy."" Thus, at the height of the wedding celebration, we recall the holy city and pray that it be rebuilt. 27. This is a prayer that the bride and groom enjoy the happiness experienced by Adam in Eve before the first sin. Several manuscripts and early printings of the Mishneh Torah mention a different conclusion for this blessing, ""Blessed are You, God, who brings joy to His people, Israel, and rebuilds Jerusalem."" (In this context, note the commentary of the Lechem Mishneh.)28. The blessing joins our wishes for the happiness of the particular couple with our hope for the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The ultimate marriage relationship is the bond between God and the Jewish people, which will be realized in the Messianic age. Thus, the two themes, marriage and redemption, share an intrinsic link.29. Rashi, Ketubot 8a, explains the difference between the last two blessings. The fifth of the blessings concludes with a request that the bride and groom enjoy a lifetime of happiness and success together. The sixth and final blessing concludes with a request that they find happiness in each other, that their wedding joy be extended throughout their lives. Alternatively, the final blessing is a blessing for the Jewish people as a whole who find fulfillment in married life.) "
29,11,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Circumcision 3:9","Come and see how severe a matter circumcision is. Moses, our teacher, was not granted even a temporary respite from [fulfilling this mitzvah]. (As Exodus 4:24-26 relates, when Moses returned to Egypt, he took his newborn son, Eliezer, with him. He did not circumcise him immediately and, therefore, an angel came in the form of a snake and swallowed him. Tziporah his wife realized the source of the problem and circumcised her son. After this, the angel retracted. (See Nedarim 32a.))  The Torah mentions only three covenants regarding all its mitzvot, as [Deuteronomy 28:69] states: ""These are the words of the covenant that God commanded... in addition to the covenant that He established with you in Chorev."" And [Deuteronomy 29:9-11] states: ""You are all standing today... to enter into a covenant with God, your Lord."" Thus, there are three covenants. In contrast, thirteen covenants were established with Abraham, our Patriarch, with regard to circumcision: (In the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 49, the Rambam writes that the brit is a sign of the covenant of the oneness of God. ""When a person is circumcised he enters into the covenant of Abraham which obligates him to know [God's] unity."" This covenant of unity defines the nature of the Jewish people. It is natural that when people share a common sign, love and mutual assistance among them grow.)  ""I will place My covenant between Me and you"" [Genesis 17:2], ""And I, behold, My covenant is with you"" [ibid.:4], ""I will establish My covenant between Me and you"" [ibid.:7], ""For an eternal covenant"" [ibid.], ""And you shall observe My covenant"" [ibid.:9], ""This is My covenant which you shall observe"" [ibid.:10], ""It will be a sign of the covenant"" [ibid.:11], ""My covenant will be in your flesh"" [ibid.:13], ""For an eternal covenant"" [ibid.], ""He will have nullified My covenant"" [ibid.:14], ""And I will establish My covenant with Him"" [ibid.:19], ""For an eternal covenant"" [ibid.], ""And I will establish My covenant with Isaac"" [ibid.:21]."
29,11,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Seventh Treatise on Repentance 5:24","(3) He should put to heart the days during which he turned away from G-d, and did not care about His service, in spite of His continuous goodness towards him during then, as written: ""For of old I broke your yoke, I tore open your yoke-bands, and you said, 'I will not pass'"" (Yirmiya 2:20), the explanation of ""I will not pass"" is: ""I will not take on Your service, and will not enter Your covenant"", as if he said ""I will not pass in Your covenant"", similar to the matter ""to pass you over the covenant of the L-rd your G-d"" (Devarim 29:11)."
29,11,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nitzavim 6:1","(Deut. 29:11 [12]:) TO ENTER INTO THE COVENANT WITH THE LORD YOUR GOD, EVEN THROUGH HIS OATH. Three covenants did the Holy One make with Israel: one when they came out of Egypt, one when they stood before Mount Sinai, {one at Horeb,} and one here. (Tanh., Deut. 8:3.)  But why did he make  with them here? Because they had {cooked} [revoked] the one which he had made with them , (This identification appears in the parallel from the traditional Tanhuma.)  when they said (of the Golden Calf in Exod. 32:4): THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL. For that reason he made < another covenant> with them on Horeb (The text should probably read: “With them here,” in accord with Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34.)  and established a curse over it for whoever would go back on his words. Now the word, ENTER (rt.: 'BR),  only be in the sense of one who says to his companion: May this curse come (rt.: 'BR) upon me, if I go back on this word. And so you find that, when they provoked the Holy One, they went into captivity. What did Daniel say (in Dan. 7:11)? AND ALL ISRAEL HAS TRANSGRESSED (rt.: 'BR) YOUR TORAH [….] SO THE CURSE (alah) AND THE OATH ARE POURED DOWN UPON US. Now alah can only be a curse, (Alah can also mean “oath” and “covenant.”)  as where it is stated (in Numb. 5:27): AND THE WOMAN SHALL BECOME A CURSE (alah).  to teach you that, just as one imposes an oath on the suspect adulteress, so the Holy One imposed an oath upon Israel. But perhaps you will say: Why all this bother? It is not because I need you? Rather what shall I do to you, when I have already sworn to your ancestors, that I will never change anything for you and your children? It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:12 [13]): IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH YOU TODAY AS HIS PEOPLE […,] . It also says (in Cant. 7:6 [5]): THE KING IS BOUND BY THE TRESSES. Now no one is bound except by an oath. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 30:4 [3]):  AND BINDS HERSELF WITH A BOND <….> Therefore, one cannot break his oath."
29,11,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:11:1-2","לעברך בברית ה’ אלוקיך, ”for you to pass into the covenant with the Lord your G’d.” This “passing” is equivalent to “entering into.“ This is evident from the fact that the Torah does not use the regular preposition used with the verb עבר, i.e. לעבור על, but the preposition ב. What occurred here is similar to what occurred when G’d concluded the covenant with Avraham in Genesis 15,17 when He passed between the pieces. This is why Onkelos translates לאעלות בקיימא. The word ובאלתו refers to the people of Israel; in other words: “by means of its oath which He made you swear and which you accepted upon yourselves.” It is possible to understand the word ובאלתו as referring to G’d, meaning “and by means of His oath which He swore to you.” The whole verse then would mean: “you are standing here today ready to enter the covenant and oath of the Lord by means of which He swore that You will be His people and that He will be your G’d.” The verse following would prove that this is the meaning, seeing the Torah writes there: “as He said to you and swore to your fathers.” Further reinforcement of this interpretation is provided by Samuel I 12,22: “seeing that the Lord had agreed (sworn) to make you His people.” Even though all the commentators there understand the word הואיל to be an expression of G’d’s goodwill, grace, I believe the word הואיל in that verse derives from the word אלה, and means “for G’d swore to make you His people.” This does not preclude that the oath itself was an expression of G’d’s goodwill towards the people so that there is no conflict between the two interpretations. Still further proof of the meaning of אלה in our verse is the comment in Tanchuma Nitzavim 3 on Song of Songs 7,6: מלך אסור ברהטים, usually translated as “a king held captive by tresses” (of hair). According to the Midrash the meaning is “a king who is bound by his oath.” The word אסר meaning oath, occurs in Numbers 30,7. G’d’s oath to the patriarchs that He would not exchange the Jewish people for any other nation is what ties Him to Israel. The word רהטים in the verse from Song of Songs which we quoted is a reference to the patriarchs; this word occurs in the record of their life stories both in Genesis 18,7 where the word הבקר is rendered by Onkelos as רהט; as well as in connection with Yaakov in Genesis 30,38. This is why G’d cannot violate His oath to the patriarchs . You will find that in Ezekiel 20 when the Jewish people challenged the continued validity of the Torah’s commandments by describing themselves as having been freed (sold) by their master (G’d) since they had become exiled, that the prophet did not accept that argument and vehemently pointed out that the basic relationship between G’d and the Jewish people is an eternal bond, that severing it would mean the total demise of the party who severed it. [I have merely summarized the dialogue in Ezekiel 20. Ed.] Basically, Ezekiel’s argument was that as long as the master had not received monetary compensation from the “buyer” of the slave no transaction had taken place at all; the Jewish people still belong to their erstwhile master, i.e. G’d. This is also reflected in the words of Isaiah 52,3: “you have been sold חנם, without price, therefore you will also be redeemed without monetary compensation having to be paid.”"
29,11,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:11:1","So that you pass into the covenant. I.e., you yourself must pass and not through others. And thus he explains afterwards: But it would be improper to interpret this, etc., i.e., through others. Because if so, how could it say Into the covenant of Hashem, your God, if one explains it to mean to be passed through by others, [since a covenant implies mutual consent]? Furthermore, how can one explain that it means to be passed through? For this would serve notice against acceptance of the covenant, for they could say, We were coerced! "
29,11,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:11:2","But, rather, as “for your performance of them.” This means to do them, i.e., you of your own volition and not through others.
"
29,11,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Nitzavim 3:1","(Deut. 29:11:) “To enter into the covenant with the Lord your God....” Three covenants did the Holy One, blessed be He, make with Israel when they came out of Egypt, one when they stood before Mount Sinai, (one at Horeb,) and one here. But why did he make [a covenant] with them here? Because they had revoked the one which He had made with them at Sinai, when they said (of the golden calf in Exod. 32:4), “This is your god, O Israel.” For that reason He made [another covenant] with them at Horeb (The text should probably read: “With them here,” in accord with Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34.)  and established a curse over it for whoever would go back on his words. Now the word, enter (rt.: 'br), [can] only be in the sense of one who says to his companion, “May this curse come (rt.: 'br) upon you, if you go back on me in this thing.” And so you find that, when Israel provoked [the Holy One, blessed be He], and they went into captivity, what did Daniel say (in Dan. 9:11)? “And all Israel has transgressed (rt.: 'br) Your Torah [...] so the curse (alah) and the oath are poured down upon us.” Now alah can only be a curse, (Alah can also mean “oath” and “covenant.”)  as where it is stated (in Numb. 5:27), “and the woman shall become a curse (alah).” [This is] to teach you that just as one imposes an oath on the suspect adulteress, so the Holy One, blessed be He, imposed an oath upon Israel. But perhaps you will say, “Why all this bother?” It is not because I need you? Rather what shall I do to you, when I have already sworn to your ancestors, that I will never replace you and your children? It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:12), “In order to establish you today as his people […] as he swore to your ancestors.” It [also] says (in Cant. 7:6), “a king is bound by his tresses.” Now bound [indicates] nothing except an oath. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 30:4), “[When a woman vows a vow to the Lord] and binds herself with a bond.” Therefore, He cannot break his oath. And so you find, when they sought to get rid of the yoke of His oath in the days of Ezekiel, it is written (in Ezek: 20:1), “some elders of Israel came to consult the Lord.” They said to him, “When the son of a priest buys a slave, is it legal for him to eat the terumah?” (The priestly tithe on produce.)  He said to them, “He may eat it.” They said to him, “If a priest returned and sold him to an [ordinary] Israelite, has he not left his jurisdiction?” He told them, “Yes.” They said to him, “We too have left the jurisdiction of [the Holy One, blessed be He]; are we not [now] like the all the [rest of the] world?” Ezekiel said to them (in Ezek. 20:32-33), “But that which you have in mind shall never come to pass, that should you say: let us become like the gentiles…. ‘As I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘surely I will [reign] over you with a powerful hand....’” He said to them, “As long as one has not sold [a slave], he is in his jurisdiction; and you have not been sold for a price.” It is so stated (in Is. 52:3), “For thus says the Lord, ‘You were sold for free, [and you shall be redeemed for no money].’” (Deut. 29:12:) “In order to establish you today as his people…,” so that I would not go back on the word that I swore to your ancestors. Deut. 29:13), “And not only with you [have I made this covenant and this oath].” But rather the generations that have yet to come were also there at that time, as stated (in vs. 14), “But with those who are [standing ('md)] here with us [today… and with those who are not here with us today].” R. Abahu said in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahmani, “Why does it say, ‘those who are [standing ('md)] here [...]; and those who are not here’ (without using the word, standing)? Because all the souls were there, [even] when [their] bodies had still not been created. It is for that reason [their] existence (literally, standing, rt.: 'md) is not stated here.” R. Eliezer said, “A curse will come upon Laban, because he said to Jacob (in Gen. 31:30), ‘Why did you steal my gods?’ It (i.e., such an idol) could not save itself from theft. [So] how could it save others? But Israel is not like that, as they serve the Holy One, blessed be He, about whom it is stated (in Deut. 10:21), “He is your praise, and He is your God, [who has done these great and awful things for you that your own eyes have seen].” He [also] watches over Israel like a father who watches over his son, as stated (in Ps. 121:4), “Behold the One keeping Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.”"
29,11,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Ezekiel 16:59:2,"that you despised an oath, etc. That one that you accepted upon yourself in Horeb (Deut. 29:11): “That you pass into the covenant of the Lord your God, etc.” But I shall not violate the covenant by not remembering it, because I am not like you."
29,12,Jewish Thought,"Man and God, Chapter 1 the Knowledge of God 223","For some mysterious reason in the Revised Version, followed here by the J.P.S. translation, the same Hebrew idiom, lih’yot l’Elohim, is changed in the translation. Accordingly, God promised Abraham to be a God unto him and to be the God of his children. Now, to say that God promises to be their God is good English, but it is disregarding completely the Hebrew idiom. Regrettably, it also conveys an unbiblical meaning. For God, the Creator of all the worlds and the Absolute Sovereign over all his creation, as he is depicted in the Bible, is of course God. For him to promise that he will be someone’s God in particular would be nonsensical. He is whatever he is. He is God and will not be anything in the future what he is not already now. He is God and as such, God over all. On the other hand, “to be a God unto thee,” the promise regarding Abraham personally according to the adopted translation, is closer to the Hebrew original, but hardly very meaningful. What does it mean to be a God to someone? We believe that there is no one who has the slightest intelligible notion of it. It is not surprising that in this passage, as well as in all other passages in the entire Bible, the idiomatic quality of the Hebrew, lih’yot l’Elohim, was consistently overlooked. As long as the specific meaning of the term, Elohim, in this, and similar, context was not understood, the Hebrew idiom could not be appreciated. Nowhere does the phrase occur in the Bible: to be your God, or, to be their God. “Lih’yot l” does not mean: to be for, but, to become. Of course, to become God for you, would not do at all. What God promised Abraham was: I, God, will become Elohim for you and for your children. It makes excellent sense, if one realizes that the term Elohim indicates the providential attitude of God toward man, the manifestation of divine guidance and protection. “I shall become Elohim for you and for your children” does not mean that God will be his and his children’s God, which is meaningless, but that God will enter into a providential relationship with them and will be Elohim, Leader, Protector, Savior, unto them. There is no passage in the Bible, where the term occurs, where it has not exactly this meaning. In the case of Abraham, to be Elohim for him and for his children is connected with the eternal covenant and the promise of the land. As in the case of Abraham, so at later times too the covenant between God and Israel is the manifestation that God becomes Elohim for Israel. We find it in Deuteronomy and in Jeremiah. (Deut. 29:11–12; Jer. 31:32; 32:38.)  Often it is the Exodus which is mentioned to illustrate the point that God desires to be Elohim for the children of Israel. For instance: “For I am Y that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to become Elohim for you. (Lev. 11:45; cf. also, ibid. 22:33; 25:38; 26:45; Num. 16:41.) "

In Sifry Num. 14 the argument is: From the verse one infers that any oath implies a potential curse on the person taking the oath.) : “The Cohen has to administer to the woman the oath of the curse.”"
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

29,11,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 9:47,"“The priest shall administer an oath to her, and he shall say to the woman: If a man has not lain with you, and if you did not stray in defilement while married to your husband, be absolved of this water of bitterness that causes curse” (Numbers 5:19).  “The priest shall administer an oath to her” – this is the oath that they will fulfill the Torah, just as it says: “This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made [with you regarding all these matters]” (Exodus 24:8). There is no covenant without an oath. This is what Moses said to them: If you fulfilled the oath of the covenant, “if [a man] has not lain…,” that you did not stray after idol worship, that you did not prostrate yourself to it. “And if you did not stray” – if you did not sacrifice; “defilement” – that you did not frolic before it; “be absolved of this water of bitterness” – just as it says: “He said: If You will heed the voice of the Lord your God [and will perform what is right in His eyes…all of the diseases that I placed on Egypt I will not place upon you]” (Exodus 15:26).  “But you, if you strayed while married to your husband, and if you were defiled, and a man has lain carnally with you, other than your husband” (Numbers 5:20).  “You, if you strayed” – this is one who sacrificed to the calf. “But you, if you strayed” – this is one who burned incense. (To the calf.)  “If you were defiled” – this is one who poured libations. “And if you were defiled” – this is one who prostrated himself. “And a man has lain [carnally with you]” – this is one who accepted it upon them as a god, and said to it: “You are my god” (Isaiah 44:17). All these were with witnesses and without forewarning. (See section 48, which describes who was punished by the water.)  “The priest shall administer to the woman the oath of the curse, and the priest shall say to the woman: May the Lord render you as a curse and as an oath among your people, in the Lord causing your thigh to fall and your belly to distend” (Numbers 5:21).  “The priest shall administer to the woman the oath [of the curse [uvalato]]” – just as it says: “To pass you into the covenant of the Lord your God and His curse [uve’alato]” (Deuteronomy 29:11). A covenant is nothing other than an oath, just as it says: “Because both of them took an oath there. They made a covenant in Beersheba” (Genesis 21:31–32). From where is it derived that they took an oath with a curse [ala] at Sinai? It is as it is written: “These are the words of the covenant [that the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moav], besides the covenant that He made with them at Ḥorev” (Deuteronomy 28:69). It juxtaposes the covenant at Ḥorev with the covenant in the land of Moav. Just as there it was with an ala, so too, here it is with an ala. Which is the covenant at Ḥorev? “But if you will not heed Me…” (Leviticus 26:14). “And the priest shall say to the woman” – this is Moses. “May the Lord render you as a curse and as an oath…” – these are the curses in the book of Leviticus.  “This water that causes curse will enter your innards, to cause the belly to distend and the thigh to collapse; and the woman shall say: Amen, amen” (Numbers 5:22).   “This water that causes curse will enter” – this is the water of the brook into which Moses cast the gold dust of the calf, and Moses administered an oath to them by everything that they had received at Sinai that the water would examine them. “Will enter” is written here three times corresponding to the three sentences to which the worshippers of the calf were sentenced: The sword, examination by water, and a plague.   “To cause the belly to distend and the thigh to collapse” – it teaches that even Aaron, the paramour, (He is likened to the paramour because he facilitated the sin of the Golden Calf.)  was punished with them, as it is stated: “And [the Lord] was incensed with Aaron [to destroy him]” (Deuteronomy 9:20). “To destroy him” is nothing other than the death of children, just as it says: “I destroyed his fruit from above…” (Amos 2:9). All his sons were fit to die, but Moses prayed on his behalf and the two died corresponding to the two curses stated here: “To cause belly [beten] to distend and thigh [yarekh] to collapse.” From where is it derived that the verse is speaking of the death of children? It is as it is written: “The womb [habaten] is a reward” (Psalms 127:3); “the fruit of your womb [bitnekha]” (Deuteronomy 7:13); and it said: “Who emerged from Jacob’s loins [yerekh]” (Exodus 1:5).   And the two remained. Likewise it says: “For every matter of transgression” (Exodus 22:8) – it is speaking of Aaron, who caused Israel to transgress the commandment: “You shall not have [other gods]” (Exodus 20:3). “For an ox” (Exodus 22:8) – just as it says: “They exchanged their Glory for the molded image of an ox” (Psalms 106:20). “For a donkey” (Exodus 22:8) – these are the Egyptians, (The reference is to the Egyptians who left Egypt with Moses.)  who are called donkeys, just as it says: “Whose [flesh] is the flesh of donkeys” (Ezekiel 23:20); they incited Israel to craft the calf. “For a sheep” (Exodus 22:8) – this is Israel, who strayed after it and are called sheep, just as it says: “Israel is scattered sheep” (Jeremiah 50:17). “For a garment [salma]” (Exodus 22:8) – that they crowned it as king over them, just as it says: “You have a garment [simla]; be our ruler” (Isaiah 3:6). “For any lost item” (Exodus 22:8) – as they lost what they said at Sinai: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform” (Exodus 19:8). “Regarding which he says: This is it” (Exodus 22:8) – as they said regarding the calf: “This is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:4). “The statements of both of them shall come before the judges [elohim]” (Exodus 22:8) – this is Moses, who is called elohim: “See, I have placed you as a god [elohim] for Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:1). “Whomever elohim condemns [yarshiun]” (Exodus 22:8) – this is Moses; yarshian is written. (Yarshiun is plural; however, as it is written without the vav, it is expounded in the singular, yarshian, as a reference to Moses.)  “Shall pay double to the other [lere’ehu]” (Exodus 22:8) – these are his [Aaron’s] two sons that he paid to the Holy One blessed be He, who is a Companion [re’a] of Israel, (See Psalms 122:8.)  as they died.   “And the woman shall say: Amen, [amen]” – this is Israel, who answered amen after the curse of idol worship, just as it says: “Cursed is the man who will craft an idol…[and the entire people shall answer and say: Amen]” (Deuteronomy 27:15). Why “amen” twice? It corresponds to “cursed” in particular and “cursed” in general, just as it says: “Cursed is one who will not uphold [the matters of this Torah to perform them, and the entire people shall say: Amen] (Deuteronomy 27:26)."
29,11,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 14:6,"“On the eighth day, prince of the children of Manasseh, Gamliel son of Pedatzur” (Numbers 7:54).  “On the eighth day, prince of the children of Manasseh, Gamliel son of Pedatzur” – that is what is written: “I keep the king’s directive, [and in regard to the word of an oath to God]” (Ecclesiastes 8:2). If the king will say to you that his fear shall be upon you and you shall observe his decrees, observe his decrees. Likewise, it says: “You shall set a king over you” (Deuteronomy 17:15) – that his fear shall be upon you. And it says: “Any man who will disobey your directive, [and does not heed your words in everything that you command him, will be put to death]” (Joshua 1:18). “I” that is written here is nothing other than fear of the monarchy, just as Pharaoh said to Joseph. That is what is written: “Pharaoh said to Joseph: I am Pharaoh, and without you no man shall lift his hand…” (Genesis 41:44). What is “I am Pharaoh”? This is what Pharaoh said to Joseph: Even though I said to you: “You will be in charge of my house…” (Genesis 41:40) – that I made you king over everyone – be careful to treat me with respect and make me king over you. That is why he said: “I am Pharaoh” – in other words, that the fear of my kingship shall be upon you.   Similarly, “God spoke to Moses, and He said to him: I am the Lord” (Exodus 6:2) – why was it necessary to say here: “I am the Lord”? Rather, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: Even though I set you as a god for Pharaoh, as the verse states: “See, I have made you a god to Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:1) be careful that my Godliness will be upon you, as I made you a god only over Pharaoh alone. That is, “I keep the king’s directive” (Ecclesiastes 8:2) – it is “I” who requires you to “keep the king’s directive” – that his fear shall be upon you. Make certain that you do not flout his commands. Is it, perhaps, even if he tells you to violate the words of the Omnipresent? The verse states: “And in regard to the word of an oath to God” (Ecclesiastes 8:2) – the verse comes to inform you that “and in regard to the word of an oath of God” will be paramount over the command of flesh and blood, as you should nullify the will of flesh and blood before the will of God and fulfill all the commandments that are in the Torah, as you entered into an oath in their regard to fulfill them, just as it says: “To pass you into the covenant of the Lord your God and into His oath…” (Deuteronomy 29:11), and it says: “[Cursed be] who will not uphold the matters of this Torah to perform them; and the entire people shall say: Amen” (Deuteronomy 27:26).  Similarly, “each of you shall fear his mother and his father…” (Leviticus 19:3) – is it, perhaps, even if his father said to him: Slaughter for me and cook for me on Shabbat, that he should listen to him? The verse states: “And you shall observe My Shabbatot” (Leviticus 19:3) – all of you are obligated in My honor. Here too, “and the word of an oath to God” (Ecclesiastes 8:2) – as above the word of the king observe the word of an oath to God.  “Do not be frightened; leave his presence [mipanav]; [do not remain in a bad situation, as he will do what he wills]” (Ecclesiastes 8:3). If [a king of] flesh and blood will become angry at you in order to cause you to violate the statutes of the Torah, do not be frightened by his anger and follow his counsel, just as it says: “Who has not walked in the counsel of the wicked” (Psalms 1:1). Panav is nothing other than his anger, just as it says: “And the expression on his face [anpohi] was distorted” (Daniel 3:19). That is, “leave his presence”; “do not remain in a bad situation [bedavar]” – do not remain in his path to follow it, just as it says: “And did not remain in the path of sinners” (Psalms 1:1).  What is “bedavar” (Ecclesiastes 8:3)? It is that you should not fear that evil matter, that he will say to you that he will burn you, kill you, or subject you to harsh suffering if you do not fulfill his decree, and he will threaten you that there is no God in the world who will be able to rescue you from his hand. That is what is written thereafter: “As he will do what he wills” (Ecclesiastes 8:3). Just as Nebuchadnezzar said to Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya: “At that time you will be cast into the burning fiery furnace; who is the god who will save you from my hands?” (Daniel 3:15). “Since authority is by the king’s word, [who will say to him: What are you doing?]” (Ecclesiastes 8:4). If you devote yourself to the mitzvot to fulfill the decree of the Holy One blessed be He and to nullify the decrees of flesh and blood, what is your reward? When the Holy One blessed be He issues a decree to bring calamity to the world – as he is the King of the world and Ruler of everything, to do everything that He desires and no one can impede him: “He is of one mind, and who can respond to Him? His soul desires, and He does” (Job 23:13) – you will stand and ask for mercy regarding the decree to abrogate it. The Holy One blessed be He will show forbearance to you, and He will nullify it because you nullified the decree of flesh and blood in order to fulfill His decree. That is why it is stated: “Since authority is by the king’s word” – this is the Holy One blessed be He, when He says to bring something to the world to inform of his authority in the world, just as it says: “God caused that they would experience fear before Him” (Ecclesiastes 3:14). Know, who can impede His decree and say to Him: ‘Why are You doing so’? It is one who observes mitzvot. That is why it is stated: “Who will say to him: What are you doing?” Who can say to Him: ‘Why are You doing this to Your creations? Descend to them with the attribute of mercy’? That is one who observes His mitzvot. That is what is written: “One who observes a mitzva [will know no evil matter]” (Ecclesiastes 8:5).   What is “will know no evil matter” (Ecclesiastes 8:5)? It is measure for measure; he did not remain in a bad situation, therefore, “he will know no evil matter.” “A wise man’s heart will know the time and judgment” (Ecclesiastes 8:5) – as there is a wise man who considers the consequences and reckons the loss from a mitzva against its reward and the loss from a transgression against its reward. He considers in his heart: If I transgress His mitzvot, and I have an opportunity to do what I want and there is no one who can impede me, tomorrow, the time will come when the Holy One blessed be He will execute judgment against him (Referring to himself.)  because he violated His Torah. Likewise it says: “The wise man’s eyes are in his head, but the fool [walks in darkness]” (Ecclesiastes 2:14). And it says: “The heart of the wise inclines to his right, [and the heart of a fool inclines to his left]” (Ecclesiastes 10:2). “A wise man’s heart will know the time and judgment” – one whose heart is wise knows that if he transgresses the mitzvot, that the time will come when the Holy One blessed be He will execute judgment against him, and he refrains from the transgression. That is what is written thereafter: “For there is a time and a judgment for every matter…” (Ecclesiastes 8:6) – regarding every situation where a person performs his will and nullifies the will of the Omnipresent, it should be known to him that he is destined to be judged. Even though retribution is not exacted from him immediately, let him not think that the Holy One blessed be He would overlook his iniquity for him, but rather, He is slow to anger and collects what is due to Him. When does He exact retribution from him? It is when the hin is filled. Likewise it says: “With the filling of his quota, he will be troubled; [the hand of all travail will come upon him]” (Job 20:22). That is why it is stated: “As the evil of man overwhelms him” (Ecclesiastes 8:6); just as He did with the generation of the Flood, as He gave them an extension but ultimately exacted retribution from them, just as it says: “The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth…” (Genesis 6:5). What is written thereafter? “The Lord said: I will obliterate man…” (Genesis 6:7).  “For he does not know what will be, [for whenever it will be, who will have told him]?” (Ecclesiastes 8:7). The verse comes to teach you that anyone who does not repent from a transgression that he committed and does not fear the Day of Judgment, when it will arrive they will not show him forbearance. Were he to come and say that he be given an extension so he could repent, they will not listen to him. That is, for whenever punishment “will be, who will have told him” so he would repent and be accepted. It is to say to you that prior to the sentence they listen to him; after the sentence they do not listen to him. That is why it is stated: “For whenever it will be, who will have told him?”  “There is no man who rules the spirit [to retain the spirit, and there is no rule on the day of death, and there is no sending a proxy in war, and wickedness will not rescue its owner]” (Ecclesiastes 8:8) – because we found that the Holy One blessed be He decreed four court-imposed death penalties for performers of transgressions. That is why four matters are written here, corresponding to them, where the living lack the ability to be rescued from them after their sentence. These are: “There is no man who rules the spirit [ruaḥ] to retain the spirit” – this is death by strangulation and the like, as a person dies from it only due to breath [ruaḥ], as he has no place from which to breathe. That is, “there is no man who rules the spirit” to exhale it when the day comes that the breath will be constricted in his body. “And there is no rule on the day of death” – this is death by stoning and the like, just as it says: “You shall stone him with stones, and he will die” (Deuteronomy 13:11). “There is no sending a proxy in war” – this is death by decapitation by sword and the like, just as it says: “Go out and wage war with Amalek” (Exodus 17:9), and it is written: “Joshua weakened [Amalek and its people by sword]” (Exodus 17:13). “And wickedness will not rescue its owner” – this is death by burning and the like, just as it says: “All the criminals and all the doers of wickedness will be straw; the day that is coming will burn them…” (Malachi 3:19). These are the four court-imposed death penalties mentioned in this verse.   Even though the Sanhedrin ceased and the four court-imposed death penalties were abrogated, the sentence of the four court-imposed death penalties were not abrogated, as the Holy One blessed be He judges the living to die of them with harsh punishments corresponding to them. One who incurs liability to be strangled either drowns in the river, dies of diphtheria, or is delivered into the hands of idol worshippers who strangle him. One who incurs liability to be stoned either falls off the roof, or a beast tramples him, or idol worshippers stone him. One who incurs liability to be beheaded, robbers come upon him and behead him. One who incurs liability to be burned either falls into the fire or a snake bites him. You learned that a person cannot escape the judgment of the Holy One blessed be He that He will not punish him measure for measure. That is why it is stated: “There is no man who rules the spirit….” (Ecclesiastes 8:8).  Another matter: “I keep the king’s directive” (Ecclesiastes 8:2) – it is speaking of Joseph the righteous, who observed the “I” that Pharaoh had said to him, just as it says: “Pharaoh said to Joseph: I am Pharaoh, [and without you no man shall lift his hand]” (Genesis 41:44), as he never flouted his command. “And the word of an oath to God” (Ecclesiastes 8:2) – as even though he entered into that prominence, he did not throw the yoke of Heaven from upon him and he feared the Holy One blessed be He, just as it says: “[I fear] God” (Genesis 42:18). That is why “God” is stated. (According to the Etz Yosef, the midrash is explaining that this is an allusion to the verse, “And the word of an oath to God” (Ecclesiastes 8:2).)  He was very cautious regarding the oath, as he did not take an oath “as the Lord lives,” but rather, “as Pharaoh lives, that you will not depart from here” (Genesis 42:15). That is, “an oath.” What is “the word of [divrat]”? It is because he separated himself from lasciviousness, just as it says: “He shall not see a lascivious matter [davar] in you” (Deuteronomy 23:15). And it says: The young woman, because [al devar] she did not cry out in the city…” (Deuteronomy 22:24). Likewise it says: “His master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said: Lie with me” (Genesis 39:7). What is written there? “He refused, and he said to his master’s wife: Behold, my master…” (Genesis 39:8). That is why it is stated: “The word of [divrat],” just as it says: “It was, as she spoke [kedabra] to Joseph day after day, and he did not heed her…” (Genesis 39:10).  “Do not be frightened; [leave] his presence” – when he entered the house to perform his labor, and the house was vacant and there was no person who could see him, just as it is written: “It was, on a certain day he went into the house to perform his labor, and there was no one [of the people of the household there in the house]” (Genesis 39:11), she came and seized his garment so that he would lie with her. Nevertheless, he was not frightened by her actions, and he went outside, just as it says: “He left his garment in her hand, fled, and went outside” (Genesis 39:12). That is why it is stated: “Do not be frightened; [leave] his presence.” He was not frightened by the house being vacant, but rather he fled and left, even though she said to him that if he would not lie with her, she would say to her husband that he sought to rape her, and her husband will kill him, and there would be no one to impede him, because he is his slave. Nevertheless, he did not allow her to fulfill her desire because of that evil matter that she threatened to do to him. That is why it says: “Do not remain in a bad situation, as God will do what He wills” (Ecclesiastes 8:3). From where do you derive that she threatened him in that manner? It is from the end of the matter. When she saw that her actions were to no avail, look at what she did: “She called to the people of her household, and spoke to them, saying.… It was, when he heard.… She placed his garment [beside her, until his master’s arrival home]. She spoke to him…[saying: The Hebrew slave whom you brought to us came to me to mock me]. It was, as I raised my voice [and cried out, that he left his garment with me, and fled outside]” (Genesis 39:14–18).  “Since authority is by the king’s word…” (Ecclesiastes 8:4) – what reward did the Holy One blessed be He give him for this? He placed him in a position of authority in the land of Egypt. That is what is written: “Since [authority is] by the king’s word…,” just as it says: “Pharaoh spoke to Joseph: In my dream, behold, I am…” (Genesis 41:17). “Authority” – just as it says: “Joseph was the ruler over the land” (Genesis 42:6). “Who will say to him: What are you doing?” (Ecclesiastes 8:4), just as it says: “Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you shall do” (Genesis 41:55). Why to that extent? It is because he observed the mitzvot. That is what is written: “One who observes a mitzva will know no evil matter” (Ecclesiastes 8:5). What is “will know no evil matter”? It is this evil matter that the butler said, just as it says: “There with us was a Hebrew lad, a slave of the chief executioner…” (Genesis 41:12). He said three matters here in Joseph’s regard: “Lad” – that he was a fool, just as it says: “Folly is bound in the heart of a lad” (Proverbs 22:15); “Hebrew” – an enemy; “slave” – that he is not worthy of kingship. Nevertheless, Joseph knew no evil matter. In other words, the matter did not affect him, as he ruled.  “A wise man’s heart will know the time and judgment” (Ecclesiastes 8:5) – this was Joseph, who was called wise, just as it says: “There is no one as wise and understanding as you” (Genesis 41:39). He knew that he would be held accountable had he touched Potifar’s wife; that is why he withdrew from her. That is what is written: “He did not heed her [to lie with her, to be with her]” (Genesis 39:10); “to lie with her” in this world; “to be with her” in the World to Come.  Another matter: “A wise man’s heart will know the time and judgment” (Ecclesiastes 8:5) – this is the Holy One blessed be He, in whose regard it is written: “Wise of heart and mighty of power” (Job 9:4). He brought about a time to reward Joseph on the basis of measure for measure. How so? He ruled over his inclination and did not touch her; therefore, he became a ruler, just as it says: “Joseph was the ruler over the land” (Genesis 42:6). He did not heed her, just as it says: “He did not heed her” (Genesis 39:10); therefore, the Holy One blessed be He crowned him as king over Egypt in its entirety, and everyone heeded his words, just as it says: “What he says to you, you shall do” (Genesis 41:55). His mouth [piv] did not kiss [nashak] in transgression; therefore, “at your directive [pikha] my entire people will be sustained [yishak]” (Genesis 41:40). He said: “There is no one greater in this house than I…” (Genesis 39:9) in order to rebuff her; therefore, “you will be in charge of my house” (Genesis 41:40). He did not seize her, but she seized him with her hands, just as it says: “She seized him by his garment…” (Genesis 39:12); therefore, “Pharaoh removed his signet ring from upon his hand, and he placed it upon Joseph’s hand” (Genesis 41:42). He left his garment in her hand; therefore, “he dressed him in linen garments” (Genesis 41:42). He did not bend his neck toward her; therefore, “he placed a gold chain on his neck” (Genesis 41:42). He did not mount [rakhav] her; therefore, “he had him ride [vayarkev] in the second chariot that he had” (Genesis 41:43). She called the people of her household in this regard, just as it says: “She called the people of her household…” (Genesis 39:14); therefore, “they called before him: Kneel” (Genesis 41:43). He was relegated to the prison for this, just as it says: “He relegated him [vayitenehu] to the prison” (Genesis 39:20); therefore, “he appointed him [venaton oto] over the land of Egypt” (Genesis 41:43). He did not direct his glance toward her, and not toward the Egyptian women when he ruled, just as it says: “Joseph is a fruitful son, a fruitful bough alongside a spring [alei ayin]” (Genesis 49:22), as he averted his eye [she’ilem eino] from Potifar’s wife and from the Egyptian women.   “Branches [banot] (Banot can also mean women.)  ran atop the wall [alei shur]” (Genesis 49:22). Therefore, alei shur. Rabbi Reuven said: What is alei shur? The Holy One blessed be He said: It is incumbent upon me to pay a reward for that eye. How so? The Rabbis taught that in the Temple they would eat offerings of lesser sanctity within the wall, within the wall of Jerusalem. But in Shilo, which was in the portion of Joseph, they would eat it within eyeshot. (Within eyeshot of the Tabernacle (Rambam, Mishna Zevaḥim 14:6).)  That is alei shur, just as it says: “The eye of one who sees me will not behold me [teshureni]” (Job 7:8). Rabbi Azarya said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Joseph: You observed the mitzva of: “You shall not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:13), which is the seventh of the Commandments, and you did not commit adultery with Potifar’s wife. And you observed the mitzva of: “You shall not steal” (Exodus 20:13), which is the eighth of the Commandments, as you did not steal Potifar’s property and you did not “steal” his wife, just as it says: “The eye of the adulterer observes the night, saying: No eye will behold [teshureni] me…” (Job 24:15). The time will come when I will repay you for them. Tomorrow, when the princes come to bring [offerings] for the dedication of the altar, the princes of your two sons, one will present his offering on the seventh day, and the second on the eighth day. And no other tribe will interpose between your two sons, just as you did not interpose (Namely, you did not differentiate between them. You observed both of them. As a reward, Benjamin did not interpose between Ephraim and Manasseh.)  between “you shall not commit adultery” and “you shall not steal,” as it is written: “On the seventh day, prince of the children of Ephraim.… On the eighth day, prince of the children of Manasseh…” (Numbers 7:48–54) That is why it is written: “A wise man’s heart will know the time and judgment” (Ecclesiastes 8:5)."
29,11,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 100:1:9,"In our Parshah, Moses presents a threefold picture of the moral platform of the Jewish people, parallel to what emerged at creation. Then we had three stages. 1) Adam as he had been in Eden before the sin. 2) Adam after the sin, when he hid from G'd, having absorbed sin into his system. 3) Adam's quest for forgiveness for 130 years after having heard the penalty that had been decreed. Our Parshah begins at that point. ""You are standing today upright in the presence of the Lord your G'd.” Just as Adam had stood upright in Paradise, so the Jewish people had their hour of being able to stand upright before the Lord. All man had to do at that time was to bridge the natural gap between him and G'd, since he did contain matter that came from that part of creation most remote from the pure Spirit. However, when under the guidance of ""your elders, your judges, your tribal heads,"" the attainment of closeness to G'd would seem assured. The message is that leadership can accomplish for the nation, what virtues accomplish for the individual in this context. In this context, the word ""head"" refers to the intellectual leadership; ""elders"" refers to leadership by those who no longer allow their yetzer hara, evil urge to dominate them. ""Police"" refers to the ability to retain one's composure even when under provocation. (The task of the police is to maintain discipline) Moses goes on to say ""every Jewish man"". He means that anyone who is guided by the four principles we have listed, qualifies for the title ""a Jewish man."" There were also present all those that had not yet matured, i.e. ""your children, your wives, your strangers;"" the latter are on the threshold of attaining their perfection and are all ""marching"" along with the covenant of G'd. (Deut 29, 9-11) "
29,11,Commentary,"Bekhor Shor, Deuteronomy 29:11:1-3","To cause you to cross over in the covenant All of you are ready to cross into the covenant, and all of you are together. And for this it's good to execute the commandment now, that not one of you is able to say: I was not in the covenant, and did not accept the covenant upon myself. Since when you will cross the Yarden and be scattered each man to his inheritance and portion, it will be impossible to gather all of you together as you are now - since it's impossible that there will be no birthing woman or sick person or person kept aaginst their will, or lame person, and it's impossible to leave the houses and cities without any creature. But now, behold all of you are in one area and one camp, and all of you hear and see the execution of the covenant, and not one of you is able to withdraw and say 'I was not in the covenant'. ""Execution [lit. ""cutting"" כריתות] of the covenenant"" since they cut the calf into two, and ""to cause you to cross over"" since they passed between the parts of the calf that Avraham our father did between the parts, as it says ""and divided them in the midst"" (Bereishit 15:10). And like they did when they executed the covenant to send the slaves free (Yirmiyahu 34:13), the calf which was cut into two and they passed between the parts, this is a sign that when you pass over the covenant this is how it will be cut. Like, ""And Shmuel took one milk-goat"" (I Samuel 7:9), ""And Tzamad took a cow and cut it into parts"" (I Samuel 11:7) -- to say, which will not go after Shaul and after Shmuel, so will be done to his cow. To bring you over As one man.  In the covenant of GOD your God and into Their curseThat you will accept upon yourself the covenant and the curse - ""curse"" the language of oath and of curse, that you accept upon yourself to have sworn an oath and accept the commandments to keep them, and the curse which will come upon you if you do not keep; and if you keep, the blessing and the life and the peace."
29,12,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:12:1,"למען הקים אתך היום לו לעם THAT HE MAY ESTABLISH THEE TO-DAY FOR A PEOPLE UNTO HIMSELF — He undertakes so much trouble (in making another covenant with you) in order that He may keep (הקים) you for a people in His presence,"
29,12,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:12:2,"והוא יהיה לך לאלהים SINCE HE MUST BE UNTO THEE A GOD, because He has promised it unto you and has sworn unto your fathers not to exchange their descendants for another nation. For this reason He binds you by these oaths not to provoke Him to anger since He, on His part, cannot dissociate Himself from you. — Thus far I have given an exposition according to the literal sense of the chapter. An Agadic explanation, however, is: Why is the section beginning with the words, “Ye are standing this day” put in juxtaposition to the curses in the previous chapter? Because when Israel heard these ninety-eight curses besides the forty-nine that are contained in Torath-Cohanim (Leviticus 26:14 ff.), their faces turned pale (they were horrified), and they exclaimed, “Who can possibly stand against these?!” Therefore Moses began to calm them: “See, you are standing today before the Lord!” — many a time have you provoked the Omnipresent to anger and yet He has not made an end to you, but you still continue in His presence (Midrash Tanchuma, Nitzavim 1)."
29,12,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:12:3,"היום THIS DAY — like the “day” which endures for ever, for though it becomes dark for a period it shines again, (cf. Midrash Tanchuma, Nitzavim 1, Sanhedrin 110b); so has He made you shine (i.e. given you periods when you have had nought but happiness) and will again make you shine; and it is just the curses and the sufferings that give you permanence and stability (נצבים) before Him. — So, too, the section preceding this (1 ff. which follows immediately after the curses) consists of comforting words: “Ye have seen all the Lord did [before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, etc.]”.  — Another explanation of אתם נצבים: Because the Israelites were now passing from one leader to another, from Moses to Joshua, therefore he (Moses) made them stand in ranks (מצבה) that he might address admonitions to them. Similarly did Joshua (cf. Joshua 24:1) and similarly did Samuel, who said, (I Samuel 12:7): “Now therefore take your stand (התיצבו) that I may reason with you before the Lord”, when they were leaving his hand (leadership) and were coming under the hand of Saul (cf. Midrash Tanchuma, Nitzavim 1)."

29,12,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:12:1,"למען הקים אותך היום, ""In order to establish you today,"" etc. The reason Moses makes the Israelites potentially liable for many penalties is to make certain they would be G'd's people and would be afraid of sinning due to the terrible curses of which the Torah warns potential sinners."
29,12,Quoting Commentary,Sforno on Leviticus 26:12:2,"והייתי לכם לאלוקים, I will be a special G’d, yours alone. You will not have recourse to any other “leader,” any intermediary who will have an input into shaping your destiny. This is why your eternal existence will not again be threatened. This is the true significance of being בצלמי ובדמותי, “in My image (and in My form.”), meaning as it had been G’d’s original intention. This intention had been briefly realised again at the revelation at Mount Sinai, only to have again been aborted when the golden calf was made and the people danced around it. When G’d said in Exodus 6,7 “I will take you to be My people and to be your G’d, He had meant the restoration of man’s original perfection as he had been when first created, becoming the gift of the Jewish people at Mount Sinai.  On the other hand, Deuteronomy 29,12 when G’d also speaks of the result of the covenant being that He will be the G’d of the Jewish people, He did not refer to such lofty ideals at that time. At that point the Torah was satisfied with ensuring the uninterrupted function of the Tabernacle as the home of the Shechinah on earth. This was the reduced objective we had heard about in Exodus 29,45 when G’d spoke about making His residence among the Jewish people in that Tabernacle, not wherever they would be in areas beyond the Tabernacle. G’d would indeed be the Jewish people’s G’d, with all that this entails in terms of His personal providence, but He would not be described as dwelling “among” them, or “within” them, depending on how we want to understand the word בתוכם. However, we would be His people, if all our efforts would be designed to carry out G’d’s will to the extent that He had revealed it to us. After all, every people does no less than this for its king of flesh and blood.

29,12,Jewish Thought,"Kol Dodi Dofek, The Covenants of Sinai and Egypt 12","Third, shared suffering is expressed in a feeling of shared obligation and responsibility. When the ‎children of Israel left Egypt, Moses and Aaron fell on their faces, pleaded before God, and said: ‎‎“Lord, God of Hosts of all flesh, shall one man sin and You direct divine wrath at the entire ‎congregation?” (Numbers 16:22).This prayer accomplished that which the “shepherds of Israel” ‎‎(Ezekiel 34:2) sought. The Holy One agreed with their action and only punished Korah and his ‎cohorts. However, God only demonstrated this loving-kindness momentarily. Forever after, the “I” ‎is ensnared in the sin of his fellow, if he had it within his power to reprimand, admonish, and bring ‎his neighbor to repentance. The people of Israel have a collective responsibility, both halakhic and ‎moral, for one another. The discrete units coalesce into a single halakhic-moral unity, with one all-‎encompassing and normative conscience and consciousness. The halakhah has already decreed ‎that “all Jews are sureties for one another” (TB Shavu’ot 39a), such that one who has already ‎fulfilled his personal mitzvah is not considered fully absolved thereby and may therefore fulfill the ‎obligation on behalf of others who have not as yet done so. The “I” is not exempt from its ‎obligation so long as his neighbor has not fulfilled that which is incumbent upon him. There is a ‎special covenant of mutual responsibility among the children of Israel. This covenant is expressed ‎in the blessings and imprecations pronounced on Mounts Gerizim and Ebal (Deuteronomy 11:29). ‎It is based upon the notion of peoplehood revealed to Moses in Egypt. Out of this concept grew ‎the covenant of mutual obligation. Moses, the dean of all prophets, in relating this covenant of ‎mutual obligation, emphasized: “For that He may establish you today unto Him as a people, and He ‎shall be unto you as a God” (Deuteronomy 29:12). He thus returned to the formulation of the ‎Covenant of Egypt. “And I will take you to Me as a people, and I will be your God” (Exodus 6:7). ‎Here the notion of shared fate was elevated from the plane of communal-political suffering to that ‎of halakhic and moral responsibility. We are all sureties for one another, as it is said: “And the ‎revelations belong to us and to our children forever” (Deuteronomy 29:28).‎12"
29,12,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nitzavim 6:1","(Deut. 29:11 [12]:) TO ENTER INTO THE COVENANT WITH THE LORD YOUR GOD, EVEN THROUGH HIS OATH. Three covenants did the Holy One make with Israel: one when they came out of Egypt, one when they stood before Mount Sinai, {one at Horeb,} and one here. (Tanh., Deut. 8:3.)  But why did he make  with them here? Because they had {cooked} [revoked] the one which he had made with them , (This identification appears in the parallel from the traditional Tanhuma.)  when they said (of the Golden Calf in Exod. 32:4): THIS IS YOUR GOD, O ISRAEL. For that reason he made < another covenant> with them on Horeb (The text should probably read: “With them here,” in accord with Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34.)  and established a curse over it for whoever would go back on his words. Now the word, ENTER (rt.: 'BR),  only be in the sense of one who says to his companion: May this curse come (rt.: 'BR) upon me, if I go back on this word. And so you find that, when they provoked the Holy One, they went into captivity. What did Daniel say (in Dan. 7:11)? AND ALL ISRAEL HAS TRANSGRESSED (rt.: 'BR) YOUR TORAH [….] SO THE CURSE (alah) AND THE OATH ARE POURED DOWN UPON US. Now alah can only be a curse, (Alah can also mean “oath” and “covenant.”)  as where it is stated (in Numb. 5:27): AND THE WOMAN SHALL BECOME A CURSE (alah).  to teach you that, just as one imposes an oath on the suspect adulteress, so the Holy One imposed an oath upon Israel. But perhaps you will say: Why all this bother? It is not because I need you? Rather what shall I do to you, when I have already sworn to your ancestors, that I will never change anything for you and your children? It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:12 [13]): IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH YOU TODAY AS HIS PEOPLE […,] . It also says (in Cant. 7:6 [5]): THE KING IS BOUND BY THE TRESSES. Now no one is bound except by an oath. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 30:4 [3]):  AND BINDS HERSELF WITH A BOND <….> Therefore, one cannot break his oath."
29,12,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nitzavim 8:1","(Deut. 29:12 [13]:) IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH YOU TODAY AS HIS PEOPLE…, i.e., so that I would not go back on the word that I swore to their ancestors. Deut. 29:13 [14]): AND NOT ONLY WITH YOU , but the generations that have yet to come were also there, as stated (in vs. 14 [15]): BUT WITH THOSE WHO ARE  HERE WITH US  … AND WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE WITH US TODAY. Now why does it say: THOSE WHO ARE  HERE? And why does it say: THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE (without using the word STANDING)? Because all the souls were there,  when  bodies had still not been created. It is for that reason  existence (literally: standing, rt.: 'MD) is not stated here. R. Eleazar said: A curse will come upon Laban, because he said to Jacob (in Gen. 31:30): WHY DID YOU STEAL MY GODS? It (i.e., such an idol) could not save itself [from theft]. How could it save others? (Cf. Mark 15:31 = Matthew 27:42 // Luke 23:35.)  But Israel is not like that, as stated (in Deut. 10:21): HE IS YOUR PRAISE, AND HE IS YOUR GOD, . He also watches over Israel like a father who watches over his son, as stated (in Ps. 121:4): BEHOLD THE ONE KEEPING ISRAEL SHALL NEITHER SLUMBER NOR SLEEP."
29,12,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:12:1","He has committed Himself with such great effort, etc. Rashi has the following difficulty: You cannot say that this In order,, etc. is the reason He ratified the covenant with them, because the reason He ratified the covenant with them is stated afterwards (v. 17) where it says, Perhaps there is among you a man or a woman or a family or a tribe,, etc. If so, what is this in order referring to? Rashi therefore explains, He has committed himself with such great effort, etc. I.e., the verse is answering the question why the Holy One made the effort of binding them by oath. He should simply have given them a commandment and if they listened well and good, and if not, He will punish them as with all the other commands. However, he committed Himself with such great effort because He already swore to your forefathers not to exchange, etc. Therefore He had to bring them, etc. "

"
29,12,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:12:2,"Another meaning why Moses wrote down all this may be so that people would not complain why G'd makes them responsible for the conduct of their peers. It is difficult enough to keep all the commandments without having to worry about everybody else keeping them too. This is why Moses said that G'd's intention in all this is for the benefit of the Jewish people, enabling Him to establish the Jewish people as His people. If not for this new commitment, some Israelites would backslide starting with minor sins and eventually becoming guilty of the commission of serious sins. Ultimately, the Israelites would forfeit their status as G'd's people. G'd initiated this mutual responsibility to act as the guarantee that such backsliding would not occur."
29,12,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 31:14:3,"והתיצבו באהל מועד, ""and stand both of you in the Tent of Meeting, etc."" This is the first instance where G'd commands Joshua to display a symbol of his new authority in Moses' presence. G'd did this by giving both Moses and Joshua simultaneous instructions using the plural התיצבו. We have explained this word as meaning ""being appointed"" in connection with Deut. 29,12. The word has a similar meaning in Samuel I 13,14 where Samuel tells King Saul ויצוהו ה׳ לנגיד על עמו, that in His heart G'd had already appointed someone else as leader of His people. This was some time before G'd ordered Samuel to anoint one of Yishai's sons as king. G'd's words to Joshua ""for you will bring the children of Israel to the land, etc."" (verse 22) are interpreted in Sanhedrin 8 as another such appointment of Joshua to a position of authority."
29,12,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Nitzavim 3:1","(Deut. 29:11:) “To enter into the covenant with the Lord your God....” Three covenants did the Holy One, blessed be He, make with Israel when they came out of Egypt, one when they stood before Mount Sinai, (one at Horeb,) and one here. But why did he make [a covenant] with them here? Because they had revoked the one which He had made with them at Sinai, when they said (of the golden calf in Exod. 32:4), “This is your god, O Israel.” For that reason He made [another covenant] with them at Horeb (The text should probably read: “With them here,” in accord with Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34.)  and established a curse over it for whoever would go back on his words. Now the word, enter (rt.: 'br), [can] only be in the sense of one who says to his companion, “May this curse come (rt.: 'br) upon you, if you go back on me in this thing.” And so you find that, when Israel provoked [the Holy One, blessed be He], and they went into captivity, what did Daniel say (in Dan. 9:11)? “And all Israel has transgressed (rt.: 'br) Your Torah [...] so the curse (alah) and the oath are poured down upon us.” Now alah can only be a curse, (Alah can also mean “oath” and “covenant.”)  as where it is stated (in Numb. 5:27), “and the woman shall become a curse (alah).” [This is] to teach you that just as one imposes an oath on the suspect adulteress, so the Holy One, blessed be He, imposed an oath upon Israel. But perhaps you will say, “Why all this bother?” It is not because I need you? Rather what shall I do to you, when I have already sworn to your ancestors, that I will never replace you and your children? It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:12), “In order to establish you today as his people […] as he swore to your ancestors.” It [also] says (in Cant. 7:6), “a king is bound by his tresses.” Now bound [indicates] nothing except an oath. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 30:4), “[When a woman vows a vow to the Lord] and binds herself with a bond.” Therefore, He cannot break his oath. And so you find, when they sought to get rid of the yoke of His oath in the days of Ezekiel, it is written (in Ezek: 20:1), “some elders of Israel came to consult the Lord.” They said to him, “When the son of a priest buys a slave, is it legal for him to eat the terumah?” (The priestly tithe on produce.)  He said to them, “He may eat it.” They said to him, “If a priest returned and sold him to an [ordinary] Israelite, has he not left his jurisdiction?” He told them, “Yes.” They said to him, “We too have left the jurisdiction of [the Holy One, blessed be He]; are we not [now] like the all the [rest of the] world?” Ezekiel said to them (in Ezek. 20:32-33), “But that which you have in mind shall never come to pass, that should you say: let us become like the gentiles…. ‘As I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘surely I will [reign] over you with a powerful hand....’” He said to them, “As long as one has not sold [a slave], he is in his jurisdiction; and you have not been sold for a price.” It is so stated (in Is. 52:3), “For thus says the Lord, ‘You were sold for free, [and you shall be redeemed for no money].’” (Deut. 29:12:) “In order to establish you today as his people…,” so that I would not go back on the word that I swore to your ancestors. Deut. 29:13), “And not only with you [have I made this covenant and this oath].” But rather the generations that have yet to come were also there at that time, as stated (in vs. 14), “But with those who are [standing ('md)] here with us [today… and with those who are not here with us today].” R. Abahu said in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahmani, “Why does it say, ‘those who are [standing ('md)] here [...]; and those who are not here’ (without using the word, standing)? Because all the souls were there, [even] when [their] bodies had still not been created. It is for that reason [their] existence (literally, standing, rt.: 'md) is not stated here.” R. Eliezer said, “A curse will come upon Laban, because he said to Jacob (in Gen. 31:30), ‘Why did you steal my gods?’ It (i.e., such an idol) could not save itself from theft. [So] how could it save others? But Israel is not like that, as they serve the Holy One, blessed be He, about whom it is stated (in Deut. 10:21), “He is your praise, and He is your God, [who has done these great and awful things for you that your own eyes have seen].” He [also] watches over Israel like a father who watches over his son, as stated (in Ps. 121:4), “Behold the One keeping Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.”"
29,12,Jewish Thought,"Man and God, Chapter 1 the Knowledge of God 223","For some mysterious reason in the Revised Version, followed here by the J.P.S. translation, the same Hebrew idiom, lih’yot l’Elohim, is changed in the translation. Accordingly, God promised Abraham to be a God unto him and to be the God of his children. Now, to say that God promises to be their God is good English, but it is disregarding completely the Hebrew idiom. Regrettably, it also conveys an unbiblical meaning. For God, the Creator of all the worlds and the Absolute Sovereign over all his creation, as he is depicted in the Bible, is of course God. For him to promise that he will be someone’s God in particular would be nonsensical. He is whatever he is. He is God and will not be anything in the future what he is not already now. He is God and as such, God over all. On the other hand, “to be a God unto thee,” the promise regarding Abraham personally according to the adopted translation, is closer to the Hebrew original, but hardly very meaningful. What does it mean to be a God to someone? We believe that there is no one who has the slightest intelligible notion of it. It is not surprising that in this passage, as well as in all other passages in the entire Bible, the idiomatic quality of the Hebrew, lih’yot l’Elohim, was consistently overlooked. As long as the specific meaning of the term, Elohim, in this, and similar, context was not understood, the Hebrew idiom could not be appreciated. Nowhere does the phrase occur in the Bible: to be your God, or, to be their God. “Lih’yot l” does not mean: to be for, but, to become. Of course, to become God for you, would not do at all. What God promised Abraham was: I, God, will become Elohim for you and for your children. It makes excellent sense, if one realizes that the term Elohim indicates the providential attitude of God toward man, the manifestation of divine guidance and protection. “I shall become Elohim for you and for your children” does not mean that God will be his and his children’s God, which is meaningless, but that God will enter into a providential relationship with them and will be Elohim, Leader, Protector, Savior, unto them. There is no passage in the Bible, where the term occurs, where it has not exactly this meaning. In the case of Abraham, to be Elohim for him and for his children is connected with the eternal covenant and the promise of the land. As in the case of Abraham, so at later times too the covenant between God and Israel is the manifestation that God becomes Elohim for Israel. We find it in Deuteronomy and in Jeremiah. (Deut. 29:11–12; Jer. 31:32; 32:38.)  Often it is the Exodus which is mentioned to illustrate the point that God desires to be Elohim for the children of Israel. For instance: “For I am Y that brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to become Elohim for you. (Lev. 11:45; cf. also, ibid. 22:33; 25:38; 26:45; Num. 16:41.) "
29,12,Jewish Thought,"Man and God, Chapter 1 the Knowledge of God 232","By saving them from their Exile and by cleansing them from their sins will God become Elohim for them and they will become a people unto him because they will no longer defile themselves with their transgressions. (Cf. also Lev. 26:12 where that Israel will become a people unto God is introduced with the words: “If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them.” Quite clearly in Deut. 29:12 the entering into covenant with God and into his oath, by means of which God establishes Israel as a people unto himself and becomes Elohim for them, implies that Israel walk in the way of God. Even more explicitly, ibid. 26:17–18.)  Not only will God cause them to dwell in their land, says Ezekiel, but he will also “sprinkle them with clean water” so that they be clean. He will also give them a “new heart” and a “new spirit”; he will put his own spirit in them and cause them to walk in his statutes and keep his commandments and do them. Thus, reconciliation will be established between God and Israel and the relationship of the covenant fulfilled, realized. Israel will become God’s people and God will turn to Israel and become Elohim for them. (Ezek. 11:20; 36:28.) "
29,12,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 28:9:1,"THE ETERNAL WILL ESTABLISH THEE FOR A HOLY PEOPLE UNTO HIMSELF AS HE HATH SWORN UNTO THEE. He applies the term “oath” to the covenant which He made with them at Mount Sinai concerning all these things, for there it was said, And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. (Exodus 19:6.)  Or it may be that the covenant He made with Abraham to be a G-d unto thee and to thy seed after thee (Genesis 17:7.)  includes this one. (In other words, G-d’s pledge to Abraham that He would be a G-d to his seed after him includes what is stated here, The Eternal will establish thee for a holy people unto Himself, as He hath sworn unto thee.)  Similarly he said, that He may establish thee this day unto Himself for a people, and that He may be unto thee a G-d, as He spoke unto thee, and as He swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, (Further, 29:12.)  for the covenant was made for all of them."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

29,12,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 29:12,"God is enacting this covenant with you in order to establish you today for Him as a people, and He will be your God. There are two parties to the covenant, which entails an exclusive, mutual relationship between the children of Israel and God, as He spoke to you, and as He took an oath to your forefathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. God’s oath to the patriarchs continues with His oath to their descendants."
29,12,Quoting Commentary,"Judaism's Life Changing Ideas; A Weekly Reading of the Jewish Bible, Nitzavim; The World Is Waiting for You 18","All of you are standing today before the Lord your God – your leaders, your tribes, your elders and officials, all the men of Israel, your children, your wives, the strangers in your camp, from woodcutter to water-drawer – to enter into the covenant of the Lord your God and its oath, which the Lord your God is making with you today, to establish you today as His people, that He may be your God, as He promised you and swore to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. (Deut. 29:9–12)"
29,12,Chasidut,"Sefat Emet, Deuteronomy, Vayeilech 1:3","The Chidushei Harim explained the pasuk (Devarim 31:28), “...and I will make the heavens and earth bear witness against them.” This is because Bnei Yisrael clarify and rejoice in the inner essence of creation, testifying that everything is the power of Hashem. This concept aligns with Shabbos, called a testimony. When one says “Vayechulu” on Friday night, he becomes a partner in creation, affirming that everything is Hashem. The truth is that as one realizes this, nothing remains hidden. The souls of Bnei Yisrael are above nature, and hence nature cannot truly conceal this fact. This is the meaning of (Devarim 29:9), “You are standing here today before Hashem your G-d,” indicating that Bnei Yisrael, as the source of life force, stand directly before Hashem. They are the first step through which everything descends. Rashi (Devarim 29:12) explains that Hashem told the parsha of Nitzavim after the curses to console Bnei Yisrael, whose faces had turned pale. Hashem reassured them, saying that just as the day turns from dark to light, so too will He bring light to them. This aligns with the idea that Bnei Yisrael, being the initial conduit for divine light, have the power to transform everything. The Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 8:1) states, “everything is created in its time,” meaning the beginning of the spreading of life force from Hashem into the realm of time. The Zohar elaborates on this (Zohar 3:58a) with the phrase “And he shall not enter at any time,” referring to the sanctity of timing in divine service. This concept is mirrored in the act of standing in prayer, as in “Atem nitzavim” (Devarim 29:9). When one acknowledges and humbles himself before Hashem, he aligns himself with Klal Yisrael, who are always standing before Hashem, nullifying himself to divine will."

29,13,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:13:1,"ולא אתכם לבדכם…כי את אשר ישנו פה ואת אשר איננו פה, ""Not only with you alone, but both with those who are present here today as well as with those who are not here today."" Why did Moses have to spell out ""and not with you alone?"" Would it not have sufficed to write ""the ones who are here today, as well as the ones who are not, etc.?"" This would have made it clear that the covenant was not made exclusively with the people present at that time! However, the whole intention of these verses is to obligate the people present at this time to commit their offspring to observe the Torah, forever. In order to make this plain the Torah had to write: ""not with you alone, etc."" Had the Torah written only the second half of the verse I would have known that future generations are obligated to observe the Torah; I would not have known, however, that those present were charged with seeing to it that their offspring kept the Torah. By writing the words: ולא אתכם לבדכם, the Torah makes it unmistakably clear that not only the obligation to keep the Torah applied to the generation present, but even the obligation to see to it that their children would also do so."
29,13,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Exodus 13:16:1,"ULTOTAPHOTH’ BETWEEN THINE EYES. No affinity is known to this word. Linguists, (Menachem ben Saruk, quoted in Rashi. See also Ibn Ezra.)  however, associated it with the expressions: ‘v’hateiph’ (And speak) to the south; (Ezekiel 21:2.)  And my word ‘titoph’ (dropped) upon them. (Job 29:22. Ramban evidently understands it: “and to them I spoke my word,” meaning “they followed my advice without question.”)  The figurative usage thereof is based on the verse: And the mountains shall drop (‘v’hitiphu’) sweet wine. (Amos 9:13. The figurative sense of the verse is that the mountains “will speak” of sweet wine.)  Thus the verse is saying that you should make the exodus from Egypt a sign upon your hand, and between your eyes a source for discourse distilling as the dew upon those that hear it. (See Deuteronomy 32:2.)  Our Rabbis, however, have called an object which lies upon the head totaphoth, just as they have said: “[A woman] may not go out [on the Sabbath] with a totepheth or head-bangles.” (Shabbath 57a.)  Rabbi Abahu said: “What is totepheth? It is a forehead-band extending from ear to ear.” (Ibid., 57b.)  Now it is the Rabbis [of the Talmud] who are the [true Hebrew] linguists, as they spoke the language and knew it and it is from them that we should accept [the explanation of the word ultotaphoth]. Now Scripture says totaphoth [in the plural] and not totepheth [in the singular] because there are many compartments in the phylacteries, (The phylactery of the head is divided into four vertical compartments, each compartment containing a scroll of one of the four Scriptural passages referring to this commandment. The phylactery of the arm contains one interior chamber which contains but one single scroll upon which all four sections of the Law are inscribed together. For fuller discussion of the subject, see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 18-19.)  just as we have received their form from the holy fathers (A reference to the Sages of the Talmud, who received the true Tradition of the Torah.)  who saw the prophets and the ancient ones up to Moses our teacher doing so. Now the fundamental reason of this commandment is that we lay the script of the exodus from Egypt upon the hand and upon the head opposite the heart and the brain, which are the pivots of thought. Thus we are to inscribe [on parchment] the Scriptural sections of Kadesh (Sanctify unto Me) [Verses 1-10], and V’haya ki y’viacha (And it shall be when the Eternal shall bring thee) [Verses 11-16], and enclose them in the phylacteries because of this commandment wherein we were charged to make the exodus from Egypt for frontlets between our eyes. [We are also to inscribe and enclose in the phylacteries the sections of] Sh’ma (Hear O Israel) [Deuteronomy 6:4-9] and V’haya im shamo’a (And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken) [ibid., 11:13-21] because we are charged to have the commandments [of the Torah] also for frontlets between our eyes, as it is written: And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart; (Deuteronomy 6:6.)  and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. (Ibid., Verse 8.)  This is why we also inscribe [on parchment] these two sections — [Sh’ma and V’haya im shamo’a] — for frontlets [even though the exodus is not mentioned in them], for they contain the commandments of the Unity of G-d, the memorial of all commandments, the doctrine of retribution, which states that the consequence of disobeying the commandments is punishment and that blessings come in the wake of obedience — and the whole foundation of the faith. (“The whole foundation of the faith.” This may refer to the principle of the Unity of G-d which is indeed the root of faith, as Ramban describes it in Deuteronomy 6:4. However, in view of the fact that this principle has already been explicitly mentioned here by Ramban, the reference must be to some other doctrine. It is reasonable to assume that Ramban is here alluding to a point he has explained in many places — “a true principle, clearly indicated in the Torah… that in the entire scope of the Torah there are only miracles, and no nature or custom.” (See Vol. I, pp. 556-7; see also his commentary above, 6:2, and on Leviticus 26:11.) The theme appears also in his introduction to the Commentary on the Book of Job (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, pp. 17-19). In his “Sermon on the Perfection of the Torah,” (Ibid., p. 153) as well as at the end of this Seder, he states clearly that “a person has no part in the Torah of Moses our teacher” unless he believes in this principle. It is thus logical to assume that “the whole foundation of the faith” mentioned here is a reference to the above principle.)  Now of the phylactery of the arm, Scripture says, And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, (Above, Verse 9.)  which the Rabbis explained (Menachoth 36b.)  as referring to the left arm, which is opposite the heart. By way of the Truth, [the mystic lore of the Cabala], the verse, It is because of ‘zeh’ (this) which the Eternal did for me, (Above, Verse 8.)  is similar to ‘zeh’ (this) is my G-d, and I will glorify Him. (Further, 15:2.)  The verse here thus states that it was because of His name and His glory that He did for us and brought us forth out of Egypt. And “this” shall be for a sign unto thee on the arm of your strength, (See Psalms 89:11.)  just as it is written, For Thou art the glory of their strength. (Ibid., Verse 18.)  Thus the sign [of the phylactery] is similar to the sign of circumcision (Genesis 17:11.)  and the Sabbath. (Further, 31:13.)  And since all [emanations] are one perfect unity, which is alluded to in “the sign” on the arm, our ancestors have received the tradition from Moses, who received it from the mouth of the Almighty, that [all four sections of Scripture inscribed in the phylacteries, as described above], are encased in one compartment. This is something like Scripture says, achothi kalah, (Song of Songs 5:1. Literally, “my sister, the bride,” but here interpreted on the basis of the Hebrew roots which suggest “unity” (achothi, my sister — echad, one) and “totality” (kalah, bride — kol, all), as explained in the text. See also Vol. I, p. 292, where Ramban refers to this theme.)  because it is united and comprised of the thirty-two paths of wisdom (Sefer Yetzirah 1:1)  [with which the world was created], and it is further written, His left hand is under my head. (Song of Songs 2:6.)  Then Scripture says, And it shall be for a memorial between thine eyes, (Above, Verse 9.)  meaning that we are to lay them at the place of remembrance, which is between the eyes, at the beginning of the brain. It is there that remembrance begins by recalling the appearances [of persons and events] after they have passed away from us. These frontlets circle around the whole head with their straps, while the loop rests directly over the base of the brain which guards the memory. And the expression, between your eyes, means that they are to be placed upon the middle of the head, not towards one side. It may be that in the middle of the head, there are the roots of the eyes and from these stems the power of sight. Similarly, the verse, Nor make ye any baldness between your eyes for the dead, (Deuteronomy 14:1. See Rashi, ibid., that the expression between the eyes means on the head adjoining the forehead. See also Rashi to Leviticus 21:5.)  [means baldness adjoining the forehead. Thus the expression between your eyes mentioned here in the case of the frontlets also refers to the identical place]. It is to explain this point, [i.e., that the phylactery of the head is not to be placed between the eyes, as the literal meaning of the words might indicate, but that it is to be placed upon the middle of the head adjoining the forehead], that He reverts here [in Verse 16 and instead of using the expression, and for ‘a memorial’ between your eyes, as stated in Verse 9], and says ‘ultotaphoth’ between your eyes. This is in order to explain that the commandment is not fulfilled by placing the phylactery between the eyes bottomward, but rather it is to be placed high on the head where it is to be there like totaphoth, [and we have seen above that the word totepheth was used by the Rabbis for an object which lies upon the head]. He uses the plural form [totaphoth, and not the singular totepheth], because the compartments in the phylactery of the head are many, as we have received the form by Tradition. And now I shall declare to you a general principle in the reason of many commandments. Beginning with the days of Enosh (Genesis 4:26. See also Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Hilchoth Akum, 1:1, where he traces the process of intellectual degeneration by which mankind fell into gross idolatry. Ramban primarily follows here the process of deterioration as affecting the three basic principles of faith: the existence of the Creator, His providence over the world, and the truth of prophecy. The chief purpose of the commandments of the Torah is to guard Israel against deviating from these principles.)  when idol-worship came into existence, opinions in the matter of faith fell into error. Some people denied the root of faith by saying that the world is eternal; they denied the Eternal, and said: It is not He (Jeremiah 5:12.)  [Who called forth the world into existence]. Others denied His knowledge of individual matters, and they say, How doth G-d know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? (Psalms 73:11.)  Some admit His knowledge but deny the principle of providence and make men as the fishes of the sea, (Habakkuk 1:14.)  [believing] that G-d does not watch over them and that there is no punishment or reward for their deeds, for they say the Eternal hath forsaken the land. (Ezekiel 8:12.)  Now when G-d is pleased to bring about a change in the customary and natural order of the world for the sake of a people or an individual, then the voidance of all these [false beliefs] becomes clear to all people, since a wondrous miracle shows that the world has a G-d Who created it, and Who knows and supervises it, and Who has the power to change it. And when that wonder is previously prophesied by a prophet, another principle is further established, namely, that of the truth of prophecy, that G-d doth speak with man, (Deuteronomy 5:28.)  and that He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets, (Amos 3:7.)  and thereby the whole Torah is confirmed. This is why Scripture says in connection with the wonders [in Egypt]: That thou [Pharaoh] mayest know that I am the Eternal in the midst of the earth, (Above, 8:18.)  which teaches us the principle of providence, i.e., that G-d has not abandoned the world to chance, as they [the heretics] would have it; That thou mayest know that the earth is the Eternal’s, (Ibid., 9:29.)  which informs us of the principle of creation, for everything is His since He created all out of nothing; That thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth, (Ibid., Verse 14.)  which indicates His might, i.e., that He rules over everything and that there is nothing to withhold Him. The Egyptians either denied or doubted all of these [three] principles, [and the miracles confirmed their truth]. Accordingly, it follows that the great signs and wonders constitute faithful witnesses (Isaiah 8:2.)  to the truth of the belief in the existence of the Creator and the truth of the whole Torah. And because the Holy One, blessed be He, will not make signs and wonders in every generation for the eyes of some wicked man or heretic, He therefore commanded us that we should always make a memorial or sign of that which we have seen with our eyes, and that we should transmit the matter to our children, and their children to their children, to the generations to come, and He placed great emphasis on it, as is indicated by the fact that one is liable to extinction for eating leavened bread on the Passover, and for abandoning the Passover-offering, [i.e., for not taking part in the slaughtering thereof]. (Numbers 9:13.)  He has further required of us that we inscribe upon our arms and between our eyes all that we have seen in the way of signs and wonders, and to inscribe it yet upon the doorposts of the houses, and that we remember it by recital in the morning and evening — just as the Rabbis have said: “The recital of the benediction True and firm, [which follows the Sh’ma in the morning and which terminates with a blessing to G-d for the redemption from Egypt], is obligatory as a matter of Scriptural law because it is written, That thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. (Deuteronomy 16:3.)  [He further required] that we make a booth every year (Leviticus 23:42.)  and many other commandments like them which are a memorial to the exodus from Egypt. All these commandments are designed for the purpose that in all generations we should have testimonies to the wonders so that they should not be forgotten and so that the heretic should not be able to open his lips to deny the belief in [the existence of] G-d. He who buys a Mezuzah (Literally: “door-post.” It is a scroll of parchment on which are written the two Scriptural portions, Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and 11:13-21, and which is fastened to the right-hand door-post.)  for one zuz [a silver coin] and affixes it to his doorpost and has the proper intent of heart on its content, has already admitted the creation of the world, the Creator’s knowledge and His providence, and also his belief in prophecy as well as in all fundamental principles of the Torah, besides admitting that the mercy of the Creator is very great upon them that do His will, since He brought us forth from that bondage to freedom and to great honor on account of the merit of our fathers who delighted in the fear of His Name. (See Nehemiah 1:11.)  It is for this reason that the Rabbis have said: (Aboth 2:1.)  “Be as heedful of a light commandment (Here understood in the sense of a commandment, the fulfillment of which does not entail a great expense, just like a Mezuzah that can be bought for one zuz and affixed to the door-post.)  as of a weighty one,” for they are all exceedingly precious and beloved, for through them a person always expresses thankfulness to his G-d. And the purpose of all the commandments is that we believe in our G-d and be thankful to Him for having created us, for we know of no other reason for the first creation, (“The first creation.” In his “Sermon on the Perfection of the Torah,” where Ramban discusses the same topic (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 152), the text reads: “for we know of no other reason for ‘the creation of man.’” See, however, my Hebrew commentary, in the fifth edition, p. 557, where I suggest that the term “the first creation” may be a reference to the period from Adam to Abraham.)  and G-d the Most High has no demand on the lower creatures, excepting that man should know and be thankful to G-d for having created him. The purposes of raising our voices in prayer and of the service in synagogues, as well as the merit of public prayer, is precisely this: that people should have a place wherein they assemble and express their thankfulness to G-d for having created them and supported them, and thus proclaim and say before Him, “We are your creatures.” This is the intent of what the Rabbis of blessed memory have said: (Yalkut Shimoni, Jonah 550. See also Yerushalmi Taanith, II, 1.)  “And they cried mightily unto G-d. (Jonah 3:8.)  From here you learn that prayer must be accompanied by sound. The undaunted one wins over the abashed one.” Through the great open miracles, one comes to admit the hidden miracles which constitute the foundation of the whole Torah, for no one can have a part in the Torah of Moses our teacher unless he believes that all our words and our events, [as dictated in the Torah], are miraculous in scope, there being no natural or customary way of the world in them, whether affecting the public or the individual. Instead, if a person observes the commandments, His reward will bring him success, and if he violates them, His punishment will cause his extinction. It is all by decree of the Most High, as I have already mentioned. (See Vol. I, pp. 215-216 and 556-558.)  The hidden miracles done to the public come to be known as is mentioned in the assurances of the Torah on the subject of the blessings and imprecations, (Leviticus 26:3-46; Deuteronomy 28:1-68.)  as the verse says: And all the nations shall say: Wherefore hath the Eternal done thus unto this land? … Then men shall say: Because they forsook the covenant of the Eternal, the G-d of their fathers. (Deuteronomy 29:23-4.)  Thus it will become known to all nations that their punishment came from G-d. And of the fulfillment of the commandments it says, And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Eternal is called upon thee. (Ibid., 28:10.)  I will yet explain this, with the help of G-d. (Leviticus 26:11.)  Beshalach"
29,13,Jewish Thought,Netzach Yisrael 11:18,"It has become clear to you that that which God, may He be blessed, took the Jewish people for Himself is not because of the righteousness of the Jewish people or their deeds. Rather it was a more encompassing choice. And this thing is explained in several places, and the faithful sages [also] came [to discuss] it in several places. Hence it is not fit to say that with the removal of the cause – which is the righteousness of the Jewish people – the result would also be removed, meaning His taking them as a people for Himself. And even though their deeds, good or bad, caused there to be more or less attachment [to God], as this is certainly according to the majority of [their] deeds, such that there would be more or less [of it] – nevertheless, [God's] actual choice was not because of any deed at all.  "
29,13,Talmud,Nedarim 25a:7,"The Gemara asks: And still, does a person not commonly take an oath according to his own understanding? But isn’t it taught in a baraita: And so we found with regard to Moses our teacher. When he administered an oath to the Jewish people in the plains of Moab, that they accept the Torah upon themselves, he said to them: Know that I do not administer an oath upon you according to your understanding and the stipulations in your hearts but according to my understanding and the understanding of the Omnipresent, as it is stated: “Neither with you only do I make this covenant” (Deuteronomy 29:13)."
29,13,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nitzavim 8:1","(Deut. 29:12 [13]:) IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH YOU TODAY AS HIS PEOPLE…, i.e., so that I would not go back on the word that I swore to their ancestors. Deut. 29:13 [14]): AND NOT ONLY WITH YOU , but the generations that have yet to come were also there, as stated (in vs. 14 [15]): BUT WITH THOSE WHO ARE  HERE WITH US  … AND WITH THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE WITH US TODAY. Now why does it say: THOSE WHO ARE  HERE? And why does it say: THOSE WHO ARE NOT HERE (without using the word STANDING)? Because all the souls were there,  when  bodies had still not been created. It is for that reason  existence (literally: standing, rt.: 'MD) is not stated here. R. Eleazar said: A curse will come upon Laban, because he said to Jacob (in Gen. 31:30): WHY DID YOU STEAL MY GODS? It (i.e., such an idol) could not save itself [from theft]. How could it save others? (Cf. Mark 15:31 = Matthew 27:42 // Luke 23:35.)  But Israel is not like that, as stated (in Deut. 10:21): HE IS YOUR PRAISE, AND HE IS YOUR GOD, . He also watches over Israel like a father who watches over his son, as stated (in Ps. 121:4): BEHOLD THE ONE KEEPING ISRAEL SHALL NEITHER SLUMBER NOR SLEEP."
29,13,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:13:1","ולא אתכם לבדכם, “And not only with you, etc.” Moses means that although G’d concludes this covenant with the present generation of Jews as well as the oath warning against non-performance, seeing that you are standing here this day, the fact is that even future generations of Jews unable to stand here today are included in this covenant. The reason that Moses is able to make such a statement is that the trunk of the tree is viewed as the father, i.e. “the root ” of all subsequent branches. All the branches are only the offshoots of the original roots. Concerning how it s possible to include unborn generations in this covenant, i.e. reciprocal undertaking, our sages in Tanchuma Yitro 11 comment that all souls ever created since the days of the creation of the earth were present at this assembly. They are not all described as “standing,” as souls without bodies cannot “stand.” The words אשר איננו פה, “who are not here,” refer to the bodies of such souls. The words עמנו היום, refer to their souls, which are present even today. The word עמנו, “with us,” refers back to the word עומד, “standing,” in verse 14. It is as if the Torah had written: “and all those not standing here with us this day.” The reason Moses uses the word “standing,” is because the angels in Zecharyah 3,7 have been described as בין העומדים האלה, “among these who are standing.” Our sages in Tanchuma Yitro 11 also claim that all the prophets who ever lived (after Moses) all received their prophetic powers when their souls were at the assembly at Sinai; however they were not allowed to make use of their prophetic powers until their respective generations when they were alive on earth. This is also the meaning of Malachi 1,1 משא דבר ה’ ביד מלאכי. It is significant that the wording is not על מלאכי, but ביד מלאכי. The present formulation means: ”A pronouncement: ‘the word of the Lord to Israel through Malachi,’” whereas the other formulation would have meant that the “message only now came to Malachi.” The present formulation describes only the point in time when this message, which the soul of the prophet had received at Mount Sinai, was released for publication. We find something similar in Isaiah 48,16 where the prophet writes: “from the beginning I did not speak in secret; from the time anything existed I was there. And now, the Lord G’d has sent me, endowed me with His spirit.” The meaning of the verse is that the soul of the prophet had received this communication from G’d already at Mount Sinai but it had only now been released for publication."
29,13,Talmud,Shevuot 39a:8,"This is as we have found written with regard to Moses, our teacher. When he administered an oath to the Jewish people in the plains of Moab so that they would accept the Torah upon themselves, he said to them: Know that it is not according to your understanding that I administer an oath to you, but according to the understanding of the Omnipresent and according to my understanding. As it is stated: “Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath” (Deuteronomy 29:13), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: Not only according to your intention."
29,13,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Nitzavim 3:1","(Deut. 29:11:) “To enter into the covenant with the Lord your God....” Three covenants did the Holy One, blessed be He, make with Israel when they came out of Egypt, one when they stood before Mount Sinai, (one at Horeb,) and one here. But why did he make [a covenant] with them here? Because they had revoked the one which He had made with them at Sinai, when they said (of the golden calf in Exod. 32:4), “This is your god, O Israel.” For that reason He made [another covenant] with them at Horeb (The text should probably read: “With them here,” in accord with Codex Vaticanus Ebr. 34.)  and established a curse over it for whoever would go back on his words. Now the word, enter (rt.: 'br), [can] only be in the sense of one who says to his companion, “May this curse come (rt.: 'br) upon you, if you go back on me in this thing.” And so you find that, when Israel provoked [the Holy One, blessed be He], and they went into captivity, what did Daniel say (in Dan. 9:11)? “And all Israel has transgressed (rt.: 'br) Your Torah [...] so the curse (alah) and the oath are poured down upon us.” Now alah can only be a curse, (Alah can also mean “oath” and “covenant.”)  as where it is stated (in Numb. 5:27), “and the woman shall become a curse (alah).” [This is] to teach you that just as one imposes an oath on the suspect adulteress, so the Holy One, blessed be He, imposed an oath upon Israel. But perhaps you will say, “Why all this bother?” It is not because I need you? Rather what shall I do to you, when I have already sworn to your ancestors, that I will never replace you and your children? It is therefore stated (in Deut. 29:12), “In order to establish you today as his people […] as he swore to your ancestors.” It [also] says (in Cant. 7:6), “a king is bound by his tresses.” Now bound [indicates] nothing except an oath. Thus it is stated (in Numb. 30:4), “[When a woman vows a vow to the Lord] and binds herself with a bond.” Therefore, He cannot break his oath. And so you find, when they sought to get rid of the yoke of His oath in the days of Ezekiel, it is written (in Ezek: 20:1), “some elders of Israel came to consult the Lord.” They said to him, “When the son of a priest buys a slave, is it legal for him to eat the terumah?” (The priestly tithe on produce.)  He said to them, “He may eat it.” They said to him, “If a priest returned and sold him to an [ordinary] Israelite, has he not left his jurisdiction?” He told them, “Yes.” They said to him, “We too have left the jurisdiction of [the Holy One, blessed be He]; are we not [now] like the all the [rest of the] world?” Ezekiel said to them (in Ezek. 20:32-33), “But that which you have in mind shall never come to pass, that should you say: let us become like the gentiles…. ‘As I live,’ says the Lord God, ‘surely I will [reign] over you with a powerful hand....’” He said to them, “As long as one has not sold [a slave], he is in his jurisdiction; and you have not been sold for a price.” It is so stated (in Is. 52:3), “For thus says the Lord, ‘You were sold for free, [and you shall be redeemed for no money].’” (Deut. 29:12:) “In order to establish you today as his people…,” so that I would not go back on the word that I swore to your ancestors. Deut. 29:13), “And not only with you [have I made this covenant and this oath].” But rather the generations that have yet to come were also there at that time, as stated (in vs. 14), “But with those who are [standing ('md)] here with us [today… and with those who are not here with us today].” R. Abahu said in the name of R. Samuel bar Nahmani, “Why does it say, ‘those who are [standing ('md)] here [...]; and those who are not here’ (without using the word, standing)? Because all the souls were there, [even] when [their] bodies had still not been created. It is for that reason [their] existence (literally, standing, rt.: 'md) is not stated here.” R. Eliezer said, “A curse will come upon Laban, because he said to Jacob (in Gen. 31:30), ‘Why did you steal my gods?’ It (i.e., such an idol) could not save itself from theft. [So] how could it save others? But Israel is not like that, as they serve the Holy One, blessed be He, about whom it is stated (in Deut. 10:21), “He is your praise, and He is your God, [who has done these great and awful things for you that your own eyes have seen].” He [also] watches over Israel like a father who watches over his son, as stated (in Ps. 121:4), “Behold the One keeping Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.”"
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

That is what Moses meant when he said, near the beginning of this parasha: “It is not with you alone that I am making this covenant and oath, but with whoever stands with us here today before the Lord our God as well as those not with us here today” (Deut. 29:13–14). In Moses’ day that last phrase meant “your children not yet born.” He did not need to include “your parents, no longer alive” because their parents had themselves made a covenant with God forty years before at Mount Sinai. But what Moses meant in a larger sense was that when we renew the covenant, when we dedicate our lives to the faith and way of life of our ancestors, they become immortal in us, as we become immortal in our children."
29,13,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Nitzavim 5","“Not with you alone” [29:13]. The oath that Israel took was to keep the Torah and it was also for all future generations and not only for those who were present at that time. Our sages say that all the souls that were created since the creation of the world. They were all present at that oath. Therefore, each person should know and remember that he swore to keep the Torah. He should be warned to keep his oath. However, perhaps there are those who do not believe in the oath. They are, because of our sins, transgressing and say, I am not afraid of the curses. He says, I will go after my heart’s desire. There are many righteous people in the world. They will protect me. I am an individual who commit sins, and I will follow my heart’s desire until I have had a taste and then I will stop. However, he does not know anymore that he will only have his bite. He will have more desire to commit sins and he never has enough. He thinks he will make his evil inclination satiated. First, he makes the evil inclination very hungry by having thoughts of committing sins. Afterwards, God punishes him for these evil thoughts, since much depends on the heart’s thoughts. When the person is happy in his heart to fulfill a commandment, then his reward is great. Similarly, when he is happy to commit sins, then his evil payment is very great. There are some people who are sad in their heart when they have committed a sin, and they say, why have we sinned? His heart is stopped up and his sin is not so great because his heart is stopped up and also because his heart has regrets. However, there are also many people whose heart burns for the sin. They would gladly commit the sin again. This has a double evil payment, to pay him with pain and suffering. Concerning this, our sages said, “thoughts of a sin are worse than the sin itself.” This means that the sin that the person thought about for a long time and then does it, this sin is very evil because he first had impure thoughts to do evil. Maimonides writes. When the person contaminates his thoughts so that his heart has thoughts to commit sins, his soul becomes impure. This is a great sin that he thinks about the sin. He wants to do it again and he does it. The Holy One judges him with evil punishments. However, before he does the act, the Holy One does not judge him for the evil thoughts, since the Holy One does not judge Israel for evil thoughts alone, when he has not yet committed the sin. However, the person should not accustom himself to have evil thoughts, since in the end he will have to do this. The Holy One leads the person in accordance with the evil thoughts for which the person has desires. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:18.) "

Furthermore, because we will ask them about the first issue, do you want to say the beginning of the creation of the soul, if the Creator commanded it to work from the works, if not? And if they say it was not a commandment, the punishments are all nullified, because there was no starting commandment. And if they accept the mitzvah, the soul at that time neither received nor died, and they already admitted that the person will command the future not only the passing, and they will return to our articles in return and leave their agreement, that there is no suffering except for what has passed, and the fourth that they are hung with doubts from the Bible, I saw to remember a few of them and say that they are my words Moshe (Deuteronomy 29:14) For what we slept here with us stands today. And they said this indicates that the spirits of the last are the spirits of the first and therefore they are the ones that are and they are the ones that are not. And the verse simply cancels out what they thought, because it says that what is found is apart from what is not found, and its meaning is that it is obligatory for those to whom the words of Moses come, to accept them as accepted by those who are with him. And of them (Psalms 1:1) blessed is the man who did not follow the counsel of the wicked, and they said that because he said he would not go and did not say he would not go, we learned that the punishment for something his soul did was in the first person. And this is the purpose of the error, because the scriptures do not oblige Ashari to be remembered except after he did not go, and they did not oblige him before he did not go. And we see from the scriptures an answer for them, and these were as they said, the reward was for the future victories, not for the passing ones, because they said after him and in his teachings, he would come, and he did not say he came, when they charged the punishment for the past seasons and not for the coming ones, his article did not go and did not say that he will not go. And of them they said (Job 38:14) It shall be turned like sealing clay and they shall stand like a garment, and they believed that they said it shall be turned upon the soul, and they said that this is a teaching that it is always turning in man and beast, and the fools did not understand that he did not say that it was on the earth, because he preceded him to take hold of the wings The earth, and on it he said that it is turned over by the wicked like sealing clay, and they burn it as if it were their clothing, they will not be able to copy from it until God's decree is fulfilled in them. And what are the words of the prophet (Psalms 23:3) My soul will be mischievous. And they thought it was a return from body to body, and the fools did not understand that it is rest and calmness and the silence is from sorrow that was in him, and there is no return after departure, and this is clearly explained in the language of our ancestors, what they said about Samson when he was thirsty And the Creator watered him with water, and his spirit returned and he lived (Judges 15:19) and it no longer went out. And they said about the Egyptian when he was hungry and they fed David, and his spirit returned (1 Samuel 3:12). And they said of the messenger, he is faithful, a messenger is faithful to his senders, and the soul of his master will return (Proverbs 25:13). And they said wisely, the Torah 10 Tamim' restores a soul (Psalms 19:8). And I bear the words of their lightness, and their arrogance reduces them, if I had not feared the sheaah. And at the end of their words they say, ""From four spirits in the island of the wind, and I cast away those who are outcasts, and they will live"" (Ezekiel 37 ninth'). And says, isn't there something foreign about it? Because he did not say this, but because the winds are quiet above and below, and in this island there is a place where it will come from both sides and from the four winds, which the Creator calls to it, as the disciple said (Job 13:22) and he called and I will answer: "
29,14,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 29:14:1","ואת אשר איננו פה עמנו היום, “as well as those who are not here with us this day.” All these as yet unborn generations of the Jews participating in this assembly are included in this oath/covenant to be undertaken at this time.

29,14,Midrash,Shemot Rabbah 28:6,"Another matter: “God spoke all these matters, saying” – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What the prophets are destined to prophesy in each and every generation, they received at Mount Sinai, as Moses says to Israel: “Rather, with him who is here with us standing today [before the Lord our God], and with him who is not here with us today” (Deuteronomy 29:14). It is not written here, “standing with us today,” but rather, “with us today.” These are the souls [of people] who are destined to be created, which lack substance, in whose regard standing is not stated. Even though they were not there at that moment, each and every one received his due.  Likewise it says: “The prophecy of the word of the Lord to Israel through Malachi” (Malachi 1:1). It is not stated, “in the days of Malachi,” but rather, “through Malachi,” as the prophecy was with him since Mount Sinai, but he had not been given permission to prophesy until that time. Likewise, Isaiah said: “From the time that it was, I was there” (Isaiah 48:16). Isaiah said: From the day that the Torah was given at Sinai, I was there and I received this prophecy; however, “now the Lord God has sent me with His spirit” (Isaiah 48:16). Until then, permission had not been given to him to prophesy.  Not only did all the prophets receive their prophecy from Sinai, but all the Sages who arise in each and every generation, each and every one received their [wisdom] from Sinai. Likewise it says: “These words the Lord spoke to your entire assembly (Deuteronomy 5:19).  “A great voice that did not cease” (Deuteronomy 5:19) – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One voice that was divided into seven voices, and they were divided into seventy languages. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: From it, all the prophets who prophesied stood. The Rabbis say: It had no echo. (The term yasaf in the phrase “that did not cease [yasaf]” can be understood as related to the word continue [hosif] such that the verse would mean “that did not continue.” It would seem that the Rabbis interpret the verse in this manner (Maharzu). However, some commentaries dispute this assertion (see, e.g., Etz Yosef). )   Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan said: What is: “The voice of the Lord is with might” (Psalms 29:4)? Is it possible to say so? Is it not so, that even an angel, there is no creature that can withstand its voice, as it is stated: “His body was like beryl…and the sound of his speech, like the noise of a multitude” (Daniel 10:6)? The Holy One blessed be He in whose regard it is written: “Do I not fill the heavens and the earth” (Jeremiah 23:24), does He need to speak mightily? Rather, “the voice of the Lord is with might [bakoaḥ],” with the might appropriate for each of the voices. In the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, this verse supports him, as it is stated: “My Lord gives the word, and the heralds are great armies” (Psalms 68:12). (The implication is that God’s voice is split into many voices, referred to as members of the great armies. ) "
29,14,Talmud,Shabbat 146a:1,"the snake came upon Eve, i.e., when it seduced her to eat from the Tree of Knowledge, it infected her with moral contamination, and this contamination remained in all human beings. When the Jewish people stood at Mount Sinai, their contamination ceased, whereas gentiles did not stand at Mount Sinai, and their contamination never ceased. Rav Aḥa, the son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What about converts? How do you explain the cessation of their moral contamination? Rav Ashi said to him: Even though they themselves were not at Mount Sinai, their guardian angels were present, as it is written: “It is not with you alone that I make this covenant and this oath, but with he that stands here with us today before the Lord our God, and with he that is not here with us today” (Deuteronomy 29:13–14), and this includes converts."
29,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Yitro 11:1","And God spoke all these words, saying: “I am the Lord thy God” (Exod. 20:1). R. Isaac said: All the prophets received the inspirations for their future prophesies at Mount Sinai. How do we know this to be so? It is written: But with him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day (Deut. 29:14). That standeth here with us this day refers to those who were already born, and with him that is not here alludes to those who were to be born in the future. Hence they are not with us this day. “Not standing here with us this day” is not written in this verse, but rather Is not here with us this day. This alludes to the souls who were to be created in the future, since standing here could not be said of them. They were included in the general statement. And that is why the verse states: The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi (Mal. 1:1). It does not say “of Malachi,” but merely by Malachi, indicating that the prophecy had been transmitted to him previously at Sinai. Similarly Isaiah said: Come ye near unto Me, hear ye this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I; and now the Lord hath sent me, and His spirit (Isa. 48:16). Isaiah is saying here that at the time the Torah was given I received the prophecy. Hence it says: from the time that it (the Torah) was, there am I; and now the Lord God hath sent me, and His spirit, but until now He did not give me permission to prophesy."
29,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Pekudei 3:4","R. Johanan asked: Why is it written: Who doeth great things past finding; yea, marvelous things without number (Job 9:10)? You should know that every soul, from Adam to the end of the world, was formed during the six days of creation, and that all of them were present in the Garden of Eden and at the time of the giving of the Torah, as it is said: With him that standeth here with us this day, and also with him that is not here with us this day (Deut. 29:14). What is the meaning of Great things past finding out? It refers to the great deeds the Holy One, blessed be He, did in the formation of the embryo. At the time that a man is about to have intercourse with his wife, the Holy One, blessed be He, informs the angel in charge of conception, whose name is Lailah. (Lailah’s role is described in Niddah 16b and Sanhedrin 6a.)  "
29,14,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Shemot 6:8:4","מורשה, “an inheritance.” G’d refrains from saying ירושה. There is a difference between מורשה andירושה . The people addressed were not the ones who would personally receive the land as a heritage seeing that all those who were adults would never get there due to the sin of the spies. They would, however, bequeath their claim to it to their children, i.e. they would be מורישים. This is why the Torah used the word מורשה instead of ירושה. We need to interpret the word מורשה in Deut. 33,4 in a similar manner. Torah cannot be handed down as an inheritance as if it were a house, a field, or a business, i.e. some object merely to be passed on from father to son. Inasmuch as Torah is an inheritance it remains such only for that particular generation. which stood at Mount Sinai and had received it as an inheritance, i.e. something inalienable, not to be stolen from them. The next generation had to study Torah on its own in order that it should become an inheritance for them also. However, the children of someone who “owned” Torah are predisposed to acquire it for themselves. Hence Torah is forevermore a מורשה for such children. Parents have been commanded not only to study Torah but to train their children in studying Torah, ושננתם לבניך, (Deut. 6,7). it is a מורשה, something to be transmitted to successive generations down the ages. By the same token later generations of Jews are as duty-bound to observe the commandments of the Torah as were those who had actually received it at Sinai. According to our sages the souls of those generations had already stood at Mount Sinai at the time when G’d revealed Himself to Moses and to the people (Pesikta Zutrata Va'etchanan 5,3). This concept is spelled out in detail in Deut. 29,14 “including all those who are not present (in the flesh) on this day.” (the day Moses renewed the covenant with the generation who would enter the Holy Land). G’d concluded this promise with the words אני ה’, seeing He had commenced the paragraph (verse 2).   The message is : “I Who make a promise can be relied upon to translate it into reality.”"
29,14,Talmud,Shevuot 39a:9,"Having quoted a verse, the baraita tangentially interprets the subsequent verse. From the phrase: “But with he who stands here with us this day” (Deuteronomy 29:14), I have derived only that those who stood at Mount Sinai were included in this covenant. From where do I derive that the subsequent generations, and the converts who will convert in the future, were also included? The verse states: “And also with he who is not here with us this day” (Deuteronomy 29:14)."
29,14,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:14:1","Even with the generations destined for the future. You cannot explain the verse according to its straightforward connotation, that those who are not here had left, because it is written, “You stand, this day all of you. Also, you could [refute this explanation and] say: How can one contract a covenant with someone who is not present? Perhaps if he came back from where he went and was here, he would not accept the covenant! But if it refers to those who will be in the future, there is no difficulty as even if their bodies were not there, their souls were there and accepted the covenant. Another explanation is that “a son is the extension [lit., leg] of his father,” and being that the fathers accepted [the covenant], the sons who come after them are also included in the covenant. "
29,14,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Psalms 55:16:1,"May He incite Death upon them May the Holy One, blessed be He, incite the Angel of Death upon them. Heb. יַשִּׁיא, incite and entice, an expression of (Gen. 3:13): “The serpent enticed me and I ate.” Menachem (p. 101) interpreted יַשִּׁיא, as an expression of יש, there is, as (Gen. 24:49): “If you wish (ישכם) to do kindness”; (Deut. 29:14), “who is (ישנו) here.”"

They say to him, ""Know that we do not administer an oath to you based on a stipulation in your heart; rather, your oath is taken based on our understanding and on the understanding of the court"" (Ned. 25a:2, Steinsaltz tr.). And thus we find that Moses imposed an oath on the Children of Israel in the wilderness of Moab. He said to them, ""Not on a stipulation in your heart,"" as it is said (Deut. 29:14), ""And not with you alone [do I make this covenant]."""
29,14,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part II 1:2","WHY GOD GAVE ISRAEL THE TWENTY-FOUR BOOKS WHEN [GOD GAVE the Torah to the Jewish people:] “He came with some of the sacred myriads; and in His right hand was eish-das, a fire of law, for them [Israel].” (As I wrote in the beginning of Part 1, Chapter 1, this verse from Deut. 33:2 is quoted at the beginning of each of the three sections because, as explained in the Sifrei, it encompasses the nature of the Torah and its impact upon humankind, especially for those who toil in its study.)  [At that time] God desired to give the Jewish people the twenty-four sacred books. (The Twenty-four Books refer to the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiographa. Samuel I and II, Kings I and II, the trei-asar (the twelve minor prophets), Ezra and Nehemiah, and Chronicles I and II are considered to be one book each.)  Tractate Berachos 5a states: R. Levi ben Hama, stated in the name of R. Shimon ben Lakish, “What is the meaning of the verse, ‘…and I shall give you [Moses] the stone luhos, (The two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed.)  Torah (Torah means “teaching.”)  and the mitzvah (Commandment.)  that I have written to teach them?’ (Ex. 24:12.)  [The word luhos refers to the Ten Commandments]. Torah refers to Scripture. Mitzvah – this is the Mishnah, and ‘that which I have written’ refers to the Prophets and Hagiographa.’” In Shemos Rabbah, parashah 28, it is written: R. Yitzhak said, “That which the Prophets were to prophesy in the future to subsequent generations was received from Mount Sinai. For Moses said to Israel, ‘[Not with you alone do I seal this covenant…] but with whoever is here, standing with us today before the Lord our God, and with whoever is not here with us today,’ (Deut. 29:14, 15.) …[A similar idea is found in the verse], ‘The burden of the word of God to Israel by Malachi,’ [literally, “in the hand of Malachi”]. (Mal. 1:1.)  It does not say ‘in the days of Malachi,’ but ‘in the hand of Malachi,’ for his prophecy was already in his hand since Sinai, but until then he was not granted the right to prophesy. Similarly Isaiah said, ‘From the time that it was, there am I.’ (Isa. 48:16.)  Isaiah said, I was present at the Revelation on Sinai where I received this prophecy. [However], only ‘now has the Lord God (Rashi, on Deut. 3:24, translates Adonai Elohim as “merciful in judgment.” See Nahmanides for another translation.)  authorized me to prophesy (Literally, “sent me.”)  and imbued me with his Divine Spirit,’ for until now no permission was given to him to prophesy.” (Since Malachi and Isaiah were born long after the Revelation, they could not have uttered any prophecy earlier because they were not yet alive. The Midrash intimates that God only brought them into the world when permission to prophesy had already been given.) "
29,14,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Nedarim 3:1:5,"So is the Mishnah (This language is somewhat unexpected since it usually introduces an emendation of the Mishnah.) : “Any vow which I make in the future shall be void, [it is void] if he remembers at the moment he makes the vow,” if he did not stipulate a reservation (If a person stipulates expressly that his vows shall be void even if he does not remember that stipulation at the moment of the vow, the stipulation is valid and active.) . But if he stipulated a reservation, then even if he does not remember. That is for vows; but for oaths? There are reservations for vows, there are no reservations for oaths, as it was stated about oaths imposed by judges (Text from Soṭah 7:1, Note 27.) : “According to our understanding, not according to your understanding.” Rebbi Jehudah said, he makes him swear according to his understanding. Why does he stipulate with him? Because of the uneducated, lest they say that there may be mental reservations for oaths."
29,14,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 7:1:7,"“And the oath of a witness and the oath about a deposit.” One makes him swear in his own language. If one made them swear not in their language and they said “Amen”, they are not prosecutable (Nobody is prosecutable for perjury if he was not admonished in his own language by the court before answering the oath read to him. In the Babli, 33a, the rule is derived from verses. The Tosephta, 7:1, has a different version: If the court explained to him five times in any language he understands and he confirms his oath, he is guilty (if he swears falsely).) . As we have stated (The text is also in Nedarim 3:1; a parallel text in Babli Šebuot 29a, Nedarim 25a.) : The oath before the judges is according to our understanding, not according to your understanding. Rebbi Yudan said, it is to be assumed that he makes them swear according to his understanding. Why does he have to spell out this condition to him? Because of the uneducated, lest they say that there may be mental reservations for oaths. Rebbi Ḥanania stated before Rebbi Mana: Is there not written (Deut. 29:14. The argument is about what is written before and after the fragment quoted: “Not with you alone am I concluding this covenant and this oath. But with everybody who stands here with us today, and with those who are not with us today.” How can you have an oath with anybody not involved?) : “But with everybody who stands here with us today”? He said to him, the future generations do not have mental reservations (Since the unborn cannot have mental reservations, so the mental reservations of the living are invalid.) ."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."

Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."

29,14,Chasidut,"Tiferet Shlomo, on Torah, Nitzavim 2","Deuteronomy 29:9: It appears to me to say the following about this verse: it says earlier in the Torah [in the previous chapter] that ""...until this day, Hashem did not give you a heart to know, ear to hear, eye to see"" [Deuteronomy 29:3]. [This means that] the entire service of Moshe Rabbeinu was for the Jewish people to hear all mitzvot from his mouth; his intent was to imbue their hearts with the power of holiness of Hashem with his holy words. The Shechina would speak from his throat, and the goal was that the Jewish people would not be able to transgress anything in the Torah. It says in the Torah, ""just like snow comes from heaven and never returns... so, too, My words will not return empty-handed [Isaiah 55:10]. This was the level that Moshe spoke [to Hashem], and Hashem answered him [directly] with a voice and He wanted to place a holiness within him so that [listening to Moshe's words would] be equal to hearing them from Hashem. This is the meaning of the previous verse, ""Hashem did not give you a heart to know..."": The Jewish people were lifted up to a very lofty level after 4o years [of being in the desert], and it says ""...on this day, you've become a people for G-d"" [Deuteronomy 27:9]. [This means that] at the end [of the Jewish people's journey], when Moshe Rabbainu would speak, the experience was that of  Mount Sinai (--of G-d speaking--) and thus the Torah would never be removed from their mouth. This is also explains the verse: ""I heard the voice of my G-d and did according to all that was commanded me"" [Deuteronomy 26:14]. ""I heard to voice..."" means that I did what G-d commanded and I'm listening now just like I did at Mount Sinai; I did all that I'm commanded and I haven't missed anything. [Moses] successfully elevated you so that you can stand before Hashem without any separation. Moshe Rabbainu expresses this covenant with everyone, not just the generation of the desert [Deuteronomy 29:14]. In the future of the generation, the tzaddik of the generation will also be speaking. This is [literally as if] Moshe Rabbainu [is speaking to you], which, [in turn, is as if] you're hearing it from G-d. As it says in the original verse, all will stand before G-d [meaning] in every future generation through the tzaddik."

In Moses’ day that last phrase meant “your children not yet born.” He did not need to include “your parents, no longer alive” because their parents had themselves made a covenant with God forty years before at Mount Sinai.

29,15,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:15:1,"כי אתם ידעתם, ""For you know, etc."" We need to analyse why the Torah suddenly provides this rationale for what it legislates in this paragraph. Nachmanides wrote that this is the introduction to what follows ""so that there not be amongst you a root flourishing with wormwood, etc."" I consider this explanation a little forced. It is not the custom of the Torah to write the reason for its legislation before writing the legislation itself. Perhaps the verse may be understood differently. Inasmuch as what is being legislated here is something unique, i.e. obligating unborn generations to observe a code of conduct over which they have never been allowed to make a decision, as had their ancestors at Mount Sinai, this requires an unusual approach. We have a rule in Ketuvot 11 that ""one cannot hold a person responsible for committing a wrong which he had never been aware of."" According to this principle the acceptance by the parents of the obligation to keep the Torah would not be binding on the children at all. This is why the Torah adds: ""for you are aware what your life was like before you became G'd's people and received the Torah, etc."" In other words, the Torah is reminding us that it is a privilege to be G'd's people, to keep the Torah, etc. This is not comparable to imposing duties and restrictions on your children. The purpose of a life filled with מצוה-observance is to avoid the pitfalls of the abominations and detestable idols the Egyptians were captive to. Moses tells the people present that inasmuch as they know all about this they also know that what is being asked of them is to confer benefits rather than restrictions on their children and children's children."
29,15,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 29:15:1","כי אתם וגו', “For you know, etc.” Moses reminds the people of the advantages of remaining true and loyal to Hashem, as in the event that some have a feeling of nostalgia for the abominations that they worshipped in Egypt, or the similar abominations that the Moabites and Ammonites worship, it would be appropriate that they recall how either of these attempts to backslide into idolatry ended, i.e. catastrophically for the participants.

I.e., this is a reason for what comes before the previous verses, For your passage into the covenant, etc. (v. 11). It is explaining why the Holy One suspected that Yisroel might serve idols and made it necessary for them take an oath regarding this. The reason he suspected them was what he says here, Because you are aware, etc. These two verses, For you are aware, etc., and Where you observed their abominations, etc., are connected to the verse Perhaps there is among you, etc. that follows them, and the word פן is missing a ויו (and).

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

(Avodah Zarah 51b states that the prohibition applies only when the articles are placed on the idol itself. The fact that they are positioned near the idol is not sufficient to have them forbidden.)  If he finds them [placed] in a derisive manner, they are permitted. (because the manner in which they are placed indicates that they were not intended as adornment or service for the idol.)  If he finds them [placed] in a deferential manner, they are forbidden. (Avodah Zarah, ibid., derives this concept from the exegesis of Deuteronomy 29:16: ""You saw their putridities (their idols)... the gold and silver which is with them,"" explaining that ""anything which is 'with them' is 'putrid,' forbidden as the idols are. Since these are articles that are used to adorn an idol, they are prohibited.)  What is implied? If one finds a purse hanging around its neck, folded garments placed on its head, or a utensil overturned on its head, they are permitted, because [they were placed] in a derisive manner. (The position of the article indicates that it was not placed there with the intent of adorning the idol. On the contrary, placing these articles on an idol in such a fashion reflects one's contempt for it. Therefore, there is no reason for the article to be forbidden.)  The same applies to other similar situations. [In contrast,] if one finds an object of a type which is used as an offering for the [Temple] altar (This includes the animals used as sacrifices, wine, flour, or oil. Avodah Zarah 51b notes that this prohibition includes even water, which is used for the water libation on Sukkot, and salt, which is added to all the sacrifices offered on the altar.)  on the head [of an idol], it is forbidden. (The fact that these articles are used as offerings in the Temple leads to the conclusion that they were presented to the idol for a similar purpose. When does the above - distinction between a deferential and a derisive position)  When does the above apply? When one finds such articles outside its (the idol's)  [usual] place of worship. When, however, one finds such articles within the [idol's place of worship], (The fact that the article was brought into the idol's temple indicates that it was used in its service. Accordingly,)  regardless of whether it was placed in a derisive manner or in a deferential manner, or whether it is of the type of objects used as sacrifices for the [Temple] altar, any article found within [such a structure] (even if it is not placed upon the idol itself)  - even water or salt (The Rambam's mention of these articles is somewhat problematic. Since they were offered on the Temple altar, as explained above, they are forbidden even if they are not found within the temple of an idol. The commentaries explain that since these articles are of little consequence and are not generally themselves brought as offerings to an idol, we would not think that they were forbidden. Therefore, it is necessary to mention them explicitly.)  - becomes forbidden. (Note Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTum'ot 6:7, where the Rambam states that the forbidden nature of foods offered to idols can never be negated. When, however, utensils are offered, the prohibition against using them can be negated, as explained in Chapter 8, Halachah 8. [Different laws apply regarding] Pe'or and Marculis. - See the description of the service of these deities in Chapter 3, Halachah 2.)  [Different laws apply regarding] Pe'or and Marculis. It is forbidden to benefit from anything that is found together with them, whether [it is found] in their [temple] or outside of it. (Since these deities are served in a derisive manner, no distinction is made between the manner in which articles placed upon them are found. Even when an article is found in a derisive position, it is forbidden.)  Similarly, with regard to the stones [found near a symbol of] Marculis: If a stone appears to be together with it, (Since a shrine to this deity consists of stones piled on each other, we assume that any stone found in proximity to it was once part of such a pile. Hence,)  it is forbidden to benefit from it. (Rashi, Avodah Zarah 50a states that all stones within a cubit of the deity are forbidden. Stones which are further removed are permitted. Tosafot maintains that any stones found within a radius of four cubits are forbidden.) "

Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says that Rabbi Oshaya says: One verse states: “And you have seen their detestable things and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them” (Deuteronomy 29:16). And one verse states: “You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself” (Deuteronomy 7:25). How can these texts be reconciled? The second verse mentions the prohibition of only silver and gold, whereas the first verse also mentions wood and stone."

And when it does not do what they want, they curse it and degrade it, as it says ""and when they are hungry, they shall rage and revolt against their king and their divine beings"" (Yeshayahu 8:21) and when they curse others, say: O, it is like their god who is unable to help them, like ""By you shall Israel give-blessings""... (Bereishit 48:20), and it does not say ""they shall curse their king and their God"". ""of gold and silver that are with them"" When they make an image of silver and gold, after they serve it for one or two years they say: This isn't working at all, I will make another. And they break it and grind it, and there is ""silver and gold that are with it"", since it's expensive. And one could explain: that it itself is gold or silver, there they are with it and beside it, since they are afraid of it being stolen, since it can't guard itself even from mice. And you will see that they serve this and leave it, and serve another, and they have no authority over them, rather whoever wants worships and whoever wants leaves, everyone according to the desires of their heart. And they cleave to theft and robbery, promiscuity and incest, all that their hearts desire they do. And this is something in the heart of a person to do ""the stubbornness of their heart"" (ref to Devarim 29:18). And therefore you need to accept all of you the covenant, the curses and the oaths, that you will stand by the tradition of the covenant."
29,17,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 29:17:1,"LEST THERE SHOULD BE AMONG YOU etc. Therefore, I must place you under an oath.” Thus far is Rashi’s language. He has commented well. And the purport thereof is to state, “I must bring you now into this covenant with an imprecation and an oath on account of my fear that perhaps the hearts of some of you have been beguiled into following the abominations of Egypt as you did at the [affair of the golden] calf, or the abominations of Ammon and Moab that you saw on the road when you had the affair with Baal-peor,” for at the first covenant at the time of the Giving of the Torah there were no imprecations and curses. He stated [lest there should be among you] man or woman because a woman is frivolous [and can easily be led into idol-worship]. He stated a similar expression in [the chapter dealing with an individual] worshipping the idols. (Above, 17:2: man or woman …)  He mentioned individuals, family, and tribe [lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe] meaning a multitude, but he did not say it [lest they should worship the idols] concerning all of them, out of respect [to them]. Or it may be that it was impossible for the hearts of all of them to turn to the idols on that day, because, if so, they would not have come into the covenant of G-d and His oath, for who could have compelled them. A family or tribe, however, might have come into the covenant for fear of the majority. He stated lest there should be among you [man, or woman etc.] whose heart turneth away this day referring to him who has already been beguiled to idol-worship and who secretly believes in them that day. Or lest there should be among you an evil root that will blossom and grow and in the coming days will bring forth poisonous buds and grow bitter herbs. This refers back to him that is not here with us this day, (Verse 14.)  for the father is the root and the son is the twig that shall grow forth out of his roots. (Isaiah 11:1.)  He mentioned the root in order to state that he can bring the coming generations into this oath, for the root from which the coming generations will grow is before him this day, and it comes within this covenant and oath. He stated a root that beareth gall to suggest that from a sweet root no bitter plant will issue, and that all those whose hearts are perfect with the Glorious Name (Above, 28:58.)  and gave no thought to the idols, will not give birth to a child, who will avow idolatry. Now, do not refute me in this matter on the basis of the verse If he [a man who is just, and does that which is lawful and right] beget a son that is a robber, (Ezekiel 18:10. And, as the verses state on this subject, this son is a murderer and idolator, and yet his father was a perfectly righteous man!)  for the matter is true, there being a great secret therein which I cannot explain. (In Abusaula’s mystic commentary on Ramban the subject is explained, based on the doctrine of the transmigration of souls.)  "

29,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:17:1,"פן יש בכם…ללכת לעבוד, ""lest there be amongst you ….to go and serve the gods, etc."" In this verse the Torah warns against the mere intention to practice idolatry, making the person doing this culpable. The operative word is לבבו פונה, ""his heart turns, etc."
29,17,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Reading the Shema 1:4","When reciting the Shema, after completing the first verse, one says quietly ""Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom forever."" (This phrase is recited quietly because it is not part of the section of the Shema as it appears in the Torah, but rather was recited by Jacob in Egypt, as explained later in this halachah. It is, however, pronounced loudly on Yom Kippur. Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer explains that the angels praise God with this verse. On Yom Kippur, we are as pure as angels and thus, emulate their practice (Hagahot Maimoniot). It is preferable to separate clearly between the end of ""Blessed be the name"" - i.e., the words לעולם ועד - forever, and the beginning of the next section, ואהבת (And you shall love...) (Tur, Orach Chayim 61).)  He then continues to read the first section in its normal fashion: ""And you shall love God, your Lord..."" Why do we read it in this fashion? (i.e., Why do we include this verse of ""Blessed be the name...,"" since it is not part of the section of the Torah beginning with ""Shema Yisrael..."")  It is our tradition that when the patriarch, Jacob, gathered all his sons together in Egypt close to his death, (See Genesis, Chapter 49.)  he commanded and urged them regarding the Unity of God and the path of God upon which Abraham and Isaac, his father, had tread. (This narrative can be found in Pesachim 56a.)  He asked them: ""My sons, perhaps there are dregs among you, one who does not stand with me in the Unity of God?"" (What would cause Jacob to have such a doubt regarding his children? One of the greatest merits of Jacob is that he - unlike Avraham, who fathered Yishmael, and Yitzchak, who had Esau as a son - had only righteous children. Pesachim (ibid.) explains that Jacob desired to reveal the secret of the end of days to his children, but that this knowledge suddenly left him. He was worried that perhaps his sudden lack of understanding was due to the imperfect state of his children and therefore, felt compelled to ask them about their faith in the One God. The Rambam omits all these particulars, since they are not relevant to the matter at hand - namely, the source of the custom of saying ""Blessed be the name..."" after ""Shema Yisrael..."")  This is comparable to the manner in which Moses, our teacher, said to us: ""Lest there be among you a man or woman [whose heart turns this day from God...]"" (The Rambam adds this in order to teach us the nature of Jacob's doubts. He was not casting aspersions on the behavior of his sons, since he knew that their deeds were righteous. He was, however, worried that perhaps one of them had a mistaken understanding regarding the unity of God. This is in line with the verse the Rambam quotes. Moses is not chastising the Jewish people for their actions, but rather warning them of the possibility that there might be someone with a lack of faith that could lead to blasphemy later (Kessef Mishneh).)  (Deuteronomy 29:17). They all answered and said: ""Listen, Israel, (Jacob is also called by that name (Genesis 32:29).)  God is our Lord, God is One,"" i.e., listen to us, Israel, our father, God is our Lord, God is One. (God is our Lord, God is One,"" i.e., listen to us, Israel, our father, God is our Lord, God is One.)  The wise elder responded: (Praising God for the fortune of having righteous children; ""Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever."" Therefore, the Jews are accustomed to utter the praise that Israel, the wise elder, uttered after this verse.)  ""Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever."" Therefore, the Jews are accustomed to utter the praise that Israel, the wise elder, uttered after this verse."
29,17,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Exodus 20:2:2,"The meaning of out of the house of bondage is that they stayed in Egypt in a house of bondage as captives of Pharaoh. (This accords with the interpretation of the Mechilta here: “Out of the house of bondage. They were slaves to kings.” And as Rashi puts it, “from the house of Pharaoh where ye were slaves to him.”)  He said this to them [in order to indicate] that they are obligated [to accept] this Great, Glorious and Fearful Name (Deuteronomy 28:58.)  as their G-d, and to worship Him, because He redeemed them from Egyptian bondage. It is similar in meaning to the verse, They are My servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. (Leviticus 25:55.)  I have also already alluded to above (Above, 19:20.)  by way of the Truth, [the mystic lore of the Cabala], to the reason why the two sacred Names — [the Tetragrammaton and Elokim] — are mentioned here. This commandment, in the words of our Rabbis, (Berachoth 13b.)  is called the obligation “to take upon oneself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven,” for these words, [i.e., the Eternal your G-d], which I have mentioned, indicate a King addressing His people. Thus the Rabbis have said in the Mechilta: (Mechilta on Verse 3 here.)  “Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. (Verse 3.)  Why is this said? (Since it says, I am the Eternal thy God, etc., it already means, “I, am not another.” Why then does He state again, Thou shalt not have other gods before Me?)  Because it says, I am the Eternal thy G-d. This can be illustrated by a parable: A king invaded a country, and his attendants said to him, ‘Issue decrees to us.’ (“Us.” In the Mechilta: “them,” i.e., the people.)  He, however, refused, saying: ‘No! When you have accepted my sovereignty, I will issue decrees to you, for if you do not accept my sovereignty, how will you carry out my decrees?’ Similarly, G-d said to Israel: ‘I am the Eternal thy G-d, thou shalt have no other gods. I am He Whose sovereignty you have accepted in Egypt.’ And when they said to Him: ‘Yes,’ [He continued]: ‘Now, just as you have accepted My sovereignty, so you must also accept My decrees.’” That is to say, “Since you have accepted upon yourselves and have admitted that I am the Eternal, and that I am your G-d from the [time that you were yet in the] land of Egypt, then accept all My commandments.” Now all the [Ten] Commandments are expressed in the singular — the Eternal thy G-d, Who brought ‘thee’ out — and not, as He began to say, [before the Giving of the Torah]: ‘Ye’ have seen; (Above, 19:4.)  if ‘ye’ will hearken. (Ibid., Verse 5.)  This is because His intent is to warn that each individual is subject to punishment for [transgression of] the commandments, since He addresses Himself to each one individually, commanding him that he should not think that He will judge according to the majority and that the individual will be saved with them. This intent was explained to the people by Moses at the end of the Torah, in the section of Atem Nitzavim. (Deuteronomy 29:17-19. See Ramban there on Verse 17.) "
29,17,Midrash,Midrash Tehillim 101:2,"""I will act wisely on the innocent way. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah. Rabbi Judah says, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, ""Appoint for Me a priest."" Moses said to Him, ""What tribe?"" He replied to him, ""Do not put Reuben before Me, who sinned with Bilhah, his father's concubine, as it is said (Genesis 35:22), 'And Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine.' "" He said to him, ""From the tribe of Simeon."" He said to him, ""They are engaged in violence, which I hate, as it is said (Genesis 49:5), 'Simeon and Levi are brothers, weapons of violence are their wares.' "" He said to him, ""How about the tribe of Dan?"" He said to him, ""They will cause My anger, for they are idolaters, as it is said (Zechariah 10:11), 'And they shall cross the sea with affliction, and smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart.'

29,17,Quoting Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Exodus 6:2:1","וידבר אלוקים....וארא אל אברהם, “G’d said….I have appeared to Avraham, etc.” Rashi explains that instead of writing הודעתי, “I have made known,” the Torah wrote a passive mode לא נודעתי, “I have not become well known.” This means that G’d’s attribute of Hashem had not become properly known, familiar, to the patriarchs. Seeing that this attribute reveals more of G’d’s essence than such attributes as shaddai, or elokim, the element of G’d’s fulfilling commitments He made of a long term nature, such as the promise to Avraham that his descendants would survive 400 years of exile and enslavement and proceed to the land of Canaan and take it over as their ancestral homeland, this attribute would from now on become better known. G’d implies that seeing that the time frame after which the redemption was supposed to occur had not yet been completed, the fact that this attribute of G’d had not yet been appreciated was not a reflection of G’d having withheld important information.
    
    Rashi also quotes an alternate commentary which suggests that the people should have inquired after this attribute of G’d, [why He had failed to keep His promises, the ones made to the patriarchs, Ed.] and that G’d now explains the reason why He had not yet seen fit to do so. Rashi rejects such a commentary saying that the time for G’d fulfilling His promises had not arrived yet, so that such a complaint would have been inappropriate. 
    The problem with such interpretations is that already during the very first revelation of G’d to Avraham at the covenant between the pieces (Genesis chapter 15), the Torah clearly states that “the word of Hashem came to Avram,” In other words, G’d introduced Himself to Avram not as shaddai or as elokim, but by His name Hashem.” He had added further that His claim on Avraham’s obedience was based on His having saved him from the furnace Nimrod had thrown him into in Ur Casdim. Rashi’s rejecting לא נודעתי as meaning “I have not made known,” is based on this appearance of G’d precisely as the attribute of Mercy, an essential attribute, as Avraham had not had a claim to being saved at the time, seeing he had voluntarily submitted to that test of his faith. [my words based on Rabbi Yitzchok Arama. Ed.]
    The question is why did G’d have to tell Moses: “I am Hashem,” seeing that He had been known as such to the patriarchs. I believe that the answer is simple. G’d tells Moses that although He had been known in His capacity as Hashem to the patriarchs, [compare how Avraham describes Mount Moriah after the binding of Yitzchok, as compared to the opening lines of that chapter (Genesis 22) Ed.] He had not appeared in that guise to the Jewish people as yet. The problem was that the people had not enquired as to the difference between these various attributes of G’d, i.e. when He would prefer to relate to them under one heading (attribute), and when He would prefer to relate to them under a different heading (attribute).
    Knowing all this, we can better understand Moses’ question to G’d in 3,13 “which of Your attributes (name) shall I say to them is the one which will orchestrate the redemption?” According to the interpretation of לא נודעתי להם, “I have not been known to them,” Moses’ question at that time should have been: “when they ask me what shall I tell them?” Rashi’s explanation that the entire paragraph contains a criticism of Moses who had questioned G’d’s handling of the situation since He had appointed him as leader, was to contrast his behaviour with that of the patriarchs who, even when faced with what appeared G’d’s inexplicable behaviour, had not questioned this. [I find all this somewhat strange. Avraham, when having to come to terms with G’d’s treatment of others, such as the people of Sodom had questioned G’d’s judgment, though he had never questioned it when it concerned his own fate. Moses too, questions why his people are suffering more; he does not question his own image being tarnished. Ed.]
    At any rate, we must not mistakenly understand G’d as saying that He had not been known as possessing the attribute of Hashem, but as explaining that only now had the time come to guide the fate of the Jewish people under that heading.
    Ibn Ezra writes that the letter ב in the word בא-ל, suggests that it applies also to an additional factor, i.e. meaning ”with.” [as in “and in addition to”, i.e. ובשמי ה', “and with My additional name, etc.” Ed.] Accordingly, we are to understand the line וארא אל אברהם ואל יצחק ואל יעקב בא-ל שדי ובשמי ה' לא נודעתי להם, “My task in appearing to the patriarchs as the attribute shaddai, i.e. the attribute which governs My power to control nature, the sun, moon, etc., was different from My task at this time when I have to demonstrate My power on earth, a domain basically assigned to man. [some of these words are my own, though I trust they reflect that of the author quoted. Ed.] The patriarchs had been taught that their experience when G’d saved them from famine, from the sword during war, etc., that these were phenomena not related to their specific good deeds, but to G’d exercising His השגחה, benevolent providence, as part of the השגחה כללית, supervision of the universe as a whole. [When directing phenomena devoid of free will such as nature, G’d employs a different attribute from that which He has to employ when facing opposing forces equipped with a free will, such as man. Ed.] During His guidance of the universe at the time of the patriarchs, He did not confront man’s free will. 
    The blessings and curses promised in the Torah are not addressed to the conduct of individuals but to the conduct of mankind as a whole or the Jewish people as a whole, [although G’d warns individuals not to use the people as a whole as an umbrella to hide their individual misdeeds (Deuteronomy 29,17-20) Ed.] The real reward in this life for observing the Torah’s commandments is something known only to G’d, the lawgiver, it is in the nature of a נס נסתר, “a hidden miracle,” i.e. when it does occur no one can pinpoint it as something unnatural. [the concept is familiar from the string of “natural” coincidences and their timing which combine to make up the Purim story. Ed.] These apparent coincidences are actually part of the process of reward and punishment, except that they are not recognized by us as such at the time. The reason why the sages tell us that astronomical influences, i.e. mazzal, do not govern the lives of the Israelites is that the same G’d Who runs nature, also interferes in an invisible manner in what astrologers believed was a forecast of their fates in the stars. This does not mean that astrology is “for the birds,” on the contrary, it means that the Creator can manipulate the events forecast by astrology in a manner which changes their impact on the individuals whom He chooses to be so impacted. Such intervention enabled Rivkah to become pregnant and have children, and it resulted in the Jewish people surviving a bloody encounter forecast by the stars, by the blood in question becoming the blood of the mass circumcision performed by Joshua, instead of becoming the loss of their lifeblood.
    Moses had actually posed two questions to G’d. 1) Why did you send me on this mission at all? 2) Why have you so far failed to save the Jewish people from their misery? Concerning his second question G’d answered him: “now you are going to see why I sent you. You will witness what I am about to do to Pharaoh.” Concerning Moses’ first question G’d said: “I am Hashem.” G’d told him that He had used the patriarchs to demonstrate His stature as shaddai, the G’d controlling events from the heavenly throne, whereas now He would employ Moses to demonstrate how He organized events on earth, by Moses being as it were “His hand and His outstretched arm.” It is your task to make My attribute of Hashem familiar both to the Israelites and to the Egyptians, i.e. the rest of mankind.
"
29,17,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 29:17:1","איש או אשה, “be it a man or a woman;” Moses does not wish to insult anyone; therefore he speaks of individuals possibly straying, something which might also result in peer-pressure by the other members of the family drawing in the ones who were not originally willing. He mentions the woman only after the man, precisely because women are more easily seduced by false philosophies. By suggesting that a man might be the first to fall into such a trap, Moses preserves the self-respect of the Jewish women.
"
29,17,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 29:17:2","פן יש בכם...אשר לבבו פונה היום, “lest there be amongst you anyone whose heart will turn away this day, etc.;” this refers to someone whose faith and belief in Hashem has already been undermined, but who has not acted upon it; or, 
"
29,17,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 29:17:3","פן יש בכם שורש פורה ראש ולענה, “lest there be amongst you a root flourishing with gall and wormwood.” This refers to a development in the more distant future, the party concerned not being alive yet and not having been seduced mentally, but belonging to the ones whom Moses described as “not being with us here this day.” When, or if, this occurs, it reflects on the “root”, i.e. forefather of such a person having carried within his seed some of his own spiritual weakness that he involuntarily transmitted to his offspring. He will, however, be under the obligations of this covenant and this curse applicable to non-compliance. [It is important to understand that seeing that membership of the Jewish nation brings with it a multiplicity of advantages, the small price to pay for this, even though this unborn Jew had not given his consent to membership of the Jewish people, still renders being born a Jew a “good deal” on the whole.” Ed.]
"
29,17,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 19:2:3","קדושים תהיו כי קדוש אני ה' אלו-היכם, “You shall be holy for I am holy, Hashem, your G’d.” According to the plain meaning of the text the word קדוש, means isolating oneself, being apart. This is an exhortation to the entire Jewish people to be chaste, to practices noble character traits and to impress one’s children with the importance of these virtues. Children then will look up to their parents as if the parents truly were G’d’s representatives on earth. In turn they will testify thereby that the Creator Himself is their supreme authority, the original “patriarch” who has called this world into existence. In order to make this point, our paragraph immediately commences by telling us that we must revere mother and father and observe G’d’s Sabbaths. (verse 3). The linkage of these two commandments is that the Sabbath is testimony to the fact that G’d created the universe (Exodus 20,11).  The reason the Torah writes the commandment to revere mother and father, letting the mother precede the father in importance (as opposed to a similar commandment in the decalogue where the Torah writes: “honour your father and your mother”), is that it is natural for children to love the mother more than the father and to fear the authority of the father more than that of the mother. The Torah wants to ensure that we do not make such distinctions in our relationship with our respective father and mother. If both parents were to agree that the child is to violate the Sabbath, the Torah adds immediately: “and you shall observe My Sabbath days,” meaning that this commandment overrides even a joint command by father and mother to the contrary. The addition of the words: “I am the Lord your G’d” at the end of verse three means that G’d is the supreme authority for both the child and his parents and thus has overriding authority when there is a conflict involving the loyalties of the child. Both the parents and the child are obligated to carry out His instructions.  The Torah appends the commandment not to serve any other deities nor to make molten images for oneself to make the point that even if one recognises the Lord as the supreme authority but denies that He created the world out of no pre-existing raw material one is considered an heretic, guilty of idolatry.  One must not turn to idols as this implies that one considers that they are a substantive force. The words אל תפנו, “do not turn,” are not so much an instruction not to face the idols but that in one’s heart one must not believe that there is anything to them and to what they purport to represent. We must consider idols as something devoid of any theological meaning, totally powerless to exert influence of any kind on anybody. The use of the root פנה here is similar in meaning to Deut. 29,17: “whose heart turns away today from the Lord, etc.,” or Deut. 30,17 “if you will turn away and not listen.”  The Torah adds that “you must not construct molten images for yourselves,” i.e. even though you are aware that such images are totally meaningless in theological terms, have no power or value. The reason the Torah appends the words: “I am the Lord your G’d,” means that ‘I can be trusted to pay you your reward, i.e. Hashem, (attribute of Mercy) but eloheychem, (attribute of Justice) in the event you do something for which you will deserve punishment.’"
29,17,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:17:1","פן יש בכם שרש פורה ראש ולענה, “lest there be among you a root flourishing with gall and wormwood.” Venom is considered the ראש, ‘principal’ of all bitter roots or leafs, being more bitter than any other variant. Some commentators explain the meaning of the word ראש here as a reference to the venom of the viper in whose head it is found, i.e. animal-based. The word לענה, by contrast, refers to some bitter vegetable matter. We find the expression in Numbers 30,14: לענות נפש, “to cause bitterness in a person.” It describes the person making such a vow as causing herself the utmost anguish."
29,17,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:17:1","In case there is among you. Some people ask: It is written above in parshas Va'eschanan (4:9), Lest you forget the words, and, Lest you raise your eyes heavenward (ibid. 19), and in parshas Eikev (above 11:16), Lest your heart be misled, yet over there, Rashi does not explain that it means perhaps. According to Re”m's explanation that this perhaps there is among you is part of Rashi's words and not that he is coming to explain it, but citing it [as part of his sentence] to explain the composition of the verse, there is no difficulty at all. Even without this, you can answer that Rashi explains the meaning of פן here and not above, is because above it connotes a negative commandment as they said (Zevachim 106a), Wherever it says השמר, פן, or אל, it connotes a negative commandment. But here one cannot explain that it is a negative commandment, i.e., that one should not do this, because it is written Perhaps there is among you, which is speaking of a case where such people are already present. Therefore Rashi explains that [here] it connotes “in case” [i.e. perhaps]. "
29,17,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:17:2","Whose thoughts stray today. This is part of Rashi's text, not that Rashi is now explaining the [beginning of] the verse, Perhaps there is among you, etc., [someone] whose thoughts stray, etc. [Because Rashi is actually explaining the second part of the verse, Perhaps there is within you a root producing gall and bitter fruit.] Otherwise, [i.e., if you claim that Rashi is explaining the first part of the verse], the difficulty arises that Rashi already explained [the first part of the verse] above (v. 15) [when he explained, “Perhaps there is, among you, etc.” “Perhaps someone among you has been tempted to follow them.”] Also, our verse seems to be talking about idolatry so how can Rashi explain that it is talking about accepting the covenant”? Thus one must say that [whose thoughts stray today] is part of Rashi's text. Rashi is discussing the words, Perhaps there is within you a root producing gall, etc. and not the words, Perhaps there is among you a man or a woman, etc., because he wants to answer why the Torah writes, Perhaps there is within you, etc. twice. He explains that the reason it is written a second time is because the first instance is talking about idolatry and the second instance [is talking] about accepting the covenant. It is as if the verse says, Perhaps there is among you whose heart strays today from Hashem to go after idols, or perhaps there is among you whose heart strays today from accepting the yoke of the covenant, and thus the word today applies to both of them, because neither of them wants to accept the covenant.

29,17,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Exodus 19:5:17,"all evildoers are scattered,"" that man's deeds betray the state of his soul, such as the kind of state referred to in Deut. 29,17 as ""a root that bears gall and wormwood."" On the other hand, when the soul is wholesome it reflects sanctity. I have written more about this in connection with Jacob's criticising Reuben on his deathbed (Genesis 49,3). We explained there that if Reuben suffered from a character weakness this had to do with what Jacob thought about when he bedded Leah thinking she was Rachel. The arguments of Esau, Ammon and Moav, as well as Ishmael were of a similar nature. They accused G'd of having burdened them with hereditary character weaknesses which would make it difficult if not impossible for them to fulfil those parts of the Torah which G'd had mentioned to them. They did not brag about their faults. They only said that their lifestyle was proof that they had been burdened with such moral weakness as they exhibited already from birth, that the root of their collective soul was polluted. There was, however, a subtle difference between the arguments of Ammon and Moav on one side and those of Esau and Ishmael on the other. Ammon and Moav attributed their problems to an action by their forefather [or better by their respective matriarchs, Lot's daughters, seeing that Lot was unconscious at the time Ed.]. The Ishmaelites went further; they blamed G'd directly seeing that their matriarch Hagar had been told by the angel (Genesis 16,12) that the son she would give birth to would be unbridled and aggressive. The people of Edom blamed their patriarch Isaac who had encouraged Esau to live the life of a murderer by telling him: ""you will live by your sword"" (Genesis 27,40)."
29,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:17:2,"פן יש בכם, what precisely is this ""root flourishing with gall and wormwood?"" If these words refer to the previous statement where the Torah describes when this person's ""heart turns to go and serve idols,"" the words פן יש בכם should not have been repeated. The Torah should have written something of this order: פן יש בכם איש או אשה אשר לבבו פונה…שרש פרה ראש ולענה. Furthermore, what is the meaning of the words ""a root of wormwood?"" Apparently the Torah does not speak about wormwood and gall but about a root. How does the Israelite who plans to engage in idolatry ""bless himself in his heart?"" Besides what is the point of the word לאמור in this verse? What does the Torah mean with the words: ""for I will walk in the path my heart sees fit,"" in verse 18?"
29,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:17:3,"The basic idea underlying this verse is to warn the Israelite that anyone who attempts to get away with none or only minor punishments by only thinking about sinning but not actually violating any of the Torah's commandments will be disappointed. The Torah tells such a person that at this particular stage of his thinking he is merely a root, Le. harmless in itself; however, the outgrowth of this root will be gall and wormwood. This is why, in the first instance, the Torah speaks of פן יש בכם שרש פורה ראש ולענה, ""it is first and foremost a root from which unexpected plants will grow."""
29,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:17:4,"The clever Israelite who looks for devious ways to escape the curses of which the Torah warns first blesses himself in ""his heart."" This means that he says to himself that merely contemplating sins is not so bad. This is why the Torah uses the words והיה בשמעו. We have explained repeatedly that the word והיה always has a joyful connotation. This Israelite says to himself that as long as he only contemplates sinning, he is not guilty of anything. This contributes to his joy. The Torah puts the record straight telling such an individual that if he thought he could cancel the oath Moses committed him to before accepting it even if he had answered ""Amen"", this would not help him. We have learned in Shavuot 26 that when it comes to oaths one's mouth and one's heart must act in unison, and that if someone makes up his mind to invalidate the words of an oath he will utter, only his intention commits him, not his words. When Moses speaks of שרירות לבו, he describes a person who uses the loophole we just quoted to escape culpability. Not only that, but למען ספות הרוה את הצמאה, ""in order to add the watered to the thirsty,"" i.e. to benefit from the blessings G'd will shower upon the Torah-observant people. The word ספות is related to כריתה, an end. The word רוה is an alternative for רבה, ""increase."" The word צמאה describes something small, insignificant. The Israelite intends to limit or totally cut off any punishment by cancelling the oath Moses wants him to undertake."
29,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:17:5,"This kind of conduct is what Moses calls שרש, from which eventually will sprout gall and wormwood. Normally, the justification of swearing an oath is to make it a bulwark against the temptations of the evil urge. David referred to such an oath in Psalms 119,106 when he said: ""I have firmly sworn to keep Your just social laws."" Our sages in Ruth Rabbah credit Boaz with having sworn such an oath to resist the temptation to sleep with Ruth before they were married. The person whom Moses refers to in our paragraph uses an oath to establish a circumvention of the law. This is much worse than merely not answering ""Amen"" when required to do so. Moses considers this the root of all the evil that will develop from such an attitude."
29,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:17:6,The Torah singles out such a person for worse punishment than that in store for people who accepted the covenant but who violate it from time to time.
29,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:17:7,"לא יאבה ה׳ סלוח לו ""G'd will not be willing to forgive him;"" Although it is one of G'd's major attributes to pardon and forgive man's sins, the kind of devious scheming person described here does not qualify for G'd exercising this attribute. As a result of G'd's unwillingness to forgive such a person, He will punish him with all the severity at His command once such a person has translated sinful thoughts into sinful deeds. He will be subjected to all the curses written in the Torah. "
29,17,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:17:9,"Even though the Torah refers here to האיש ההוא, ""that man,"" the same applies to a family or tribe which conduct themselves in the same manner."
29,17,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Yitro, Derekh Chayim 30","The other אתם in פרשת נצבים, which was said to the Jewish people after they had just finished listening to Moses issue dire warnings as to what would befall them if they did not observe the Torah, included a warning that someone who observed everybody else being Torah observant should not exploit the merit of the community to protect him from the consequences (Deut. 29,18-19). Moses actually told the Israelites that his very warnings were the factor that would keep them alive as they would be afraid to sin for fear of what would befall them. He explained that though they were descendants of wicked forefathers, they personally had cleaved to G–d, and this is why they had been saved (compare Rashi on Deut 4,4). [Rashi explains elsewhere that the Jews to whom Moses repeatedly referred as obstinate, sinful, etc.,were those who had been redeemed from Egypt and had perished in the desert. This made the second generation צדיקים בני רשעים. The Rashi is not on the above quoted verse. Ed.] Whenever Israel is punished such punishment includes portion of the punishment due for the sin of the golden calf which has not yet been totally expiated. This too is part of the mystical dimension of the transmigration of souls."
29,17,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Matot, Masei, Devarim, Torah Ohr 14","We find that Adam essentially violated three categories of sin: idol worship, sexual licentiousness, and bloodshed. He was also guilty of violating property rights, i.e. financial misdemeanors. Our sages describe Adam as a heretic in Sanhedrin 38. They describe him as ""pulling his foreskin,"" (ibid. i.e. to make himself appear as if he had not been circumcised) He also cohabited with his wife who had previously been slept with by the serpent. As a result Adam's son Cain was infected with the pollutant of the serpent, the reason why he could become a murderer. [I recommend to the reader the commentary on this by Rabbeinu Chananel, who sees these accusations as being mouthed by the Gentiles, and who feels that the Talmud quotes them only in order to teach us how to respond to Biblical quotations taken out of context and used against us by our enemies. Ed.] As to Adam having sinned in property matters, this must be explained, seeing that the whole world belonged to him and he could not therefore become guilty of stealing, embezzling, etc. Rashi comments on Leviticus 1,2 that the reason why the Torah uses the word אדם as an example for someone who offers a sacrifice is, that just as Adam could not have brought a sacrifice from money which was not his, so anyone who offers a sacrifice is warned not to use stolen money for its purchase. Adam's sin consisted of his attitude to material things, described by the Torah as פורה ראש ולענה, ""sprouting poison weed and wormwood"" (Deut. 29,17). Adam displayed greed by eating from the tree of knowledge, which is described by the Torah as ""inspiring desire in the eyes"" (Genesis 3,6). He was a victim of the trait which our sages described when they said: ""man does not leave this world without leaving behind half his desires unfulfilled, that having amassed his first million, a man already aims at the second million"" (Kohelet Rabbah 1,34). Adam himself is alluded to in these three portions. Prior to his sin, Adam can be viewed as having been ראש המטות, ""the (spiritual) head of all human tribes."" Our sages describe the ministering angels surrounding Adam as paying homage to him, eager to hear his words of wisdom (Bereshit Rabbah 8,9). When the Torah says of the progress of the Jewish people in the desert in Numbers 33,2: ""These are the departures of the Jewish people according to their journeys,"" this is a veiled reference to Adam who had been expelled from Paradise and forced to reside in various parts of the earth, a constant traveler. At the end of the same verse, the Torah reverses the description of these journeys by describing them as ""their journeys according to the points of their departures."" "
29,17,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 29:17:2,"‘Rosh v’la’anah’ (gall and wormwood) are bitter or poisonous herbs. These are their names in the Sacred Language. Or it may be that they are surnames, one called rosh (“the head”) because it is the head of the bitter herbs, the bitterest of all, and the second is called la’anah, from the expression ‘lei’anoth’ (to humble thyself) before Me, (Exodus 10:3.)  for he who eats it becomes oppressed and is humbled, because he eats it only in order to afflict his soul."
29,17,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Hosea 13:15:2,"For though he flourish among the marshes Heb. יַפְרִיא. Blossoms and grows in the marsh. Among the marshes, among those growing in the marshes, which always flourish. And, since He compares him to a marsh, He says: An east wind shall come... and his spring shall dry up. Another explanation: For he decreased among the brothers, i.e., Jeroboam. He was a son who decreased the brotherhood [other versions: the heritage] of Israel. Through him, they were divided into two kingdoms. Decreased יַפְרִיע. An expression similar to (Gen. 16:12) “One who decreases men (פֶּרֶא אָדָם) .”"

Jonathan renders: For they are called sons, but they increased corrupt deeds. אַחִים An expression of an evil thing. Comp. (Ezekiel 21:20) “Woe! (אָח) It is made for a blade.” Also (ibid. 6:11) “And say, ‘Woe!’ (אָח) to all the... abominations.” יַפְרִיא An expression similar to (Deut. 29:17) פֹּרֶה רֹאשׁ וְלַעֲנָה, that hears (פֹּרַה) hemlock and wormwood.” But I say that אַחִים is an expression similar to (Gen. 41:2) “And they grazed in the marsh (בָּאָחוּ).”"

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

29,17,Quoting Commentary,"Simchat HaRegel on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, In the Beginning Our Fathers Were Idol Worshipers 1:11","It has been established based on what is stated in Chapter 8 of Masechet Shabbat, that, (BT Avodah Zarah 2b, Shabbat 88a, “Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: From here there is a substantial caveat (protest) to the obligation to fulfill the Torah. The Jewish people can claim that they were coerced into accepting the Torah, and it is therefore not binding. Rava said: Even so, they again accepted it willingly in the time of Ahasuerus, as it is written: “The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them” (Est. 9:27))  God held the mountain over their heads like a huge vessel… “From this we learn the great caveat to the Torah...."" Rabbi Rosanes in Parshat Derachim rejects this this claim (That Israel is not obligated to observe the Torah since they were coerced to do so at Sinai.)  by suggesting that, “The law of the land is the law.” (BT Nedarim 28a, Gittin 10b, Baba Kama 113b, Baba Batra 54a)  This would apply if Israel did not acquire the land through a hazakah (the right of usucaption), only then could they be expelled from the land because “the law of the land is the prevailing law.” If, on the other hand, the land was acquired by our forefathers through usucaption (hazakah) then the “the law of the land would not be the prevailing law” (since the land would belong to them by divine right) as has been taught. Joshua wished to see what was in the hearts of the Israelites. If they rejected the mitzvot, their position would be revealed and their righteousness tested, whether they were strong in their faith. And if corruption (See Deut 29:17)  was found in them, one might worry that their true position was not revealed because it would be necessary to expel them from the land, “A land which Adonai your God always looks after,” (Deut. 11:12) and God acquired it for His portion. If they said that they would not worship God, heaven forbid, they would be expelled from the land. Therefore, one would worry that they would hide what was really in their hearts… Thus Scripture states, “I took your father…” to prove that Abraham had the status of an Israelite and he acquired the land through usucaption. This statement has two implications: if they wanted to reject the mitzvot they could do so openly and they would not worry about being expelled from the land since it was their inheritance and the land was presumed to be theirs from the time of their forefathers. Second, through his statement they would understand that Abraham had the status of an Israelite. He wanted to arouse them to faith. Since their identity was from the time of Abraham and they have the status of a Jew from earliest times - even before the giving of the Torah - the patriarchs and their offspring had Israelite status. Therefore, it was appropriate for them to take hold of the Torah of Israel. This was hinted at as an aside; if they aroused themselves to Torah fine, and if, God forbid, they had a complaint in their heart and rejected the commandments, it would still be revealed to them that the Torah was presumed to be theirs. There is a protest and no one could say that the law of the land is the law since the land belonged to them."
29,17,Quoting Commentary,Nachal Eshkol on Ruth 4:7:1,"Now this was formerly done in Israel. It is stated in the book Likutei Torah (manuscript), ““Now this;” the word zot, this, refers to Torah. “Was formerly done in Israel,” specifically in Israel and not by the other nations. “In cases of redemption;” that is, in the book of the prophets. “Or exchange;” the Babylonian Talmud which mixed up the language. “And this was the practice in Israel;” this is the Jerusalem Talmud. “To confirm all things;” as if there were three knots. “One man would take off his sandal;” refers to Esau who is called a man of the field. “And he gave it to the other;” The word Na’alah is connected with La’anah, “Wormwood and poison weed.” (Deut. 29:17) They were removed and placed on the head of the goat which was sent to the wilderness. (Lev. 16:10) “This is the practice in Israel;” That is, to say, this depends on Israel’s deeds. (Another interpretation) “Now this was formerly done in Israel concerning redemption;” this refers to the juxtaposition of redemption and prayer by those who knew the mysteries and meditations. “Now this was formerly done in Israel” and not now. “Or exchange;” for example, the letters, כוזו, (A 14-lettered form of the Shem HaMephorash, esoteric names of God within Kabbalah. It appears on the back of the Mezuzah.)  and מצפך, (An ancient prayer which appears on amulets: אל נא קרב תשועת מצפך including the first letters of each word on each line: אנקתמ)  etc. With the mystery of the thirteen attributes of mercy - all of this was formerly done in Israel so that it came down the spouts bringing down the divine abundance to establish “to confirm all things.” That is to establish the Kingship (Malchut) which is also called Davar. What did they do? “One man would take off his sandal,” causing the divine abundance to continue through a righteous person from the heavenly source, from the attribute of wisdom which is Kodesh. It has the same gematria shalaf. It continues the name of Kana (zeal) which is in Yesod. This is Na’alo like the numerical value of Kana including the letters and the word. (156) “he gave to the other,” with the mystery of da’at in order to establish all of Malchut. He writes about this at length, the mystery of the words, the sandal - see what he wrote there at length."
29,17,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 29:17:1","V. 17. פן יש בכם וגו׳, nun könnte schon heute unter euch ein einzelner, oder ein einzelner Familien- oder Stammeskreis sein, deren Sinn sich schon heute von Gott ab und dem Heidentum zuwendet, oder es könnte eine solche sich verirrende Gesinnung noch in der Gegenwart gar nicht zum entschiedenen Durchbruch gekommen sein, sie ist heute nur erst noch שרש, eine Wurzel, ein im Entstehen begriffener Anfang, der erst in Zukunft, vielleicht erst in der Nachkommenschaft als bittere Frucht aufgeht. Die Bedeutung von ראש ist zweifelhaft. Während hier und so auch ענבי רוש (Kap. 32, 32), ופרח כראש משפט (Hosea 10, 5) usw. es einen der Pflanzenwelt angehörigen Stoff zu bedeuten scheint, weist ראש פתנים אכזר (Kap. 32, 33) auf einen animalischen Stoff hin. Jedenfalls ist es ein Stoff von höchst schlechter Wirkung auf den Körper. Die Zusammenstellung mit לענה weist auf Geschmacksinn, während ראש פתנים אכזר einen tötenden Stoff vermuten lässt. Vielleicht bezeichnet es eine Art Gift, deren sowohl das Pflanzen-, als das Tierreich liefert."
29,17,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 29:17,"Lest there is among you a man, or a woman, or a family, or a tribe, who was impressed by the idols of the nations and whose heart turns today from the Lord our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations, I am therefore issuing this warning to them. At that time idolatry was not openly practiced among the Jewish people, but it is nevertheless possible that some people might have been influenced by the idolatrous nations. Although they would not yet publicly admit their beliefs, they are liable to do so at a later stage. Moses expresses this concern by means of a metaphor: Lest there is among you a root producing gall and wormwood, bitter and possibly poisonous plants that are hard to discern when they are intermingled with a large quantity of produce;"
29,17,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Nitzavim 6-7","“Perchance there is among you some man or woman … whose heart is even now turning” [29:17]. This means, perhaps there will be a man or woman who will turn their heart to commit sins. Afterwards, the verse says, “the Lord will never forgive him” [29:19]. This means, God will not want to forgive the sins. Here one asks a question. When somebody does not repent, then it is just that God does not forgive. However, when he does repent, how is it possible that the Holy One should not forgive him? The explanation is that He first says, “whose heart is even now turning away” [29:17]. This means, his heart desires to commit sins, and when he repents, the Holy One forgives him because the evil inclination incited him and brought forth his desires. However, afterwards the verse says, “I follow my own willful heart” [29:18]. This means, the person says, I will commit sins willfully and afterwards he wants to repent for it. (Toldot Yizhak, Deuteronomy, 29:17–19.)  Through repentance I will have more reward than if I had always been righteous, as the Talmud says, “the place where penitents stand, even completely righteous people cannot stand.” (B. Berakhot, 34b.)  This means, in the Garden of Eden, where the penitents stand, even the most righteous will not have such a good place. Therefore, the verse tells us here that when the person would willingly commit sins, expecting that he would do penance so that he would have a good place in the Garden of Eden, the Holy One will not forgive that person his sins, as the Talmud states, “the one who says, I will sin and repent, he is not forgiven the opportunity to repent.”  (M. Yoma, 8.9.)  This means, the one who will commit sins expecting that he will repent, God does not forgive him."
29,17,Musar,Pele Yoetz 62:38,"Evil speech is the head root sprouting poison (alluding to Deuteronomy 29:17), for its severity corresponds to that of idolatry, sexual immorality, and murder [put together] (Arkahin 15b). And King David, peace be upon him, has already expunged it, as it is written: May the Lord expunge all flattering lips, every tongue that speaks arrogance (Psalms 12:4). And evil speech is when one speaks disparagingly about his fellow. If it is something that has nothing to it, it is also called putting out a bad name. But if it is true, it is called evil speech – anything that was not known and this one reveals it. A talebearer reveals secrets (alluding to Proverbs 11:13), as he carries things to and fro and says, “X did this to you,” or “said this and that about you.” Their tongue is a sharpened arrow (alluding to Jeremiah 9:7); their throat is an open grave (alluding to Psalms 5:10). However, if he sees that damage will come to his fellow, he is obligated to reveal it to him so that he can be on guard. About this is it stated: You are not to traffic in slander among your kinspeople, you are not to stand by the blood of your neighbor; I am the Lord (Leviticus 19:16)."
29,17,Kabbalah,Beur Eser Sefirot 1:2,"Answer. Like it's impossible for a ship to not have a captain, so it's impossible for the world to not have a Ruler. And the Ruler is the Infinite One for God's honor and God's word - as the matter is written, ""I have seen an end to every purpose; but Thy commandment is exceeding broad."" (Ps. 119:96), and it is written, ""That God will call every creature to account for everything unknown, be it good or bad."" (Ecc. 12:14) And what is this that is hidden, without end or beginning, and without detail and without anything outside of it? And the sages of the investigation agree that this is a thing without end and without detail and without border, the causes of all causes, and the reason behind all reasons. And the way of the Ruler that we have seen is without end and all of God's actions are hidden from one who investigates the issue, as its written, ""God hath set the world in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end."" (Ecc. 3:11) And its also written, ""though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it."" (ibid, 8:17). And about this the text cautions, ""... lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe...""  (Deut. 29:17) And its written, ""that he bless himself in his heart, saying: 'I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart...'"" (ibid, 18) that is to say, that there's no believer in name and in image except for he that believes in the Infinite and draws from God strength for himself - and he doesn't do so through the virtue of name. And regarding one who has denied the name, it is written, and in him God protests God's name in order to contend with him and his image. And the one that believes in God will believe that there is a Ruler of the world, and the believer in the Infinite. But the one who doesn't believe that there is a Ruler of the world, but instead says that the world is degraded and happened by chance, about him it is written, 'If you walk contrary to me..."" (Lev. 26:21) And it's written, ""...then I will walk contrary to you in fury."" (ibid, 28) That is to say, that each and every person is measured by God in the same measure of desire, and in him is the path which is established for him."

Lest there be among you a root whose fruit is gall and wormwood. (Deuteronomy 29:17). Know – for this is clear – that whenever a person has bitter and evil thoughts that challenge his faith, his life is at that very moment being judged, (Similarly, the Arizal writes that if a person suddenly starts crying on Rosh Hashanah or during the Ten Days of Penitence, it is a sign that at that moment, he is being judged before the Heavenly Tribunal.)  or the life of one of his children. Therefore, he must try as hard as he can to annul these evil thoughts and to bind his soul with simple faith to G‑d. He must believe and know that no place devoid of Him, and that G‑d enlivens, creates, directs and judges everything – every single movement and word. He should constantly repent in joy and with a good heart to serve his Creator. Every morning, he should declare that if, G‑d forbid, the Accuser tempts him with a thought opposite G‑d’s will, it will be completely invalidated, for it is completely empty and without substance, like the thoughts and foolishness that the evil inclination puts in the heads of unintelligent people. He should reject them with all of his heart in truth. Otzar HaChayim, Shalach, p. 106a"
29,18,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 29:18:1,"AND HE BLESS HIMSELF IN HIS HEART, SAYING: [‘I SHALL HAVE PEACE’]. When he will hear others imprecating themselves with these oaths, he will in his imagination bless himself, saying in his heart, “I shall have peace from any curse when I follow the desire of my heart.” G-d will not pardon him; instead, His anger will then be kindled against him (Verse 19.)  whenever he sins, in that generation or [when his descendants sin] in later generations. (This is to be understood in the light of Ramban’s explanation above, that the expression whose heart turneth away this day applies to one who has already been beguiled after the idols; or lest there should be among you an evil root refers to the descendants. It is with reference to these two types of idol-worshippers that Ramban says here that G-d’s anger will be kindled when he sins in that generation, or when his descendants sin in future generations (Kur Zahav).)  Or the sense of the verses may be as follows: “Because he says [publicly]: I shall have peace, since in my heart I do not accept the oath upon myself, for I shall walk in the stubborness of my heart all my days and carry out all my desires. And the Eternal will not be willing to pardon him (Verse 19.)  because he did not accept His imprecation; instead, His anger will be kindled against him (Verse 19.)  since he came into the covenant in My presence with all [the people of] Israel.” [Therefore the refusal of an individual to accept the covenant constitutes a punishable defiance.] A desire that grows stronger and more in one’s heart is termed [in Hebrew] shriruth [‘ki bishriruth libi eileich’ — for I shall walk in ‘the stubborness’ of my heart], similar to the expression of the Sages: (Baba Bathra 160b.)  “sharir (strong) and established.” So also, ‘bishrirei’ (in the muscles of) his body. (Job 40:16.) "
29,18,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:18:1,"והתברך בלבבו AND HE BLESS HIMSELF IN HIS HEART — The word והתברך has the meaning of “blessing”. In his heart he will imagine for himself a blessing of peace, saying, “These curses will not come upon me, I shall have peace”."

29,18,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:18:3,"בשררות לבי אלך means IN THE VIEWS OF MY HEART WILL I WALK, שררות being of a root which means to look, to see, as (Numbers 25:17): “I shall see him (אשרנו), but not now”; it is as much as to say, I will follow what my heart sees good to do."

Onkelos, too, rendered it in a similar sense: “in order to add for him the sins of inadvertence to those of premeditation”, which can only mean. “In order that “I” may add sins of inadvertence to those of presumption”."

29,18,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 29:18:1,THIS CURSE. This curse refers to Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image (Deut. 27:15).
29,18,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 29:18:2,"THAT HE BLESS HIMSELF IN HIS HEART. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, of blessed memory, says that he bless himself is to be taken according to its plain meaning. When he hears the curse he will bless himself in his heart and say I shall have peace. In other words, when he hears the ban (The curse.)  he will say it will not fall on me but upon someone else."
29,18,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 29:18:3,"THAT…BE SWEPT AWAY. Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi, who rests in paradise, says that the word sefot (swept away) means to extirpate. Compare, tispeh (Both words come from the root samekh, peh, heh.)  [thou (wilt) sweep away] in Wilt Thou indeed sweep away (Gen. 18:23). In other words, the one who blesses himself (The wicked.)  wants to nullify the words of the righteous, (Moses.)  who are metaphorically called “the watered,” with the words of “the dry.” Look, the righteous are called watered. Compare, For he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water (Jer. 17:8). The wicked are called dry. Compare, For he shall be like a tamarisk in the desert (Ibid., v. 6). The wicked person thinks that the blessing which he utters in his heart will also stop the curse. He explained well were it not that the word ravah (well watered) is an adjective. (As is tzeme’ah (dry). The point is that Rabbi Judah’s interpretation requires that nouns, not adjectives, be employed in our verse, for according to his interpretation the verse speaks of people. Filwarg argues that Rabbi Judah’s interpretation requires a noun because the dry and the watered are metaphors for curses and blessing, which are nouns. He interprets in this manner because later on I.E. himself interprets the dry and the watered as referring to people. The problem with Filwarg’s interpretation is that I.E. quotes Rabbi Judah as saying, “The righteous are called watered…The wicked are called dry.”)  Our text should have read, ravi (A noun.)  et ha-tzama (A noun.)  (the well watered…with the dry). Rabbi Jonah the grammarian (Rabbi Jonah ibn Janach.)  says that it means (The meaning of that he blesses himself in his heart…that the watered are swept away with the dry.)  because the corrupt sees the righteous (The watered.)  destroyed along with the wicked (The dry.)  he therefore thinks evil in his heart. (Rabbi Jonah’s interpretation of that he bless himself in his heart. The wicked person says I might as well be wicked, for both the righteous and the wicked suffer one fate. They are both swept away.)  However, this is incorrect because Scripture reads, I shall have peace. (That he blesses himself in his heart implies that he says something positive to himself. However, there is nothing positive in saying the righteous and I will be swept away.)  In my opinion the word sefot (swept) means to add. Compare, sefot chattat (add sin) (Is. 30:1). The added sin is the wicked person’s statement, I shall have peace even though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart. I will live because of the righteousness of the righteous, for the pious are many and I am an individual sinner. (I.E.’s interpretation of the watered be swept away with the dry. A nation is judged by the majority of its people. The wicked believe that the merit of the majority, who are righteous, will protect the sinners, who are a minority.)  Scripture therefore afterwards reads, The Lord will not be willing to pardon him (Hebrew, selo’ach lo.)  but then… (v. 19). The meaning of the latter is he shall immediately be destroyed. This verse is also proof of my interpretation of and he shall be forgiven (Hebrew, ve-nislach lo. According to I.E. the word salach means to delay punishment. See I.E. on Num. 14:19, “Selach refers to being slow to anger.”)  (Num. 15:28). The meaning of sefot is that the well watered will add to the dry. Scripture compares the righteous to the well watered, as in And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water (Ps. 1:3). It compares the wicked to the dry. Compare, For he shall be like a tamarisk in the desert (Jer. 17: 6). The fact that Scripture at first reads, a root that beareth gall and wormwood (v. 17), is proof of this. (That dry refers to the wicked.)  It is in a dry place. (The root that beareth gall and wormwood grows in parched land. Hence the wicked person is called the dry (Meijler, Krinsky). I.E.’s interpretation presents a problem. He interprets “the watered and the dry” as referring to people. However, earlier I.E. rejects Rabbi Judah Ha-Levi’s interpretation for this very reason. As noted above, Filwarg attempts to justify I.E.’s position. However, his interpretation is forced.) "
29,18,Targum,Onkelos Deuteronomy 29:18,"When he hears the statements of this oath-curse, he will imagine self-blessings [think to himself], saying, ‘‘Peace will be my lot when I shall follow what my thoughts envision,’’ so that the unintentional may be added to the sinful [I will add unintentional sins to the intentional]."

29,18,Jewish Thought,Eight Chapters 3:3,"But, if he who is morally sick be not aware of his illness, imagining that he is well, or, being aware of it, does not seek a remedy, his end will be similar to that of one, who, suffering from bodily ailment, yet continuing to indulge himself, neglects to be cured, and who in consequence surely meets an untimely death. Those who know that they are in a diseased state, but nevertheless yield to their inordinate passions, are described in the truthful Law which quotes their own words, “Though I walk in the stubborness of my heart, in order that the indulgence of the passions may appease the thirst for them.” (Dt. XXIX, 18.)  This means that, intending to quench the thirst, it is, on the contrary, intensifed. He who is ignorant of his illness is spoken of in many places by Solomon, who says, “The way of the fool is straight in his own eyes, but he who hearkeneth unto counsel is wise”. (Prov. XII, 15.)  This means that he who listens to the counsel of the sage is wise, for the sage teaches him the way that is actually right, and not the one that he (the morally ill) erroneously considers to be such. Solomon also says, “There is many a way which seemeth even before a man; but its ends are ways unto death”. (Ibid., XIV, 12.)  Again, in regard to these who are morally ill, in that they do not know what is injurious from that which is beneficial, he says, “The way of the wicked is like darkness; they do not know against what they stumble.” (Ibid., IV, 19. Cf. H. Deot, II, 1, “What is the remedy for those whose souls are diseased? Let them consult the sages who are the physicians of the soul, who will cure their disease by teaching them those characteristics by which they may return to the moral path, and recognize their evil traits. Concerning those who do not seek the sages in order to be cured, Solomon says, ‘wisdom and instruction fools despise’ (Prov. I, 7)”. The conception of a spiritual healing originated neither with Aristotle nor with M. There are many biblical passages based on such a comparison with the healing art, as Jer. III, 22: ארפה משובותיכם; Hos. XIV, 5: ארפא משובתם Ps. XLI, 5: ארפאה נפשי כי חטאתי לך, etc. Rosin, Ethik, p. 78, n. 4, refers to similar passages in Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic literature.)  The art of healing the diseases of the soul will, however, form the subject-matter of the fourth chapter."
29,18,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 29:18:1,"והתברך בלבבו, while accepting the covenant with his lips, he already resolves in his heart to honour it in the breach, comforting himself, thinking שלום יהיה לי כי בשרירות לבי אלך, “I will be alright even though I will do my own thing.” He considers that seeing that he already planned to breach the covenant at the very moment when he accepted it with his lips, the covenant is not binding upon him. "
29,18,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 29:18:2,"The only reason he had mouthed acceptance of the covenant was to become at one and the same time a beneficiary of the overwhelming number of people for whose sake G’d was going to bestow so many blessings on His people. This is the meaning of the words שלום יהיה לי כי בשרירות לבי אלך למען ספות הרוה את הצמאה; he knows full well that the holy community of the Jewish people, his brethren, have attained that status by resisting the lures of the evil urge instead of succumbing to it. This is why they will benefit from G’d’s largesse in such abundant manner. He therefore decided to have the best of both worlds by at least paying lip service to a covenant he knows he will not live by. "

29,18,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 29:18:1","למען ספות הרוה את הצמאה, “thereby adding the watered to the thirsty.” Nachmanides explains this turn of phrase as “adding that which is already satisfied to the list of the ones still unsatisfied,” i.e thirsty. The word רוה describes someone sated as in Jeremiah 31,11 והיתה נפשם כגן רוה, “their soul will be like a watered garden.” When applied to the soul, i.e. essence of a human being, it means that the human being is not aware of his lacking anything, desirous of something that has not been granted to him, hence not in need of G’d as the One Who could supply his non-existing needs. On the other hand, Moses describes any person who feels that some of his needs have not been fulfilled, as צמאה, “thirsting after something.” [Nachmanides qualifies the thirst as including a desire for something that, if granted, would prove harmful to him. Ed.] The person who had felt completely fulfilled is at a disadvantage compared to those who have learned to do without on occasion, as when such a person does feel the need for something, he is so eager to satisfy that need that he feels it a great imposition if the laws of the Torah impose restrictions on the manner in which he can satisfy his “need.” If, as a result of this supposed “need,” he forthwith proceeds to satisfy it without due regard to the Torah’s laws, he will henceforth experience more desires more frequently, in line with the psychological axiom of our sages that when one trains oneself to resist improper impulses one will experience ever fewer of them, whereas when one gives in to them easily, one will progressively experience such impulses becoming more and more powerful and frequent. Eventually, one will even experience a burning desire for things from which one had already weaned oneself. Moses describes this process as בשרירות לבי אלך, “I will follow the dictates of my heart.” The word למען in our context does not introduce a reason or purpose of what the “free-spirited” person is thinking, but means something similar to: “as a result of which such and such will occur.” [In this case a gradual but steady spiritual decline. Ed.]
    Rabbi Yehudah the Spaniard explains the word ספות, as the cutting off of something as in האף תספה, when Avraham asked G’d if He would also cut off the righteous in the process of punishing the Sodomites for their wickedness. (Compare Genesis 18,23) The sinner reasons to himself that he can get away with ignoring, and even make irrelevant the words of the righteous. The righteous, in the scenario painted by Rabbi Yehudah, is the רוה, “watered one”, in our verse. He is compared to the proverbial עץ שתול על מים, “tree planted alongside a steadily flowing well of water”, who, according to our sages is the symbol of the righteous that is unperturbed by the turbulence and poverty surrounding him, as he has the מים חיים, the waters of the living Torah to sustain him come rain or shine. (Compare the simile in Jeremiah 17,8) The wicked person is likened by the prophet to a tree that does not have sound roots and will be dried out by the slightest natural disaster, such as the first month of drought. Moses explains that such people will not experience any help from G’d in withstanding even temporary setbacks, as they have not only given in to the slightest temptation, but considered themselves as smart in riding on the coattails of the righteous expecting to participate in the reward G’d metes out to the vast majority who are Torah-observant.
    The grammarian Rabbi Yonah, also sees in the word ספות a reference to כריתה, being cut off; he attributes the sinner’s attitude to Torah to the fact that he observes in “real” life that both the righteous and the wicked die the same death of the essential life force, the נפש. He reasons that just as the body dies the same death as the animals, so does the spirit.

29,18,Talmud,Sanhedrin 76b:2,"Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: One who marries his daughter to an old man, and one who takes a wife for his minor son, and one who returns a lost item to a gentile are all individuals who are the cause of sin. Marriage to an old man or a minor leaves the woman unsatisfied and is apt to lead to licentiousness. One who returns lost property to gentiles adds to the property that they stole from Jews. With regard to each of them the verse states: “Lest there should be among you a man or a woman…whose heart turns away this day from the Lord…saying: I will have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, that the quenched shall be added to the thirsty. The Lord will not be willing to pardon him” (Deuteronomy 29:17-19)."
29,18,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:18:1-4","והיה בשמעו את דברי האלה הזאת, “it will be when he hears these words of a curse, etc.;” a reference to what we read above in Deut. 27,15: “cursed the man who makes a hewn image, etc.” The person concerned is under the mistaken impression that he will be a beneficiary of the merit accumulated by the many people who do observe the Torah and have forsworn any form of idolatry.   והתברך בלבבו לאמר “and he will bless himself in his heart, saying;"" He will think upon hearing the curses that they will not harm him and actually be turned into blessings. בשרירות לבי אלך, “I will walk as my heart sees fit.” He says to himself that in spite of the fact that he does not accept any part of the Torah which does not appeal to him he will not be punished, seeing that he is only an individual whose actions are not relevant when the vast majority of his fellow Jews are observant and therefore the whole people is deserving of G’d’s bountiful blessing as promised. Seeing that he reasons in such a way, the Torah adds immediately that he is totally wrong. G’d will not forgive him, i.e. turn a blind eye to his conduct; on the contrary, G’d’s wrath will be fuming, etc., against such an individual. The word אז in our verse is understood to mean “immediately,” by Ibn Ezra. It is also possible to understand the words בשרירות לבי as an expression of aggressive obstinacy. This individual deliberately disregards the opinion of the multitude, “doing his own thing” openly. The meaning of the expression is similar to what is known in the Talmud (Gittin 26) as אשרתא דדייני, “a document signed by judges testifying to the fulfillment of conditions in an accompanying document,” i.e. confirmation. The reason the Torah writes למען ספות הרוה את הצמאה, is that the wicked person prides himself with his evil deeds and determines to continue in his evil ways, thereby adding more “thirst” to his whole system which previously was adequately supplied with moisture. He had hoped to become satiated by indulging his cravings for sin. His punishment consists of the fact that instead of deriving satisfaction from his sins, he constantly feels the irrepressible urge to commit more and more sins. Instead of slaking his thirst for whatever it is he wishes to achieve, he will find that he gets ever thirstier. [A form of the principle described by our sages in Avot 4,2 עבירה גוררת עבירה, “one deliberately committed sin brings in its wake another.” Ed.] The desire to sin acts like a roller-coaster; once on that path it is almost impossible to stop and to reverse course.  It is also a well known fact that man’s heart is the “root” of the body. His thoughts are like the branches, his deeds like the fruit of the tree. The Torah has already stated (Genesis 6,5) that “all the thoughts of (wicked people) are centered all day long on doing evil.” Such people will not cease producing bitter fruit (Jeremiah 17,8). Even if all the planning of the wicked people is not translated into deeds, such wicked people are punished for the wicked thoughts they entertain. This is what Solomon referred to when he said (Proverbs 15,13) “a happy heart makes for a cheerful face; a sad heart causes a despondent spirit.” The meaning of the entire verse is that one should not think that mere thoughts have no bearing on one’s personality. If a person has a positive attitude to life, is joyful, or has a negative attitude to life, is despondent, all depends on the kind of thoughts he entertains. In other words, the thoughts have their origin in the heart; when these thoughts are translated into action they have an impact on the body, i.e. the body reveals the nature of the thoughts a person entertains. It follows that the despondent person is in line for punishment even more so when he actually enjoys contemplating the performance of sins.  This is also what the sages (Yuma 29) had in mind when they said that the contemplating of sins is a more serious offense than the actual carrying out of the sin. The sinful thoughts, when carried out, leave their mark on the body of a person, whereas spontaneously committed sins do not leave such marks on the body. This statement, i.e. psychological insight, of the sages is of very great importance. The statement has given rise to many and varied interpretations as I have already mentioned elsewhere where I said that it means that contemplating sins is more serious than committing the actual sin seeing that the contemplating of the sin is what brings about its execution. By contemplating sins on a regular basis, the heart becomes involved in one’s deeds. Seeing that the soul has its home in the heart, such evil thoughts tend to corrupt the soul. [The author clearly feels that the soul, something disembodied, abstract, must be housed in something physical in order to be able to function. One cannot think of the soul as being something detached from the body, independent. Therefore, the part of the body in which the soul is “at home” is of crucial significance. Ed.] Contaminating the soul by entertaining these sinful thoughts is therefore a more serious offense than the actual spontaneous commission of a sin which had not previously had such an impact on one’s soul. Another interpretation of the statement that הרהורי עבירה קשין מעבירה involves often “follow-up” sins. Let us say that a person entertains the thought of breaking into someone’s house. If he is contemplating this sin instead of spontaneously stealing, he most likely weighs what action to take if his plan encounters opposition. He will think of how to deal with the opposition, i.e. possibly decide to kill the person who would frustrate his plan. Thus he already adds further sinful thoughts before even committing the original sin. Should someone ask: “how can the Torah decree penalties for thoughts which have never been carried out? How can the Torah expect a person to be so perfect that the temptation and intention to commit a sin never occurs to him?” Let me explain the essence of the subject. We know that man is in charge (has the choice) of the actions he carries out. This is what the Torah alluded to in Deut. 30, 15-19: “see I have today given into your hand (control) over life and goodness, over death and evil;......you shall choose life.“ Just as man can control his actions, he can also control his thoughts. True, the latter require some preparation, education. We are commanded to entertain constructive thoughts and to avoid thinking potentially destructive, sinful thoughts. G’d gives credit for our entertaining positive constructive thoughts, whereas He punishes us for thinking sinful thoughts.  If, on occasion, one does entertain unworthy thoughts, thoughts which creep up on a person uninvited, such thoughts reflect the fact that the individual in question has not trained himself sufficiently not to entertain unworthy, potentially sinful thoughts. The only cure for this is to concentrate on G’d and what He expects us to do and how He expects us to relate to His universe and our environment. One must relate to such unworthy thoughts with anger at oneself for such thoughts to have occurred to one at all. If one does so, one may rely on the saying of our sages that הבא לטהר מסיין אותו, “when a person makes a genuine effort to purify (himself or others) he receives a divine assist.” (Yuma 38) There are numerous verses in the Bible testifying to the principle that there are divine assists for people trying to do the right thing. One such verse is found In Chronicles I 28,9: ”for the Lord searches all minds and discerns the design of every thought, if you seek Him, He will be available to you.” Another verse in a similar vein is found in Proverbs 21,2: ”G’d probes the (content) of one’s hearts.” Solomon means that when man entertains positive thoughts, G’d will help translate them into reality. Other verses from Scripture which convey similar messages are found in Psalms 10,17, as well as in Chronicles I 29,18. Maimonides explains the statement that the contemplating of commission of sins is קשין, something more severe than the actual commission of the sin, by reference to the fact that the ability to entertain thoughts is one of the major factors elevating man above the beasts. Abusing such a faculty is more serious than committing sins with the body, something we have in common with the animals, i.e. the lower forms of life. Perverting the very distinctive feature given to us by the Almighty by contemplating actions aimed against our Creator, is indeed an unforgivable abuse of the powers granted to us. By turning the dominating element of his personality into a tool to commit sins, the subservient part of man, i.e. his body, will automatically tend to become corrupted thereby. When someone commits a sin using as his instrument a foolish slave, this is not nearly as serious as when one uses a free man to carry out one’s nefarious schemes. This is what Maimonides wrote at the beginning of the second part of his Moreh Nevuchim. [Actually it is found in section 3, chapter 8]  Yet another reason why planning a sin is more serious than the actual commission of it (a thought attributed to Nachmanides by the author in his book Kad Hakemach), is that the author of the statement had in mind the satisfaction one derives from having carried out the sin. The fact that the perpetrator still thinks about the sin as an accomplishment results in his punishment becoming harsher. According to this interpretation no penalty accrues to the contemplation of a sin not carried out. The author, in his volume Kad Hakemach, reasons that seeing that we do not have control of our thoughts, we cannot be held culpable for them. [I am quoting from Rabbi Chavell’s notes, seeing I have neither seen the comment by Nachmanides nor the author’s book Kad Hakemach. Ed.] This is based on the statement of our sages in Kidushin 40 that G‘d does not combine the sinful thought with the actual performance of the evil deed. There is no penalty for the thought. This is also supported by a verse in Psalms 66,18: ”Had I an evil thought in my mind, the Lord would not have listened.” The only exception to this rule is contemplating idolatry. Such thoughts are punishable even if not carried out, as it states in Ezekiel 14,5: “Thus I will hold the House of Israel responsible for their thoughts, because they have all been estranged from Me through their fetishes.”"
29,18,Quoting Commentary,"Redeeming Relevance; Deuteronomy, CHAPTER 4 The Shema and all that Jazz 18","And just as the singular (representing the individual) continues to have a role even as we progress into the plural (representing the community), the same is true in reverse. From the very beginning, we are given an indication that the message of allegiance is not only directed to the individual. In fact, this happens at the very beginning of the first “bookend” with the introductory expression, Shema Yisrael, for here we also go from the individual verb Shema to the collective noun Yisrael. This phrase sets the tone for the entire section; its words speak of a communal listening predicated on its internalization by each individual member (the word shema connotes not just listening but a comprehension and acceptance of that which is heard). For that internalization to happen, each individual must feel that the message is directed specifically to him or her, and that it is not just a general mandate for the Jewish people as a whole. (In Devarim 29:18–19, Moshe specifically addresses the likelihood that some will excuse themselves from following the commandments of the Torah, based on the sense that what really matters to God is the group as a whole, and not the individual.) "
29,18,Quoting Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 32:23:1","Another interpretation of אספה, “I shall consume, etc. In other words, I will deploy all the evils against them; no evil of the evils will be left, but all of them will be deployed against them. This is similar to “I shall deplete my arrows against them” which means that I will throw all My arrows against them. Rashi needed the alternative explanation because according to the first explanation it is difficult, for it should have written אספו from the term “ספו (you join) year on year” (Yeshayah 29:1), and not אספה with a hei, which is from the term “תספה (destroy)” (Bereishis 18:23). And according to the second explanation alone it is also difficult because it is written afterwards, “I shall deplete my arrows against them.” But the arrows have already been included in the [aforementioned] evils! Some ask that earlier in parshas Nitzavim (Devarim 29:18) Rashi explained the phrase ספות הרוה “so that I shall punish him additionally, etc.” but here Rashi explains ספות הרוה as meaning “to join the sated.” One could answer that every addition means adding to something else, and therefore it joins it. Accordingly, “addition” and “join” have the same meaning and are the same concept. Earlier Rashi explained that it is a term meaning “addition” because of its context, since it is not plausible to say “I will join,” for there is no punishment for unintentional sins. So how could it say “I will join punishment to punishment”? Therefore Rashi explained it as “additionally.” But here, there is no mention of unintentional sin, but rather intentional sin, so according to its context he explains it as “joining.” It also appears to me that one could answer that the plain meaning of אספה whenever it appears is “addition.” However, here one cannot explain it to mean “addition,” because that would mean that would imply that Hashem will add greater punishments than what they have sinned, but this is not so. Hashem only punishes according the wickedness the person commits before Him. Therefore Rashi was forced to explain here that it means “joined.” Therefore Rashi brought all of these verses and explained them as meaning “joined” so that at first glance you would not ask regarding his explanation, because he explains that the word “אספה” as “joined/linked” in all the verses that he cites. I explained similarly above on the verse “He armed his trained servants” (Bereishis 14:14). See there. "
29,18,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:18:1","He will imagine blessings of tranquility, etc. Rashi is answering the question: Even if [the person imagines that] no oath-curse will affect him, why should this be considered a blessing if it confers him no benefit, i.e., the great good [that results from a blessing]? Therefore Rashi explains blessings of tranquility, i.e., when there is peace that is a blessing as it is written (Tehillim 29:11), Hashem will bless his people with peace. He will imagine this blessing of tranquility. "
29,18,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:18:2","Because I shall punish him additionally, etc. Rashi is answering the question: The verse I shall follow what my thoughts envision” implies that his sins are intentional; if so, what is the meaning of that the unintentional may be added”? Rashi answers, Because I shall punish him additionally. "
29,18,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:18:3","Now, however, he has provoked me into combining them with the intentionally sinful, etc. With this, Rashi emends a number of things. He explains that the term ספות connotes adding and not destruction as in lest you be swept away (תספה) (Bereishis 19:17). He also alters the verse by saying למען שאוסיף (lit. so that I will add), because ספות is a gerund and could be interpreted as meaning that that transgressor will add. He also adds the word him, because without the word him, we would not understand to whom He is adding. If Rashi had not explained that I shall punish him additionally, one could understand that adding unintentional acts to intentional acts means that the intentional acts will be regarded as unintentional, or vice versa. The explanation of [word so that in the] verse is as follows, that his acts of following what his thoughts envision will be reason for Me to add the punishment for his unintentional sins to the punishment of his intentional sins. "
29,18,Musar,Kav HaYashar 61:12,"This is the meaning of the words, “Seeing that they are beasts, unto themselves.” That is, they should remain by themselves and not be associated with the righteous. And what were the words of these wicked ones that Shlomo was reflecting upon? It was their vain and false hypothesis that the same fate befalls both men and beast. On the basis of this doctrine they concluded that everyone may do as he pleases, since there is in any event no reward for the righteous and no punishment for the wicked, nor, in fact, is their any Judge or justice at all! But may their souls expire, for they are like beasts! They are faithless fools! Woe to them and to their souls! King Shlomo continues, “And who knows if the spirit of man ascends on High and if the spirit of a beast descends below to the earth?” That is to say, “who knows” among these fools who have no knowledge of our holy Torah and the ways of awe! They hold fast to the trait of arrogance “in order to join the quenched [i.e., the unintentional sinner] to the thirsty [i.e., the intentional sinner]” (Devarim 29:18). They should be informed that the “spirit of man” — those who are worthy of being called men, that is, the faithful and innocent servants of Hashem — do indeed ascend On High. They rise to the highest levels where they bask in the supernal light and are bound up in the bond of life. As the traveler explained to Rabbi Chizkiya and Rabbi Yeisa, the word “ascend” [olah] hints that the spirit of the righteous resembles a flawless burnt offering [olah] before the King. On the other hand, the “spirit of a beast” — that is, the souls of the wicked, against which they themselves sin by turning themselves into beasts — descends below to the earth. They descend to the place where their souls will indeed expire. Concerning them it states, “Let them be as chaff before the wind with the angel of Hashem thrusting them away” (Tehillim 35:5)."
29,18,Quoting Commentary,Malbim on Job 2:10:1,"Job rebukes her for this but does not bless God again; nor does he curse Him. (Malbim elaborates, adding that his wife taunted him: 'Look, when you blessed God the first time and thereby showed that you are faithful with Him, He went on to afflict your body too. So if now you bless him again, He will surely go on to afflict your soul until you die, for there is nothing else left by which He can strike you. And so, since you still maintain your sincerity, why are you silent this time and do not bless over the bad. Bless God now too, and die!'')   He asks rhetorically: Besides, can we receive good from God without receiving bad?. At first sight, this appears to be a noble reply and this is how most commentators interpret it. But closer examination shows that in his mind Job was already turning to heresy. This follows from his use of the word 'besides'.  Job believed that in reality good is always touched with bad. Furthermore, from what he subsequently says in the debate, it is clear that he thought that the bad in the world outweighs the good. Consequently, he does not believe God can grant only good. Whoever wants good must also accept an amount of bad. For example, a person, who consumes large quantities of wine and rich foods because he likes their taste, must not complain that it makes him drunk or gives him indigestion. Just the opposite, in exchange for the pleasure it gives him, one who enjoys the taste of wine and good food must be prepared to endure the inevitable and greater discomfort that follows their consumption. The hangover and upset stomach are the price that must be paid for enjoying the food and drink.   Likewise, if we want to receive good from God, namely existence and life, we must of necessity also accept bad; a bad that is greater than the good. So great in fact, that it can be argued that overall what we get in our short lives is principally and mainly bad with just a little good thrown in. When he comes into existence, man is burdened with a host of troubles, worries and uncertainties that crowd his short span. This is the essence of his patrimony.   Thus, Job reveals that in his mind he was already leaning towards the heresy that God's creation of man was to his detriment, for the bad outweighs the good in the world  (The Talmud relates:  For two and a half years, the academies of Shammai and Hillel were in dispute. The former asserting that it were better for man not to have been created than to have been created; the latter maintaining that it is better for man to have been created than not to have been created. They finally took a vote and decided that it were better for man not to have been created than to have been created. But now that he has been created, let him investigate his past deeds; or, as others say, let him examine his future actions (TB Eruvin 13b)) .   To criticize God's motives and to impute that He created man for his own harm is a root from which springs gall and wormwood (Deuteronomy 29:18),  and this is the foundation of all the bitter things that he subsequently expounds in the debate. But since at this point, even though this idea was already in his mind, he only hints at it by his use of the word 'besides', the book relates that despite everything, Job did not sin with his lips.  For he had not yet actually uttered it. Hence, the Talmudic Sages said that though Job did not sin with his lips, he did sin in his heart (TB Baba Batra 16a). "
29,19,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Yitro, Derekh Chayim 30","The other אתם in פרשת נצבים, which was said to the Jewish people after they had just finished listening to Moses issue dire warnings as to what would befall them if they did not observe the Torah, included a warning that someone who observed everybody else being Torah observant should not exploit the merit of the community to protect him from the consequences (Deut. 29,18-19). Moses actually told the Israelites that his very warnings were the factor that would keep them alive as they would be afraid to sin for fear of what would befall them. He explained that though they were descendants of wicked forefathers, they personally had cleaved to G–d, and this is why they had been saved (compare Rashi on Deut 4,4). [Rashi explains elsewhere that the Jews to whom Moses repeatedly referred as obstinate, sinful, etc.,were those who had been redeemed from Egypt and had perished in the desert. This made the second generation צדיקים בני רשעים. The Rashi is not on the above quoted verse. Ed.] Whenever Israel is punished such punishment includes portion of the punishment due for the sin of the golden calf which has not yet been totally expiated. This too is part of the mystical dimension of the transmigration of souls."
29,18,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Isaiah 15:9:3,"for I will place upon Dimon additions Its name is blood, and I will add the blood of the fallen, to fill it. Jonathan renders, however: כְּנִישַׁת מַשַׁירְיָן, the gathering of the camps, the camps joined together.

29,18,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 29:18:2,"L’MA’AN’ (THAT) THE WATERED BE SWEPT AWAY WITH THE THIRSTY. The meaning thereof is “‘to supplement’ the watered with the thirsty,” for the satisfied soul is called ravah (satiated), similar to, And I will ‘satiate the soul’ of the priests with fatness, and My people shall be satisfied with My goodness; (Jeremiah 31:13.)  and their soul shall be as a watered garden, (Ibid., Verse 11.)  while the desiring soul is called tz’meiah (thirsty): My ‘soul thirsteth’ for Thee. (Psalms 63:2.)  Therefore, the sense of the verse is: when into a person’s satisfied soul — one that does not desire harmful things — there comes a slight craving, and he satisfies his lust, then there will grow in his soul a craving even greater than the original one, for the thing that he ate or that he did, and it [the soul] will lust [even] after evil things for which he never craved at first. Thus, if someone craves for lewdness with beautiful women and becomes carried away in unchastity, his lust will ultimately bring him to sodomy and to bestiality and the like with other forms of lust. This is akin to what the Sages have mentioned [with respect to sexual craving]: (Succah 52b.)  “The more one satisfies it, the more it hungers, the more one starves it, the more it is satisfied.” Therefore Scripture states concerning him who follows the stubborness of his heart, that if he will satisfy his soul with those stubborn and overpowering desires for which it thirsts, his soul “will add the watered to the thirsty,” for then he will desire and thirst after things for which he had been satisfied, and with which his soul was satiated [meaning that, up to then, he felt no desire for them]. And, because he used the expression ‘shoresh poreh’ (a root that beareth), (Verse 17.)  he follows this usage, saying that this root shall add a branch that will be satiated and leafy to the thirsty one and they will all become thirsty. Thus the word l’ma’an (that) in this place does not refer to the reason [i.e., “so that”]: “I will go in the stubborness of my heart so that I supplement the watered with the thirsty.” Instead its meaning is like “to add” — Scripture is saying that because of his conduct, this will be the result. (In other words, it is not the sinner who says: “L’ma’an (so that) I supplement the watered etc.” but it is Scripture which declares “L’ma’an etc.” that “to add” the watered etc., will result from his conduct.)  For in every result of a particular action, Scripture uses the term l’ma’an, whether the responsible person does it intentionally to effect that result, as ‘l’ma’an’ (so that) it may be well with us, (Jeremiah 42:6. See my Hebrew commentary p. 478, Note 32, that the reference in the Hebrew text of Ramban is to above, 4:40, but the word l’ma’an is not found there in connection with this expression.)  or whether the person effecting the result does so unintentionally, as in the expressions: ‘l’ma’an’ (that) their heart may melt; (Ezekiel 21:20.)  ‘l’ma’an’ (that) your altars may be laid waste; (Ibid., 6:6.)  Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, ‘l’ma’an’ (that) they may be cut off, (Hosea 8:4. The result referred to in each of the last three verses is involuntary. Here, too, it cannot be said that they made idols of gold and silver “so that” they may be cut off. Rather, Scripture states that the undesired result will be that, in punishment, they will be cut off.)  and many other similar verses. In my opinion this is the best and most correct of all that has been written about this verse from many aspects. It is also possible to explain that the phrase [that the watered …] refers back to the expression a root that beareth gall and wormwood, (Succah 52b.)  the verse stating that he will bless himself in his heart, saying, ‘I shall have peace,’ so that his watered branch, on which grow and sprout the wormwood and gall, should be added to the thirsty one on which nothing has grown. (The difference between the two interpretations is: In the first interpretation “the watered” was not lustful — it was “the thirsty” that was the sinful part of the soul. In the second interpretation, however, the sinful aspect of the soul is “the watered” part, for on it has already grown “the gall and the wormwood;” and “the thirsty” is the pure part of the soul, for nothing evil has yet grown on it. The third explanation which follows is similar to the second with a minor change, as explained in the text (Kur Zahav).)  Or the watered may be a surname for the aforementioned wormwood, meaning that the watered wormwood which sprouts and grows exceedingly will be added to the thirsty which until now has grown but little — so that now both will sprout. Thus the intent is to state that anyone who will hear the imprecation and will imagine himself to be immune against it, holding strongly to [this] stubborness, and, as a result, his thoughts will bring him to [further] sin sprouting transgressions greater than the first [the Eternal will not be willing to pardon him etc.]. (Verse 19.)  This also is a correct interpretation."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

Since the members of far-off nations did not witness God’s greatness, their souls are called dry. They lack the divine experience that is the foundation of faith. By contrast, the souls of the Jewish people, whom God has accompanied and guided for many years, are considered properly watered. Therefore, the Israelites should not have learned from the way of life of those whose souls are dry merely because they passed through those heathen nations. If they do so, it is as though the watered has been added and adjoined to the dry."

29,18,Quoting Commentary,"Chizkuni, Genesis 41:8:2","ותפעם, “it became agitated;” there is a difference in meaning between the words: ותפעם and ותתפעם. The former describes an emotion which cannot be explained as resulting in a definite action by the person so troubled faking his agitation, whereas the reflexive mode ותתפעם, allows for the subject either to take an action as a result of his agitation or to remain passive. The latter is a rule that applies whenever we encounter the use of the reflexive mode. Compare Deuteronomy 29,18: והתברך בלבבו, “he consoles himself by thinking, etc.” There are numerous examples of this. In the case of Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel 2,3, the king was in two minds if to reveal the content of what he dreamt, fearing that if he did so, the soothsayers would exploit this to offer each his own interpretation so that he would be forced to choose which to accept without knowing which interpretation to accept. He therefore decided to act as if he had forgotten the content of the dream. Whichever of the soothsayers would both tell him what he had dreamt, and what it meant would surely have offered the correct interpretation. That interpreter must have been inspired by G-d Himself. Whatever that interpreter foresaw would happen as a result of having heard my dream, would surely occur in reality. Pharaoh, on the other hand, who revealed to all what he had dreamt, acted very foolishly, except that he did not threaten to kill the ones who interpreted his dream incorrectly, as did Nebuchadnezzar."

[He denied G-d’s supervision of individuals who are sinful, as otherwise the community would be made to pay for the sins of each individual. We can perhaps understand this logic as the deluge swept away everyone and they could not all have been equally guilty. He also distinguishes between sins that are due to the evil urge, such as indulging in forbidden but tasty food, and others such as not wearing garments with a mixture of wool and linen, which did not require him to resist temptation. Ed.] An alternate interpretation of the line: למען ספות הרוה את הצמאה; he cannot wait until violation of Torah laws becomes popular, so that he may indulge in it openly rather than secretly and make an outcast of himself. In the meantime he has to suffer like a plant suffers that is not irrigated. He may even have restrained himself from sinning although harbouring a fervent desire to do so as he is afraid of being caught and convicted. The Torah appears to compare the righteous to the well watered plant, and the sinner or potential sinner, to the plant that thirsts for water. (Compare Yehudah Halevi quoted by Ibn Ezra)"
29,18,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 98:1:6,"This reasoning is based on Kohelet 10,17. ""hail to the country whose king is truly free,"" meaning that the king is obedient to the Torah's commandments, and humbles himself before G'd, as is explicitly required of him. (Deut. 17,18-19) ""When he sits on the throne, he must write for himself a copy of the Torah, which shall reside with him, and in which he shall read throughout his lifetime in order to revere the Lord His G'd, to keep all the commandments of this Torah and all its statutes to carry them out, so that his heart shall not become haughty above his brethren and so that he will not depart from the commandments of this Torah either to the right or to the left; in order that his reign should be long; both his and that of his sons."" In other words, the Torah tells us that the king is truly free when he does not give in to the temptation to amass women, money and horses. His freedom is due to his attitude towards his Master (G'd) being similar to the attitude of his subjects towards him. We find throughout the Bible that ministers are referred to as ""servants of the king."" The more dedicated to the service of the king, the more truly free is the minister in question. For this reason, alternate descriptions of such ministers are chorey Yehudah, ""the freemen of Yehudah."" (compare Jeremiah 27,20) This is also the meaning of Psalms 116,16, ""G'd, when I am Your servant, I Your servant, the son of Your handmaid, then You have truly loosened my bonds."" David says that his bonds have been loosened by his having become G'ds servant. The Jewish nation's stature as a princess amongst the nations of the world, flows directly from its subservience to its G'd. (Deut. 26, 17-18) ""You have acknowledged G'd this day...and the Lord in turn has acknowledged you."" Our greatness is due to our having enthroned G'd as our Sovereign. There are four areas in which subservience to G'd has to express itself. 1) Since everyone has a tendency to want to be his own master, irrespective of the benevolence of any authority he may find himself under, the Torah states that ""you have expressed the wish that the Lord be with you."" (26,17) 2) Man does not like to be thought of as a carbon copy of someone else, nor to imitate someone else, robot like. He feels that by doing that he deprives himself of all originality and that he will never be thought of as an independent individual. Man desires to receive credit for action stemming from his own initiative. The book of Kohelet is full of emphasis of the originality of its author's thinking. ""I thought,"" ""I did,"" I concluded"" etc. The desire to ""do one's own thing,"" is so natural that already the Torah refers to it. (Deut 29,18) ""For in the autonomy of my heart I will walk."" When these tendencies are given up voluntarily by our following the ways of the Lord, (26,17) this is a further expression of the true freedom found in disciplining oneself by recognising the superior wisdom of the Lord. It is not our task to boast about our own way of life, but we are to pursue a way of life in accordance with G'ds instructions. When we read in Genesis 18,18, about Abraham commanding his descendants to perform acts of righteousness, this transforms what would otherwise have been a spontaneous act, an impulsive gesture, into a way of life that serves as a model for the Jew. Denying oneself pork should not stem from a distaste for the product, but should be rooted in G'ds injunction. (Torat Kohanim 9, Parshat Kedoshim) Similarly, in the confession we recite when we offer the tithes for the poor, (Deut 26,14) we emphasize ""I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my G'd, and have done all You have commanded me."" 3) It is natural for man not to accept suggestions, instructions etc., when these suggestions do not make sense to him. A classic example is that of Yoav, David's commander-in-chief, who was ordered to conduct a headcount of men eligible for army service. He reacted by demanding a reason for this order, (seeing it was contrary to Torah law) Yoav never carried out the full task, and was involved in what must be considered intentional inaccuracies, (compare different results given in Samuel II chapter 24 and Chronicles I chapter 21) Yoav also failed to count the tribes of Levi and Benjamin. Presumably, lack of adequate performance stemmed from lack of interest in a task that seemed senseless and even counterproductive in Yoav's eyes. When the Torah demands obedience also to statutes that defy our understanding, it says ""and to observe His statutes, commandments and social laws,"" to emphasize that it is the source of the instructions that matter, not their content. 4) Lastly, there are things which run counter to human instinct, and which if performed are seen as inviting hazards to one's health or one's property. A case in point, is the outrage expressed by Navot, when king Achav wants him to trade his ancestral vineyard. In all such situations, the Torah stresses ""and listen to His voice,"" meaning that even when the instructions are completely contrary to our instincts, our freedom expresses itself when we discipline ourselves to listen to G'ds wishes. In these four ways we crown G'd as king over ourselves. But, more than anything, in this way G'd crowns us as king over the remainder of the nations. ""To place you supreme over all the nations."" (26,17) This latter promise goes beyond the one when Israel became the Lord's ""precious nation and holy people"" at Mount Sinai. The part of the verse saying ""to walk in His ways and to observe His statutes,"" is part of the covenant in return for which Israel was promised to be the highest ranking nation. This makes the Jewish people custodian of ""the way of the Lord,,"" something not entrusted to anyone else. In Psalms 147,19, G'd is described as ""He reveals His words to Jacob, His statutes and social laws to Israel,...He has not done so to any other nation."" David described the nature of the mutual covenant there. "

29,18,Quoting Commentary,"Bekhor Shor, Deuteronomy 29:16:2","""of gold and silver that are with them"" When they make an image of silver and gold, after they serve it for one or two years they say: This isn't working at all, I will make another. And they break it and grind it, and there is ""silver and gold that are with it"", since it's expensive. And one could explain: that it itself is gold or silver, there they are with it and beside it, since they are afraid of it being stolen, since it can't guard itself even from mice. And you will see that they serve this and leave it, and serve another, and they have no authority over them, rather whoever wants worships and whoever wants leaves, everyone according to the desires of their heart. And they cleave to theft and robbery, promiscuity and incest, all that their hearts desire they do. And this is something in the heart of a person to do ""the stubbornness of their heart"" (ref to Devarim 29:18). And therefore you need to accept all of you the covenant, the curses and the oaths, that you will stand by the tradition of the covenant."
29,18,Chasidut,"Ba'al Shem Tov, Noach 137:1","A person’s many sins cause him to become far from the service of G-d. Because in his lowliness, he does not believe that his prayers and Torah study draw Divine blessing into all the worlds, and that even the angels are nourished by his Torah and prayer. For if he believed this, he would serve G-d in joy and fear, and would be careful to say each letter and word properly. He would remember what it says: “When you lie between the sheepfolds (sefasoyim)” (Psalms 68:14) – that G-d watches a man’s lips (sefasayim), to kiss them when he says words of Torah and prayer in reverence and love. Who would not be filled with fear and dread upon realizing that the great and awesome King watches the lips of a man who is “despised and forsaken of men” (Isaiah 53:3)? This reflects our Sages’ statement: “The humility of Rabbi Zechariah caused the destruction of the Temple.” (Gitten 56a.)  For a person should remember that he is a “ladder standing upon the earth, with his head reaching heaven” (Genesis 28:12), and that his every gesture, word, step and action makes its mark high above. Then, he will certainly be careful that all of his deeds are for the sake of G-d. This is not the case when a person thinks, “Am I really significant enough to damage or repair what is above and below. Are all of my deeds really recorded above?” This person will feel unaccountable for his deeds, saying “I will have peace” (Deuteronomy 29:18). But this is not true. Because through a person’s good deeds, he actually clings to G-d, as it is written: “And you shall go in His ways” (ibid. 29:9). By being compassionate below, he arouses the attribute of compassion in all the worlds above. This is as I wrote on the phrase: “Know what is above from you.” (Pirkei Avos 2:1.)  That is, from you yourself, from the different emotions that you feel, know that that is what is above you. Toldos Yaakov Yosef, p. 181c-d"

29,19,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:19:1,"יעשן אף ה׳ THE ANGER OF THE LORD SHALL SMOKE [AGAINST THAT MAN] — Through anger the body becomes heated and smoke, as it were, issues from the nostrils. And thus does it state, (Psalms 18:9) “Smoke rose up in his nostril”. Although this idea is not really applicable to God, Scripture makes the human ear hear the matter (i.e. it tells it to him) in the manner that it is accustomed and able to understand according to the ordinary course of the world (i.e. when speaking of God it uses language that properly is applicable only to human beings because this the only language we have at our command)."

Observe, if the sinner be an individual he will die immediately, and if it is a family all the curse…shall lie upon him. This means that the curse shall lie upon the family until its name is eradicated. If the sinner be a tribe, the Lord shall separate him unto evil (v. 20). (Thus The anger of the Lord…shall be kindled against that man refers to an individual; and all the curse…shall lie upon him refers to a family; and the Lord shall separate him unto evil refers to a tribe.)  Similarly And I will offer it up for a burnt-offering (Jud. 11:31), as I have explained. (We no longer have I.E.’s commentary on Judges. However, Radak in his comments on Judges notes that the vav there has the meaning of or. It appears that I.E. interpreted similarly.) "

29,19,Chasidut,"Kedushat Levi, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 3","In that book this matter is illustrated by means of a parable. ‎When a very wise man asks someone a question about something ‎that is beyond his field of expertise, and he ignores the advice ‎given by proceeding to follow his own intuition, and it turns out ‎that he was wrong, this “wise man,” will no doubt feel deeply ‎ashamed for not having followed the sage counsel he had ‎received. At the time when G’d was occupied with creating the ‎universe and all that it contains, He had consulted with the ‎angels about the advisability of creating the human species, i.e. a ‎species who was granted free will in determining if to obey the ‎Creator’s directives. (Compare Bereshit Rabbah 8,5). At that ‎time, G’d following His preponderant attribute of mercy, had ‎decided to ignore the advice given to Him by the angels who had ‎foreseen all of the imperfections of the human species and the ‎‎“heartache” this would cause the Creator so that they had advised ‎against this species being created. Now that unfortunately the ‎advice of the angels had proven far sighted, the Creator felt ‎עלוב‎. ‎‎[King Achav, though a nationalist, and repeatedly willing ‎to give up his own life in order to protect his people, had ‎nonetheless committed a foul judicial murder by framing the ‎owner of an ancestral vineyard as being guilty of a crime that ‎Navot, the owner of that vineyard had not committed. His only ‎‎“crime” had been his refusal to sell to the King. The verse cited ‎from Kings I 22,19 is the prelude to G’d sitting in judgment of ‎Achav for his crime. Ed.] Incidentally, the parable from the sefer Rezie’l also ‎accounts for an anomaly in psalms 81,5 ‎כי חק לישראל הוא ומשפט ‏לאלוקי יעקב‎, “for it is a statute (immutable) for Israel and a ruling ‎‎(depending on circumstances) by the G’d of Yaakov” (compare ‎‎Rosh Hashanah 8) in that verse. The psalmist could have ‎been expected to write: ‎כי משפט לאלוקי יעקב הוא וחק לישראל‎. The ‎Talmud there explains the wording in that verse as meaning that ‎the first day of Tishrey serves as a date on which all ‎mankind is judged in heaven provided that Israel will be the first ‎nation to be so judged. For the Israelites who are basically ‎observing G’d’s laws and are therefore a holy nation, the meaning ‎of the word ‎חוק‎ is that their livelihood for the following year is ‎determined on that day as the sages taught in Beytzah 16‎‏ ‏‎ ‎‎(Compare Proverbs 30, 8 ‎הטריפני לחם חוקי‎, “feed me with the bread ‎allotted to me.” Or: Leviticus 10,13 ‎חוקך וחוק בניך היא מאשי ה'‏‎, “it is ‎your portion from the Lord’s fire-offerings and that of your ‎children.”) [The verse just quoted, addressing the priests, ‎begins with the words: ‎ואכלתם אותה במקום קדוש‎, “you are to ‎consume it in a sacred location.”] This leaves open the ‎possibility that in our verse in psalms the word might mean ‎‎“statute,” or something similar. How do we know that in psalms ‎too it means the same as in the verses we quote from Leviticus ‎and Proverbs, i.e. that it refers to parnassah, livelihood? The ‎unusual sequence of ‎חוק לישראל משפט לאלוקי יעקב‎ provides us ‎with the answer to this question.‎ The subject concerning which Israel is to be judged on New ‎Year’s day is their livelihood. The psalmist rejoices in the fact that ‎these decisions are not made by Israel’s detractors but are the ‎exclusive domain of ‎אלוקי יעקב‎. According to the Zohar, as ‎soon as our enemies understand this, they cease to demonize us.‎ The appropriate translation of the verse in psalms 81,5 ‎therefore is: “if our enemies, (be they celestial beings who ‎opposed the creation of mankind altogether, or just our perennial ‎opponents the forces of Amalek (in whatever guise they appear) ‎want to sit in judgment of Israel, ‎משפט לישראל‎, they are advised ‎by the psalmist Assaph that our ‎חוק‎, livelihood, is decided by the ‎G’d of Yaakov, ‎לאלוקי יעקב‎, no one else. As a result of this, our ‎detractors are seized with ‎חיל ורעדה יאחזון‎ they (our adversaries) ‎are seized with fright and trembling for (Deut. 29,19) G’d’s anger ‎would be aroused against them etc.; this is also what Job spoke ‎about in Job 15,15 when he stated that even His heavenly ‎entourage did not find favour in His eyes. ‎"

Moses actually told the Israelites that his very warnings were the factor that would keep them alive as they would be afraid to sin for fear of what would befall them. He explained that though they were descendants of wicked forefathers, they personally had cleaved to G–d, and this is why they had been saved (compare Rashi on Deut 4,4). [Rashi explains elsewhere that the Jews to whom Moses repeatedly referred as obstinate, sinful, etc.,were those who had been redeemed from Egypt and had perished in the desert.

29,19,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 20:9:1,"FOR WHATSOEVER MAN THERE BE THAT CURSETH HIS FATHER OR HIS MOTHER. The meaning thereof is that it refers back to the beginning of the section where He stated, Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, (Above, 19:3.)  and He now states here, for whatsoever man there be that does not obey [this commandment] and curseth his father, or his mother, he shall surely be put to death, and by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], this verse is here stated because He had said [above], Sanctify yourselves therefore, and by ye holy; for I am the Eternal your G-d, (Verse 7.)  and I am the Eternal Who sanctify you, (Verse 8.)  meaning that it is the Glorious Name (Deuteronomy 28:58.)  Who sanctifies us, for He is our Father, and our Redeemer from everlasting, (Isaiah 63:16.)  and it is His Name; therefore he who curses those who participated in his formation, is liable to death. This is the reason for the law [of the punishment] of the adulterer and adulteress, [in the following verse], which He placed near here before [the law of] all forbidden relations [mentioned further on in this section]. (Ramban’s meaning, as clearly indicated by his commentary (see following note) is that as a result of committing adultery the children of the union may come to transgress the laws relating to parental honor, as they will not know who their fathers are. It is for this reason that the law of the adulterer and adulteress is identical to that of one who curses his parents [who is liable to death by the hand of the court], as the one leads to the other, and therefore too, it is mentioned in juxtaposition to that law.)  I have already alluded to this above. (Exodus 20:13 (Vol. II, p. 320).)  Now Scripture mentions here some of the forbidden relations in order to make [one who has intercourse with them] liable to death, these being a man’s wife, (Verse 10.)  a father’s wife, (Verse 11.)  a daughter-in-law, (Verse 12.)  a male, (Verse 13.)  a woman and her mother, (Verse 14.)  and the same law applies to a woman and her daughter and her daughter’s daughter, for He mentioned here only some of the relations of a wife, but the same punishment applies to all those mentioned there (Above, 18:17.)  in the admonition. And surely this applies all the more so to one’s own relatives, such as his son’s daughter and his daughter’s daughter mentioned there, (Ibid., Verse 10.)  and needless to say, his [own] daughter. On all these matters there are also Rabbinical interpretations to establish their punishment. Similarly He mentioned here the punishment of death for lying with a beast. (Verse 15.)  He mentioned excision again in the case of a menstruant (Verse 18.)  [although this has already been included in a general statement above, 18:29], in order to declare him liable for mere sexual contact without completion of the act, this being the sense of the expression, he hath bared her fountain. (Verse 18.)  Similarly [He has stated] in the case of a mother’s sister and a father’s sister, for he hath bared his near kin. (Verse 19.)  He mentioned an uncle’s wife (Verse 20.)  and also a brother’s wife, (Verse 21.)  in order to declare them liable to [the punishment of] dying childless, whether he had no children at the time when he commits the sin, or he did have [in which case none will survive him]. But the excision mentioned in the case of one’s sister (Verse 17.)  is redundant [being included in the general statement above, 18:29], and has therefore been interpreted by our Rabbis: (Makkoth 13 b.)  “Why was excision specified in the case of a sister etc.” In line with the plain meaning of Scripture [excision was specified in the case of a sister] in order that Scripture should add [that it will be done] in the sight of the children of their people, (Verse 17.)  meaning to state that their soul will perish in youth (Job 36:14.)  in such a way that people will see, understand and realize that the hand of the Eternal hath done this, (Isaiah 41:20.)  and that the Holy One of Israel has decreed it. The meaning of the expression he shall bear his iniquity, (Verse 17.)  is that this sin will cleave to him from that time onwards, his deeds will not prosper, and the curse shall lie upon him, (See Deuteronomy 29:19.)  for G-d will strike him with sore sicknesses until He will destroy him with excision, something similar to what the Rabbis have said: (Shabbath 37 a.)  “A sign of [this type of] sin is one affected with dropsy.” It was not necessary for Scripture to mention the other people who are liable to excision, such as one’s mother (Above, 18:7.)  and a wife’s sister, (Ibid., Verse 18.)  because all that is needed to be stated about them we have already derived from those mentioned [here in this section]."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

29,19,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 76:1:7,"(1) We have to understand this whole story as a continuation of the previously reported incident, in which G'd had criticised Moses openly for having appeared to doubt His ability to supply the people with large quantities of meat. Under the circumstances, Miriam and Aaron also found reason to criticise Moses. They believed that Moses, having married a woman belonging to another nation, had now become ashamed of this, and that this was the reason he had separated from her. They were convinced that his status as a prophet had nothing to do with this separation, since they too were prophets, and this did not interfere with their family life. If Moses were to use the argument of his being a prophet, they considered that this would be showing off his piety. This was their second sin, in fact. G'd heard all this, and decided to reprimand them more severely than He would have done, had their criticism been more factual, and if they had not chosen a point in time when they believed Moses to be out of favour with G'd. First of all, by testifying to Moses' humility, the Torah squelches the thought that he could have been showing off his piety. Secondly, it states that the separation had nothing to do with Moses having developed a dislike for his wife. Matters which would be considered private by other couples who conduct their sex life in the confines of their bedrooms, would assume a quasi public character in the case of Moses, since he had to be available for communication from G'd on a seven day, twenty four hour basis. He could therefore not afford to be found tamey, ritually impure due to the emission of seminal fluid at any moment. Even the brief space of time it would require to immerse himself in a ritual bath, would mean that he would keep G'd waiting, on occasion. Because Miriam and Aaron did not appreciate the different level of Moses' prophetic powers and stature, they had arrived at an opposite conclusion regarding Moses' motivation. By addressing them suddenly, G'd wanted to demonstrate to Miriam and Aaron that whereas they had not been tuned in to this communication and had been totally unprepared for it, their brother was perfectly at ease, comfortable with this ""sudden"" communication. Miriam and Aaron were forced to remain outside the tabernacle, whereas Moses was inside it. Only through Moses being in the presence of the shechinah, did they receive any communication at all. (2) G'd then proceeded to outline the qualitative difference between Moses' prophetic powers, and those of Miriam and Aaron respectively. Im yihye nevi-achem, ""if he were a prophet according to your definition of the term,"" G'd would speak to him in a dream or through a reflection. (verses 6-8) Other prophets receive their communications in one of four ways. A) In a dream. B) Through a reflected image, while remaining awake but in a state of trembling. C) In a parable, through a riddle, by means of an angel. D) After having prepared themselves spiritually to a state necessary to receive a communication. In chapter seven of his sefer hamada, Maimonides has elaborated on the Talmudic statement in Yevamot 49, explaining that the prophecy of Moses was in the nature of a ""clear vision,"" whereas all other prophets received only ""clouded visions."" Our Parshah explains some of the aspects of prophecy discussed by Maimonides, as well as others not dealt with in his sefer hamada. Mar-ah, is the mirror which is the means by which the prophet receives his message while awake or asleep. There are four basic deficiencies when one receives a communication by means of a mirror. They leave the recipient unable to comprehend the message in its entirety. 1) The viewer sees only what is immediately opposite him, anything behind a curtain, for instance, would not be seen, since only the curtain itself is reflected by the mirror. In this way, prophets receive an external view of things, without comprehending its substance. Abraham's belief that Isaac was to be sacrificed is an example of this. Although it appeared as if G'd had changed His mind, lack of comprehension of the true nature of G'ds command, only affected the viewer. Similarly, Samuel erred thinking G'd had wanted him to appoint Yishai's eldest son, until G'd told him not to be guided by the ""exterior."" i.e. mar-eyhoo. Even at the beginning of his career, he had mistaken the call of Eli, the High Priest, his mentor, no less than three times. (Samuel I chapter 3) This kind of communication is described by Solomon in his Song of Songs as ""behold, He was standing behind our wall, observing through the windows, peering through the lattices."" (chapter 2,9) Concerning all this, G'd says ""not so My servant Moses; he is at home in any part of My house."" The second deficiciency when perceiving by means of a mirror, is that all communication is only visual; the viewer cannot hear anything that may be spoken by the figure appearing in the mirror. Consequently, understanding is liable to be fragmentary, the whole picture is not communicated. Gestures may be observed, but no sound is audible. Zacharyah 4, and Daniel 10, are examples of the inadequacy to the prophet of this kind of revelation, unless there is further assistance. Concerning this flaw which other prophets have to put up with when they receive G'ds communications, G'd says about Moses ""I speak to him mouth to mouth."" His ears, not only his eyes are part of his prophetic visions. The third disadvantage in perceiving by means of a mirror, is that one does not behold the actual form or shape of the object shown, but only its two dimensional reproduction, i.e. reflection. This is like making the recipient of the vision guess at the real essence of something. It is as if asking him to piece together parts of a puzzle, chidot. Mar-eh, spelled with the vowel segal, means a true image, not the reflected one. Moses receives mar-eh, not mar-ah. The fourth disadvantage of viewing by means of a mirror is that whoever wants to view things in a mirror, must first assume a position opposite, directly in front of the mirror. Whatever is seen however, appears inverted. What is right in reality and parallel to the viewer, appears as on the left of the viewer. The viewer must employ his brain to compensate for the distortion inherent in viewing things in a mirror. Moses, on the other hand, sees temunat hashem, the true image, not something distorted in a mirror. After G'd had outlined to Miriam and Aaron how different Moses' level of prophetic perceptions was from theirs, He challenges them ""why have you not had enough reverence for him to talk about My servant etc."" i.e. ""about ME?"" Here G'd makes the point that Moses is indeed the spiritual father of all prophets, and as such, a special reverence is required in our attitude towards him. When the Mishnah Avot 4, 15, says ""may the reverence for your teacher equal the reverence for Heaven,"" our Parshah is its source. The sin of Miriam and Aaron was twofold, since in making derogatory remarks about Moses, they had actually criticised G'd by implication. Moses was G'ds chosen instrument, after all. Secondly, Moses' character was so perfect, that they had no right to impute base motives to any of his actions. When G'd had finished explaining to Miriam and Aaron how they had erred, He withdrew, and Miriam was struck by the skin disease, since it had only been she who had actually done the talking. Aaron had been included in the accusation, since by remaining a silent listener, he had become an accessory to the travesty committed. Proof that Aaron had kept silent, is the fact that the Torah does not say ""Miriam and Aaron spoke,"" using the plural form, or the masculine form, which would have included Aaron. (3) The plea ""do not lay sin upon us,"" means ""since we have already admitted our guilt, do not reprimand us any further for this sin, but pray for us."" In answer to Moses' prayer to heal Miriam of her affliction, G'd says ""since even Aaron had not suggested that she go completely free, only that she should not die, her punishment would be temporary banishment. Her sin being also against her father in Heaven, said father would ban her from His presence temporarily."" (4) The fact that the people did not continue their journey during Miriam's quarantine, was not an unmixed blessing for her. Though it reflected the fact that they held Miriam in high esteem, it was also the surest way of publicising what had happened to her, since the delay in travelling would lead to questions concerning the reason for the delay. All of this would result in increased respect for Moses and his prophetic powers. The Parshah teaches the lesson that one must be exceedingly careful when criticising one's leaders. Solomon, in Proverbs 18,12-14, summarizes the lesson to be learned from this Parshah. Moses, who enjoyed tremendous prestige and honour was exemplified by his humility, whereas Miriam the greatest prophetess, had let her pride cause her to slander her brother. The principal error to be avoided when criticising one's leaders, is not to apply one's own low standards of conduct to those of one's leaders. "
29,20,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:20:1,"הכתובה בספר התורה הזה — Above, however, (Deuteronomy 28:61) it says: And every sickness and every plague … [which is not written] הזאת) בספר התורה הזאת the feminine form, whilst here we have הזה, the masculine)?! But the explanation is: הזאת, the feminine form, refers to the feminine word התורה, whilst הזה, the masculine form, refers to the masculine word הספר in our text. Through the division into clauses by means of the tonic accents (which serve also as marks of interpunctuation) they (the two phrases) are shown to be two different expressions: in the chapter containing the curses (ch. Deuteronomy 28:61) the Tipcha (a disjunctive accent) is placed beneath the word בספר, and the words התורה הזאת are connected one with the other, therefore it says הזאת, the feminine form, (since it has to be connected with a feminine noun), whilst here the Tipcha is placed beneath the word התורה, and consequently the words ספר התורה are connected one with the other (i.e. they form one phrase), — therefore it is a masculine word that is applicable after it, because the term (the pronoun) refers to הספר (which is masculine)."

It is intended to inform us that they were all equal [in righteousness]. How then shall we explain the first part of the above-mentioned passage? It is intended to teach that he (Reuben) deranged his father's bed, and the Scriptures charge him as if he had been lying with Bilhah."" We are taught that R. Simon h.

29,20,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:20:2,"In this instance, a unique instance, the Torah threatens that in spite of the sacred origin of his soul, it will be utterly blotted out in retribution for the devious plan to be parasites and to benefit from the blessings granted to the Torah-observant majority while at the same time violating all the commandments."
29,20,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:20:3,"והבדילו ה׳ לרעה, ""And G'd will single him out for misfortune, etc,"" This seems a paradox. After the soul of the person has already been blotted out, how can G'd separate it from other souls? We may have to understand this in connection with Isaiah 60 that all the Jewish souls originate in the same place as we have been told by Vayikra Rabbah 4,6 on Genesis 46,26 where all the 70 souls of the family of Jacob are described as כל הנפש, ""the whole soul"" (singular), as opposed to the souls of Esau which are described in the plural (Genesis 36). When the Torah writes that ""G'd will blot out his name from under the heaven, this means that G'd will not take action against this man and consign him to the forces of the קליפה which is here called רעה, ""evil,"" until He has separated his soul. This ""separation"" implies certain restrictions G'd imposes on the forces of the קליפה concerning the soul of this person. G'd makes it a point to always set some limits on the forces of destruction though He Himself allocated to these forces the parameters within which they may operate. We have quoted an example of such restrictions placed on the forces of destruction when Rava's father warned his son not to sleep in his bed in order not to be killed by these forces ( Taanit 24)."
29,20,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:20:4,"מכל שבטי ישראל, from all the tribes of Israel.

29,20,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:20:5,"Alternatively, the word והבדילו may mean that after G'd has wiped out the name of this person, i.e. his soul, from under the heaven, He will transfer it to a spiritual region reserved for destroying such souls. ככל האלות, ""like all the curses, etc."" this means that the רעה, ""evil"" in store for this soul will include all the curses mentioned in the Torah thus far."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

See there. For according to the one that holds, ""And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the Torah of God"" (Joshua 24:26), is about the [Torah's last] eight verses, from ""And Moses died"" (Deuteronomy 34:5) - if so, the death of the righteous like Moses, which protects the generation is written in the book of the Torah, but not in the Torah itself. For there is no Torah after the death of Moshe, as it stated (Malachi 3:22), ""Remember the Torah of Moshe."" And this is one of the thirteen principles [of faith]."
29,20,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 29:20,"If those with idolatrous thoughts are not merely individuals, but an entire family or an even larger group, they will be punished accordingly.

29,20,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 29:20:1","והבדילו, “and the Lord shall separate him, etc;” his punishment will correspond to the principle of the punishment matching the sin.

29,20,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 29:20:2","לרעה, “for evil;” this had to be spelled out as G-d also singles out people “for good,” when the occasion justifies this.

29,21,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:21:1,"ואמר הדור האחרון..וראו את מכת הארץ, ""The later generation will say,…when they see the destruction and the conflagration, etc."" Clearly, the Torah envisages that such punishment will not be something isolated. Why does the Torah mention the reaction by a later generation viewing the destruction of the Holy Land before mentioning the fact that they have seen it? The Torah should have written: ""the later generation will see what destruction happened to this country and they will ask what caused it."" Besides, the word ואמר is totally superfluous here seeing the Torah repeats in verse 23 that ""they will say"" i.e. all the other nations who came face to face with the destruction in the Holy Land. Furthermore, why did the Torah begin the verse in the singular, i.e. ואמר, only to switch to the plural, i.e. ואמרו כל הגוים, ""and all the nations will say?"""

This distinction is, however, not always adhered to: so here החלִי, the apocopated form of החלִיא, instead of החלׇה the root being חלה.) ;ל״א comp. תחלואיה אשר חלה the sicknesses which the Lord hath laid upon it (Deut. 29:21). God was pleased to bruise him, to chastise him with exile. "
29,21,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:21:2,"I believe the best approach to understanding the sequence in our verse is as follows: ""the later generation will say, etc."" who is this later generation? Your children. The Torah had to spell this out seeing that other nations also have later generations. The Torah adds that not only your own children will raise this question, but even the Gentile who lives nearby and the nations who come from afar.  וראו When all these nations from near and far will observe how this land has been devastated, they (too) will say: ""what has caused this destruction?"" It is taken for granted that your children who live in the land did not have to come and see the destruction. This is why the Torah could commence with describing only their reaction. The reason the Torah speaks of כל הגוים, ""all the nations,"" is that those who have seen the desolation in the Holy Land will tell all those who have not seen it with their own eyes."
29,21,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 29:21:3,"The desolation described in this verse refers to the people of whom the Torah spoke in verse 17, the ones who decided to become idolators. The curses which had been mentioned immediately prior to this verse referred to the individual who tried to outsmart the Torah by hedging his acceptance of the oath of the covenant prior to affirming it with his mouth. The warning that G'd would erase that man's name applied only to the individual described in verse 18. Exile and desolation of the land of Israel are the result of idolatry."
29,26,Halakhah,"Shev Shmateta, Introduction 26","(Alef) The Psalmist said in Ps. 50:18, 20, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers. You are busy maligning your brother, defaming the son of your mother.” It appears to me [that this can be explained] according to that which is written in Netsach Israel, chapter 25: (Maharal, Netsach Yisrael, pp. 126-127 in London edition.)  We were asked, “How is it that Israelites are constantly yearning to [do] bad, etc.? As he seeks evil for the one who is his compatriot in Torah and in the commandments. And [yet] the Torah states (Lev. 19:18), ‘and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” And I answered him, etc. However this trait is not in Israel from the angle of ‘an evil soul desires evil.’ As from the angle of their essence, this holy people is deserving of all the importance and status, etc. And the one who is important based on his own nature will [naturally] seek status (and this is what causes the Jews to hurt each other). As you will not find a villager jealous of a great minister, but rather a sage of another sage, a wealthy man of a wealthy man and a strong man of a strong man, etc.  Rather this thing comes from [their appropriate] sense of importance. And the proof to this is that it is perfectly obvious that when one of them is in distress, all of them step forward like ‘a brother for adversity.’ And that is because Israel is one nation, etc. And it is not like the traits of licentiousness, etc., as that thing would show great lowliness, etc. And they are stiff-necked from repenting, etc. Because they are far from physicality, they are not [easily] impacted, but rather hold on to their traits, etc. [See there.] And for this reason, he said, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers” – and that is from the side of crass physicality and it is lowliness. But, “You are busy maligning your brother, etc.,” is from the side of an elevated form, and as is written in Netsach Yisrael. And they are two opposites of one issue. And ‘there should not be [lowliness] like this in Israel’ – the holy people that comes from a good nature. And that which is in Parashat Netzaivm (Deut. 29:21-26) is elucidated by this: And later generations will ask—the children who succeed you, and foreigners who come from distant lands and see the plagues and diseases that the Lord has inflicted upon that land. All its soil burnt by sulfur and salt, etc. And all the nations will say, “Why did the Lord do thus to this land; wherefore that awful wrath?” And they will be told, “Because they forsook the covenant that the Lord, etc. And they turned to the service of other gods and worshiped them – gods whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them. So the Lord was incensed at that land, etc.” And Rashi explained [the phrase], “whom they had not known,” [as] they had not known the strength of divinity in them. And Onkelos translated [it as, these gods] did not do good to them – as the one they selected for a god did not give them any inheritance or portion. See there. And at first glance, [this needs] precision – as had it given them an inheritance and a portion, the ‘prohibition [against worshiping it] would still stand in its place. [It is] as we expound in the Gemara, (See Bamidbar Rabbah 20:9.)  “He exalts (masgi, which can also be read as fools) nations, then destroys them” (Job 12:23); such that it appears to them that they are healed by idolatry, etc. And see that with the generation of the flood it is written (Gen. 6:13), “and behold I will destroy them with the earth.” And the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded [it as] (Bereishit Rabbah 31:7), “with the land” – three handbreadths of the depth of a plow were despoiled. And the sin of the land was that the Lord said (Gen. 1:11) that the land should give forth “trees of fruit” – that the taste of the tree be like the fruit; but it made “trees that made fruit” (Gen. 1:12). (Bereishit Rabbah 5:9.)  [It did this] because [its] material was coarse; and this caused man to incline towards physicality. And [so] the Lord said (Gen. 3:17), “Cursed is the earth for the sake of man” – as the damage was evident in man. And for this reason, [people] in the generation of the flood also sinned in physicality – violent theft, sexual immorality and murder; and this was because of the sin of the land. And therefore it was punished. And in the Guide (Guide for the Perplexed 1:36.) , [Rambam] wrote that we only find [the terms], awful wrath and jealousy [attributed to God] with idolatry, [since it is understandable that] the Lord has awful wrath about this. See there. But the sin of idolatry is from the angle of the form (the spiritual side) – and that it is the loss of the intellect, as it is written in Gur Aryeh. (Perhaps the reference is to Gur Aryeh on Exodus 22:30.)  That is why the verse stated, “And all the nations will say, ‘Why did the Lord do thus to this land’” – since if their sin was from the spiritual side, the land did not sin. But if we say that the sin was from the side of physicality; you would still ask, “‘wherefore that awful wrath,’” as this is only with idolatry – as is written in the Guide – and that is from the angle of the intellect. “And they will be told, ‘Because they forsook, etc. and worshiped other gods’” – and the awful wrath was for that.  And “whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them” – meaning that they did not apportion them any good and they did not know them [to be] with divine powers, and this was not from a confused intellect, such that ‘He fools the nations.’ Rather it was from the side of crass physicality that [such] anarchy was pleasing to them. And that was the sin of the land, and hence, “all its soil was burnt.” However, if people do righteous deeds, ‘the desolate land will be worked.’"
29,21,Jewish Thought,"What is the Talmud, VIII What is not written in the Talmud? Jew and Gentile, 2 The discriminatory laws 6","The term gentile-stranger presupposes the existence of a Jewish State or an autonomous Jewish society. The gentile is one who does not live permanently in such an autonomous Jewish society, and whose laws do not apply to him. That is, not the gentile himself, but more precisely: the “stranger” [a son of another country] the non-Jew. (See Deuteronomy 29:21: “and the stranger who comes from a far-off land…”; Samuel II 15: 19-20 “And the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why should you go with us,?

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

Some explain that even all the nations shall say (v. 23) repeats what was stated earlier (In verse 21. Our verse repeats parts of verse 21 because it picks up its trend of thought.)  because Scripture went off on a tangent, (In verse 22.

"
29,22,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 29:22:1,"'גפרית ומלח....במהפכת סדום אשר הפך ה, the people seeing this know full well that this was not something accidental but that it is a finger of G’d. The comparison is based on Sodom seeing that its destruction had both been predicted to Avraham and confirmed by Lot and his daughters who were survivors of that event."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Genesis 19:5:1,"AND WE SHALL KNOW THEM. Their intention was to stop people from coming among them, as our Rabbis have said, (Sanhedrin 109a.)  for they thought that because of the excellence of their land, which was as the garden of the Eternal, (Above, 13:10.)  many will come there, and they despised charity. Lot, however, came to them with his riches and wealth [and was given permission to live in Sodom because] he either asked permission of them, or that they accepted him in honor of Abraham. Now Scripture testifies that this was the intent of the people of Sodom, as it is said, Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and careless ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. (Ezekiel 16:49.)  The verse stating, And the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the Eternal exceedingly, (Above, 13:13. This would seem to indicate that they sinned only against G-d but not against their fellow man.)  really means that they continued provoking and rebelling against Him with their ease and the oppression of the poor. It is this thought which Scripture expresses by saying, And they were haughty, and committed abomination before Me; therefore I removed them when I saw it. (Ezekiel 16:50.)  In the opinion of our Rabbis, (Sanhedrin 109a.)  all evil practices (Such as blasphemy, bloodshed, etc. (Ibid.))  were rampant among them. Yet their fate was sealed because of this sin — i.e., they did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy — since this sin represented their usual behavior more than any other. Besides, since all peoples act righteously towards their friends and their poor, there was none among all the nations who matched Sodom in cruelty. Know that the judgment of Sodom was due to the superiority of the Land of Israel since Sodom is part of the inheritance of the Eternal, (II Samuel 20:19.)  and it does not suffer men of abominations. And just as it later vomited out a whole nation on account of their abominations, (See Leviticus 18:25.)  so it now anticipated and saw that this entire people behaved worse than all nations towards Heaven and mankind. It thus laid waste heaven and earth for them, and the land was destroyed forever, never to be restored, since they became haughty on account of the goodness that was bestowed on them. The Holy One, blessed be He, thus made Sodom a token against the rebellious children, (Numbers 17:25.)  that is, against the children of Israel who were destined to inherit it, even as He warned them: The whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning… like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the Eternal overthrew in His anger, and in His wrath. (Deuteronomy 29:22.)  For there have been among nations those who were evil and exceedingly sinful, and yet He did not do to them as He did to Sodom. However it was all on account of the superiority of this land for there is the temple of the Eternal. (Jeremiah 7:4.)  I plan to explain this in Seder Achrei Moth, (Leviticus 18:24.)  if He Who taketh life and giveth life will sustain me in life."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Exodus 30:35:1,"MEMULACH’ (SEASONED WITH SALT), PURE AND HOLY. This means that it be seasoned with salt of Sodom, just as the Rabbis have said: (Kerithoth 6a.)  “Of salt of Sodom, the fourth part of a kab.” Onkelos translated [memulach as] m’areiv (mixed together). By this he intended to say that memulach means “rubbed out” — that the ingredients should all be so well-ground and mixed so thoroughly together, that their identity is “rubbed out” and none of the [individual] ingredients can be recognized. This is of the expression: For the heavens ‘nimlochu’ (shall vanish away) like smoke. (Isaiah 51:6.)  Similarly: ‘u’vloyei m’lachim’ (and worn rags); (Jeremiah 38:11.)  A fruitful land ‘limleichah’ (into a salt waste). (Psalms 107:34.)  These are all expressions of destruction and annihilation. And Rashi explained that the term memluach means that it be thoroughly mixed together in the grinding of the ingredients one with another. To this interpretation Rashi brought proof from the verse similar in meaning: ‘malachayich’ (thy mariners) and thy pilots, (Ezekiel 27:27.)  who are so called “because they turn over the water with the oars when they propel the ship, like a person who stirs up beaten eggs with a spoon in order to mix them thoroughly.” In my opinion mariners are called malachim [of the root melach — salt] because they know the “taste” of the sea, as if they could feel if it is “salty” or “sweet;” that is to say, they know when it will be sweet and pleasant for those travelling by sea, and when it will be bad and bitter for them. It is not those who hold the oars [propelling the ship] who are called malachim [as Rashi said], for it is written on Tyre, The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy ‘shotim’ (rowers); (Ibid., Verse 8.)  The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers; all the ships of the sea ‘u’malacheyhem’ (and their mariners) were in thee. (Ibid., Verse 9.)  For it is the older captains who know the sea that are called malachim. And it is further written, And all that handle the oar, ‘malachim’ (the mariners), and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships, they shall stand upon the land. (Ibid., Verse 29.)  Thus three categories are mentioned: those that handle the oar, the mariners, and the pilots [which proves that malachim — the mariners — are not those that handle the oar]. Similarly, a fruitful land ‘limleichah’ (Psalms 107:34.)  means “to a salt land,” for in a salt land nothing will grow, just as is written of Sodom, The whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and a burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, (Deuteronomy 29:22.)  and it is further written, and he sowed it with salt. (Judges 9:45.)  It is possible that the letter lamed is redundant in the verse, for the heavens ‘nimlochu’ like smoke, (Isaiah 51:6.)  the intent thereof being as in the word nimchu (erased), which would make it similar to these cases: ba’l'umim; (Psalms 44:15. The structure of the word is ba’umim (among the nations).)  wholly ‘shalanan’ (at ease) and quiet. (Job 21:23. The structure of the word is shanon (ease).) "
29,22,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Genesis 18:20:1,"'ויאמר ה' זעקת סדם ועמורה וגו, G’d means to say that the reason he now appeared to Avraham was to inform him that He had heard the outcry concerning Sodom, etc. The same applied to the five kings who were involved in the war with Kedorleomer in chapter 14 were all killed together with their population when Sodom was overturned. They were what the Torah referred to in 19,28 as the ארץ הככר. Moses also referred to this overturning of Sodom and Amora in Deut. 29,22 mentioning 4 towns, seeing that Tzoar was saved at the request of Lot. Also in Hoseah 11,8 the cities of Adma and Tzvoyim are singled out by the prophet, although the largest of the cities were Sodom and Amora. Sodom was the principal city, and the perversions committed in all of these cities were presumably dreamt up by the citizens of Sodom. The prophet Ezekiel 16,53 specifically refers to the other cities of that valley as Sodom’s satellites."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Genesis 19:26:1,"ותבט אשתו מאחריו, Lot’s wife who had been walking behind him turned around, seeing that she had little faith in such miracles as she had been warned would occur; This, in spite of the fact that she had personally overheard the angel warning Lot that no one was to turn around on pain of their becoming a victim of this destruction. Even though salt has not been mentioned as having been part of the lethal rain, the Torah speaking of sulfur and fire, it appears that the people themselves were turned into pillars composed partly of sulfur and partly of salt. We have proof of this in Deut. 29,22 when Moses describes the valley as it appeared in his time. The Israelites had not yet seen it, never having set foot in the land of Canaan as yet."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,Sforno on Genesis 19:25:1,"ויהפוך, the earth as well as its inhabitants underwent a total chemical transformation being turned into brimstone and fire, similar to what David means in Psalms 105,29 “He turned their waters into blood.” The dew that rose from the earth prior to sunrise turned into salt. Compare Deut. 29,22 גפרית ומלח שרפה כל ארצה, meaning that the moisture descended back onto earth but this time mixed with solid burned particles."
29,22,Midrash,Seder Olam Rabbah 27:2,"For twenty-eight days, he was groaning and crying out to the mountain (Isaiah 22:5). It is also said, ""In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon"" (2 Kings 25:8). Elsewhere it says, ""On the tenth day of the month"" (Jeremiah 52:12). It also says, ""In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar"" (Jeremiah 52:29). What does it mean by nineteen? And what does it mean by eighteen? Nineteen refers to the reign, and eighteen to the capture of Jehoiakim. What does it mean by the seventh day of the month? And what does it mean by the tenth day of the month? If we say on the tenth, why also say on the seventh? From now on, know that on the seventh, the nations entered the temple and took the sea, the bronze vessels, and the pillars. They were groaning on the seventh, eighth, and ninth until the day turned (Lamentations 1:14). At dusk, they lit a fire in it, and it was burned on the tenth of the month. Of that generation, it is said, ""For I know his inclination"" (Deuteronomy 31:21), and it is said, ""For I know your rebellion"" (Deuteronomy 31:27), for I knew that after my death, you would corrupt yourselves (Deuteronomy 31:29)."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,Kli Yakar on Leviticus 26:42:2,"And I will remember the land. There is a place to judge favorably and say: If the people of Israel sinned, did Eretz Yisrael ever sin? And yet the land was afflicted (Devarim 29:22): “Sulfur and salt all its land was burnt”."
29,22,Talmud,Yoma 54a:4,"And it was taught in another baraita that Rabbi Yosei says: For seven years a curse of brimstone and salt endured in Eretz Yisrael, rendering it unfit for human habitation. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the rationale of Rabbi Yosei; from where does he learn this? It is derived from a verbal analogy between “covenant” and “covenant.” It is written here: “And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week” (Daniel 9:27), i.e., seven years. And it is written there: “And that its entire land is brimstone and salt…They shall say: Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers” (Deuteronomy 29:22; 24). Evidently, the Jebusites must have been exiled from Jerusalem, which proves that the phrase “to this day” does not always mean forever."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Bereshit 19:26:1","ותבט אשתו מאחריו ותהי נציב מלח, ”his wife looked behind him and was turned into a pillar of salt.” It is possible to understand the word “behind him” as referring to the angel who overturned these towns, seeing the angel has already been credited with this activity in verse 25 where the Torah mentioned sulfur and fire being rained on the towns. The reason Lot’s wife was turned into a pillar of salt may have had to do with the power of the fire [which dehydrated all fluids and left only solids which endure like salt? Ed.] When we find Moses refer to this event in Deut. 29,22 where he credits “G’d” with having turned that area into uninhabitable sulfur and salt, something completely burned, he refers to the agent of G’d who performed this as אפו וחמתו. The fact that he first mentioned “G’d,” and then “אף and חמה,” indicates that these were the names of the respective angels who had carried out this destruction."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Bereshit 19:29:3","What happened to the Sodomites was an illustration of how the very earth of ארץ ישראל responds to the perversion of all human and religious values such as practiced by the people who live on it. Sodom’s destruction was to serve as a warning to the Israelites in the future not to become guilty of similar acts. Before the Israelites conquered the land they themselves became witnesses to the manner in which the land vomited the Canaanites. Even the spies had described the land as “consuming its inhabitants,” (Numbers 13,32) but they had misinterpreted the cause for this. For all these reasons Moses recalled what happened to Sodom and the Sodomites in his parting address to the Jewish people in Deut. 29,22. He warned his people of what would happen to them if they failed to adhere to the Torah and would forsake its laws."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 2:13:6","ולא תשבית מלח ברית ה' אלו-היך מעל מנחתך, “you may not discontinue the salt of your G’d’s covenant from upon your meal-offering.” The reason the Torah calls the salt “the covenant of the Lord,” is because by means of it the covenant will be maintained or destroyed. You may compare this to a statement in Bereshit Rabbah 14,15: “when G’d saw that man would not be able to survive if He ruled the universe by means of the attribute of Justice exclusively, He co-opted the attribute of Mercy;” in a similar way we may view “salt” either as the instrument of preserving matters or as being the instrument of destruction and making earth forever useless to man. An example was the brimstone and salt which fell on the cities of Sodom, etc. (Jeremiah 17,6; compare also Deut. 29,22).  Still on the same words: “do not discontinue salt, etc.” Seeing the Torah had already written that every meal-offering consisting of fine flour has to have salt on it, and that every meat-offering has to have salt on it, why does the Torah once more write the above words? Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra writes that these latter words by the Torah are to be viewed as if they were an oath by G’d who says to The Jewish people: “I who have made a covenant with you beseech you on oath that you shall not discontinue the practice of adding salt to your meal-offerings.” Thus far Ibn Ezra.   The Torah writes: “you shall offer salt with every one of your sacrifices” as otherwise we would have thought that only meal-offerings such as the showbreads, etc., require that they be salted or accompanied by salt, and that this is the reason the Torah mentioned salt always in connection with the מנחה, the meal-offering. To avoid such an error, the Torah had to write a line saying that salt is to be part of every offering."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Bamidbar 18:19:2","A kabbalistic approach: the words “it is an eternal covenant” mean that the covenant described as a “salt-like covenant” is an eternal covenant. Just as salt preserves the meat indefinitely, so this type of covenant endures indefinitely.   The major ingredient of salt is water. Due to the power of the sun which shone upon it it turns into salt. In other words, salt represents a fusion of the elements fire and water. Similarly, the covenant is a combination of the attributes Mercy and Justice. This is the mystical dimension of Genesis 36,39 בת מי זהב, (compare author’s comment on page 544 our translation on the meaning of the word בת). The whole verse explains to us that this covenant is the “salt of the universe.” it ensures that the universe endures, or, G’d forbid, will be destroyed if the covenant is breached. We have proof of this from Deut. 29,22 where the earth around Sodom and Gomorah which had undergone a rain of sulfur and salt some 500 years earlier is described as still unfit to produce vegetation. At first glance, describing salt as a destructive agent and using it as an example of an enduring covenant, i.e. something positive, appears contradictory. However, this is not so. The two statements are merely two halves of the same coin."
29,22,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:22:1-2","שרפה כל ארצה, “a burning up of its entire land;” according to the plain meaning of the text the word ארצה refers back to what the Torah described in verse 21 as “the plagues which afflicted that land.” In that verse the land had been described generally, whereas in our verse the Torah gives some details of what precisely happened to the land, i.e. that it was “burned” by sulphur and salt. The Torah now makes clear that this affliction struck the entire land. Alternatively, the words כל ארצה, can mean that the choicest part of Israel’s land was turned into something similar to Sodom and Gomorrah which had been destroyed by sulphur and brimstone. It is also possible that the word כל in the expression כל ארצה refers to the land which had formerly contained everything, i.e. כל; the land which epitomized every thing good under the sun. When G’d related to that land (and its people) with goodwill, benevolently, the land of Israel was לא תחסר כל בה, “did not lack for anything,” (Deut. 5,9) whereas now when the Divine Presence had withdrawn in anger, it once more came to resemble a land which had been burned."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 2:13:5","A kabbalistic approach: salt contains two forces which are opposites of one another. They are fire and water, the power of warmth, i.e. the sun which dries out the water making the salt congeal, solidify. [I suppose the meaning is that through the heat of the sun which causes such water as the waters of the Dead Sea to evaporate, salt is isolated and becomes identifiable. Ed.] In other words, heat (fire), the opposite of water releases the power of the salt in the water. Seeing that water and fire are the two elements which ensure the existence and continuity of the universe, salt combines these two elements in a certain form. It is the catalyst, so to speak, for water and fire to interact. This is the reason why the Torah writes :"
29,22,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Job 36:31:1,"For...therewith With the clouds He judges peoples and chastises them by withholding rain, causing famine, as well as all sorts of plagues. When the Generation of the Flood sinned (Gen. 7:11), “and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.” As for the people of Sodom (Deut. 29:22), “Sulfur and salt, all the soil is burned up.” As for Sisera (Jud. 5:20), “From heaven they fought...against Sisera.”"
29,26,Halakhah,"Shev Shmateta, Introduction 26","(Alef) The Psalmist said in Ps. 50:18, 20, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers. You are busy maligning your brother, defaming the son of your mother.” It appears to me [that this can be explained] according to that which is written in Netsach Israel, chapter 25: (Maharal, Netsach Yisrael, pp. 126-127 in London edition.)  We were asked, “How is it that Israelites are constantly yearning to [do] bad, etc.? As he seeks evil for the one who is his compatriot in Torah and in the commandments. And [yet] the Torah states (Lev. 19:18), ‘and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” And I answered him, etc. However this trait is not in Israel from the angle of ‘an evil soul desires evil.’ As from the angle of their essence, this holy people is deserving of all the importance and status, etc. And the one who is important based on his own nature will [naturally] seek status (and this is what causes the Jews to hurt each other). As you will not find a villager jealous of a great minister, but rather a sage of another sage, a wealthy man of a wealthy man and a strong man of a strong man, etc.  Rather this thing comes from [their appropriate] sense of importance. And the proof to this is that it is perfectly obvious that when one of them is in distress, all of them step forward like ‘a brother for adversity.’ And that is because Israel is one nation, etc. And it is not like the traits of licentiousness, etc., as that thing would show great lowliness, etc. And they are stiff-necked from repenting, etc. Because they are far from physicality, they are not [easily] impacted, but rather hold on to their traits, etc. [See there.] And for this reason, he said, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers” – and that is from the side of crass physicality and it is lowliness. But, “You are busy maligning your brother, etc.,” is from the side of an elevated form, and as is written in Netsach Yisrael. And they are two opposites of one issue. And ‘there should not be [lowliness] like this in Israel’ – the holy people that comes from a good nature. And that which is in Parashat Netzaivm (Deut. 29:21-26) is elucidated by this: And later generations will ask—the children who succeed you, and foreigners who come from distant lands and see the plagues and diseases that the Lord has inflicted upon that land. All its soil burnt by sulfur and salt, etc. And all the nations will say, “Why did the Lord do thus to this land; wherefore that awful wrath?” And they will be told, “Because they forsook the covenant that the Lord, etc. And they turned to the service of other gods and worshiped them – gods whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them. So the Lord was incensed at that land, etc.” And Rashi explained [the phrase], “whom they had not known,” [as] they had not known the strength of divinity in them. And Onkelos translated [it as, these gods] did not do good to them – as the one they selected for a god did not give them any inheritance or portion. See there. And at first glance, [this needs] precision – as had it given them an inheritance and a portion, the ‘prohibition [against worshiping it] would still stand in its place. [It is] as we expound in the Gemara, (See Bamidbar Rabbah 20:9.)  “He exalts (masgi, which can also be read as fools) nations, then destroys them” (Job 12:23); such that it appears to them that they are healed by idolatry, etc. And see that with the generation of the flood it is written (Gen. 6:13), “and behold I will destroy them with the earth.” And the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded [it as] (Bereishit Rabbah 31:7), “with the land” – three handbreadths of the depth of a plow were despoiled. And the sin of the land was that the Lord said (Gen. 1:11) that the land should give forth “trees of fruit” – that the taste of the tree be like the fruit; but it made “trees that made fruit” (Gen. 1:12). (Bereishit Rabbah 5:9.)  [It did this] because [its] material was coarse; and this caused man to incline towards physicality. And [so] the Lord said (Gen. 3:17), “Cursed is the earth for the sake of man” – as the damage was evident in man. And for this reason, [people] in the generation of the flood also sinned in physicality – violent theft, sexual immorality and murder; and this was because of the sin of the land. And therefore it was punished. And in the Guide (Guide for the Perplexed 1:36.) , [Rambam] wrote that we only find [the terms], awful wrath and jealousy [attributed to God] with idolatry, [since it is understandable that] the Lord has awful wrath about this. See there. But the sin of idolatry is from the angle of the form (the spiritual side) – and that it is the loss of the intellect, as it is written in Gur Aryeh. (Perhaps the reference is to Gur Aryeh on Exodus 22:30.)  That is why the verse stated, “And all the nations will say, ‘Why did the Lord do thus to this land’” – since if their sin was from the spiritual side, the land did not sin. But if we say that the sin was from the side of physicality; you would still ask, “‘wherefore that awful wrath,’” as this is only with idolatry – as is written in the Guide – and that is from the angle of the intellect. “And they will be told, ‘Because they forsook, etc. and worshiped other gods’” – and the awful wrath was for that.  And “whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them” – meaning that they did not apportion them any good and they did not know them [to be] with divine powers, and this was not from a confused intellect, such that ‘He fools the nations.’ Rather it was from the side of crass physicality that [such] anarchy was pleasing to them. And that was the sin of the land, and hence, “all its soil was burnt.” However, if people do righteous deeds, ‘the desolate land will be worked.’"
29,22,Quoting Commentary,"Naftali Seva Ratzon on Pesach Haggadah, Nirtzah, Adir Hu 1:1","Adir Hu, Mighty is He!  “May HE build HIS Temple soon; speedily, speedily; in our life time may it be!” In discussing on what day the redemption would take place, the sages conclude that it would be on the fifteenth of Nissan – on Passover. In discussing this matter, Rashi wonders; since the building of the Temple does not take precedence over the observance of the Sabbath or the Holy Days, how can the third Temple be built on the fifteenth of Nissan which is the first day of Passover. He answers that this prohibition only applies to human construction and not the divine construction of the Temple. We read in the Bible, “The sanctuary of the Lord, which YOU shall establish.” (Exodus 15:17)  Since the Holy One of Blessing will be the one to build the Third Temple this construction project can take place on the festival. That is why we can chant in the words of the poet, “Speedily, speedily in our day…” since the building of the Temple could conceivably begin right at this moment!!” “May HE build HIS Temple,” – we mean this quite literally! Similarly, even though God swore never to let the Jewish people enter His Temple, “Therefore in my indignation did I swear never to let enter my (place of) rest,” we will be able to enter the Temple. This is like the parable of a king who banished his children from his palace and said he would never let them enter this palace. What did the King do? When he forgave his children he knocked down his old palace and built a new one so that they could enter without his having to break the oath that he made. We read, “I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, they shall never hold their peace day nor night…who…take no rest, and give Him no rest, until He establishes and makes Jerusalem full of praise in the earth.’” (Isaiah 62:6-7)  And yet we also ask God to rebuild Jerusalem so that the remnant can enter it. Yet if God has set guards upon the walls of Jerusalem this would seem to suggest that it doesn’t have to be rebuilt! This suggests that the temple was not really burned down but was hidden away for future generations so that even God will not have to rebuild it on the festival! But brings us back to our first question: If the temple was not destroyed, how can we enter it since God swore never to let us “enter His place of rest.” Therefore we must ask God to rebuild Jerusalem so that His oath is no longer in effect and then to let those who are exiled enter the city. So we are left with a controversy. If the Temple was burned and destroyed, then we don’t have to worry about God’s oath forbidding us entry into it. But if it is merely hidden away, then we cannot enter it even when He returns it to its place. Now we can understand why we ask God to personally rebuild the Temple (so we will not be excluded from it). That is also why on the festival of Sukkot we add an extra passage to the end of the Grace after Meals in which we ask the All-Merciful “to reestablish His fallen Sukkah of David for us.” The Holy Temple is referred to as the Sukkah of David. We have a further objection to why Israel might not be able to experience the rebuilt Temple in Jerusalem. Jewish law teaches us that if a man divorces his wife she is not allowed to live in his neighborhood any more. In the case of our exile God has, in a sense, divorced us. If so what use is there in God rebuilding the Temple? As divorcees from God, we would not be allowed to dwell in His neighborhood, so we would not have access to God’s house or even the courtyard outside of His house. Adir Hu, says, “Your house rebuild,” emphasizing the words, baytcha, “Your house.” But since the Shechinah, the divine presence moved from this place, we are no longer forbidden from entering the Temple, and it is no longer a matter of divorce. (I am not sure I understand Rabbi Ginzburg’s point here. Is it that by leaving the Temple, the Temple is no longer ‘God’s neighborhood?’ Or is it that this was not so much a divorce as a separation, and therefore Israel is not forbidden to enter the rebuilt Temple.)  Finally, why does the author of Adir Hu add the word, bikarov, “soon” to the opening phrase of the song? This word seems to be redundant and unnecessary. This word teaches us an insight based on a discussion of the law regarding a woman who was raped in the Bible and in the Talmud: If a man rapes a virgin maiden, according to the Torah he must marry her and he is forbidden to ever divorce her. (Deuteronomy 29:22: If a man comes upon a virgin girl who is not engaged and seizes her and lies with her….he shall pay…she shall be his wife…he can never have the right to divorce her. This halachah troubles us – it is as if after being a victim of rape she is now condemned to marry a man she does not love or certainly does not want. However, one must remember that up until modern times, marriage was not a matter of love but family unity and continuity. As ‘damaged property’ the father of the girl would have a hard time finding a match for her once she lost her virginity; therefore Jewish law forced the culprit to remain married to her. The Talmud in Makkot 15a discusses what happens if he does give her a writ of divorce. What if he then agrees to take her back?)  Even if he divorces her, he must remarry her and does not incur the punishment of lashings. He has not broken the negative injunction against divorcing this woman when he is no longer able to take her back. (Thus, if the rapist was a Kohen and he divorced her, he cannot remarry her because he is not allowed to marry a divorced woman, even if she was formally his wife. So in this case the Kohen would receive lashes for having illegally divorced his wife!)  Similarly, in a sense, God forced Himself on Israel at Mount Sinai: according to the Midrash, God held the mountain over the heads of the people and threatened them: He said “If you do not accept My Torah I will put this mountain down on you and this place will be your grave!” Therefore God can never completely divorce the Jewish people – He is bound to us by the same penalty as a man who rapes a virgin girl has according to the Torah! However since human life is limited eventually either the man or the woman in this particular marriage referred to above is going to die; if the man divorced his wife he would then be guilty of having divorced her. In the case of God whose life is forever, we might have to wait a very long time since God is not subject to mortality. Therefore we plead with him, “Rebuild Your house soon!” Don’t make us wait a long time to take us back as is Your obligation according to law. (Wow! Did God, in a sense, rape of Israel when He forced the Torah upon us at Mount Sinai? Did God break his own law and for that reason can never forsake the Jewish people. Is the estrangement of God from Israel also an infraction? Is Israel is a victim of a forced divorce by God? There is much to think about here implied in this statement….)  The refrain of Adir hu, then, answers four reasons why Israel might have doubts about the rebuilding of the Temple: El b’nay baytcha bikarov: God, build your-house soon! 1. How can we rebuild the Temple on a festival? We answer, EL B’nay GOD will rebuild the Temple. 2. God took an oath never to allow us to enter His house – so how can we enter the Temple. To this we answer El B’NAY, “God will build the Temple” so that it will be a new Temple for us to enter and not the one about which he took an oath to exclude us. 3. But God divorced us and therefore we can never return to his neighborhood – so what good will it do to rebuild the temple? To this we say BAYTCHA, “your house.” There was no real divorce here; simply a separation in which the Shechinah left God’s House; therefore we are allowed back in. 4. Finally, even if God can never divorce us completely according to Jewish law (as in the case of a man who rapes a virgin); he can leave us alone and forsaken a very long time since His time is timeless. To this we say BIKAROV, “Rebuild Your house SOON.” That is why we ask God not to take to long in reconciling with us – we love Him and want to return to him soon!"
29,22,Midrash,Eikhah Rabbah 5:2,"“Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners” (Lamentations 5:2). “Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers.” What type of turning? It is “like the overturning of Sodom” (Deuteronomy 29:22). Jeremiah calls it “our inheritance.” Isaiah calls it “the House of our holiness and splendor” (Isaiah 64:10). Asaf came and said: It is not “our inheritance” and it is not “the House of our holiness and splendor,” but rather, nations entered what is Yours. That is what is written: “God, nations have invaded Your inheritance; they have impurified Your holy Temple, rendered Jerusalem ruins” (Psalms 79:1)."
29,22,Midrash,"Eikhah Rabbah, Petichta 34","“For the mountains I will take up weeping and wailing…” (Jeremiah 9:9) – Rabbi Aḥa said: Nebuchadnezzar commanded Nevuzaradan three matters concerning Jeremiah: “Take him and keep your eyes on him” (Jeremiah 39:12) – on him and not on his nation. “Do not do anything harmful to him” (Jeremiah 39:12) – to him do not do, but to his nation do as much harm as you please. “As he will say to you so you shall do to him” (Jeremiah 39:12) – but not to his nation. Jeremiah would see a group of lads placed in collars, and he would place his head with them, and Nevuzaradan would come and remove him from them. He then would see elders chained in chains. He would place his neck with them, and Nevuzaradan would come and remove him from them. Nevuzaradan said to him: ‘Look, you are one of three things; either you are a false prophet, or you are contemptuous of suffering, or you are a shedder of blood. Maybe you are a false prophet, as all these years you are prophesying about this city that it will be destroyed, and now that it is being destroyed, your soul is greatly troubled. Or you are contemptuous of suffering, as I do not wish to do you any harm, but you wish to do yourself harm, as though to say: Suffering is nothing for me. Or you are a shedder of blood, as the king commanded me extensively in your regard that I not do you any harm, and you seek to do harm so that the king will hear and execute this man.’ (Nevuzaradan was referring to himself.)  Ultimately, he said to him: ‘If you agree, come and I will keep my eye on you,’ but he did not accept it, as it is stated at the end of the portion, until it was stated to him from the mouth of the Almighty. (Nevuzaradan had suggested that Jeremiah come to Babylon under his protection or remain in the Land of Israel, but Jeremiah had insisted on remaining with the other captives who were being exiled to Babylon, until God spoke to him. See Jeremiah 40:1–5.)  That is what is written: “This is the matter that was to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying” (see Jeremiah 40:1). What was that matter? He said to him: ‘Jeremiah, if you remain here, I will go with them, and if you go with them, I will remain here.’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, if I go with them, in what way can I benefit them? Rather, let their King, their Creator go with them, as He can benefit them greatly.’ That is what is written: “After Nevuzaradan, captain of the guards, sent him …and he had been bound in chains” (Jeremiah 40:1). Rabbi Aḥa said: As it were, both he and Him were bound in chains. Similarly, it is written: “And I am in the midst of the exile” (Ezekiel 1:1). (“And I” is expounded to mean: I – Ezekiel; and – God.)  Until where was Jeremiah’s prophecy? (What was the last prophecy Jeremiah conveyed to those who were being led into exile. Alternatively, the midrash assumes that the book of Jeremiah is not written in chronological order, and asks which was his last prophecy (Etz Yosef).)  Rabbi Yaakov and Rabbi Aba, and some say Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yoḥanan: one said: Until, “He who scattered Israel will gather them” (Jeremiah 31:9). The other says: Until, “there is hope for your future, the utterance of the Lord, and your children will return to their border” (Jeremiah 31:16). Upon his return, (From Rama (see Jeremiah 40:1).)  he would find severed toes cast on the mountains. He would gather them, caress them, hug them, kiss them, and place them in his garment. He would say to them: ‘My children, did I not warn you of this and say to you: “Give honor to the Lord your God before it grows dark and before your feet will stumble on the mountains of the night” (Jeremiah 13:16)?’ Regarding that moment it is stated: “For the mountains I will take up weeping and wailing, and for the oases [neot] of the wilderness a lamentation” (Jeremiah 9:9) – for those beautiful and excellent mountains I will take up weeping and wailing, on the abodes [neot] of Jacob that have been transformed into a lamentation. “They did not hear the sound of livestock [mikneh]” (Jeremiah 9:9) – they did not hear the sound of words of Torah or the sound of the words of prophecy, but rather mikneh, the sound of words that arouse jealousy [mekaneh]. They aroused His zealotry with idol worship [avoda zara], just as it says: “They would arouse His jealousy with strangers [zarim]” (Deuteronomy 32:16). Therefore, “from the birds of the heavens to the animals, they have wandered and gone” (Jeremiah 9:9). Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta said: For fifty-two years, no bird was seen flying in the Land of Israel. What is the source? “From the birds of the heavens to the animals [behema], they have wandered and gone” (Jeremiah 9:9); the numerical value of behema is fifty-two. (Bet – 2; heh – 5; mem – 40; heh – 5 = 52)  Rabbi Ḥanina said: Forty years before, they (God caused the Babylonians to plant the trees in preparation for the impending exile.)  would plant date palms in Babylon, indicating that sweet foods accustom the tongue to Torah. Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Abbahu said: There are seven hundred species of kosher fish, eight hundred species of kosher grasshoppers, and innumerable birds, and all of them were exiled with Israel to Babylon. When they returned, all of them returned with them with the exception of one fish whose name is shibuta. How were the fish exiled? Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: They were exiled via the depths, and they returned via the depths. Rabbi Zeira said: Come and see how insolent is the Land of Israel, that it continues producing fruit. (It does so even though it was decreed that after Israel is exiled the land would remain desolate (see Leviticus 26:32).)  Why does it produce fruit? Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: one said: Because they fertilize it. The other said: Because they overturn its soil. (Before Israel was exiled, it would produce even without these measures.)  Rabbi Yudan said: For seven years, [the curse] of sulfur and salt (See Deuteronomy 29:22)  was fulfilled for them. Why to that extent? “He will promote a covenant with the multitudes for one period of seven years” (Daniel 9:27). What did the Cuthites among them do? They would sow it in small plots. They would sow here, and it would be burned, they would sow there and it would be burned. There was an incident involving an individual who was standing and plowing in the Beit Arava Valley, and his hand grasped his plowshare. Hot soil arose and burned his arm, to realize what is stated: “Sulfur and salt, its entire land is afire” (Deuteronomy 29:22). Rabba bar Kahana said: They are neither an indication of forgiveness in the land nor an indication of desolation of the land, (This statement refers to the return of the birds and fish to the Land of Israel, and to the original exit of the birds and fish from the land (Matnot Kehuna).)  but rather it is from before Him, to realize what is stated: “Fear of you and dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, [and upon every bird of the heavens, and upon all that crawls on the ground, and upon all fish of the sea]” (Genesis 9:2). (Since these creatures are subject to domination by man, it stands to reason that if humanity could no longer reside in the land of Israel, neither could these creatures.)  But in the future, everything will return. That is what is written: “The land that had been desolate will be tilled, instead of being desolation in the eyes of every passerby” (Ezekiel 36:34). The prologue of the Sages to Midrash Eikha Rabati is complete."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 12:2:1,"Rashi commented: “If a woman have conceived seed, and born [a male]. This includes a case where she gave birth to [the male child as] a fleshy mass which had dissolved, so that it became liquefied and like seed, in which case his mother becomes impure because of the birth” [as if it were a normal child]. The explanation of this matter (Ramban is clarifying Rashi’s words and saying that Rashi did not refer to a case where the abortion was a foetus filled with water, for in that event the mother does not become impure for the days prescribed for a male or for a female child. Rather, Rashi referred to a case where the child had been formed already etc.)  is that we know that the child has been formed already in human form, and then became liquefied, for anything that does not have a human form is not considered a child, and similarly, whatever is not fit to become a creature with a soul, is not considered a child. But even if it is a fleshy dissolved mass at the time of birth, it makes the mother impure [for the prescribed number of days] provided we recognize its form, such as a foetus with its human parts fashioned, in which case the mother is certainly impure, and if not [i.e., the matter is in doubt] she is impure because of a doubt. This is what this verse comes to include according to the words of our Rabbis. (Niddah 27b.)  Now with regard to the implication of the verse the Rabbis have said: (Ibid., 31a.)  “Ishah ki thazria — (Literally: “if the woman has [an emission of] seed” first. — Then, as the verse continues, she will bear a male-child.)  if the woman emits seed first, she will bear a son.” (“And when the male is the first to emit semen, then she will bear a female-child.”)  The intent of the Rabbis was not that the child is formed from the woman’s seed, for although the woman has generative organs [i.e., ovaries] like those of the man, yet seed is not formed by them at all, or [if it is formed], that seed is not thick and does not contribute anything to the embryo. Rather, the Rabbis used the term “she emits seed” with reference to the blood of the womb, which gathers in the mother at the time of the consummation of coition, and attaches itself to the seed of the male. For in the opinion of the Rabbis the child is formed from the blood of the female and the white [semen] of the man, and both of them are called “seed.” Thus the Rabbis have said: (Ibid., 31a.)  “There are three partners in [the formation of] man: The male emits the white [semen], from which are formed the sinews, the bones, and the white substance in the eye. The female emits a red secretion from which are formed the skin, the flesh, the blood, the hair, and the black substance in the eye.” (“And the Holy One, blessed be He [i.e., the third partner in the formation of the child] gives him spirit and soul, beauty of features, power of sight, power of hearing, speech and walk, and understanding and rational faculty” (Niddah 31 a).)  The opinion of doctors as to the formation [of the embryo of the child] is also the same. In the opinion of the Greek philosophers, (See Vol. I, p. 76 (in Verse 18) where Ramban alludes to this controversy.)  however, the whole body of the child is formed from [the substance of] the blood of the mother, the father only contributing that generative force which is known in their language as hyly, which gives form to matter. (See ibid., p. 23.)  For there is no difference at all between the egg of a chicken which is laid because it was fructified by a male, and that laid as a result of the mother rolling herself in the dust, except that the egg [that had been fructified by a male] germinates into a young bird, while the other is not sown, nor beareth, (Deuteronomy 29:22. The thought here suggested is: “because the seed of the male was lacking, therefore it does not bear.”)  because it is deprived of the elemental heat which is its hyly. And if so, the word tazria [in ishah ki thazria] will be like u’cheganah zeiru’eha thatzmiach (as the garden causeth the seeds that are sown in it to spring forth). (Isaiah 61:11. — Ramban’s meaning is as follows: According to the view of the Rabbis [and the doctors] that the child is formed both by the seed of man and the secretion of woman, the expression ishah ki thazria can be understood in its simple meaning: “when the female emits her secretion” first etc. But according to the philosophers who say that the child is formed entirely from the body of the mother, and the male semen is merely a generative force which gives form to matter, then the word tazria can no longer mean “emitting,” but is like thatzmiach — “causes to spring up.”)  And so did Onkelos render it: “If a woman conceives.”"
29,22,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 29:22:2,[THE GOD OF THEIR FATHERS.] They forsook the God that they and their fathers knew and they served gods whom they did not know.
29,22,Tanakh,Hosea 11:8,"How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How surrender you, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah, Render you like Zeboiim? (Admah…Zeboiim Towns that were destroyed along with neighboring Sodom and Gomorrah; cf. Gen. 10.19; 14.2, 8; Deut. 29.22.)  I have had a change of heart, All My tenderness is stirred."
29,22,Jewish Thought,"In the Narrow Places; Daily Inspiration for the Three Weeks, [Day Nine] 25 Tammuz; Never Abandon Zion 9","That Sodom and Gomorrah are mentioned here as examples of places that have lost their way is not surprising. The story of these immoral cities is told in Genesis 19 as a cautionary tale of what happens to an area steeped in illicit behavior. Throughout the Bible, these cities are held up as paradigms of poor real estate choices. Wicked neighbors have influence. To illustrate, in Deuteronomy 29:22, we read: “The whole land is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor does any grass grow on it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah.” Cities that are barren of those of good deeds are locations to avoid. Isaiah states that Zion has not yet reached that point but is on its way. There are still some surviving people of integrity, but Zion is becoming like these places of ill-repute."
29,22,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 2:13:1,"NEITHER SHALT THOU SUFFER THE SALT OF THE COVENANT OF THY G-D TO BE LACKING FROM THY MEAL-OFFERING. “For a covenant was established with salt as far back as the six days of Creation, for the lower waters [i.e., those of the oceans] were promised that they would be offered upon the altar in the form of salt, and [also as water] at the libation of water, on the Festival of Tabernacles.” (During the morning Daily Whole-offering on the seven days of the Festival of Succoth, there was in addition to the regular libation of wine, a libation of water on the altar. The drawing of the water from the fountain of Shiloah was marked by a great public festivity held in the Court of the Sanctuary during the evenings of the festival. They were known as the Simchath Beth Ha’sho’evah (Rejoicing of the Drawing of the Water).)  This is Rashi’s language, and it is a homiletic exposition of the Sages. (Numbers 18:19. See Rabbi M. Kasher’s Torah Shleimah here, Note 111.)  Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted it in line with the plain meaning of Scripture as follows: “I have brought you into a covenant and made you swear that you would not offer a saltless offering, nor shall it [i.e., a saltless offering] be eaten, (Ibn Ezra’s intention in using this phrase [“Nor shall it be eaten”] is unclear to me. Perhaps he means that the priests when eating the flesh of certain offerings [such as the sin-offering, guilt-offering etc., or the Israelite eating the peace-offering] must salt it, otherwise the food is without flavor and thus they show their contempt for it, as they did not take the effort to prepare it properly. The commentators on Ibn Ezra are silent on this point.)  because it is a mark of contempt.” Now since salt is the covenant of the offerings, Scripture made this accord the pattern for all such agreements, saying of the gifts given to priests and the dynasty of David that they are [an everlasting] covenant of salt, (Numbers 18:19 [referring to the gifts of the priests]; II Chronicles 13:5 [referring to the kingdom of the House of David].)  meaning that they are as everlasting as the covenant of salt of the offerings. There, however, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained: (Numbers 18:19.)  “A covenant of salt — a covenant decreed, it being of the root, a fruitful land into a salt waste, (Psalms 107:34.)  since a salt waste is as if it has been decreed [upon it that nothing should grow therein].” (So clearly explained in Ibn Ezra (Numbers 18:19).)  But there is no sense to his words. Now it seems to me that since Scripture here states, the covenant of thy G-d, and does not say “the covenant of the Eternal,” which would have been in consonance with the language of the section and the way all the offerings are mentioned [throughout Scripture], or did not say, “the covenant of the Eternal thy G-d” — that the reason for this is because salt is derived from water, and it is through the power of the sun which shines upon it that it becomes salt. Now the nature of water is that it soaks into the earth and makes it bring forth and bud; but after it becomes salt it destroys every place and burns it, that it is not sown, nor beareth. (Deuteronomy 29:22.)  Since a covenant is inclusive of all attributes, water and fire come into it, and unto her shall come the former dominion (Micah 4:8.)  — the Kingdom of G-d, just like salt which seasons all foods and helps to preserve them, but destroys them when they are over-saturated with it. Thus salt is like the covenant. It is for this reason that Scripture states, Ought ye not to know that the Eternal, the G-d of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt (II Chronicles 13:5.)  forever? For this too is the attribute of David. Therefore He says in connection with the offerings, it is an everlasting covenant of salt, (Numbers 18:19.)  for the covenant is “the salt of the world,” and by virtue of it [the world] exists or may be destroyed.

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

29,22,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Exodus 9:18:1,"In view of the fact that Scripture states, A very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded, and repeats it again, Very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation, (Further, Verses 18 and 24.)  there is an allusion that there are other places in the world where such hail did come down, such as is mentioned in the verse, And the Eternal cast down great stones from heaven upon them, (Joshua 10:11.)  or as is mentioned in connection with [the destruction of] Sodom, brimstone, and salt, and fire. (Deuteronomy 29:22.)  But in the land of Egypt, where there is no rain or hail, this was a great wonder. I have not understood what is said in Midrash Rabbah: (Shemoth Rabbah 12:2. In our Midrash, there is a different version of this text. See also my Hebrew commentary, p. 316.)  “The verse does not say, ‘as hath not been in Egypt like it,’ but instead it says, ‘as hath not been like it in Egypt,’ which means there has neither been like it in the world nor in Egypt.” (This Midrash is in clear contradiction to that which Ramban stated above, i.e., that such hail has come down in other places. Therefore Ramban preceded the Midrash by saying that he does not understand it. Since Ramban’s opinion is based upon the verses mentioned above, he cannot revoke his opinion as being incorrect.)  And the expression, since the day it was founded, is equivalent to saying: “Your fathers and your grandfathers have never seen the like of it.” But it is not possible to say that it suggests that the like of it occurred before the world was founded or before the inception of nations. Perhaps because this hail came as a punishment upon the inhabitants of Egypt and was not in the natural order, [the verse] is saying that nothing like it has ever occurred because of the sins of the fathers, for before the inception of Egypt as a nation, surely there was no [reason for] such hail to come."

29,22,Quoting Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Genesis 19:26:2,"A PILLAR. Nitziv (pillar) means the same as matzevah. (Matzevah is the term usually used for pillar, hence I.E.’s comment.)  Her bones were burned by brimstone and she was encrusted in salt, (Weiser suggests translating: she became a pillar of salt. He believes im melech (with salt) to be an error for ammud melech (a pillar of salt).)  for it is written, brimstone, and salt…like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim (We thus see that salt as well as brimstone descended upon Sodom.)  (Deut. 29:22). This verse also shows that Zoar was not destroyed. (Deut. 29:22 lists the following cities as being overthrown: Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zaboiim. Zoar is not mentioned.)  The latter is also borne out by the words of the angel. (Who said, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken (v. 21).) "
29,22,Quoting Commentary,"Chizkuni, Genesis 19:26:1","ותהיא נציב מלח, “she was turned into a pillar of salt;” her punishment fitted her crime, as Rashi has explained.

(based on B’reshit Rabbah,50,4) *Alternatively, ""his wife gazed behind him and it became... - ""it"" referring to the entire land becoming filled with salt as it says ""all its soil devastated by sulfur and salt.""

29,22,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 29:22:1","גפרית ומלח שרפה כל ארצה, “all of its land having become salt and brimstone;” what is the connection between salt and brimstone? Nothing can withstand fire better than salt, and nothing can be destroyed more totally that when it is treated with brimstone. The Torah means to tell you that if the Israelites had remained loyal to their covenant, they could have withstood any attempt at destruction as salt can withstand it; seeing that they had not, they were destroyed utterly as if they had been rubbed out with brimstone. Brimstone destroys even what the fire had not been able to destroy."

29,22,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 29:22:3","שרפה כל ארצה, “its whole land is as if burned.” Is it conceivable that G-d would become so angry on account of a sin committed by a single individual? The fact is that the destruction of the area occupied by the Ten tribes and the population being sent into exile, had nothing to do with an individual’s sins, but with erection of public idols, two golden calves built to block the route to Jerusalem during the lifetime of Solomon’s son Rechavam, hundreds of years before theKingdom of the Ten Tribes went into exile and the idol erected by Michah, and the appointment as Levites by people not born to members of that tribe.

29,23,Quoting Commentary,Rashbam on Deuteronomy 9:25:1,"'ואתנפל לפני ה' את ארבעים היום וגו' ואתפלל אל ה ואומר וגו', who is wise enough to understand and explain why Moses had to repeat that he had to fall on his face for forty days? Is it then the custom for the Torah to keep repeating things like ואתנפל אשר התנפלתי?. We would have expected the words ואתפלל, “I prayed,” to immediately follow the words ואתנפל, “I prostrated myself! However, there is a profound wisdom in the sequence of the words the Torah quotes Moses as saying, one that contains an admonition to his people. Moses is using the way he phrases his report of what he did during those 40 days and how he did it, by pre-empting an argument by the Jewish people that just as his prayers had been helpful when they were in the desert, similar prayers would be equally helpful once the people were in the Holy Land and they committed a major sin. The prophets in such days, they would argue, would surely be able to act as their interlocutors then just as Moses had done while he was alive. The point Moses is making here is that at this time their atonement was only in order for G’d not to be perceived as being unable to fulfill His oath of bringing Avraham’s descendants to take over the land of Canaan. In other words, Israel’s pardon was for the sake of not desecrating G’d’s Holy name. Once G’d had demonstrated that He had kept His promise, and that the people concerned had been settled in the Holy Land, as promised, His Holy name would never again be in danger of being desecrated by someone citing the arguments Moses had been able to cite while the people were still in the desert. This is why Moses repeats again the wording of his prayer. He is telling the people that if his prayer had been heard, it was only on account of an irrefutable argument he had been able to advance, namely how the Egyptians and other nations would react to the Jewish people’s annihilation. It follows, that if, G’d forbid the Jewish people, once settled in the Holy Land, would become guilty of similar misdemeanours as had the Canaanites, they would face both death and expulsion. On the contrary, if that were to happen, the gentile nations would not point to G’d’s inability to keep them there as the cause of their misfortune, but they would correctly point to the disloyalty this people had demonstrated by eschewing the laws given to them by their G’d, the One who had driven out the Canaanites. We find this all spelled out in Deuteronomy 29,23-27."
29,23,Midrash,Pesikta Rabbati 28:1,"... R’ Yitzchak expounded on, “On willows in its midst we hung our harps.” (Psalms 137:2) Come and see – the dirt of the land of Israel is for repentance. While they were still in the land of Israel, Jeremiah was saying to them ‘repent before the judgement is sealed upon you,’ and they did not accept his words. Once they were exiled, they kept themselves sanctified through the commandments, taking their harps and hanging them on the willows. “For there our captors asked us for words of song…” (Psalms 137:3) At that time the nations of the world said to them: stand up and sing before idols just as you would sing in the Holy Temple. They replied: if we had sung songs in our place, we would not have been exiles. And now how should we sing songs before idols?! R ‘ Yitzchak Tavlai would say: to what is this to be compared? To a king of flesh and blood who married the daughter of kings. He said to her: get up and bring me a cup to drink, and she did not want to serve him. He was angry with her and drove her from his house, and she went and married a man who was afflicted with boils. He said: get up and bring me a cup to drink. She said to him: worthless one! I was a daughter of kings, married to a king, and because he said ‘bring me a drink’ and I did not want to serve him he was angry with me and drove me from his home. In that case if I had served him I would have added to my honor and had honor in my place, and now you say to me get up and serve me?! So Israel says to the nations of the world: if we had sang songs before the Holy One in our place on all the miracles which He did for us, we would have stayed in our place and not been exiled from our land. Now we should sing songs before idols?! Immediately they arose and killed heaps and heaps of them, and even though many of them were killed Israel rejoiced that they did not sing songs before the idols, as it says “…and our tormentors [asked of us] mirth…” (ibid.) At that moment the Holy One swore a whole oath to Israel. He said of Himself, so to speak,  if I do not keep my oath, as it says “If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget [its skill].” (Psalms 137:5) The Holy One took His hand and placed it behind Him at the moment when Israel was exiled, just as it says “He has withdrawn His right hand from the enemy…” (Lamentations 2:3) The Holy One, so to speak, did not return it to its place. And so too the Holy One said to Israel: I will forget My right hand which I placed behind Me if I do not fulfill my oath to you and not forget you among the nations. “May my tongue cling to my palate, if I do not remember you, if I do not bring up Jerusalem at the beginning of my joy.” (Psalms 137:6) In the future the Holy One will return to Jerusalem all of her joy, as it says “And the redeemed of Zion shall return, and they shall come to Zion with song, with joy of days of yore shall be upon their heads…” (Isaiah 35:10) And anyone who mourns for Jerusalem in this world will rejoice with her in the time to come, as it says “Rejoice with Jerusalem and exult in her all those who love her: rejoice with her a rejoicing, all who mourn over her.” (Isaiah 66:10) They said in the name of Abaye: joy only comes on the ninth of Av, because they mandated mourning then in this time and in the future the Holy One will make it into a holiday, as it says “…and I will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow.” (Jeremiah 31:12) ... “No one pitches my tent anymore, or sets up my curtains.” (Jeremiah 10:20) What is this, does it mean that the Holy Temple will not be rebuilt in the future?! No, rather it is saying that no one from among you will pitch my tent anymore nor anyone from among you shall set up my curtains. The First Temple, which was built by flesh and blood, fell at the hands of the enemy. But the final Sanctuary that will be built by the Holy One, as it says “The Lord is the builder of Jerusalem; He will gather the outcasts of Israel,” (Psalms 147:2) will not be destroyed. Therefore it says “My tent has been spoiled…” (Jeremiah 10:20)"
29,23,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Exodus 13:16:1,"ULTOTAPHOTH’ BETWEEN THINE EYES. No affinity is known to this word. Linguists, (Menachem ben Saruk, quoted in Rashi. See also Ibn Ezra.)  however, associated it with the expressions: ‘v’hateiph’ (And speak) to the south; (Ezekiel 21:2.)  And my word ‘titoph’ (dropped) upon them. (Job 29:22. Ramban evidently understands it: “and to them I spoke my word,” meaning “they followed my advice without question.”)  The figurative usage thereof is based on the verse: And the mountains shall drop (‘v’hitiphu’) sweet wine. (Amos 9:13. The figurative sense of the verse is that the mountains “will speak” of sweet wine.)  Thus the verse is saying that you should make the exodus from Egypt a sign upon your hand, and between your eyes a source for discourse distilling as the dew upon those that hear it. (See Deuteronomy 32:2.)  Our Rabbis, however, have called an object which lies upon the head totaphoth, just as they have said: “[A woman] may not go out [on the Sabbath] with a totepheth or head-bangles.” (Shabbath 57a.)  Rabbi Abahu said: “What is totepheth? It is a forehead-band extending from ear to ear.” (Ibid., 57b.)  Now it is the Rabbis [of the Talmud] who are the [true Hebrew] linguists, as they spoke the language and knew it and it is from them that we should accept [the explanation of the word ultotaphoth]. Now Scripture says totaphoth [in the plural] and not totepheth [in the singular] because there are many compartments in the phylacteries, (The phylactery of the head is divided into four vertical compartments, each compartment containing a scroll of one of the four Scriptural passages referring to this commandment. The phylactery of the arm contains one interior chamber which contains but one single scroll upon which all four sections of the Law are inscribed together. For fuller discussion of the subject, see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 18-19.)  just as we have received their form from the holy fathers (A reference to the Sages of the Talmud, who received the true Tradition of the Torah.)  who saw the prophets and the ancient ones up to Moses our teacher doing so. Now the fundamental reason of this commandment is that we lay the script of the exodus from Egypt upon the hand and upon the head opposite the heart and the brain, which are the pivots of thought. Thus we are to inscribe [on parchment] the Scriptural sections of Kadesh (Sanctify unto Me) [Verses 1-10], and V’haya ki y’viacha (And it shall be when the Eternal shall bring thee) [Verses 11-16], and enclose them in the phylacteries because of this commandment wherein we were charged to make the exodus from Egypt for frontlets between our eyes. [We are also to inscribe and enclose in the phylacteries the sections of] Sh’ma (Hear O Israel) [Deuteronomy 6:4-9] and V’haya im shamo’a (And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken) [ibid., 11:13-21] because we are charged to have the commandments [of the Torah] also for frontlets between our eyes, as it is written: And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart; (Deuteronomy 6:6.)  and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. (Ibid., Verse 8.)  This is why we also inscribe [on parchment] these two sections — [Sh’ma and V’haya im shamo’a] — for frontlets [even though the exodus is not mentioned in them], for they contain the commandments of the Unity of G-d, the memorial of all commandments, the doctrine of retribution, which states that the consequence of disobeying the commandments is punishment and that blessings come in the wake of obedience — and the whole foundation of the faith. (“The whole foundation of the faith.” This may refer to the principle of the Unity of G-d which is indeed the root of faith, as Ramban describes it in Deuteronomy 6:4. However, in view of the fact that this principle has already been explicitly mentioned here by Ramban, the reference must be to some other doctrine. It is reasonable to assume that Ramban is here alluding to a point he has explained in many places — “a true principle, clearly indicated in the Torah… that in the entire scope of the Torah there are only miracles, and no nature or custom.” (See Vol. I, pp. 556-7; see also his commentary above, 6:2, and on Leviticus 26:11.) The theme appears also in his introduction to the Commentary on the Book of Job (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, pp. 17-19). In his “Sermon on the Perfection of the Torah,” (Ibid., p. 153) as well as at the end of this Seder, he states clearly that “a person has no part in the Torah of Moses our teacher” unless he believes in this principle. It is thus logical to assume that “the whole foundation of the faith” mentioned here is a reference to the above principle.)  Now of the phylactery of the arm, Scripture says, And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, (Above, Verse 9.)  which the Rabbis explained (Menachoth 36b.)  as referring to the left arm, which is opposite the heart. By way of the Truth, [the mystic lore of the Cabala], the verse, It is because of ‘zeh’ (this) which the Eternal did for me, (Above, Verse 8.)  is similar to ‘zeh’ (this) is my G-d, and I will glorify Him. (Further, 15:2.)  The verse here thus states that it was because of His name and His glory that He did for us and brought us forth out of Egypt. And “this” shall be for a sign unto thee on the arm of your strength, (See Psalms 89:11.)  just as it is written, For Thou art the glory of their strength. (Ibid., Verse 18.)  Thus the sign [of the phylactery] is similar to the sign of circumcision (Genesis 17:11.)  and the Sabbath. (Further, 31:13.)  And since all [emanations] are one perfect unity, which is alluded to in “the sign” on the arm, our ancestors have received the tradition from Moses, who received it from the mouth of the Almighty, that [all four sections of Scripture inscribed in the phylacteries, as described above], are encased in one compartment. This is something like Scripture says, achothi kalah, (Song of Songs 5:1. Literally, “my sister, the bride,” but here interpreted on the basis of the Hebrew roots which suggest “unity” (achothi, my sister — echad, one) and “totality” (kalah, bride — kol, all), as explained in the text. See also Vol. I, p. 292, where Ramban refers to this theme.)  because it is united and comprised of the thirty-two paths of wisdom (Sefer Yetzirah 1:1)  [with which the world was created], and it is further written, His left hand is under my head. (Song of Songs 2:6.)  Then Scripture says, And it shall be for a memorial between thine eyes, (Above, Verse 9.)  meaning that we are to lay them at the place of remembrance, which is between the eyes, at the beginning of the brain. It is there that remembrance begins by recalling the appearances [of persons and events] after they have passed away from us. These frontlets circle around the whole head with their straps, while the loop rests directly over the base of the brain which guards the memory. And the expression, between your eyes, means that they are to be placed upon the middle of the head, not towards one side. It may be that in the middle of the head, there are the roots of the eyes and from these stems the power of sight. Similarly, the verse, Nor make ye any baldness between your eyes for the dead, (Deuteronomy 14:1. See Rashi, ibid., that the expression between the eyes means on the head adjoining the forehead. See also Rashi to Leviticus 21:5.)  [means baldness adjoining the forehead. Thus the expression between your eyes mentioned here in the case of the frontlets also refers to the identical place]. It is to explain this point, [i.e., that the phylactery of the head is not to be placed between the eyes, as the literal meaning of the words might indicate, but that it is to be placed upon the middle of the head adjoining the forehead], that He reverts here [in Verse 16 and instead of using the expression, and for ‘a memorial’ between your eyes, as stated in Verse 9], and says ‘ultotaphoth’ between your eyes. This is in order to explain that the commandment is not fulfilled by placing the phylactery between the eyes bottomward, but rather it is to be placed high on the head where it is to be there like totaphoth, [and we have seen above that the word totepheth was used by the Rabbis for an object which lies upon the head]. He uses the plural form [totaphoth, and not the singular totepheth], because the compartments in the phylactery of the head are many, as we have received the form by Tradition. And now I shall declare to you a general principle in the reason of many commandments. Beginning with the days of Enosh (Genesis 4:26. See also Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Hilchoth Akum, 1:1, where he traces the process of intellectual degeneration by which mankind fell into gross idolatry. Ramban primarily follows here the process of deterioration as affecting the three basic principles of faith: the existence of the Creator, His providence over the world, and the truth of prophecy. The chief purpose of the commandments of the Torah is to guard Israel against deviating from these principles.)  when idol-worship came into existence, opinions in the matter of faith fell into error. Some people denied the root of faith by saying that the world is eternal; they denied the Eternal, and said: It is not He (Jeremiah 5:12.)  [Who called forth the world into existence]. Others denied His knowledge of individual matters, and they say, How doth G-d know? and is there knowledge in the Most High? (Psalms 73:11.)  Some admit His knowledge but deny the principle of providence and make men as the fishes of the sea, (Habakkuk 1:14.)  [believing] that G-d does not watch over them and that there is no punishment or reward for their deeds, for they say the Eternal hath forsaken the land. (Ezekiel 8:12.)  Now when G-d is pleased to bring about a change in the customary and natural order of the world for the sake of a people or an individual, then the voidance of all these [false beliefs] becomes clear to all people, since a wondrous miracle shows that the world has a G-d Who created it, and Who knows and supervises it, and Who has the power to change it. And when that wonder is previously prophesied by a prophet, another principle is further established, namely, that of the truth of prophecy, that G-d doth speak with man, (Deuteronomy 5:28.)  and that He revealeth His counsel unto His servants the prophets, (Amos 3:7.)  and thereby the whole Torah is confirmed. This is why Scripture says in connection with the wonders [in Egypt]: That thou [Pharaoh] mayest know that I am the Eternal in the midst of the earth, (Above, 8:18.)  which teaches us the principle of providence, i.e., that G-d has not abandoned the world to chance, as they [the heretics] would have it; That thou mayest know that the earth is the Eternal’s, (Ibid., 9:29.)  which informs us of the principle of creation, for everything is His since He created all out of nothing; That thou mayest know that there is none like Me in all the earth, (Ibid., Verse 14.)  which indicates His might, i.e., that He rules over everything and that there is nothing to withhold Him. The Egyptians either denied or doubted all of these [three] principles, [and the miracles confirmed their truth]. Accordingly, it follows that the great signs and wonders constitute faithful witnesses (Isaiah 8:2.)  to the truth of the belief in the existence of the Creator and the truth of the whole Torah. And because the Holy One, blessed be He, will not make signs and wonders in every generation for the eyes of some wicked man or heretic, He therefore commanded us that we should always make a memorial or sign of that which we have seen with our eyes, and that we should transmit the matter to our children, and their children to their children, to the generations to come, and He placed great emphasis on it, as is indicated by the fact that one is liable to extinction for eating leavened bread on the Passover, and for abandoning the Passover-offering, [i.e., for not taking part in the slaughtering thereof]. (Numbers 9:13.)  He has further required of us that we inscribe upon our arms and between our eyes all that we have seen in the way of signs and wonders, and to inscribe it yet upon the doorposts of the houses, and that we remember it by recital in the morning and evening — just as the Rabbis have said: “The recital of the benediction True and firm, [which follows the Sh’ma in the morning and which terminates with a blessing to G-d for the redemption from Egypt], is obligatory as a matter of Scriptural law because it is written, That thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. (Deuteronomy 16:3.)  [He further required] that we make a booth every year (Leviticus 23:42.)  and many other commandments like them which are a memorial to the exodus from Egypt. All these commandments are designed for the purpose that in all generations we should have testimonies to the wonders so that they should not be forgotten and so that the heretic should not be able to open his lips to deny the belief in [the existence of] G-d. He who buys a Mezuzah (Literally: “door-post.” It is a scroll of parchment on which are written the two Scriptural portions, Deuteronomy 6:4-9 and 11:13-21, and which is fastened to the right-hand door-post.)  for one zuz [a silver coin] and affixes it to his doorpost and has the proper intent of heart on its content, has already admitted the creation of the world, the Creator’s knowledge and His providence, and also his belief in prophecy as well as in all fundamental principles of the Torah, besides admitting that the mercy of the Creator is very great upon them that do His will, since He brought us forth from that bondage to freedom and to great honor on account of the merit of our fathers who delighted in the fear of His Name. (See Nehemiah 1:11.)  It is for this reason that the Rabbis have said: (Aboth 2:1.)  “Be as heedful of a light commandment (Here understood in the sense of a commandment, the fulfillment of which does not entail a great expense, just like a Mezuzah that can be bought for one zuz and affixed to the door-post.)  as of a weighty one,” for they are all exceedingly precious and beloved, for through them a person always expresses thankfulness to his G-d. And the purpose of all the commandments is that we believe in our G-d and be thankful to Him for having created us, for we know of no other reason for the first creation, (“The first creation.” In his “Sermon on the Perfection of the Torah,” where Ramban discusses the same topic (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 152), the text reads: “for we know of no other reason for ‘the creation of man.’” See, however, my Hebrew commentary, in the fifth edition, p. 557, where I suggest that the term “the first creation” may be a reference to the period from Adam to Abraham.)  and G-d the Most High has no demand on the lower creatures, excepting that man should know and be thankful to G-d for having created him. The purposes of raising our voices in prayer and of the service in synagogues, as well as the merit of public prayer, is precisely this: that people should have a place wherein they assemble and express their thankfulness to G-d for having created them and supported them, and thus proclaim and say before Him, “We are your creatures.” This is the intent of what the Rabbis of blessed memory have said: (Yalkut Shimoni, Jonah 550. See also Yerushalmi Taanith, II, 1.)  “And they cried mightily unto G-d. (Jonah 3:8.)  From here you learn that prayer must be accompanied by sound. The undaunted one wins over the abashed one.” Through the great open miracles, one comes to admit the hidden miracles which constitute the foundation of the whole Torah, for no one can have a part in the Torah of Moses our teacher unless he believes that all our words and our events, [as dictated in the Torah], are miraculous in scope, there being no natural or customary way of the world in them, whether affecting the public or the individual. Instead, if a person observes the commandments, His reward will bring him success, and if he violates them, His punishment will cause his extinction. It is all by decree of the Most High, as I have already mentioned. (See Vol. I, pp. 215-216 and 556-558.)  The hidden miracles done to the public come to be known as is mentioned in the assurances of the Torah on the subject of the blessings and imprecations, (Leviticus 26:3-46; Deuteronomy 28:1-68.)  as the verse says: And all the nations shall say: Wherefore hath the Eternal done thus unto this land? … Then men shall say: Because they forsook the covenant of the Eternal, the G-d of their fathers. (Deuteronomy 29:23-4.)  Thus it will become known to all nations that their punishment came from G-d. And of the fulfillment of the commandments it says, And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Eternal is called upon thee. (Ibid., 28:10.)  I will yet explain this, with the help of G-d. (Leviticus 26:11.)  Beshalach"

29,26,Halakhah,"Shev Shmateta, Introduction 26","(Alef) The Psalmist said in Ps. 50:18, 20, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers. You are busy maligning your brother, defaming the son of your mother.” It appears to me [that this can be explained] according to that which is written in Netsach Israel, chapter 25: (Maharal, Netsach Yisrael, pp. 126-127 in London edition.)  We were asked, “How is it that Israelites are constantly yearning to [do] bad, etc.? As he seeks evil for the one who is his compatriot in Torah and in the commandments. And [yet] the Torah states (Lev. 19:18), ‘and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” And I answered him, etc. However this trait is not in Israel from the angle of ‘an evil soul desires evil.’ As from the angle of their essence, this holy people is deserving of all the importance and status, etc. And the one who is important based on his own nature will [naturally] seek status (and this is what causes the Jews to hurt each other). As you will not find a villager jealous of a great minister, but rather a sage of another sage, a wealthy man of a wealthy man and a strong man of a strong man, etc.  Rather this thing comes from [their appropriate] sense of importance. And the proof to this is that it is perfectly obvious that when one of them is in distress, all of them step forward like ‘a brother for adversity.’ And that is because Israel is one nation, etc. And it is not like the traits of licentiousness, etc., as that thing would show great lowliness, etc. And they are stiff-necked from repenting, etc. Because they are far from physicality, they are not [easily] impacted, but rather hold on to their traits, etc. [See there.] And for this reason, he said, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers” – and that is from the side of crass physicality and it is lowliness. But, “You are busy maligning your brother, etc.,” is from the side of an elevated form, and as is written in Netsach Yisrael. And they are two opposites of one issue. And ‘there should not be [lowliness] like this in Israel’ – the holy people that comes from a good nature. And that which is in Parashat Netzaivm (Deut. 29:21-26) is elucidated by this: And later generations will ask—the children who succeed you, and foreigners who come from distant lands and see the plagues and diseases that the Lord has inflicted upon that land. All its soil burnt by sulfur and salt, etc. And all the nations will say, “Why did the Lord do thus to this land; wherefore that awful wrath?” And they will be told, “Because they forsook the covenant that the Lord, etc. And they turned to the service of other gods and worshiped them – gods whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them. So the Lord was incensed at that land, etc.” And Rashi explained [the phrase], “whom they had not known,” [as] they had not known the strength of divinity in them. And Onkelos translated [it as, these gods] did not do good to them – as the one they selected for a god did not give them any inheritance or portion. See there. And at first glance, [this needs] precision – as had it given them an inheritance and a portion, the ‘prohibition [against worshiping it] would still stand in its place. [It is] as we expound in the Gemara, (See Bamidbar Rabbah 20:9.)  “He exalts (masgi, which can also be read as fools) nations, then destroys them” (Job 12:23); such that it appears to them that they are healed by idolatry, etc. And see that with the generation of the flood it is written (Gen. 6:13), “and behold I will destroy them with the earth.” And the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded [it as] (Bereishit Rabbah 31:7), “with the land” – three handbreadths of the depth of a plow were despoiled. And the sin of the land was that the Lord said (Gen. 1:11) that the land should give forth “trees of fruit” – that the taste of the tree be like the fruit; but it made “trees that made fruit” (Gen. 1:12). (Bereishit Rabbah 5:9.)  [It did this] because [its] material was coarse; and this caused man to incline towards physicality. And [so] the Lord said (Gen. 3:17), “Cursed is the earth for the sake of man” – as the damage was evident in man. And for this reason, [people] in the generation of the flood also sinned in physicality – violent theft, sexual immorality and murder; and this was because of the sin of the land. And therefore it was punished. And in the Guide (Guide for the Perplexed 1:36.) , [Rambam] wrote that we only find [the terms], awful wrath and jealousy [attributed to God] with idolatry, [since it is understandable that] the Lord has awful wrath about this. See there. But the sin of idolatry is from the angle of the form (the spiritual side) – and that it is the loss of the intellect, as it is written in Gur Aryeh. (Perhaps the reference is to Gur Aryeh on Exodus 22:30.)  That is why the verse stated, “And all the nations will say, ‘Why did the Lord do thus to this land’” – since if their sin was from the spiritual side, the land did not sin. But if we say that the sin was from the side of physicality; you would still ask, “‘wherefore that awful wrath,’” as this is only with idolatry – as is written in the Guide – and that is from the angle of the intellect. “And they will be told, ‘Because they forsook, etc. and worshiped other gods’” – and the awful wrath was for that.  And “whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them” – meaning that they did not apportion them any good and they did not know them [to be] with divine powers, and this was not from a confused intellect, such that ‘He fools the nations.’ Rather it was from the side of crass physicality that [such] anarchy was pleasing to them. And that was the sin of the land, and hence, “all its soil was burnt.” However, if people do righteous deeds, ‘the desolate land will be worked.’"
29,23,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on II Chronicles 7:21:2,"Why has the Lord done בַּמֶּה, like (Deut. 29:23): “Why (עַל מֶה) has the Lord done thus,” and so it is written in I Kings (9:9)."
29,23,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Beitzah 2:6:4,"“One does not bake his bread as large loaves but as thin cakes.” Since you tire him (Since making single small loaves is more work that making one large loaf.)  he bakes only what is needed. Rebbi Aḥa understood it from the following: what is this great burning rage (Deut. 29:23, root חרר.) . The Sages understand it from the following, and behold, three bags of white-flour baked goods on my head (Gen. 40:16, root חרר.) ."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

(Deut. 9.28) However, once you will have defeated the thirty one Canaanite kings and you have taken over their land, if you would commence to sin again, even prayers would not help, as in the meantime G-d had demonstrated that He had kept His part of the bargain, i.e. that He had not been too weak to overcome those nations.

29,23,Talmud,Avot DeRabbi Natan 1:5,"And make a fence around the Torah. And make a fence around your words, the way the Holy Blessed One made a fence around His words and Adam made a fence around his words. The Torah made [a fence] around its words. Moses made a fence around his words. Even Job, and even the Prophets and the sages – they all made a fence around their words. What is the fence that the Holy Blessed One made around His words? It says (Deuteronomy 29:23), “All the nations will say: Why has the Eternal done such a thing to this land?” This teaches you that it was well known to the One who spoke and brought the world into being, that future generations would say this. Therefore, the Holy Blessed One said to Moses: Moses! Write this and place it in [the Torah] for future generations (Deuteronomy 29:24–25): “Then they will be told, because they forsook the covenant of the Eternal…and they went and served other gods and bowed down before them, gods that they did not know, and were not meant for them.” From here we learn that the Holy Blessed One made a fence around His words, and wrote after this what they would one day say. Because of this, He is able to take reward away from His creatures with no argument. What is the fence that Adam made around his words? It says (Genesis 2:16–17), “The Eternal God commanded [Adam]: From every tree of the garden you may absolutely eat. But from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, do not eat. For on the day you eat from it, you will surely die.” Adam the first person did not want to tell Eve in same the way that the Holy Blessed One had told him. Instead, he said this to her (thus making a fence around his words, saying more than what the Holy Blessed One had said to him): God said not to eat from the tree that is in the midst of the garden, nor to touch it, lest you die. He wanted to keep himself and Eve from even touching the tree. So then the snake said to himself: Since I cannot make Adam stumble, I will make Eve stumble. He went and sat beside her, and began chatting with her, and said to her: If you say the Holy Blessed One commanded us not to touch it, look, I will touch it and I will not die. And even you, if you touch it, you will not die. What did the wicked snake do then? He went up and touched the tree with his hands and feet, and shook it until its fruits fell to the ground. Some say that he did not touch it at all, for when the tree saw him, it screamed and said to him, Wicked one! Wicked one! Don’t touch me! as it says (Psalms 36:12), “Do not bring the foot of the arrogant upon me, nor let the hand of the wicked push me away.”"

29,24,Commentary,Rashbam on Deuteronomy 29:24:1,"על אשר עזבו, because, contrary to previous occasions, G’d’s anger could not be tempered by the consideration that the gentiles would consider G’d’s killing His people as proof that He was unable to keep His promise to the. I already explained on Deut. 9,28 that after the people had crossed the river Jordan such excuses could not longer be cited in their defense."
29,24,Talmud,Yoma 54a:4,"And it was taught in another baraita that Rabbi Yosei says: For seven years a curse of brimstone and salt endured in Eretz Yisrael, rendering it unfit for human habitation. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the rationale of Rabbi Yosei; from where does he learn this? It is derived from a verbal analogy between “covenant” and “covenant.” It is written here: “And he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week” (Daniel 9:27), i.e., seven years. And it is written there: “And that its entire land is brimstone and salt…They shall say: Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers” (Deuteronomy 29:22; 24). Evidently, the Jebusites must have been exiled from Jerusalem, which proves that the phrase “to this day” does not always mean forever."
29,24,Quoting Commentary,Rashbam on Deuteronomy 9:25:1,"'ואתנפל לפני ה' את ארבעים היום וגו' ואתפלל אל ה ואומר וגו', who is wise enough to understand and explain why Moses had to repeat that he had to fall on his face for forty days? Is it then the custom for the Torah to keep repeating things like ואתנפל אשר התנפלתי?. We would have expected the words ואתפלל, “I prayed,” to immediately follow the words ואתנפל, “I prostrated myself! However, there is a profound wisdom in the sequence of the words the Torah quotes Moses as saying, one that contains an admonition to his people. Moses is using the way he phrases his report of what he did during those 40 days and how he did it, by pre-empting an argument by the Jewish people that just as his prayers had been helpful when they were in the desert, similar prayers would be equally helpful once the people were in the Holy Land and they committed a major sin. The prophets in such days, they would argue, would surely be able to act as their interlocutors then just as Moses had done while he was alive. The point Moses is making here is that at this time their atonement was only in order for G’d not to be perceived as being unable to fulfill His oath of bringing Avraham’s descendants to take over the land of Canaan. In other words, Israel’s pardon was for the sake of not desecrating G’d’s Holy name. Once G’d had demonstrated that He had kept His promise, and that the people concerned had been settled in the Holy Land, as promised, His Holy name would never again be in danger of being desecrated by someone citing the arguments Moses had been able to cite while the people were still in the desert. This is why Moses repeats again the wording of his prayer. He is telling the people that if his prayer had been heard, it was only on account of an irrefutable argument he had been able to advance, namely how the Egyptians and other nations would react to the Jewish people’s annihilation. It follows, that if, G’d forbid the Jewish people, once settled in the Holy Land, would become guilty of similar misdemeanours as had the Canaanites, they would face both death and expulsion. On the contrary, if that were to happen, the gentile nations would not point to G’d’s inability to keep them there as the cause of their misfortune, but they would correctly point to the disloyalty this people had demonstrated by eschewing the laws given to them by their G’d, the One who had driven out the Canaanites. We find this all spelled out in Deuteronomy 29,23-27."
29,26,Halakhah,"Shev Shmateta, Introduction 26","(Alef) The Psalmist said in Ps. 50:18, 20, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers. You are busy maligning your brother, defaming the son of your mother.” It appears to me [that this can be explained] according to that which is written in Netsach Israel, chapter 25: (Maharal, Netsach Yisrael, pp. 126-127 in London edition.)  We were asked, “How is it that Israelites are constantly yearning to [do] bad, etc.? As he seeks evil for the one who is his compatriot in Torah and in the commandments. And [yet] the Torah states (Lev. 19:18), ‘and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” And I answered him, etc. However this trait is not in Israel from the angle of ‘an evil soul desires evil.’ As from the angle of their essence, this holy people is deserving of all the importance and status, etc. And the one who is important based on his own nature will [naturally] seek status (and this is what causes the Jews to hurt each other). As you will not find a villager jealous of a great minister, but rather a sage of another sage, a wealthy man of a wealthy man and a strong man of a strong man, etc.  Rather this thing comes from [their appropriate] sense of importance. And the proof to this is that it is perfectly obvious that when one of them is in distress, all of them step forward like ‘a brother for adversity.’ And that is because Israel is one nation, etc. And it is not like the traits of licentiousness, etc., as that thing would show great lowliness, etc. And they are stiff-necked from repenting, etc. Because they are far from physicality, they are not [easily] impacted, but rather hold on to their traits, etc. [See there.] And for this reason, he said, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers” – and that is from the side of crass physicality and it is lowliness. But, “You are busy maligning your brother, etc.,” is from the side of an elevated form, and as is written in Netsach Yisrael. And they are two opposites of one issue. And ‘there should not be [lowliness] like this in Israel’ – the holy people that comes from a good nature. And that which is in Parashat Netzaivm (Deut. 29:21-26) is elucidated by this: And later generations will ask—the children who succeed you, and foreigners who come from distant lands and see the plagues and diseases that the Lord has inflicted upon that land. All its soil burnt by sulfur and salt, etc. And all the nations will say, “Why did the Lord do thus to this land; wherefore that awful wrath?” And they will be told, “Because they forsook the covenant that the Lord, etc. And they turned to the service of other gods and worshiped them – gods whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them. So the Lord was incensed at that land, etc.” And Rashi explained [the phrase], “whom they had not known,” [as] they had not known the strength of divinity in them. And Onkelos translated [it as, these gods] did not do good to them – as the one they selected for a god did not give them any inheritance or portion. See there. And at first glance, [this needs] precision – as had it given them an inheritance and a portion, the ‘prohibition [against worshiping it] would still stand in its place. [It is] as we expound in the Gemara, (See Bamidbar Rabbah 20:9.)  “He exalts (masgi, which can also be read as fools) nations, then destroys them” (Job 12:23); such that it appears to them that they are healed by idolatry, etc. And see that with the generation of the flood it is written (Gen. 6:13), “and behold I will destroy them with the earth.” And the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded [it as] (Bereishit Rabbah 31:7), “with the land” – three handbreadths of the depth of a plow were despoiled. And the sin of the land was that the Lord said (Gen. 1:11) that the land should give forth “trees of fruit” – that the taste of the tree be like the fruit; but it made “trees that made fruit” (Gen. 1:12). (Bereishit Rabbah 5:9.)  [It did this] because [its] material was coarse; and this caused man to incline towards physicality. And [so] the Lord said (Gen. 3:17), “Cursed is the earth for the sake of man” – as the damage was evident in man. And for this reason, [people] in the generation of the flood also sinned in physicality – violent theft, sexual immorality and murder; and this was because of the sin of the land. And therefore it was punished. And in the Guide (Guide for the Perplexed 1:36.) , [Rambam] wrote that we only find [the terms], awful wrath and jealousy [attributed to God] with idolatry, [since it is understandable that] the Lord has awful wrath about this. See there. But the sin of idolatry is from the angle of the form (the spiritual side) – and that it is the loss of the intellect, as it is written in Gur Aryeh. (Perhaps the reference is to Gur Aryeh on Exodus 22:30.)  That is why the verse stated, “And all the nations will say, ‘Why did the Lord do thus to this land’” – since if their sin was from the spiritual side, the land did not sin. But if we say that the sin was from the side of physicality; you would still ask, “‘wherefore that awful wrath,’” as this is only with idolatry – as is written in the Guide – and that is from the angle of the intellect. “And they will be told, ‘Because they forsook, etc. and worshiped other gods’” – and the awful wrath was for that.  And “whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them” – meaning that they did not apportion them any good and they did not know them [to be] with divine powers, and this was not from a confused intellect, such that ‘He fools the nations.’ Rather it was from the side of crass physicality that [such] anarchy was pleasing to them. And that was the sin of the land, and hence, “all its soil was burnt.” However, if people do righteous deeds, ‘the desolate land will be worked.’"
29,24,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 26:11:1,"AND I WILL SET MY TABERNACLE AMONG YOU. “This means the Sanctuary [at Jerusalem].” AND MY SOUL SHALL NOT ‘THIG’AL’ (ABHOR) YOU. “This means that My spirit shall not reject you. Every [form of the term] ge’ilah is an expression of spewing out something that has been absorbed in another substance, such as: for there ‘nig’al’ the shield of the mighty, (II Samuel 1:21. The reference is to King Saul and Jonathan who fell in battle with the Philistines, and David in his eulogy mentions that their shields were of no avail to them, as Ramban explains.)  meaning that the shield was not receptive to the oil with which it was anointed; for they used to anoint a leather shield with boiled [fat], in order to make the blows of arrows or spears glance off it, so that it should not pierce the leather.” This is Rashi’s language. But I do not know what would be the meaning of this, that the Holy One, blessed be He, should say that if we keep all the commandments and do His will, He will not reject us and His soul will not abhor us! Similarly when [speaking of] our transgressing His covenant [with us], and committing great provocations, (Nehemiah 9:18.)  He said, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them! (Further, Verse 44.)  And the prophet [Jeremiah] said at the time of cursing [i.e., the prediction of the destruction of the First Sanctuary], Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah? Hast Thy soul loathed Zion? (Jeremiah 14:19.)  But this subject is one of the secrets of the mysteries of the Torah. (The allusion is to the transmigration of the soul (Bei’ur Ha’lvush to Ricanti, and so also clearly in Rabbeinu Bachya’s commentary to the Torah (Vol. II, p. 575 in my edition).)  Scripture is thus stating that He will set His Tabernacle among us, and that “the soul” (Here referring to a term which in the Cabalistic sense signifies the very source in one of the Divine Emanations from which the human soul originates (Abusaula).)  from which the Tabernacle (I.e., the Divine soul within us.)  comes, will not spew us forth as a pot which we scour in hot water [in order to cleanse it of substances it has absorbed], but instead our garments will always be white (Ecclesiastes 9:8. — Ramban is thus intimating that human life will be so perfect when we observe the commandments, that man will achieve his goal in one lifetime, and his soul will not be rejected on its return to its original heavenly abode.)  and new. For the term ge’ilah denotes, as Rashi said, “casting out,” related to the expression, his bull gendereth and doth not ‘yag’il’ (allow the cow to reject as loathsome), his cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. (Job 21:10.)  He states here My soul [and ‘My soul’ shall not abhor you] similar to the expression, the Eternal G-d hath sworn by His soul. (Amos 6:8.)  And the prophet [Jeremiah] thus is saying by way of amazement: “Hast Thou loathed Zion, itself (Jeremiah 14:19.)  which is a city and a mother in Israel, (II Samuel 20:19.)  and hast Thou cast her from before thee, so that all her sons are clothed with filthy garments, (Zechariah 3:3.)  polluted [with sin]?” Now according to their simple sense, these blessings, which are many and [stated in] general terms [affecting the people as a whole], — such as rain, plenitude, peace and the fruitfulness of people — are unlike the blessings with which He has already blessed [the people] in brief, saying, And He will bless thy bread, and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. (Exodus 23:25.)  For there He assured them that their food and drink would be [a source of] blessing, so that no sickness will occur to our bodies, and therefore the organs of procreation will be complete and healthy and we will give birth properly, and live full lives, as He said, None shall miscarry, nor be barren in thy Land, the number of thy days will I fulfill, (Ibid., Verse 26.)  and similarly He said at the beginning, for I am the Eternal that healeth thee. (Ibid., 15:26.)  The reason for this [division of the blessings into two sections] is that [all] the blessings [mentioned in the Torah], although they are miraculous, are hidden miracles of which the whole Torah is full, as I have explained. (See in Genesis 17:1 (Vol. I, pp. 215-216), and 46:15 (pp. 556-558). See also at the end of Seder Bo in the Book of Exodus (Vol. II, pp. 174-175).)  They apply even to an individual who serves [Him], for when there is a pious man who keeps all the commandments of his G-d, the Eternal G-d will guard him from sickness, barrenness and bereavement, and he will live out his days in goodness. But these blessings which are stated in this section are general ones applying to the people [as a whole], and they [take effect] when the whole of our people shall all be righteous. (Isaiah 60:21.)  Therefore He mentions here always the Land: and the Land shall yield; (Above, Verse 4.)  in your Land safely; (Verse 5.)  peace in the Land; (Verse 6.)  out of the Land; (Verse 6.)  it shall not go through your Land. (Verse 6.)  Now we have already explained (See in Genesis 17:1 (Vol. I, pp. 215-216), and 46:15 (pp. 556-558). See also at the end of Seder Bo in the Book of Exodus (Vol. II, pp. 174-175).)  that all these blessings are miracles, for it is not natural that the rains should come [in their due season], and that we should have peace from our enemies, and that they should have faintness of heart so that a hundred of them flee before five, as a result of us observing the statutes and commandments of G-d, nor that everything should be the opposite [i.e., that none of these things should happen] because of us planting in the Seventh year [which we are forbidden to do]. But although they are hidden miracles, for they are [brought about] by means of the natural events of the world occurring according to their habit, yet [the Torah mentions them separately because] they come to be known [as miracles] because of their constant and continuous occurrence in the whole Land. For if one righteous man lives and G-d takes away sickness from him, and he lives out his days, this also happens to some wicked people [and is thus not acknowledged as miraculous]. But when an entire land and a whole people always have rains coming in their season, and plenitude, security, peace, health, strength and defeat of their enemies, in a manner unparalleled in the whole world, it becomes known to all that this is the Eternal’s doing. (Psalms 118:23.)  Therefore He said [in connection with these blessings], And all the peoples shall see that the Name of the Eternal is called upon thee, and they shall be afraid of thee. (Deuteronomy 28:10.)  And the opposite of this will occur because of the curses, when punishments will come upon the [whole] Land, just as He said, and I will make your heaven as iron, (Further, Verse 19.)  and punishments of sickness, as He said, and sore sickness, and of long continuance, (Deuteronomy 28:59.)  meaning that the food will be spoiled and bring about sickness, and thus the miracle will be made known to all because of its continued existence amongst the whole people. Therefore it is written, And the generation to come, your children that shall rise up after you, and the foreigner that shall come from a far land, shall say when they see the plagues of that Land, and its sicknesses. (Ibid., 29:21.)  For they will not wonder at that [single] man upon whom all the curse that is written in this book shall lie (Ibid., Verse 19.)  for it happens many times in the natural order of the world, among all nations, that bad happenings come upon a certain individual. It is only with reference to that Land (Ibid., 29:21.)  that they will wonder, and that all the nations will ask, Wherefore hath the Eternal done thus unto this Land?, (Ibid., Verse 23.)  for all will see and understand that the hand of the Eternal hath done this. (Isaiah 41:20.)  And [by way of reply] they will say, Because they forsook the covenant of the Eternal, the G-d of their fathers. (Deuteronomy 29:24.)  In general then, when Israel is in perfect [accord with G-d], constituting a large number, their affairs are not conducted at all by the natural order of things, neither in connection with themselves, nor with reference to their Land, neither collectively nor individually, for G-d blesses their bread and their water, and removes sickness from their midst, so that they do not need a physician and do not have to observe any of the rules of medicine, just as He said, for I am the Eternal that healeth thee. (Exodus 15:26.)  And so did the righteous ones act at the time when prophecy [existed], so that even if a mishap of iniquity overtook them, causing them sickness, they did not turn to the physicians, but only to the prophets, as was the case with Hezekiah when he was sick. (See Isaiah Chapter 38.)  And Scripture states [of Asa, king of Judah, by way of rebuke], Yet in his disease he sought not to the Eternal, but to the physicians. (II Chronicles 16:12.)  Now had the practice of [consulting] physicians been customary among them, why should the verse mention [as a sinful act Asa’s consulting] the physicians, since his guilt was only because he did not [also] seek G-d? But the verse can be compared to someone saying: “That person did not eat unleavened bread on the Festival of Passover, but instead [ate] leavened bread.” (The intent of this statement is that the transgressor has committed two sins: not only has he failed to fulfill the positive commandment of eating unleavened bread (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 168-169), but he has also eaten chametz during Passover, which is forbidden by a negative commandment (ibid., Vol. II, pp. 194-195). In the same way Scripture states that Asa committed two sins: he failed to seek G-d, and he consulted the physicians. This shows that consulting the physicians was not customary.)  For he who seeks the Eternal through a prophet, will not consult the physicians. And what part do the physicians have in the house of those who do the will of G-d, after He has assured us, and He will bless thy bread, and thy water, and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee, (Exodus 23:25.)  whereas the physicians are concerned [mostly] with food and drink, warning [the patient] against [eating] certain foods and commanding him [to eat] others. (Rambam writes in a similar vein: “Most maladies that afflict people are the result of bad food, or of overeating even wholesome food” (Mishneh Torah, Hilchoth Dei’oth 4:15).)  Thus also the Rabbis said: (Horayoth 14 a. To understand the full significance of this Talmudic statement about Rav Yoseph, and especially about Rabbah’s connection with it [“During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned …”] it is necessary to know the background of a certain event that transpired in their lives. When the post of chief of the Academy of Pumbeditha became vacant the Rabbis of Babylon were in doubt as to whom they should appoint — Rabbah or Rav Yoseph. Rabbah’s distinction was that he was the outstanding dialectician of his generation, while that of Rav Yoseph was that he was the greatest erudite scholar. When an inquiry was made of the Rabbis in the Land of Israel the answer came back: “An erudite scholar is preferable.” It was thus Rav Yoseph’s turn to become the head of the Academy. Yet in his humility Rav Yoseph refused to accept the post and insisted that Rabbah should reign. And thus for twenty-two years Rabbah continued to rule over the Academy of Pumbeditha. In recompense for his humility, the Talmudic story continues, Heaven rewarded Rav Yoseph that “During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned Rav Yoseph did not call even a bloodletter to his house,” as was customary in those days, for his health was in such perfect condition. — See in Ein Ya’akov at end of Horayoth, in the commentary Hakotheiv, at end, for source of this beautiful interpretation. It expresses no doubt the intent of Ramban’s words here before us.)  “During all the twenty-two years that Rabbah reigned [as head of the Academy at Pumbeditha], Rav Yoseph did not call even a blood letter to his house” [as he, being a righteous person, was protected directly by G-d and needed no physicians], and they also say by way of proverb: (Shir Hashirim Rabbah 6:17.)  “A gate which is not open for the commandments [i.e., a house wherein the commandments are not observed] is open for the physician.” This is also the meaning of their saying: (Berachoth 60 a.)  “People should not have to take medicaments, but they have become accustomed to do so.” [That is to say]: had they not accustomed themselves to [taking] medicines, people would become sick according to the degree of punishment corresponding to their sin, and would be healed by the will of G-d, but since they accustomed themselves to medicaments, G-d has left them to natural happenings. This is also the intent of the Rabbis’ interpretation: (Baba Kamma 85 a.)  “And he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed. (Exodus 21:19.)  From here [you deduce the principle] that permission has been given to the physician to heal.” They did not say that “permission was given to the sick to be healed” [by the physician], but instead they stated [by implication] that since the person who became sick comes [to the physician] to be healed, because he has accustomed himself to seeking medical help and he was not of the congregation of the Eternal whose portion is in this life, (See Numbers 27:3; Psalms 17:14.)  the physician should not refrain from healing him; whether because of fear that he might die under his hand, since he is qualified in this profession, or because he says that it is G-d alone Who is the Healer of all flesh, since [after all] people have already accustomed themselves [to seeking such help]. Therefore when men contend and one smites the other with a stone or his fist (Exodus 21:18.)  the one who smote must pay for the healing, (Exodus 21:19.)  for the Torah does not base its laws upon miracles, just as it said, for the poor shall never cease out of the Land, (Deuteronomy 15:11.)  knowing [beforehand] that such will be the case. But when a man’s ways please the Eternal, (Proverbs 16:7.)  he need have no concern with physicians."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

29,24,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 29:24,"They will say to themselves in response, or others will answer them: It, this occurrence, is because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, God of their fathers, which He made with them when He took them out of the land of Egypt."
29,24,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 29:24:1,"ואמרו, “then they will say, etc.” even the gentiles will come to the conclusion that the G–d of the Jews had done to them was justified; they had entered into a covenant with their G–d voluntarily, and had abandoned their part of the bargain without reason. It is therefore no more than just that they had to pay the price for their treachery. The prophet Ezekiel has spelled this out clearly in Ezekiel 20, 32-37: “that which entered your thoughts- it shall not be! What you say: “let us be like the other nations, like the families of the lands, to serve wood and stone. As I live-the words of my Lord Hashem/Elohim,-with a strong had and an outstretched arm and with outpoured fury will I rule over you. And I shall take you out from among the nations, and gather you from the lands into which you were scattered, with a strong hand, and an outstretched arm and with outpoured fury. And I will bring you to the “Wilderness of the Nations” and I will wrangle with you face to face. As I wrangled with your fathers in the Wilderness of the Land of Egypt, so I will wrangle with you- the words of my Lord Hashem/Elohim- and  I will make you pass under the rod, and bring you into the bond of the covenant, and separate those among you those who rebel and transgress against Me, from the land of their sojourning I will take them out, but to the soil of Israel none shall come.” The Talmud, in tractate Rosh Hashanah, folio 32, quotes a sage on verse 33 there as saying: “wish that the Lord redeem us from every place;” we would be willing to endure the punishments preceding this, knowing the result would be the redemption.” [The subject matter under discussion in the Talmud there is the reciting of scriptural verses depicting G–d’s fury and anger in our liturgy on a day such as new Year’s; it would be better to recite only verses depicting G–d’s attribute of mercy.

29,25,Talmud,Avot DeRabbi Natan 1:5,"And make a fence around the Torah. And make a fence around your words, the way the Holy Blessed One made a fence around His words and Adam made a fence around his words. The Torah made [a fence] around its words. Moses made a fence around his words. Even Job, and even the Prophets and the sages – they all made a fence around their words. What is the fence that the Holy Blessed One made around His words? It says (Deuteronomy 29:23), “All the nations will say: Why has the Eternal done such a thing to this land?” This teaches you that it was well known to the One who spoke and brought the world into being, that future generations would say this. Therefore, the Holy Blessed One said to Moses: Moses! Write this and place it in [the Torah] for future generations (Deuteronomy 29:24–25): “Then they will be told, because they forsook the covenant of the Eternal…and they went and served other gods and bowed down before them, gods that they did not know, and were not meant for them.” From here we learn that the Holy Blessed One made a fence around His words, and wrote after this what they would one day say. Because of this, He is able to take reward away from His creatures with no argument. What is the fence that Adam made around his words? It says (Genesis 2:16–17), “The Eternal God commanded [Adam]: From every tree of the garden you may absolutely eat. But from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, do not eat. For on the day you eat from it, you will surely die.” Adam the first person did not want to tell Eve in same the way that the Holy Blessed One had told him. Instead, he said this to her (thus making a fence around his words, saying more than what the Holy Blessed One had said to him): God said not to eat from the tree that is in the midst of the garden, nor to touch it, lest you die. He wanted to keep himself and Eve from even touching the tree. So then the snake said to himself: Since I cannot make Adam stumble, I will make Eve stumble. He went and sat beside her, and began chatting with her, and said to her: If you say the Holy Blessed One commanded us not to touch it, look, I will touch it and I will not die. And even you, if you touch it, you will not die. What did the wicked snake do then? He went up and touched the tree with his hands and feet, and shook it until its fruits fell to the ground. Some say that he did not touch it at all, for when the tree saw him, it screamed and said to him, Wicked one! Wicked one!

And Onkelos rendered this expression: v’lo otiva l’hon, meaning, ‘they had not done them any good.’ [Onkelos thus explained] the term chalak as meaning, ‘that god which they have chosen for themselves has never chalak (apportioned) them any inheritance or portion.” This is Rashi’s language. The correct interpretation is: “gods that they knew not as gods, that is to say, [they worshipped gods] whom they knew not as having acted with any Divine power inherent to their essence. And the Eternal, the G-d of their fathers did not allot them [these gods] to them, meaning that He did not designate them as lords over Israel as He placed them over the nations.” I have already explained this.

As for the expression לא חלק, Onkelos took it thus, explaining also the singular form of the verb: that god which they have chosen for themselves has never given them any חלק, any inheritance or portion."

Not only this, but G’d had not assigned these powers to the Jewish people but only to the Canaanites (Nachmanides). This is based on Deut. 4,19 where we discussed it and pointed out that Israel had been assigned as its protective Power the Creator of the entire universe, and that the Lord Himself is described as מנת חלקי וכוסי, “the Lord is my allotted share and portion” (Psalms 16,5). We also have a verse in the Torah itself, Deut. 32,9 כי חלק ה’ עמו, “for He is the share of His people.”"
29,25,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:25:1","They had no notion that they possessed Divine omnipotence. [In some texts] Rashi explains the text out of order because he wants to prove that when the verse writes unknown to them, it means, They had no notion that they possessed Divine omnipotence. Because once Rashi explains the verse that Which He had not apportioned to them means He did not allot them as their portion, it is obvious that they were unknown to them. If so, why does the verse write unknown to them”? Therefore we must say it means they had no notion that they possessed Divine omnipotence. Re”m explains that [Rashi explains the verse out of order] because the verse [too] should have written, “gods [which] He had not apportioned to them and were unknown to them, in order to first say that they prostrated themselves to those gods not because Hashem had allotted them as their portion. And afterwards he adds that they also did not choose them of themselves for they saw that they possessed Divine omnipotence. "
29,26,Halakhah,"Shev Shmateta, Introduction 26","(Alef) The Psalmist said in Ps. 50:18, 20, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers. You are busy maligning your brother, defaming the son of your mother.” It appears to me [that this can be explained] according to that which is written in Netsach Israel, chapter 25: (Maharal, Netsach Yisrael, pp. 126-127 in London edition.)  We were asked, “How is it that Israelites are constantly yearning to [do] bad, etc.? As he seeks evil for the one who is his compatriot in Torah and in the commandments. And [yet] the Torah states (Lev. 19:18), ‘and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” And I answered him, etc. However this trait is not in Israel from the angle of ‘an evil soul desires evil.’ As from the angle of their essence, this holy people is deserving of all the importance and status, etc. And the one who is important based on his own nature will [naturally] seek status (and this is what causes the Jews to hurt each other). As you will not find a villager jealous of a great minister, but rather a sage of another sage, a wealthy man of a wealthy man and a strong man of a strong man, etc.  Rather this thing comes from [their appropriate] sense of importance. And the proof to this is that it is perfectly obvious that when one of them is in distress, all of them step forward like ‘a brother for adversity.’ And that is because Israel is one nation, etc. And it is not like the traits of licentiousness, etc., as that thing would show great lowliness, etc. And they are stiff-necked from repenting, etc. Because they are far from physicality, they are not [easily] impacted, but rather hold on to their traits, etc. [See there.] And for this reason, he said, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers” – and that is from the side of crass physicality and it is lowliness. But, “You are busy maligning your brother, etc.,” is from the side of an elevated form, and as is written in Netsach Yisrael. And they are two opposites of one issue. And ‘there should not be [lowliness] like this in Israel’ – the holy people that comes from a good nature. And that which is in Parashat Netzaivm (Deut. 29:21-26) is elucidated by this: And later generations will ask—the children who succeed you, and foreigners who come from distant lands and see the plagues and diseases that the Lord has inflicted upon that land. All its soil burnt by sulfur and salt, etc. And all the nations will say, “Why did the Lord do thus to this land; wherefore that awful wrath?” And they will be told, “Because they forsook the covenant that the Lord, etc. And they turned to the service of other gods and worshiped them – gods whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them. So the Lord was incensed at that land, etc.” And Rashi explained [the phrase], “whom they had not known,” [as] they had not known the strength of divinity in them. And Onkelos translated [it as, these gods] did not do good to them – as the one they selected for a god did not give them any inheritance or portion. See there. And at first glance, [this needs] precision – as had it given them an inheritance and a portion, the ‘prohibition [against worshiping it] would still stand in its place. [It is] as we expound in the Gemara, (See Bamidbar Rabbah 20:9.)  “He exalts (masgi, which can also be read as fools) nations, then destroys them” (Job 12:23); such that it appears to them that they are healed by idolatry, etc. And see that with the generation of the flood it is written (Gen. 6:13), “and behold I will destroy them with the earth.” And the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded [it as] (Bereishit Rabbah 31:7), “with the land” – three handbreadths of the depth of a plow were despoiled. And the sin of the land was that the Lord said (Gen. 1:11) that the land should give forth “trees of fruit” – that the taste of the tree be like the fruit; but it made “trees that made fruit” (Gen. 1:12). (Bereishit Rabbah 5:9.)  [It did this] because [its] material was coarse; and this caused man to incline towards physicality. And [so] the Lord said (Gen. 3:17), “Cursed is the earth for the sake of man” – as the damage was evident in man. And for this reason, [people] in the generation of the flood also sinned in physicality – violent theft, sexual immorality and murder; and this was because of the sin of the land. And therefore it was punished. And in the Guide (Guide for the Perplexed 1:36.) , [Rambam] wrote that we only find [the terms], awful wrath and jealousy [attributed to God] with idolatry, [since it is understandable that] the Lord has awful wrath about this. See there. But the sin of idolatry is from the angle of the form (the spiritual side) – and that it is the loss of the intellect, as it is written in Gur Aryeh. (Perhaps the reference is to Gur Aryeh on Exodus 22:30.)  That is why the verse stated, “And all the nations will say, ‘Why did the Lord do thus to this land’” – since if their sin was from the spiritual side, the land did not sin. But if we say that the sin was from the side of physicality; you would still ask, “‘wherefore that awful wrath,’” as this is only with idolatry – as is written in the Guide – and that is from the angle of the intellect. “And they will be told, ‘Because they forsook, etc. and worshiped other gods’” – and the awful wrath was for that.  And “whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them” – meaning that they did not apportion them any good and they did not know them [to be] with divine powers, and this was not from a confused intellect, such that ‘He fools the nations.’ Rather it was from the side of crass physicality that [such] anarchy was pleasing to them. And that was the sin of the land, and hence, “all its soil was burnt.” However, if people do righteous deeds, ‘the desolate land will be worked.’"
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

And make a fence around your words, the way the Holy Blessed One made a fence around His words and Adam made a fence around his words. The Torah made [a fence] around its words. Moses made a fence around his words. Even Job, and even the Prophets and the sages – they all made a fence around their words. What is the fence that the Holy Blessed One made around His words? It says (Deuteronomy 29:23), “All the nations will say: Why has the Eternal done such a thing to this land?” This teaches you that it was well known to the One who spoke and brought the world into being, that future generations would say this. Therefore, the Holy Blessed One said to Moses: Moses! Write this and place it in [the Torah] for future generations (Deuteronomy 29:24–25): “Then they will be told, because they forsook the covenant of the Eternal…and they went and served other gods and bowed down before them, gods that they did not know, and were not meant for them.” From here we learn that the Holy Blessed One made a fence around His words, and wrote after this what they would one day say. Because of this, He is able to take reward away from His creatures with no argument. What is the fence that Adam made around his words? It says (Genesis 2:16–17), “The Eternal God commanded [Adam]: From every tree of the garden you may absolutely eat. But from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, do not eat. For on the day you eat from it, you will surely die.” Adam the first person did not want to tell Eve in same the way that the Holy Blessed One had told him. Instead, he said this to her (thus making a fence around his words, saying more than what the Holy Blessed One had said to him): God said not to eat from the tree that is in the midst of the garden, nor to touch it, lest you die. He wanted to keep himself and Eve from even touching the tree. So then the snake said to himself: Since I cannot make Adam stumble, I will make Eve stumble. He went and sat beside her, and began chatting with her, and said to her: If you say the Holy Blessed One commanded us not to touch it, look, I will touch it and I will not die. And even you, if you touch it, you will not die. What did the wicked snake do then? He went up and touched the tree with his hands and feet, and shook it until its fruits fell to the ground. Some say that he did not touch it at all, for when the tree saw him, it screamed and said to him, Wicked one! Wicked one! Don’t touch me! as it says (Psalms 36:12), “Do not bring the foot of the arrogant upon me, nor let the hand of the wicked push me away.”"

29,26,Halakhah,"Shev Shmateta, Introduction 26","(Alef) The Psalmist said in Ps. 50:18, 20, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers. You are busy maligning your brother, defaming the son of your mother.” It appears to me [that this can be explained] according to that which is written in Netsach Israel, chapter 25: (Maharal, Netsach Yisrael, pp. 126-127 in London edition.)  We were asked, “How is it that Israelites are constantly yearning to [do] bad, etc.? As he seeks evil for the one who is his compatriot in Torah and in the commandments. And [yet] the Torah states (Lev. 19:18), ‘and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” And I answered him, etc. However this trait is not in Israel from the angle of ‘an evil soul desires evil.’ As from the angle of their essence, this holy people is deserving of all the importance and status, etc. And the one who is important based on his own nature will [naturally] seek status (and this is what causes the Jews to hurt each other). As you will not find a villager jealous of a great minister, but rather a sage of another sage, a wealthy man of a wealthy man and a strong man of a strong man, etc.  Rather this thing comes from [their appropriate] sense of importance. And the proof to this is that it is perfectly obvious that when one of them is in distress, all of them step forward like ‘a brother for adversity.’ And that is because Israel is one nation, etc. And it is not like the traits of licentiousness, etc., as that thing would show great lowliness, etc. And they are stiff-necked from repenting, etc. Because they are far from physicality, they are not [easily] impacted, but rather hold on to their traits, etc. [See there.] And for this reason, he said, “When you see a thief, you fall in with him, and throw in your lot with adulterers” – and that is from the side of crass physicality and it is lowliness. But, “You are busy maligning your brother, etc.,” is from the side of an elevated form, and as is written in Netsach Yisrael. And they are two opposites of one issue. And ‘there should not be [lowliness] like this in Israel’ – the holy people that comes from a good nature. And that which is in Parashat Netzaivm (Deut. 29:21-26) is elucidated by this: And later generations will ask—the children who succeed you, and foreigners who come from distant lands and see the plagues and diseases that the Lord has inflicted upon that land. All its soil burnt by sulfur and salt, etc. And all the nations will say, “Why did the Lord do thus to this land; wherefore that awful wrath?” And they will be told, “Because they forsook the covenant that the Lord, etc. And they turned to the service of other gods and worshiped them – gods whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them. So the Lord was incensed at that land, etc.” And Rashi explained [the phrase], “whom they had not known,” [as] they had not known the strength of divinity in them. And Onkelos translated [it as, these gods] did not do good to them – as the one they selected for a god did not give them any inheritance or portion. See there. And at first glance, [this needs] precision – as had it given them an inheritance and a portion, the ‘prohibition [against worshiping it] would still stand in its place. [It is] as we expound in the Gemara, (See Bamidbar Rabbah 20:9.)  “He exalts (masgi, which can also be read as fools) nations, then destroys them” (Job 12:23); such that it appears to them that they are healed by idolatry, etc. And see that with the generation of the flood it is written (Gen. 6:13), “and behold I will destroy them with the earth.” And the Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, expounded [it as] (Bereishit Rabbah 31:7), “with the land” – three handbreadths of the depth of a plow were despoiled. And the sin of the land was that the Lord said (Gen. 1:11) that the land should give forth “trees of fruit” – that the taste of the tree be like the fruit; but it made “trees that made fruit” (Gen. 1:12). (Bereishit Rabbah 5:9.)  [It did this] because [its] material was coarse; and this caused man to incline towards physicality. And [so] the Lord said (Gen. 3:17), “Cursed is the earth for the sake of man” – as the damage was evident in man. And for this reason, [people] in the generation of the flood also sinned in physicality – violent theft, sexual immorality and murder; and this was because of the sin of the land. And therefore it was punished. And in the Guide (Guide for the Perplexed 1:36.) , [Rambam] wrote that we only find [the terms], awful wrath and jealousy [attributed to God] with idolatry, [since it is understandable that] the Lord has awful wrath about this. See there. But the sin of idolatry is from the angle of the form (the spiritual side) – and that it is the loss of the intellect, as it is written in Gur Aryeh. (Perhaps the reference is to Gur Aryeh on Exodus 22:30.)  That is why the verse stated, “And all the nations will say, ‘Why did the Lord do thus to this land’” – since if their sin was from the spiritual side, the land did not sin. But if we say that the sin was from the side of physicality; you would still ask, “‘wherefore that awful wrath,’” as this is only with idolatry – as is written in the Guide – and that is from the angle of the intellect. “And they will be told, ‘Because they forsook, etc. and worshiped other gods’” – and the awful wrath was for that.  And “whom they had not known and whom He had not allotted to them” – meaning that they did not apportion them any good and they did not know them [to be] with divine powers, and this was not from a confused intellect, such that ‘He fools the nations.’ Rather it was from the side of crass physicality that [such] anarchy was pleasing to them. And that was the sin of the land, and hence, “all its soil was burnt.” However, if people do righteous deeds, ‘the desolate land will be worked.’"
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

(I Chronicles 5:26.)  The correct interpretation is that he is now alluding to the exile of all Israel, all of them being evil, and they will be banished in a complete exile. Similarly, the following chapter, And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee (Further, 30:1.)  is a reference to the exile of all Israel, as he said, among all the nations whither the Eternal thy G-d hath driven thee, (Further, 30:1.)  and so he concludes the entire chapter."

29,27,Mishnah,Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:3,"The members of the generation of the flood have no share in the World-to-Come and will not stand in judgment at the end of days, as it is stated: “My soul shall not abide [yadon] in man forever” (Genesis 6:3); neither will they stand in judgment [din] nor shall their souls be restored to them. The members of the generation of the dispersion have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the Lord scattered them from there upon the face of all the earth” (Genesis 11:8), and it is written: “And from there did the Lord scatter them upon the face of all the earth” (Genesis 11:9). “And the Lord scattered them” indicates in this world; “and from there did the Lord scatter them” indicates for the World-to-Come. The people of Sodom have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly” (Genesis 13:13). “Wicked” indicates in this world; “and sinners” indicates for the World-to-Come. But they will stand in judgment and they will be sentenced to eternal contempt. Rabbi Neḥemya says: Both these, the people of Sodom, and those, the members of the generation of the flood, will not stand in judgment, as it is stated: “Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous” (Psalms 1:5). “Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment”; this is referring to the generation of the flood, about whom it is written: “The wickedness of man was great upon the earth” (Genesis 6:5). “Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous”; these are the people of Sodom, about whom it is written: “And the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners” (Genesis 13:13). The Sages said to Rabbi Neḥemya: They will not stand in judgment for resurrection in the congregation of the righteous, but they will stand in judgment in the congregation of the wicked. The spies who spread an evil report of their visit to Canaan have no share in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And those men who spread the evil report about the land died by plague before the Lord” (Numbers 14:37). “And…died” indicates in this world; “by plague” indicates for the World-to-Come. The members of the generation of the wilderness have no share in the World-to-Come and will not stand in judgment, as it is stated: “In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die” (Numbers 14:35). “They shall be consumed” indicates in this world; “and there they shall die” indicates for the World-to-Come; this is the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer says: The members of the generation of the wilderness were essentially righteous, and about them the verse says: “Gather My pious together to Me, those that have entered into My covenant by offering” (Psalms 50:5). It is they who entered into the covenant with God and they will certainly be rewarded in the future. The assembly of Korah is not destined to arise for resurrection, as it is stated: “And the earth closed upon them” (Numbers 16:33), meaning in this world, and also: “And they perished from among the assembly” (Numbers 16:33), meaning in the World-to-Come; this is the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer says: About them the verse says: “The Lord kills and makes alive; He lowers to the grave, and raises” (I Samuel 2:6), indicating that the assembly of Korah has a share in the World-to-Come. The ten tribes are not destined to return to Eretz Yisrael, even during the messianic era, as it is stated: “And He cast them into another land, as it is this day” (Deuteronomy 29:27). Just as the day passes never to return, so too, the ten tribes go into exile and do not return; this is the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer says: “As it is this day,” meaning just as the day darkens and then the sky brightens the next day, with regard to the ten tribes as well, although it is dark for them now, so it is destined to brighten for them."

29,27,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Genesis 21:15:1,"AND SHE CAST THE CHILD. Thirst overtook him and he was unable to walk, and so his mother laid him under the tree, cast away and abandoned. It may be that the word vatashleich (and she cast) is similar in sense to the verses: And He cast them into another land; (Deuteronomy 29:27.)  Cast me not away from Thy presence, (Psalms 51:13.)  meaning “sending away.” Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said: “And she cast for she had taken him onto her lap when he was weakened by thirst, [and seeing that he was expiring from thirst, she cast him from her].” Our Rabbis have said (Bereshith Rabbah 53:17.)  that he was sick at the time he sent him away, and therefore he put the child on her shoulder. This is the sense of the word vatashleich (and she cast) him: [until that point she had carried him]. All this occurred to Abraham because he had been commanded to do whatever Sarah said, and she commanded that he send him away immediately, and it was at her command that he did not give them silver and gold, servants, and camels to bear them."
29,27,Midrash,Seder Olam Rabbah 22:2,"In the twentieth year of Pekah, during the days of Ahaz, it was reported to the house of David, and the Lord said to Isaiah, ""Say to him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid’” (Isaiah 7). At that time, Ahaz took the money and sent it to the king of Assyria, and the king of Assyria listened to him (2 Kings 16:9). In the twentieth year of Pekah, Tiglath-Pileser came and took the golden calf from Dan and left (2 Kings 15:29). It is also said, ""Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came up against him and distressed him"" (2 Chronicles 28:20), because Ahaz had divided the house of the Lord (2 Chronicles 28:21). He heard what the prophet said, ""It will not stand; it will not happen"" (Isaiah 7:7). At that time, Hoshea ben Elah conspired (2 Kings 15:30). In the twentieth year of Jotham ben Uzziah, which was the fourth year of Ahaz, it may be so, but it was a decree from the days of Jotham. Alternatively, the text wanted to mention Jotham in his grave, not Ahaz while he was alive. Shalmaneser king of Assyria came against him, and Hoshea became his servant (2 Kings 17:3). Thus, Ahaz king of Judah and Hoshea king of Israel were both subject to the king of Assyria for twelve years. In the twelfth year of Ahaz, the Lord God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (2 Chronicles 5:26). Pul took the golden calf from Bethel and left to fulfill what was said, “Also the images of Beth-aven shall be carried to Assyria” (Hosea 10:6). Rabbi Nehorai says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua that it is said, “Thus says the Lord: ‘As a shepherd rescues from the lion’s mouth a couple of legs or a piece of an ear’” (Amos 3:12), meaning from all Israel. In the corner of the bed, this teaches that only one in eight of them remained, and the rest of the people were where? In Damascus, to fulfill what is said, ""I will send you far away to Damascus"" (Amos 5:27)."

And one can't say that they were mixed with the gentiles and that the dispute [of Rabbi Akiva  and Rabbi Elazar] is whether those mixed among the gentiles will return in the future, for in the first chapter of Tractate Yevamoth (17a) it is [clear] that we are not concerned for this [possibility], for it says there: a [presumed] gentile who [attempts to] perform Kiddushin [which is only effectable by an Israelite or proselyte] nowadays, we are not concerned that the ""Kiddushin"" may be valid, [since] perhaps he is from the ten tribes, as ""it is learned as a tradition that the girls from the ten tribes of that generation [became barren]"", and there was no further concern that there were [descendants] of the ten tribes [mixed among the gentiles].  Therefore, one must say that that which Rabbi Elazar said that the ten tribes are destined to return, the meaning is that they will return in the future along with the rest of the exiles [of the kingdom of Judah].  For even now also they are [mixed] in the midst of the rest of the exiles [of the kingdom of Judah], for originally He exiled them such that ultimately they would be able to return with the rest of the exiles, for He exiled them originally to Afrikei or to the Selug Mountains, and afterward they were uprooted from their place [there] to be amongst the rest of the exiles [of Judah].  For often a person uproots himself from his place and goes to another place.  And according to [Rabbi Akiva] who said that [the ten tribes] never return, those 10 tribes went off and were lost from the land. This is what is meant ""They are not destined to return"", i.e. from the onset He didn't exile them that they would then return [again] in the future; rather they would be lost from Israel. Nonetheless, it is unsayable that [G-d forbid] an [entire] tribe would be gone from Israel.  Rather, as we said, [the 10 tribes] returned [to Israel] in the days of Jeremiah and [Josiah ruled] over them (Megillah 14b).  [Rabbi Akiva] is only speaking regarding those [of the 10 tribes] who did not return in the days of Jeremiah, whether they are destined to return. Regarding them [alone] he said ""and he cast them to another land as this day"" [means] that they will never return."

    Ibn Ezra understands the word ותשלך to mean that Hagar moved him down to her lap as a result of becoming tired and exhausted from thirst. As to why Avraham gave Hagar only bread and water and no supply of silver or gold or camels to ride on, this was due to his having been commanded by G’d to obey Sarah’s instructions, and she had objected to this.

29,27,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:27:1","ויתשם ה’ מעל אדמתם, ”the Lord uprooted them from their soil.” This whole paragraph refers to the period of the first Temple, seeing that this was the period during which the people were guilty of idolatry. The expressions ויתשם and וישליכם refer to the fate of the ten tribes, exiled by Shalmanesser, who never returned to their homeland. Such people are considered נדחים, “outcast.” This is why the Torah uses the expression כיום הזה, i.e. their fate became similar to yours as of this day. Just as you are all together in one place, not spread out over the area comprising your homeland, so these exiles will be in a closely confined area. As long as you (the Jewish people) have not yet come to your homeland, i.e. אל המנוחה ואל הנחלה, (compare Deut. 12,9) you too can be considered as נדחים. Your descendants will once more face such crowded conditions, if and when they are exiled due to breaking the conditions of this covenant. Whenever a people are not on their own land where they have space to spread out they are considered as נדחים, outcast."
29,27,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:27:2","וישליכם אל ארץ אחרת, “He expelled them to another land.” The letter ל is anyway the largest of the letters in the א-ב. Here it is written even larger. This may be an allusion to the exceptionally high spiritual level from which the people were flung down at the time they were exiled. The prophet Jeremiah (Lamentations 2,1) already speaks of this when he says: השליך משמים ארץ תפארת ישראל, “the Lord has cast down from heaven to earth the majesty of Israel.” Another verse referring to the same experience of the Jewish people is found in Psalms 78,61: “His majesty is in the hands of an oppressor.” This is similar to Daniel 8,12: ”it hurled truth to the ground.” This is a reference to the countenance of Yaakov engraved on the throne of G’d [he is known as personifying “truth” just as is G’d Himself, Ed.] This is also what we read in Midrash Eychah 2,2: “G’d said to Israel the reason you have the audacity to anger Me is that you rely on the fact that the picture of your patriarch Yaakov’s countenance is engraved in My throne, This is why I will fling it back at you right into your faces.” This (according to the author of this Midrash) is the meaning of the verse we quoted from Lamentations 2,1 that “He hurled the majesty of the people of Israel from the heaven.” This is also what David referred to when he wrote (Psalms 102,11) כי נשאתני ותשליכני, “for You had lifted me up high only to cast me down.” G’d flung down the Jewish people whom He had raised previously to such great heights (spiritual). It is as if the psalmist said that the very great height to which the Jewish people had risen previously was a reason why their fall became so phenomenal. Seeing that G’d had flung the Jewish people down from such great heights, “He no longer remembered the footstool of His feet on the day of His wrath* (Lamentations 2,1). [the thrust of this commentary, if I understand correctly, is that the upheaval caused to the Jewish people by its exile was matched by a similar upheaval in the celestial spheres. Ed.] The various portions of verses from Lamentations (5,16) or Amos (5,2), as well as from Ezekiel (19,12) cited by the author, all tend to describe the decline of Israel’s image in the celestial regions before this was followed by Israel’s physical decline and exile. It is part of the mystical aspect of what is referred to in our verse."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

Despite the clear nature of the divine command to fashion such appurtenances, Rambam does not enumerate their construction as constituting separate and distinct mizvot because he views their construction as being subsumed under the commandment to construct the Temple. Stretching the parallelism a bit, Avnei Nezer argues that Rambam does not enumerate settlement in Erez Yisra'el as a separate mizvah because he regards it as subsumed under the commandment to annihilate the Seven Nations indigenous to the Land of Canaan. [For a critique of this analogy see R. Israel Zev Mintzberg, Yishuv Erez Yisra'el (Jerusalem, 5690), pp. 32-33.] However, subsequently, in the same responsum, secs. 23-27, Avnei Nezer himself queries, ""But how can there be a mizvah in the time of exile [regarding which time] it is written in the Torah 'and the Lord … cast them into another land' (Deut. 29:27)?"" Avnei Nezer, secs. 24-27, then develops the interesting thesis that only such persons who are deserving of redemption are commanded to dwell in Erez Yisra'el. Even more astonishing is Avnei Nezer's further statement, sec. 26, that one who is not so deserving but who nevertheless makes aliyah is accounted as if he continues to reside in the Diaspora and has fulfilled no mizvah thereby. However, Avnei Nezer, secs. 39 and 62, concludes with the statement that, his own opinion notwithstanding, the position of rabbinic decisors is that settlement in Israel is a mizvah. Whether this mizvah is biblical or rabbinic in nature is contingent upon the conflicting talmudic views with regard to whether the biblical sanctity engendered by Ezra's settlement is eternal in nature or whether it, too, lapsed (as did Joshua's earlier sanctification) upon the destruction of the Second Temple. Nevertheless, Avnei Nezer, sec. 52, asserts that since subsequent to the ""three oaths"" there is no longer an obligation upon the entire community to settle in the Land of Israel, there can therefore be no obligation upon any individual to settle in Israel. In sec. 56 he adds that if all Jews were to be granted permission to immigrate to Israel, settlement in the Land of Israel would become obligatory provided that it be possible to settle among righteous people."

The opinion of these scholars notwithstanding, the very fact that an oath not to reconquer the Land of Israel by force as well as the biblical verse ""and the Lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land, as it is this day"" (Deut. 29:27), certainly make it logical to assume that during the period of exile God has relieved the Jewish people from this obligation, at least insofar as conquest and retention of the land is concerned. Were an obligation predicated upon the commandment ""and you shall inherit the land"" still to exist with regard to retention of territory already acquired, it is difficult to comprehend the halakhic basis and justification of exacting an oath not to retake the land by force."

But Rabbi Akiva says: Just as “this day” is dark and then gets lighter, so will their darkness one day become lighter. (Rabbi Gamliel says: See, it says (Deuteronomy 11:21), “In order that you and your children will endure.” And it also says (Deuteronomy 24:16), “Parents shall not be put to death for their children.” So when the parent’s life extends, so does the child’s.

29,28,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 29:28:1,"THE SECRET THINGS BELONG UNTO THE ETERNAL OUR G-D. In the opinion of the commentators (Ibn Ezra and others.)  the verse states: “It is for the Eternal our G-d to execute judgment upon those who worship idols secretly, for all hidden matters are revealed before Him, but the things that are revealed are upon us and our children that we may do to them all the words of this Law — to smite the idol-worshippers in accordance with the law of the Torah. According to the interpretation of the Rabbis, too, it is so. (Sanhedrin 43b.)  By way of the simple meaning of Scripture it is my opinion that the secret things are the sins that are hidden from those who commit them, as it is stated, Who can discern errors? Cleanse Thou me from hidden faults. (Psalms 19:13.)  The verse states: “[Our] hidden sins belong to G-d alone; for them we bear no guilt for having transgressed [unknowingly]. But the things that are revealed, namely our conscious sins, belong unto us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this Law as an eternal statute. As such we accepted it, obligating the one who was present [when the covenant was made] and the one who was not present. And because he included in the imprecation [the obligation] to perform all the commandments, he excluded from the ban whoever commits a sin unintentionally, so that he should not be afflicted by this curse. The words of Onkelos indicate this, for he rendered it, “The secret things are before the Eternal our G-d,” [thus implying that we will not be punished for sins we have committed unknowingly], but if he agreed with the [aforementioned] interpretation of the commentators [that it is for G-d to punish conscious sins committed secretly] then Onkelos should have said, “The secret things are ‘to’ the Eternal our G-d” [to punish]."
29,28,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 29:28:1,"הנסתרת לה' אלהינו THE SECRET THINGS BELONG UNTO THE LORD OUR GOD — And if you say, “But what can we do? Thou threatenest the many (the whole community) with punishment because of the sinful thoughts of one individual, as it is said, (v. 17): “Lest there should be among you a man, [or a woman or a family … whose heart turneth away this day from the Lord …]”, and afterwards it states, (v. 21) “And they will see the plagues of that land”. But surely no man can know the secret thoughts of his fellow! Now, I reply: I do not threaten to punish you because of secret thoughts for these belong to the Lord our God and He will exact punishment from that individual; but those things which are revealed belong to us and to our children that we may put away the evil from our midst; and if we do not execute judgment upon them, the whole community will be punished. — There are dots on the words לנו ולבננו to suggest that even for the revealed sins (those committed openly), He did not punish the community until they had crossed the Jordan — from the moment when they took upon themselves the oath on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal and had thus become responsible for one another (Sanhedrin 43b; cf.

29,28,Responsa,"Iggerot HaRambam, Iggeret Teiman 10","Remember, that ours is the true and authentic Divine religion, revealed to us through Moses, the master of the former as well as the later prophets, by means of which God has distinguished us from the rest of mankind, as Scripture says, ""Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and He chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples"" (Deuteronomy 10:15). This did not happen because of our merits, but rather as an act of Divine grace, and on account of our forefathers who were cognizant of God and submitted to Him as we read, ""The Lord did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people ... but because the Lord loved you, and because He would keep the oath which He swore unto your fathers."" (Deuteronomy 7:7). God has made us unique by His laws and precepts, and our pre-eminence is manifested in His rules and statutes, as Scripture says, in narrating God's mercies to us, ""And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?"" (Deuteronomy 4:8). Therefore all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us. They wanted to thwart God, but He cannot be thwarted. Ever since the time of Revelation, every despot or slave that has attained to power, be he violent or ignoble, has made it his first aim and his final purpose to destroy our law, and to vitiate our religion, by means of the sword, by violence, or by brute force, such as Amalek, Sisera, Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar, Titus, Hadrian, may their bones be ground to dust, and others like them. This is one of the two classes which attempt to foil the Divine will. The second class consists of the most intelligent and educated among the nations, such as the Syrians, Persians, and Greeks. These also endeavor to demolish our law and to vitiate it by means of arguments which they invent, and by means of controversies which they institute. They seek to render the Law ineffectual and to wipe out every trace thereof by means of their polemical writings, just as the despots plan to do it with the sword. But neither the one nor the other shall succeed. We possess the divine assurance given to Isaiah concerning any tyrant that will wish to undermine our Law and to annihilate it by weapons of war, that the Lord will demolish them so that they will have no effect. This is only a metaphorical way of saying that his efforts will be of no avail, and that he will not accomplish his purpose. In like manner whenever a disputant shall attempt to demonstrate the falsity of our Law, the Lord will shatter his arguments and prove them absurd untenable and ineffective. This divine promise is contained in the following verse, ""No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn."" (Isaiah 54:17). Although the exponents of both methods persuade themselves that this is a structure which can be demolished, and they exert themselves to undermine its firmly established foundations, they only increase their pain and toil. The structure remains as firmly planted as ever, while the God of Truth mocks and derides them, because they endeavor, with their feeble intelligence, to achieve a goal that is beyond the powers of mortal man. The inspired writer describes their attempt and God's scorn of them in the following verses: ""Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their words from us, He that sitteth in heaven laugheth, the Lord hath them in derision."" (Psalms 2:3-4). Both of these parties have harassed and afflicted us incessantly throughout the epoch of our political independence, and partly during the period of our dispersion. After that there arose a new sect which combined the two methods, namely, conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. It, therefore, resolved to lay claim to prophecy and to found a new faith, contrary to our Divine religion, and to contend that it was equally God-given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and to create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such is the remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain. The first one to have adopted this plan was Jesus the Nazarene, may his bones be ground to dust. He was a Jew because his mother was a Jewess although his father was a Gentile. For in accordance with the principles of our law, a child born of a Jewess and a Gentile, or of a Jewess and a slave, is legitimate. (Yebamot 45a). Jesus is only figuratively termed an illegitimate child. He impelled people to believe that he was a prophet sent by God to clarify perplexities in the Torah, and that he was the Messiah that was predicted by each and every seer. He interpreted the Torah and its precepts in such a fashion as to lead to their total annulment, to the abolition of all its commandments and to the violation of its prohibitions. The sages, of blessed memory, having become aware of his plans before his reputation spread among our people, meted out fitting punishment to him.1 Daniel had already alluded to him when he presaged the downfall of a wicked one and a heretic among the Jews who would endeavor to destroy the Law, claim prophecy for himself, make pretenses to miracles, and allege that he is the Messiah, as it is written, ""Also the children of the impudent among thy people shall make bold to claim prophecy, but they shall fall."" (Daniel 11:14). Quite some time after, a religion2 appeared the origin of which is traced to him by the descendants of Esau, albeit it was not the intention of this person to establish a new faith. For he was innocuous to Israel as neither individual nor groups were unsettled in their beliefs because of him, since his inconsistencies were so transparent to every one. Finally he was overpowered and put a stop to by us when he fell into our hands, and his fate is well known. After him arose the Madman who emulated his precursor since he paved the way for him. But he added the further objective of procuring rule and submission, and he invented his well known religion. All of these men purposed to place their teachings on the same level with our divine religion. But only a simpleton who lacks knowledge of both would liken divine institutions to human practices. Our religion differs as much from other religions for which there are alleged resemblances as a living man endowed with the faculty of reason is unlike a statue which is ever so well carved out of marble, wood, bronze or silver. When a person ignorant of divine wisdom or of God's works sees the statue that superficially resembles a man in its contours, form, features, and color, he believes that the structure of the parts of a statue is like the constitution of a man, because he is deficient in understanding concerning the inner organization of both. But the informed person who knows the interior of both, is cognizant of the fact that the internal structure of the statue betrays no skillful workmanship at all, whereas the inward parts of man are truly marvelously made, a testimony to the wisdom of the Creator, such as the prolongation of the nerves in the muscles and their ramifications, the branching out of the sinews and their intersections and the network of their ligaments and their manner of growth, the articulations of the bones and the joints, the pulsating and non-pulsating blood vessels and their ramifications, the setting of the limbs into one another, the uncovered and covered parts, every one of these in proportion, in form and proper place. Likewise a person ignorant of the secret meaning of Scripture and the deeper significance of the Law, would be led to believe that our religion has something in common with another if he makes a comparison between the two. For he will note that in the Torah there are prohibitions and commandments, just as in other religions there are permitted and interdicted acts. Both contain a system of religious observances, positive and negative precepts, sanctioned by reward and punishment. If he could only fathom the inner intent of the law, then he would realize that the essence of the true divine religion lies in the deeper meaning of its positive and negative precepts, every one of which will aid man in his striving after perfection, and remove every impediment to the attainment of excellence. These commands will enable the throng and the elite to acquire moral and intellectual qualities, each according to his ability. Thus the godly community becomes pre-eminent, reaching a two-fold perfection. By the first perfection I mean, man's spending his life in this world under the most agreeable and congenial conditions. The second perfection would constitute the achievement of intellectual objectives, each in accordance with his native powers. The tenets of the other religions which resemble those of Scripture have no deeper meaning, but are superficial imitations, copied from and patterned after it. They modeled their religions upon ours in order to glorify themselves, and indulge the fancy that they are similar to so and so. However, their counterfeiting is an open secret to the learned. Consequently they became objects of derision and ridicule just as one laughs and smiles at an ape when it imitates the actions of men. This event was predicted in the divinely inspired prophecy of Daniel, according to which, in some future time a person would appear with a religion similar to the true one, with a book of Scriptures and oral communications, who will arrogantly pretend that God had vouchsafed him a revelation, and that he held converse with Him, besides making other extravagant claims. Thus Daniel in his description of the rise of the Arabic kingdom after the fall of the Roman Empire, alluded to the appearance of the Madman and his victories over the Roman, Persian, and Byzantine Empires in the vision concerning a horn which grew, became long and strong. This is clearly indicated in a verse that can be understood by the masses as well as by the select few. Since this interpretation is borne out by the facts of history, no other meaning can be given to the following verse: ""I considered the horns, and, behold, there came among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things."" (Danield 7:8). Now consider how remarkably apt the symbolism is. Daniel says that he saw a small horn that was going up. When it became longer, even marvelously longer, it cast down before it three horns and behold in the side of the horn there were two eyes similar to the two eyes of man, and a mouth speaking wanton words. This obviously alludes to the person who will found a new religion similar to the divine law, and make claims to a revelation of a Scripture, and to prophecy. He will furthermore endeavor to alter and abolish the Law, as it is said, ""and he shall seek to change the seasons and the law."" (Daniel 7:25). Daniel was divinely informed that He would destroy this person notwithstanding his greatness and his long endurance together with the remaining adherents of his predecessors. For the three parties that warred against us will ultimately perish, i.e., the one that sought to overpower us with the sword, the second which strove to conquer us by arguments, as well the third that founded a religion similar to ours. Though they shall appear to be triumphant for a while, and be in the ascendancy for a longer or shorter period of time, they shall not last nor endure. We have a divine assurance from time immemorial that whenever a decree of apostasy is passed against us, God will ultimately terminate it. When King David inspired by the Holy Spirit and speaking in the name of the community reflected, how many peoples ruled over Israel in the past, and how many trials and tribulations they had undergone from the beginning of their history, and nevertheless were not exterminated, he was moved to exclaim, ""Much have they afflicted me from my youth up; but they have not prevailed against me."" (Psalms 129:2). My brethren, you all know that in the time of Nebuchadnezzar the Wicked, the Jews were compelled to worship idols and none was spared save Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. Ultimately God destroyed Nebuchadnezzar, and put an end to his laws, and the religion of Truth came back to its own. Similarly during the Second Commonwealth when the wicked Greek rulers gained control of Palestine, they instituted severe persecutions against Israel in order to abolish the Torah. The Jews were compelled to profane the Sabbath, and were forbidden to observe the rite of circumcision. Every Jew was forced to write on his garment the words ""we have no portion in the Lord God of Israel, and also to engrave this sentence on the horns of his ox and then plough with it.""3 This state of affairs lasted about fifty-two years. Finally, God brought to an end simultaneously their empire and their laws. The sages, of blessed memory, frequently allude to persecutions in the following manner: ""once the wicked government passed the following decree of persecution,"" or, ""they decreed so and so."" After a while God would make the decree null and void by destroying the power which issued it. It was this observation that led the rabbis of blessed memory to affirm that persecutions are of short duration. (Ketubot 3b). The divine assurance was given to Jacob our father, that his descendants would survive the people who degraded and discomfited them as it is written: ""And thy seed shall be like the dust of the earth."" (Genesis 28:14). That is to say, although his offspring will be abased like dust that is trodden under foot, they will ultimately emerge triumphant and victorious, and as the simile implies, just as the dust settles finally upon him who tramples upon it, and remains after him, so shall Israel outlive its persecutors. The prophet Isaiah has long ago predicted that various peoples will succeed in vanquishing Israel and lording over them for some time. But that ultimately God will come to Israel's assistance and will put a stop to their woes and affliction as is suggested in the following verse: ""A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous one will deal treacherously, and the spoiler will spoil; Go up O Elam, besiege O Media! but ultimately the sighing thereof I shall make to cease."" (Isaiah 21:2). We are in possession of the divine assurance that Israel is indestructible and imperishable, and will always continue to be a pre-eminent community. As it is impossible for God to cease to exist, so is Israel's destruction and disappearance from the world unthinkable, as we read, ""For I the Lord change not, and ye, O sons of Jacob, will not be consumed."" (Malachi 3:6). Similarly He has avowed and assured us that it is unimaginable that He will reject us entirely even if we disobey Him, and disregard His behests, as the prophet Jeremiah avers, ""Thus saith the Lord: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, Then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the Lord"" (Jeremiah 31:36). Indeed this very promise has already been given before through Moses our Teacher who says, ""And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the Lord their God."" (Leviticus 26:44). Put your trust in the true promises of Scripture, brethren, and be not dismayed at the series of persecutions or the enemy's ascendency over us, or the weakness of our people. These trials are designed to test and purify us so that only the saints and the pious ones of the pure and undefiled lineage of Jacob will adhere to our religion and remain within the fold, as it is written, ""And among the remnant are those whom the Lord shall call."" (Joel 3:5). This verse makes it clear that they are not numerous, being the descendants of those who were present on Mount Sinai,4 witnessed the divine Revelation, entered into the covenant of God, and undertook to do and obey as is signified in their saying, ""we will do, and obey."" (Exodus 24:7). They obligated not only themselves but also their descendants, as it is written, ""to us and to our children forever."" (Deuteronomy 29:28). We have been given adequate divine assurance that not only did all the persons who were present at the Sinaitic Revelation believe in the prophecy of Moses and in his Law, but that their descendants likewise would do so, until the end of time, as it is written, ""Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee forever."" (Exodus 10:9). Consequently it is manifest that he who spurns the religion that was revealed at that theophany, is not an offspring of the folk who witnessed it. For our sages of blessed memory have insisted that they who entertain scruples concerning the divine message are not scions of the race that were present on Mount Sinai. (Nedarim 20a). May God guard us and you from doubt, and banish from our midst confusion, suspicion, which lead to it. Now, my co-religionists in the Diaspora, it behooves you to hearten one another, the elders to guide the youth, and the leaders to direct the masses. Give your assent to the Truth that is immutable and unchangeable, and to the following postulates of a religion that shall never fail. God is one in a unique sense of the term, and Moses is His prophet and spokesman, and the greatest and most perfect of the seers. To him was vouchsafed by God what has never been vouchsafed to any prophet before him, nor will it be in the future. The entire Torah was divinely revealed to Moses of whom it was said, ""with him do I speak mouth to mouth."" (Numbers 12:8). It will neither be abrogated nor superseded, neither supplemented nor abridged. Never shall it be supplanted by another divine revelation containing positive and negative duties. Keep well in mind the Revelation on Sinai in accordance with the divine precept to perpetuate the memory of this occasion and not to allow it to fall into oblivion. Furthermore we were enjoined to impress this event upon the minds of our children, as it is written, ""Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but make them known unto thy children and thy children's children."" (Deuteronomy 4:9). It is imperative, my fellow Jews, that you make this great spectacle of the Revelation appeal to the imagination of your children. Proclaim at public gatherings its momentousness. For this event is the pivot of our religion, and the proof which demonstrates its veracity. Evaluate this phenomenon at its true importance for Scripture has pointed out its significance in the verse, ""For ask now of the days past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the one end of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?"" (Deuteronomy 4:32). Remember, my co-religionists, that this great, incomparable and unique historical event, is attested by the best of evidence. For never before or since, has a whole nation witnessed a revelation from God or beheld His splendor. The purpose of all this was to confirm us in the faith so that nothing can change it, and to reach a degree of certainty which will sustain us in these trying times of fierce persecution and absolute tyranny, as it is written, ""for God is come to test you."" (Exodus 20:17). Scripture means that God revealed Himself to you thus in order to give you strength to withstand all future trials. Now do not slip nor err, be steadfast in your religion and persevere in your faith and its duties. Solomon, of blessed memory, has compared our people to a beautiful woman with a perfect figure, marred by no defect, in the verse, ""Thou art all fair, my love; and there is no spot in thee."" (Song of Songs 4:7). On the other hand, he depicted the adherents of other religions and faiths, who strive to entice and win us over to their convictions, as courtesans who lure virtuous women for lewd purposes. Similarly they seek devices to trap us into embracing their religions, and subscribing to their doctrines. To these who endeavor to decoy her into avowing the superiority of their creed, our nation deftly replies, ""Why do you take hold of me, can you confer upon me something like the felicity of the two companies?"" She reasons thus, ""If you can furnish us with something like the Revelation on Sinai, in which the camp of Israel faced the camp of the Divine Presence, then we shall espouse your doctrines."" This is metaphorically expressed in the verse, ""Return, return, O Shulammite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will you see in the Shulammite? As it were a dance of two companies."" (Song of Songs 7:1). Now ""Shulammite"" signifies the perfect one; ""A dance of the two companies"" alludes to the joy of the theophany in Mt. Sinai in which both the camp of Israel and the camp of God showed as is intimated in the two following verses: ""Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God,"" (Exodus 19:17), and ""The chariots of God are myriads, even thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in holiness."" (Psalms 68:18). Note well the apt imagery and the deeper significance of the aforementioned verse. The fourfold occurence of the word ""return"" is an allusion to the four empires, each of which will endeavor to coerce us to abandon our faith and embrace theirs. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that we are now living under the aegis of the Fourth Empire. A prediction to this effect is found in the Torah, that our enemies will force us to accept their faith, for we read, ""And there shall ye serve god, the work of men's hands,"" (Deuteronomy 4:28). However, it will not be general throughout the world and God will never deprive us of His Law. As he assured us saying: For it shall not be forgotten from the mouth of his seed. Indeed, Isaiah, the herald of the national redemption, has already stated that Israel's indestructibility is the result of a Divine pact betokened by the perpetuation of the Torah in our midst, and our devotion to its tenets and teachings, as he says, ""And as for Me, this is My covenant with them, saith the Lord; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever."" (Isaiah 59:21). Our nation speaks with pride of the virulent oppression it has suffered, and the sore tribulations it has endured, to quote the words of the Psalmist, ""Nay, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day."" (44:23). The rabbis, of blessed memory, in Midrash Hazita, remark that the verse ""nay, but for Thy sake"" allude to the generation that undergoes persecution. (Midrash Song of Songs I:3, ed. Vilna, f. 13a). Let those persons exult who suffered dire misfortunes, were deprived of their riches, forced into exile and lost their belongings. For the bearing of these hardships is a source of glory and a great achievement in the sight of God. Whoever is visited by these calamities is like a burnt offering upon the altar. We may apply in commendation the verse to them, ""Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, that he may also bestow upon you a blessing this day."" (Exodus 32:29). It behooves the victim for the sake of his religion to escape and flee to the desert and wilderness, and not to consider separation from family or loss of wealth. For they are a slight sacrifice and a paltry offering due to God, King of kings, possessor of all things, the Lord thy God, whose Name is glorious and awful. God may be trusted to compensate you well in this world and in the world to come. We have noted that godly and pious folk who are animated by a desire to get acquainted with the truth and those who are engaged in its pursuit, rush to the divine religion and, wend their way from the most distant parts, to the homes of scholars. They seek to gain increased insight into the law with the concomitant hope that God will amply reward them. How much more is it one's duty to go into exile, if the question of observing the whole Torah is at stake. When a man finds it arduous to gain a livelihood in one country he emigrates to another. All the more is it incumbent upon a Jew who is restricted in the practice of his religion, to depart for another place. If he finds it impossible to leave that locality for the time being, he must not become careless and indulge with abandon in the desecration of the Sabbath and the dietary laws on the assumption that he is exempt from all religious obligations. It is the eternally inescapable duty, willy-nilly, of every one belonging to the stock of Jacob to abide by the Law. Nay, he exposes himself to punishment for the violation of each and every positive or negative precept. Let no man conclude that he may freely disregard the less important ceremonies without liability to penalty because he has committed under duress some major sins. For Jeroboam, son of Nebat, may his bones be ground to dust, was chastised not only for the sin of worshipping the calves and inciting Israel to do the same, but also for his failure to construct a booth on the Feast of Tabernacles. This is one of the fundamental principles of our religion. Understand it aright, teach it, and apply the principle widely."
29,28,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Sanhedrin 6:5","On this point the Tannaim differ. (Deut. 29, 28). The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which are publicly known, belong unto us and to our children for ever, to do all the words of this law. Why are the words unto us and to our children and the letter Ayin of the word ad dotted? This is to teach that for crimes conimitted in secrecy, Israel was not punished until they passed the Jordan. This is the opinion of R. Juda. R. Nechemiah said to him: ""Were then Israel ever punished for crimes committed in secrecy? Behold! It is written [in the ahove passage] forever. Say then that just as they were not punished for secret crimes, so were they not punished for crimes which were done publicly until they passed the Jordan. (Fol. 44) But why was then Achan punished, [since his crime was in secret]? Because his wife and children were aware of it."" (Ib.) Israel hath sinned! R. Abba b. Zabda said: ""Although he had sinned he was still called an Israelite."" R. Abba remarked: ""This is what people say: 'A myrtle, even if it stands between willows, is still a myrtle by name, and people call it a myrtle.'"" (Josh. 7, 11) Yea, they have even transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; yea they have even taken of the devoted things; and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have even put it among their own stuff; R. Illai said in the name of R. Juda b. Massaparta: ""We infer from the above passage, that Achan had transgrassed all that is written in the five books of the Torah; for the word Gam (also) is mentioned five times in the above passage."" "
29,28,Midrash,Sifrei Bamidbar 69:2,"""from a distant (rechokah) way"": There is a (diacritical) dot above the heh in ""rechokah"" (to indicate that he observes Pesach Sheni) even if he were on a non-distant way and did not observe (the first) Pesach with them. Similarly, (Bereshit 16;5) ""May the L-rd judge between me (Sarah) and between you (Abraham) (uvenecha)"": There is a dot above (the yod in) ""uvenecha"" — She spoke of Hagar alone. Others say: (She spoke of Hagar) who engendered strife between him and her. Similarly, (Ibid. 18:9) ""And they said to him (eilav): Where is Sarah, your wife?"" There are dots above the aleph, yod and vav (in ""eilav"") — They knew where she was. Similarly (Ibid. 19:33) ""and he did not know in her lying and in her rising (uvekumah)."" There is a dot above (the vav in) ""uvekumah"" — He did not know in her lying and in her rising, but he knew in her rising. Similarly, (Ibid. 33:4) ""And he (Esav) kissed (vayishakehu) him (Jacob)"": There are dots above (all the letters in) ""vayishakehu"" — He did not kiss him with all his heart. R. Shimon b. Yochai says: It is a known halachah that Esav hates Jacob, but his mercy gained the ascendancy at that time and he kissed him with all his heart. (Ibid. 37:12) ""And his brothers went to graze eth their father's flock in Shchem"": There are dots above ""eth"" — They went only to graze themselves. Similarly, (Bamidbar 21:30) ""We have laid it waste until Nofach which (asher) reaches unto Medva"": There is a dot (above the resh in ""asher"") — They did so beyond that (Nofach) too, but here they destroyed the cities, too, whereas beyond that they destroyed only the people. Similarly, (Ibid. 3:39) ""All the numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered"": There are dots above ""Aaron"" — Aaron was not of the numbered (of the Levites). Similarly, (Ibid. 3:29) ""And issaron, issaron, for the one lamb,"": There is a dot above the second vav in ""And issaron"" — There was one issaron alone. Similarly, (Devarim 29:28) ""The hidden things are for the L-rd our G-d and the revealed ones are for us and our children (lanu ulevanenu) forever."": There are dots (above ""lanu ulevanenu."") He said to them: If you have done (i.e., violated) what is revealed, I (the L-rd), likewise, will apprise you of what is concealed. Here, too, (in our instance,) there is a dot (above the heh in ""rechokah"" to indicate that he observes Pesach Sheni) even if he were on a non-distant way and did not observe (the first) Pesach with them. (Ibid. 10) ""or to your generations"": This provision (of Pesach Sheni) obtains for all of the generations. (Ibid. 11) ""In the second month, on the fourteenth day, towards evening shall they offer it"": These are the mitzvoth (directly) pertaining to its body, viz. (Shemot 12:5) ""an unblemished lamb, a male, of the first year."" ""with matzoh and bitter herbs shall they eat it"": These are mitzvoth attendant upon its body. (Devarim, Ibid. 12) ""They shall not leave over of it until the morning, and a bone shall they not break in it"": Scripture hereby superadds two mitzvoth concerning its body. This tells me only of these (as obtaining on Pesach Sheni). Whence do I derive (the same for) the other mitzvoth pertaining to its body? From (Ibid.) ""According to all the statue of the Pesach shall they offer it."" — But perhaps this would also include (the eating of) matzoth for seven days and the burning of chametz! It is, therefore, written ""and a bone shall they not break in it."" ""a bone, etc."" was included in the general category (viz. ""According to all the statute of the Pesach""), and it departed from the category (for special mention) — to teach about the category, viz. Just as ""a bone, etc."" is a mitzvah (directly) pertaining to its body, so, ""according to all the statute of the Pesach"" speaks of mitzvoth (directly) pertaining to its body, (and not of the others). Issi b. Akavya says: ""shall they offer it"": Scripture speaks of mitzvoth pertaining to its body."
29,28,Midrash,Midrash Tehillim 87:5,"Mentioning Rahab and Babylon. Rabbi Yosei bar Simon said: ""All nations are destined to bring gifts to the Messiah, as it is written (Song of Songs 4:8): 'Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the top of Amana, from the tops of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards.' "" Rabbi Simon said, ""Why is a gift called a dorein?"" Because it is compared to a woman who looks at herself and sings, as it is written (Job 7:8): 'The eye that saw me shall see me no more; your eyes are upon me, and I am not.' And when the nations come before the Messiah, he will say to them, 'Is there among you any Israelite who brought them to me?' as it is said (Psalm 96:7), 'Ascribe to the Lord, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.' The peoples brought me the families of Israel. Rabbi Aha said, ""And he tells them, 'Bring them to me with honor, not with shame,' as it is said (Psalm 29:2), 'Ascribe to the Lord the glory of his name; worship the Lord in holy splendor.' Those who honored him in this world and gave glory to his name."" Rabbi Berechiah said in the name of Rabbi Judah (Isaiah 18:7), ""In that time shall a present be brought to the Lord of hosts by a people tall and smooth, even from the beginning onward, a nation meted out and trodden underfoot, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Zion."" The letters of ""jubilee year"" spell ""with them,"" because they bring gifts to the Messiah, as it is said (Zechariah 14:16), ""And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles."" Rabbi Berechiah said, ""The elders among them who cannot walk, what do they do? They bring gifts and carry them in their hands. What is the meaning of honor when they bring gifts? And when they bring them and they go to leave, and he says, 'This one is a priest, this one is a Levite, this one is an Israelite,' it is as if they were sold into slavery and forgotten and made into Gentiles by force, I accept them. For it is said (Isaiah 56:7), 'Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar: for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.' And where did it say (Deuteronomy 29:28), 'The secret things belong to the Lord our God'?"
29,28,Chasidut,"Kedushat Levi, Genesis, Bereshit 1","The first thing G’d embarked on when creating the material universe was to create heaven and ‎earth.”  It is an axiom, general principle, that G’d created the entire universe, and having done so, ‎never withdraws from the universe for even a single moment, [unlike sculptors or painters who, ‎once they have completed a sculpture or painting, move on to something else, having “finished” ‎with their previous “creation.” Ed.] This axiom is true both of what He created in the heavens and ‎what He created in the material, three-dimensional part of the universe. We pay tribute to this in ‎our daily prayers when we say ‎יוצר אור ובורא חושך‎, “He creates and fashions (present tense) light, ‎and He creates darkness.” When speaking of any accomplishments of G’d’s creatures however, we ‎speak of them in the past tense, i.e.‎יצר כסא‎, “he shaped a chair,” or ‎עשה מזרון‎, “he made a ‎mattress.” G’d’s creative activity is never completed, as the Torah testified in Genesis 2,3 ‎אשר ברא ‏אלוקים לעשות‎, “which the Lord has created in order to complete it.” This means that G’d is part of ‎every creature He ever created, and once man realizes that he is nothing without G’d Who has ‎created him and Who provides him with all the strength and creative stimuli that he possesses, he ‎will be able to relate to Hashem as an ongoing creative Force in His universe. This is ‎reflected every morning when we get up [after having used the washroom] and we refer to G’d ‎with the words ‎אשר יצר את האדם בחכמה‎, “Who has fashioned man with ‎חכמה‎,” the word ‎חכמה‎ ‎meaning the opposite of ‎אין‎, “nothing.” It is appropriate therefore that in that prayer we refer to ‎the creation of man in the past tense, as opposed to the line we quoted earlier, seeing that we ‎refer to something or somebody who already exists, i.e. ‎יש‎. This explains why the Ari z’al , ‎Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, said that when we refer to G’d as ‎ה' מלך‎, usually translated as “Hashem ‎‎is King,” the reference is to the ‎אין‎, “nothing,” i.e. G’d at any given moment ‎gives us life, -by not withdrawing it from us.- The implied meaning of the expression is that man is ‎‎“nothing” unless he continues to exist as part of G’d’s creative activity. The so-called ‎אין‎, “nothing,” ‎in terms of metaphysical beings, rules supreme in the regions beyond those that are part of the ‎physical universe, the one that we conveniently refer to as “nature.” This so-called ‎אין‎, is not really ‎a “nothing,” in terms of the universe, its “nothingness” is such only vis a vis the ‎physical part of the universe; in the celestial regions this “‎אין‎” rules supreme. [as opposed to the ‎חכמה‎ in our part of the universe. Ed. Although ‎יש‎ and ‎אין‎ are popularly perceived as absolute ‎opposites, not having anything in common, this perception is built on a fallacy; the linkage between ‎יש‎ and ‎אין‎ are the mitzvot, Torah commandments, performed by the Jewish people. The ‎commandments are performed in the section of the universe known as ‎יש‎, as a result of which ‎close contact is maintained between the aforementioned two domains of the universe. Ezekiel 1:14 refers to the “mitzvot” in their capacity as providing the link between the terrestrial ‎and the celestial part of the universe with the words ‎והחיות רצוא ושוב‎, “and the chayot ran ‎to and fro”. According to the Zohar II 288, the mitzvot and the Torah respectively, ‎are viewed as related to one another like the “hidden” is related to the “revealed,” both being part ‎of the same whole. Torah and mitzvot provide the link between these two domains, so that ‎each domain is not completely divorced from the other. This concept is contained in the letters of ‎the word ‎מצוה‎ when we divide it up into ‎מצ‎ and ‎וה‎. The letters ‎מצ‎ when we read the alphabet ‎backwards, starting with the letter ‎ת‎ are equivalent to the letters ‎יה‎, symbolising the totally ‎abstract Divinity, whereas the letters ‎וה‎ symbolize the hidden parts of the universe, ‎יש‎. The first ‎half of the word ‎מצוה‎ being read with the two letters used in reverse order of the aleph ‎‎bet, alludes to the “hidden” part of the universe, the domain exclusive to Divine, abstract ‎forces. Let us explain something about what precisely is “hidden” and what is “revealed,” when it ‎comes to the ‎מצוה‎, “Torah commandment.” When we perform a ‎מצוה‎, we cause G’d to become ‎pleased with having created man, the choicest of His creatures. When we comply with requests ‎made to us by a fellow human being, we can immediately gauge whether he is pleased by our ‎actions or not, either by his face indicating this, or by words of approval, something that is not the ‎case when we comply with G’d’s requests from us. Since He is invisible, and does not speak to us ‎as He did to Moses, “mouth to mouth”, we have no way of knowing if our efforts to please Him ‎have been successful. When we try to perform deeds that are for our (immediate) personal ‎benefit, we are able to determine if our efforts have succeeded. This then is the “hidden” element ‎present whenever we perform any of G’d’s commandments, ‎מצות‎. This is what the Torah had in ‎mind when it wrote (Deuteronomy 29,28) ‎הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו‎, “the hidden aspects of ‎‎mitzvah performance are reserved for the Lord our G’d;” on the other hand, ‎והנגלות לנו ‏ולבנינו עד עולם‎, “the benefits which the performance of the Torah confers upon us will be ‎revealed forever.” This is also the meaning of the words ‎בראשית ברא אלוקים‎, (addressed to us) “at ‎the beginning of G’d’s creative activity G’d created the ‎יש‎, a physical domain of the universe.” ‎Through His creating ‎יש‎, i.e. ‎ראשית‎, a beginning, the creation of heaven and earth came into being, ‎for prior to that there was only the ‎אין‎, the abstract universe. This is the meaning of Targum ‎‎Yerushalmi who renders this verse as‎ 'בראשית בחוכמא ברא ה‎', “at the beginning G’d created ‎by means of using intelligence found in the domain of the abstract regions.” ‎חכמה‎, as we pointed ‎out earlier, is a quality inherent in the terrestrial domain.‎"
29,28,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah 7:7","There is the possibility that a prophet will experience prophecy for his own sake alone - i.e., to expand his mental capacities and to increase his knowledge - [allowing him] to know more about the lofty concepts than he knew before. It is also possible that he will be sent to one of the nations of the world, or to the inhabitants of a particular city or kingdom, to prepare them and to inform them what they should do or to prevent them [from continuing] the evil which they are doing. When he is sent [on such a mission], he is given a sign or a wonder [to perform], so that the people will know that God has truly sent him. Not everyone who performs signs or wonders should be accepted as a prophet: only a person who is known to be fit for prophecy beforehand; i.e., his wisdom and his [good] deeds surpass those of all his contemporaries. If he follows the paths of prophecy in holiness, separating himself from worldly matters, and afterwards performs a sign or wonder and states that he was sent by God, it is a mitzvah to listen to him, as [Deuteronomy 18:15] states: ""Listen to him."" It is possible that a person will perform a sign or wonder even though he is not a prophet - rather, the wonder will have [another cause] behind it. It is, nevertheless, a mitzvah to listen to him. Since he is a wise man of stature and fit for prophecy, we accept [his prophecy as true], for so have we been commanded. [To give an example of a parallel:] We are commanded to render a [legal] judgment based on the testimony of two witnesses. Even though they may testify falsely, since we know them to be acceptable [as witnesses], we presume that they [are telling the truth]. Considering these matters and the like, [Deuteronomy 29:28] states: ""The hidden matters are for God, our Lord, but what is revealed is for us and our children,"" and [I Samuel 16:7] states: ""Man sees what is revealed to the eyes, but God sees into the heart."""
29,28,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah 9:1","It is clear and explicit in the Torah that it is [God's] commandment, remaining forever without change, addition, or diminishment, as [Deuteronomy 13:1] states: ""All these matters which I command to you, you shall be careful to perform. You may not add to it or diminish from it,"" and [Deuteronomy 29:28] states: ""What is revealed is for us and our children forever, to carry out all the words of this Torah."" This teaches that we are commanded to fulfill all the Torah's directives forever. It is also said: ""It is an everlasting statute for all your generations,"" and [Deuteronomy 30:12] states: ""It is not in the heavens."" This teaches that a prophet can no longer add a new precept [to the Torah]. Therefore, if a person will arise, whether Jew or gentile, and perform a sign or wonder and say that God sent him to: a) add a mitzvah, b) withdraw a mitzvah c) explain a mitzvah in a manner which differs from the tradition received from Moses, or d) if he says that the mitzvot commanded to the Jews are not forever, but rather were given for a limited time, he is a false prophet. He comes to deny the prophecy of Moses and should be executed by strangulation, because he dared to make statements in God's name which God never made. God, blessed be His name, commanded Moses that this commandment is for us and our children forever, and, God is not man that He speak falsely."
29,28,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah 9:3","Similarly, a prophet who violated his own prophetic instructions, and one who refrains from prophesying, are liable for death at the hand of God, since concerning the three of them, it is said, ""I will seek [retribution] from him."" When a prophet - who has already proven himself to be a prophet - instructs us to violate one of the mitzvot of the Torah or many mitzvot, whether they be of a severe or light nature, for a limited amount of time, it is a mitzvah to listen to him. The Sages of the early generation taught as part of the oral tradition: If a prophet tells you to violate the precepts of the Torah as Elijah did on Mount Carmel, listen to him with regard to all things except the worship of false gods. This applies when his command is temporary in nature. For example, on Mount Carmel, Elijah offered a sacrifice outside [the Temple's premises], even though Jerusalem was chosen for such [service], and one who offers a sacrifice outside [the Temple's premises] is liable for karet. Since he was [already established as] a prophet, it was a mitzvah to listen to him. The commandment, ""Listen to him,"" applies in these circumstances as well. If they would have asked Elijah: How can we violate the Torah's command [Deuteronomy 12:13]: ""[Be careful...] lest you offer your burnt offerings everywhere""?, he would have told them: We should not say anything, but anyone who offers a sacrifice outside [the Temple premises] is liable for karet, as Moses said. [The present instance,] however, [is an exception]. I am offering a sacrifice today outside [the Temple] at God's command in order to disprove the prophets of Ba'al. Similarly, if any [other] prophet commands us to transgress for a limited time, it is a mitzvah to listen to him. If, however, he says that the mitzvah has been nullified forever, he is liable for execution by strangulation, for the Torah has told us: ""[It is] for us and our children forever."""
29,28,Jewish Thought,"Kol Dodi Dofek, The Covenants of Sinai and Egypt 12","Third, shared suffering is expressed in a feeling of shared obligation and responsibility. When the ‎children of Israel left Egypt, Moses and Aaron fell on their faces, pleaded before God, and said: ‎‎“Lord, God of Hosts of all flesh, shall one man sin and You direct divine wrath at the entire ‎congregation?” (Numbers 16:22).This prayer accomplished that which the “shepherds of Israel” ‎‎(Ezekiel 34:2) sought. The Holy One agreed with their action and only punished Korah and his ‎cohorts. However, God only demonstrated this loving-kindness momentarily. Forever after, the “I” ‎is ensnared in the sin of his fellow, if he had it within his power to reprimand, admonish, and bring ‎his neighbor to repentance. The people of Israel have a collective responsibility, both halakhic and ‎moral, for one another. The discrete units coalesce into a single halakhic-moral unity, with one all-‎encompassing and normative conscience and consciousness. The halakhah has already decreed ‎that “all Jews are sureties for one another” (TB Shavu’ot 39a), such that one who has already ‎fulfilled his personal mitzvah is not considered fully absolved thereby and may therefore fulfill the ‎obligation on behalf of others who have not as yet done so. The “I” is not exempt from its ‎obligation so long as his neighbor has not fulfilled that which is incumbent upon him. There is a ‎special covenant of mutual responsibility among the children of Israel. This covenant is expressed ‎in the blessings and imprecations pronounced on Mounts Gerizim and Ebal (Deuteronomy 11:29). ‎It is based upon the notion of peoplehood revealed to Moses in Egypt. Out of this concept grew ‎the covenant of mutual obligation. Moses, the dean of all prophets, in relating this covenant of ‎mutual obligation, emphasized: “For that He may establish you today unto Him as a people, and He ‎shall be unto you as a God” (Deuteronomy 29:12). He thus returned to the formulation of the ‎Covenant of Egypt. “And I will take you to Me as a people, and I will be your God” (Exodus 6:7). ‎Here the notion of shared fate was elevated from the plane of communal-political suffering to that ‎of halakhic and moral responsibility. We are all sureties for one another, as it is said: “And the ‎revelations belong to us and to our children forever” (Deuteronomy 29:28).‎12"
29,28,Kabbalah,"Ohr Ne'erav, PART I 1:35","Who has caused these people to chase after the simple meaning [of Scripture] and ignore the esoteric portions? It is you dullards [who] hate knowledge (Prov. 1:23), meaning the knowledge of hidden things. What is written [in the verse] after that? You are indifferent to my rebuke, I will now speak my mind to you. This means that the soul which is enwrapped in the simple meaning [is now addressed]: I will now speak my mind to you and let you know my thoughts concerning the secrets which I possess. And you spurned [my counsel](Prov: 1:25) … Then they will call upon me [but I will not answer (Prov. 1:28). This is why [the passage] states, “This concerns one who removes Kabbalah and wisdom. [Kabbalah] means the written Torah, [which symbolizes] Tiferet, and [wisdom] refers to the oral Torah, which is Malkhut. This is the mystery of the vav heh in which the yod heh is concealed, (Cf. n. 18 above.)  as it is written, The hidden things are for the Lord our God. There the secret of God is revealed—to us and our children forever (Deut. 29:28)."
29,28,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 5","“The secret things belong unto Hashem our God, and the revealed things are for us and our children, forever, to do all the words of this Torah.” (Devarim, 29:28) It is written in the Gemara (Sanhedrin, 44a), The Tannaim (Talmudic Masters) argue the following point. The secret matters belong unto God, but revealed matters belong to our children and us forever. Why are the words Lanu u-lebanenu [unto us and to our children] and the ‘ayin of the word ‘ad, [forever] dotted? In order to teach that God did not punish secret transgressions until the Israelites had crossed the Jordan. this is the view of Rav Yehuda. Said Rav Nehemia to him, “Did God ever punish all of Israel for crimes committed in secret? Does not the Torah say forever? But just as God did not punish Israel for secret transgressions [at any time], so too did He not punish them as a whole for revealed transgressions until they had crossed the Jordan.” So why where they punished in the case of Achan? It is because his wife and children knew thereof [so the transgression was no longer secret], therefore all of Israel was punished. (In Chapters 6 and 7 of the book of Yehoshua, it relates how the spoils of the battle of Jericho were banned, saying, “cursed be the man who rises up and builds of this city.”Achan had taken some of the spoils, and God related to Yehoshua that because of this 30,000 of his men were killed in the battle of Ai that followed.)  One could say that the answer of the Gemara, “because his wife and children knew thereof [so the transgression was no longer secret],” is not enough, for from this it would seem that not all of Israel, but only the ones who knew of the transgression should have been punished. We can explain this in the following way. When a man transgresses in secret, unknown to anyone else, then his sin is not pertinent to the whole community of Israel, but it is rather of the secret things that belong to Hashem our God (and He decides how to deal with that individual). God is called, Rav Chesed, the Great One of Kindness, and He is called the one who tilts the unworthy to the side of mercy. He clarifies the action for the good, but we only find this attribute in God. However, if there is another person who witnessed or knows of his fellow’s sin, then the sin becomes pertinent to the whole community of Israel. This is because the very act of witnessing another’s sin is testimony that the very deficiency also exists within him, or within another member of Israel, (even if with him it never materialized in action). For this reason, God made him witness the sin. Certainly the one who saw his fellow man’s evil action felt a stir of teshuva (repentance) in his own heart. Therefore, this affair pertains to the entire community of Israel, for “all of Israel are responsible for one another.” In this fashion does it say in the passage about the one who cursed in Parshat Emor (Vayikra, 24:14), “and they shall lay their hands upon the head [of the one who cursed].” They placed their hands on his head exactly as they did with an animal brought for sacrifice in the Temple. All of Israel needed atonement because they had heard the curse, and in him, they achieved atonement."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 18:21:1","וכי תאמר בלבבך, “If you were to say in your heart, etc.” [Our author quotes Nachmanides although he does not say so. Ed.] Our sages (Sifri) do not view the word וכי in our verse as a conditional “if,” but as a prediction by Moses of what will happen in the future, a prediction that has been documented as having occurred in Jeremiah chapter 28. (About the false prophet Chananyah, and how Jeremiah dealt with him.) What prompted the sages to interpret the word וכי in this manner is that Moses did not say “ואם,” which would have clearly been something conditional. If you were to ask: “since when does the Torah make it a practice to allude to events in the future?” The reason the Torah does so at this stage is to remind future readers of the Torah that when such a man as Chananyah appears, the people, remembering what they had read here, should ask for verification of the prophet’s legitimacy. 
    [Unbelievably, in Jeremiahs time, when true to his prediction the holy vessels of the Temple had already been plundered by Nevuchadnezzar, the people did not question the rosy predictions of Chananyah, but tended to disbelieve the established and proven prophet Jeremiah, presumably because they were thirsty for “good” prophecies rather than becoming penitents and to regain favour in the eyes of Hashem. Ed.]
    Why did the Torah not also portray the people as asking: “how do we know that the word that comes out of the mouth of the prophet is that which Hashem had told him to convey to us?” Seeing that it is the Torah’s principal purpose here to instruct us to execute false prophets, there was no need to spell this out, seeing that the predictions of a true prophet come true. When they do, the prophet enjoys such a high degree of trust by the people that even when he orders violation of a Torah commandment on a temporary basis, he does not become disqualified. A prominent example is Elijah rebuilding an altar that had long been in disuse and disrepair and forbidden as a “private altar” once the Temple had been erected. The word כמוך in verse 18 already contained the authority for the people to remain loyal to an established prophet, even if he commanded something that appears to conflict with the Torah’s law, provided he does not try to abrogate this law but demands temporarily ignoring such a law due to an emergency. When the prophet does predict a future event, after specifying the when and where, and it comes true, this legitimizes him, just as it legitimized Moses in the eyes of Pharaoh when the Nile turned into blood, and the frogs swarmed all over the country, all at the time predicted.
    Rashi felt that our verse was not needed to spell out the penalty for a false prophet as the Torah had already done so in 13,2 where the Torah legislated the death penalty even though the prediction of that “prophet” had come true, because the man in question had tried to get his listeners to violate Torah law. He felt that regardless of the stature of the “prophet,” he has to legitimize himself not only by his piety but also by a miracle that comes true. If, after both these conditions have been met, he once asks you to violate or tolerate violation of Torah law, such as Elijah did at Mount Carmel, this is no reason for you to disown that prophet. We do no less when we convict someone to death on the strength of the testimony of two witnesses whose lifestyle entitles them to be considered trustworthy as Torah observant. Maimonides considers the latter argument as a גזרת הכתוב, Divine decree, not capable of being upheld by human reasoning. Such matters all belong to what Moses described in Deut. 29,28 as הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, “matters which are concealed form our eyes, are revealed to Hashem,” (Who will take care of them in His own way.)
"
29,28,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 29:28:1","הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, “The hidden [sins] are for Hashem our G’d, etc.“ Nachmanides writes that all the commentators understand the verse to mean that sins committed in private, unobserved, will be taken care of by Hashem, instead of by a human tribunal, whereas sins committed in public and witnessed, must not be simply left to His discretion to deal with.
    He adds, that from the plain meaning of the text it would seem that the sins described as הנסתרות, are the ones concealed even from the sinner, i.e. he was not aware of having committed them. Our sages have composed prayers in which we constantly ask G’d to protect us against committing such sins inadvertently committed. (Compare Psalms 19,13) In appreciation of not being made responsible for such sins, Moses says that we will take care of knowingly committed sins, do penance, etc., and ask G’d’s forgiveness and undertake not to be negligent again. The curses Moses has called down on sinners do not apply to people who have sinned unintentionally.
"
29,28,Responsa,"Iggerot HaRambam, Iggeret Teiman 11","In your letter you mention that the apostle has spurred on a number of people to believe that several verses in Scripture allude to the Madman, such as ""bimeod meod""5 (Genesis 17:20), ""he shined forth from Mount Paran""6 (Deuteronomy 33:1), ""a prophet from the midst of thee"" (Deuteronomy 18:15), and the promise to Ishmael ""I will make him a great nation"" (Genesis 17:20). These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; nay, to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. For these are not matters that can confuse the minds of anyone. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them, believe in them or entertain any illusions about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. But the Muslims themselves put no faith in their own arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so fallacious. Inasmuch as the Muslims could not find a single proof in the entire Bible nor a reference or possible allusion to their prophet which they could utilize, they were compelled to accuse us saying, ""You have altered the text of the Torah, and expunged every trace of the name of Mohammed therefrom."" They could find nothing stronger than this ignominious argument the falsity of which is easily demonstrated to one and all by the following facts. First, Scripture was translated into Syriac, Greek, Persian and Latin hundreds of years before the appearance of Mohammed. Secondly, there is a uniform tradition as to the text of the Bible both in the East and the West, with the result that no differences in the text exist at all, not even in the vocalization, for they are all correct. Nor do any differences effecting the meaning exist. The motive for their accusation lies therefore, in the absence of any allusion to Mohammed in the Torah. The phrase ""a great nation"" cited above does not connote a people in possession of prophecy or a Law, but merely one large in numbers just as in reference to idolaters Scripture says ""nations greater and mightier than yourselves."" (Deuteronomy 11:23). Similarly, the phrase ""bimeod meod"" simply signifies ""exceedingly."" Were there any allusion in the verse to Mohammed, then it would have read ""and I shall bless him bimeod meod,"" and whoever likes to hang on to a spider's web might then discover a reference to Mohammed therein. As it is, since Scripture says ""I shall increase him bimeod meod,"" it can only denote an extravagant increment in numbers. There is no question that the Divine assurance to Abraham to bless his descendants, to reveal the Torah to them, and to make them the Chosen People, refers only to the offspring of Isaac. For Ishmael is mentioned as an adjunct and appendage in the blessing of Isaac, which reads ""and also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation."" (Genesis 21:13). This verse suggests that Isaac holds a primary position and Ishmael a subordinate place. This point is made even more explicit in the blessing which ignores Ishmael entirely. ""For in Isaac shall seed be called in thee."" (Genesis 21:12). The meaning of God's promise to Abraham is that the issue of Ishmael will be vast in numbers but neither pre-eminent nor the object of divine favor, nor distinguished for the attainment of excellence. Not because of them will Abraham be famed or celebrated, but by the noted and illustrious scions of Isaac. The phrase ""shall be called"" simply means, shall be renowned, as it does in the verse, ""Let thy name be called in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac."" (Genesis 48:16). Other verses also indicate that when God promised Abraham that His law would be vouchsafed to his children as is implied in the words ""And I will be their God"" (Genesis 17:8), He meant Isaac to the exclusion of Ishmael as is intimated in the declaration ""But My covenant will I establish with Isaac"" (Genesis 17:21), although He had already conferred His favor upon Ishmael when He said ""Behold I have blessed him"" (Genesis 17:20). Similarly, Isaac by bestowing the blessing of Abraham upon Jacob exclusively, debarred Esau from it, as we read in his benediction ""And may He give you the blessing of Abraham"" (Genesis 28:4). To sum up, the Divine covenant made with Abraham to grant the sublime Law to his descendants referred exclusively to those who belonged to the stock of both Isaac and Jacob. Hence the prophet expresses his gratitude to God for ""the covenant which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac, which He established unto Jacob for a statute, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant."" (Psalms 105:9, I Chronicles 16:16). It is also to be noted that the name of the Arabian prophet which the Mahommedans believe to be mentioned in the Torah, by way of allusion, which the Jewish apostates find in the phrase ""bimeod meod,"" is A.H.M.D. and not M.H.M.D. So it is explicitly stated in the Koran: ""They find him mentioned in the Torah and the Gospels (Sura 7:156); his name is Ahmad."" But the numerical value7 of the latter is not equal to that of the words ""bimeod meod"" which is supposed to contain an allusion to the prophet of Islam. The argument from the phrase ""He shined forth from Mount Paran"" (Deuteronomy 33:2) is easily refutable. Shined is past tense. Had Scripture employed the future tense ""he will shine forth from Mount Paran"" then the imposters might have had a semblance of truth on their side. However the use of the past tense ""he shined forth"" demonstrates that this phrase describes an event that has taken place, namely the theophany on Sinai. When the Deity was about to reveal Himself on Sinai, the heavenly light did not descend suddenly like a thunder-bolt, but came down gently, manifesting itself gradually first from the top of one mountain, then from another, until He reached His abode on Sinai. This notion is implied in the verse ""The Lord revealed himself at Sinai, after His light had radiated to them from Seir and glimmered from Mount Paran."" (Deuteronomy 33:2). Mark well, that the phrase ""unto them"" refers to Israel. Note also how Scripture indicates the various gradations in the intensity of the Divine Splendor. It speaks of the light that glimmered from Mount Paran which is further removed from Sinai, but of the light that radiated from Mount Seir, which is nearer to it, and finally of the revelation of the full splendor of God on Sinai which was the goal of the theophany as is related in the verse ""And the glory of God abode on Mount Sinai"" (Exodus 24:16), ""and the Lord came from Sinai"". (Deuteronomy 33:2). Similarly, the idea that the light descended gradually from mountain to mountain is conveyed in Deborah's description of the grandeur of Israel at the Revelation on Sinai when she exclaimed ""Lord when Thou didst go forth out of Seir, when Thou didst march out of the field of Edom"" (Judges 5:4). Our sages of blessed memory, tell us that God, may He be praised and exalted, charged a prophet before the time of Moses to go to the Romans and another to go to the Arabs with the purpose of presenting them the Torah, but each of them in turn spurned it. When Moses was later sent to us we signified our acceptance in the words ""All that the Lord hath spoken will we do, and obey"" (Exodus 24:7). The aforementioned event happened before the Sinaitic Revelation, consequently Scripture speaks in the past tense: ""He came, radiated forth, and shone,"" which proves that no prophecy is intended in these words."" You write in your letter, that some people were duped by the argument that Mohammed is alluded to in the verse ""A prophet will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren"" (Deuteronomy 18:15), while others remained unconvinced because of the phrase ""from the midst of thee."" It is most astonishing that some folks should be deluded by such specious proof, while others were almost persuaded, were it not for the phrase ""from the midst of thee."" Under these circumstance it is incumbent upon you to concentrate and understand my view in the matter. Remember that it is not right to take a passage out of its context and to draw inferences from it. It is imperative to take into consideration the preceding and following statements in order to fathom the writer's meaning and purpose before making any deductions. Were it otherwise, then it would be possible to assert that Scripture has prohibited obedience to any prophet, and interdicted belief in miracles, by quoting the verse, ""Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet,"" (Deuteronomy 13:4). It could likewise be affirmed that a positive command exists requiring us to worship idols, by citing the verse ""And ye shall serve other gods"" (Deuteronomy 11:16). Other illustrations could be multiplied ad libidinem. To sum up, it is wrong to interpret any given verse apart from its context. In order to comprehend unequivocally the verse under discussion namely, ""A prophet will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren,"" it is necessary to ascertain its context. The beginning of the paragraph whence the verse is taken, contains prohibitions of the acts of soothsaying, augury, divination, astrology, sorcery, incantation and the like. The Gentiles believe that through these practices they can predict the future course of events and take the necessary precautions to forestall them. The interdiction of these occult proceedings were accompanied with the explanation that the Gentiles believe they can depend upon them to determine future happenings. But you may not do so. You will learn about the time to come from a prophet who will rise up among you, whose predictions will come true without fail. You will thus arrive at a foreknowledge of circumstances without being obliged to resort to augury, divination, astrology and the like, for he will spare you that. Matters will be facilitated for you by the fact that this prophet will live within your borders. You will not be compelled to go in search after him from country to country, nor to travel to distant parts, as is implied in the phrase, ""from the midst of thee."" Moreover, another notion is conveyed in the words ""from the midst of thee from thy brethren like unto me,"" namely, that he will be one of you, that is, a Jew. The obvious deduction is that you shall be distinguished above all others for the sole possession of prophecy. The words ""like unto me"" were specifically added to indicate that only the descendants of Jacob are meant. For the phrase ""of thy brethren"" by itself might have been misunderstood and taken to refer also to Esau and Ishmael, since we do find Israel addressing Esau as brother, for example, in the verse, ""Thus saith thy brother Israel"" (Numbers 20:14). On the other hand, the words ""like unto me,"" do not denote a prophet as great as Moses, for this interpretation is precluded by the statement ""And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses."" (Deuteronomy 34:10). The general drift of the chapter points to the correctness of our interpretation and will be confirmed by the succession of the verses, to wit ""There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire etc.,"" (Deuteronomy 18:10), ""For these nations, that thou art to dispossess, hearken unto soothsayers, and unto diviners; but as for thee, the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do ."" (Verse 14). ""A prophet will the Lord why [sic] God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of they brethren, like unto me,"" (Verse 15). It is obviously clear that the prophet alluded to here will not be a person who will produce a new law, or found a new religion. He will merely enable us to dispense with diviners and astrologers, and will be available for consultation concerning anything that may befall us, just as the Gentiles confer with soothsayers and prognosticators. Thus we find Saul advising with Samuel concerning his lost asses, as we read, ""Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said: 'Come and let us go to the seer'; for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer."" (Samuel 9:9). Our disbelief in the prophecy of Omar and Zeid8 is not due to the fact that they are non-Jews, as the unlettered folk imagine, and in consequence of which they are compelled to justify their standpoint by the Biblical statement ""from thy midst, out of thy brethren."" For Job, Zophar, Bildad, Eliphaz, and Elihu are all considered prophets and are non-Jews. On the other hand, although Hananiah, the son of Azur was a Jew, he was deemed an accursed and false prophet. Whether one should yield credence to a prophet or not depends upon the nature of his doctrines, and not upon his race, as we shall explain presently. Our ancestors have witnessed Moses, our Teacher, foremost among the prophets, holding a colloquy with the Divinity, reposed implicit faith in him when they said to him, ""Go thou near and hear,"" (Deuteronomy 5:24). Now he assured us that no other law remained in heaven that would subsequently be revealed, nor would there even be another Divine dispensation, as the verse, ""It is not in heaven,"" (Deuteronomy 30:12) implies. Scripture prohibits us from making any amendments to the Law or eliminating anything, for we read ""Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it"" (Deuteronomy 13:1). We pledged and obligated ourselves to God to abide by His Law, we, our children, and our children's children, until the end of time as Scripture says ""The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever."" (Deuteronomy 29:28). Any prophet, therefore, no matter what his pedigree is, be he priest, Levite, or Amalekite, is perfidious even if he asserts that only one of the precepts of the Torah is void, in view of the Mosaic pronouncement ""unto us and unto our children forever."" Such a one we would declare a false prophet and would execute him if we had jurisdiction over him. We would take no notice of the miracles that he might perform, just as we would disregard the wonder-working of one who seeks to lure people to idolatry, as we are enjoined in the verse ""And the sign or wonder came to pass ... thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet"" (Deuteronomy 13:3). Since Moses, of blessed memory, has prohibited image worship for all the time, we know that the miracles of a would-be-seducer to idolatry are wrought by trickery and sorcery, Similarly, since Moses has taught us that the Law is eternal, we stamp definitely as a prevaricator any one who argues that it was destined to be in force for a fixed duration of time, because he contravenes Moses. Consequently we pay no attention to his assertions or supernatural performances. Inasmuch as we do not believe in Moses because of his miracles, we are under no obligations to institute comparison between his miracles and those of others. Our everlastingly firm trust and steadfast faith in Moses is due to the fact that our forebears as well as he, had heard the Divine discourse on Sinai, as it is intimated in the Scripture, ""and they will also believe thee forever"" (Exodus 19:9). This event is analogous to the situation of two witnesses who observed a certain act simultaneously. Each of them saw what his fellow saw and each of them is sure of the truth of the statement of his fellow, and does not require proof or demonstration, whereas other people, to whom they would report their testimony, would not be convinced without confirmation or certification. Similarly, we of the Jewish faith, are convinced of the truth of the prophecy of Moses, inasmuch as our ancestors in common with him witnessed the Divine revelation on Sinai, and not merely because of his miracles.9 He performed all of these only as the occasion demanded and as is recorded in Scripture. We do not give credence to the tenets of a miracle worker, in the same way we trust in the truth of Moses our Teacher, nor does any analogy exist between them. This distinction is a fundamental principle of our religion, but seems to have fallen into oblivion, and has been disregarded by our co-religionists. This thought was present in the mind of Solomon when he addressed the Gentiles in behalf of Israel, ""What will you see in the Shulamite? as it were a dance of two companies."" (Song of Songs 7:1). The verse means to say, ""If you can produce anything like the revelation on Sinai then we shall concede some misgivings concerning Moses."" If a Jewish or Gentile prophet urges and encourages people to follow the religion of Moses without adding thereto or diminishing therefrom, like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the others, we demand a miracle from him. If he can perform it we recognize him and bestow upon him the honor due to a prophet, but if he fails to do so, he is put to death. We require only a miracle as his credentials, although it may be wrought by stratagem or magic, just as we accept the evidence of witnesses although there is a possibility of perjury. For we are divinely commanded through Moses to render judgment in a suit at law in accordance with the testimony of two witnesses, the possibility of false swearing notwithstanding. Similarly we are enjoined to yield obedience to one who asserts that he is a prophet provided he can substantiate his claims by miracle or proofs, although there is a possibility that he is an impostor. However, if the would-be-prophet teaches tenets that negate the doctrines of Moses, then we must repudiate him. This point was made abundantly clear in the introduction to our large work on the commentary of the Mishnah, where you will find some useful information concerning principles which form the foundation of our religion, and the pillars of our faith. It is incumbent upon you to know that the rule that nothing may ever be added to or diminished from the Laws of Moses, applies equally to the oral law, that is the traditional interpretation transmitted through the sages of blessed memory. Be cautious and on your guard lest any of the heretics, may they speedily perish! mingle among you, for they are worse than apostates. For although this country is, as you know, a place of scholars, students and schools, they indulge in bombastic talk and we warn our people against their occasional errors, heresies and mistakes. As for you, in this distant country, although you are scholars, learned in the law, and pious, you are few in number, may God increase your number and hasten the time of gathering you all together. If any of the heretics rises up to corrupt the people, they will undermine the faith of the young folks and they will not find a savior. Beware of them and know that it is permitted to slay them in our opinion for they repudiate the statement in the prophecy of Moses who commanded us to act ""According to the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee thou shalt do."" (Deuteronomy 17:11). They assert in wicked defiance that they believe most firmly in the prophecy of Moses, as the Arabs and Byzantines say, yet they destroy and nullify his law and kill the adherents thereof. Whoever joins them is just like his seducer. We deemed it imperative to call your attention to these facts, and to raise the young generation on these tenets, because they are a pillar of faith!"
29,28,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Yitro 13:3","Rabbi said: At the time that the Israelites stood at Sinai, all agreed with one accord to receive with joy the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven, as it is said: And all the people answered together, and said (Exod. 19:8). And furthermore, they pledged themselves in behalf of each other. At the time the Holy One, blessed be He, sought to make a covenant with them concerning the hidden and revealed matters, they said: We will make a covenant with Thee concerning the revealed matters, but not concerning that which is hidden, lest one of us sin in secret and the entire congregation be held responsible because of him, as it is said: The secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us (Deut. 29:28), in order that we may perform all the words of this law. Therefore, God spoke all these words."
29,28,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Fourth Treatise on Trust 3:41","But the prophet refrained from giving an answer because each specific case has its own particular reason (there is no general answer which includes everything - TL). Therefore Moshe Rabeinu commented on this in the torah saying (Devarim 29:28) ""the hidden things belong to G-d""..and the wise man said in connection to this ""If you see the oppression of the poor, and perverting of justice and righteousness in a province, marvel not at the matter"" (Koheles 5:7), and the verse says: ""the Rock, His deeds are perfect for all His ways are justice"" (Devarim 32:4)."
29,28,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Fourth Treatise on Trust 4:110","The proof for this view is as follows. G-d has guaranteed to His people that for their visible service, He would give them visible and swift reward in this world. This is explained in parsha Bechukosai ""If you will go in My ways.."" (Vayikra 26), and likewise, for visible sins, visible and swift punishment in this world, because the masses understand only that which is visible not that which is hidden, as written: ""the hidden things belong to G-d, but the revealed things belong to us and to our children, forever"" (Devarim 29:28). And the verse says ""if the people will turn their eyes away from the [evil] acts of this man and his family, I will turn My face to this man and his family"" (Vayikra 20:4). Hence, the reward and punishment for the fulfillment or transgression of the duties of the heart belongs to the Creator. Therefore, Scripture omitted an explanation of their reward and punishment in the next world. (see Tov Halevanon for more details)"
29,28,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Fifth Treatise on Devotion 3:2","But for the duties of the heart, there can be no hypocrisy, nor expectation of honor, respect, or praise on account of fulfilling them since other people cannot look into one's heart. Therefore one's intent in fulfilling them is automatically only to the Watcher, namely, the blessed Creator alone, as written ""I, the L-rd, search the heart, examine the reins.."" (Yirmiya 17:10), and ""the hidden things belong to the L-rd our G-d"" (Devarim 29:28)."
29,28,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Third Treatise on Service of God 9:29","For what is open and revealed in you and what is concealed in you, are equally known to Him. He will requite you for all that His omniscience observes in you, though it remain hidden from human beings. For do you not see that a human judge decides according to what has been established before him as fact, whether on the evidence of witnesses or by his own senses. If what was in the mind could be established for him, he would also take that into account in his decision. Since the blessed Creator knows everything equally well, it follows that He judges according to His knowledge, as it is said: ""The secret things belong to the L-ord, our G-d"" (Deut. 29:28). "
29,28,Talmud,Sanhedrin 43b:10,"The Gemara notes that this is subject to a dispute between tanna’im. The verse states: “The hidden matters belong to the Lord our God, but those matters that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever [ad olam], that we may do all the words of this Torah” (Deuteronomy 29:28). Why in a Torah scroll are there dots over each of the letters in the words “to us and to our children” and over the letter ayin in the word “forever [ad]”? The dots, which function like erasures that weaken the force of the words, teach that God did not punish the nation for hidden sins until the Jewish people crossed the Jordan River. This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda."
29,28,Musar,Orchot Tzadikim 1:26,"And know this — that we are obligated that all our deeds, public or private, be dedicated to God's Holy Name, may He be Exalted, and the whole purpose of service to God should be to attain His will and approval alone and not the approval of men, so as to gather praise and honor for one's deeds. But a person should do all for the sake of God who looks to the heart as it is written: ""I the Lord search the mind and examine the heart"" (Jer. 17:10), and it is said: ""The secret things are known to the Lord our God"" (Deut. 29:28)."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 23:4:1","אלה מועדי ה' מקראי קודש אשר תקראו אותם, “These are the appointed times of the Lord, holy convocations, which you are to proclaim, etc.” The Torah describes all the festivals as related to the attribute Hashem. The reason the word אלה is used to introduce them is that that word symbolises something permanent, enduring. The message is that these festivals will not become redundant through historic developments in the future. As long as this physical universe will continue to exist the Jewish people will continue to observe these festivals. This is also what is meant when the Torah wrote the words לנו ולבנינו עד עולם, “for us and our children forever” (Deut. 29,28), i.e. the laws of the Torah apply for all foreseeable future times.  Tanchuma Pinchas 17 relates that a Gentile once asked Rabbi Akiva why the Jews were still celebrating the festivals when the prophet (Isaiah 1,14) had told the people that “G’d hated your new moons and your festivals, etc.” Rabbi Akiva answered that if Isaiah had spoken of “My new moons, My festivals,” instead of: “your new moons and your festivals,” he would have a point. What G’d hated were the festivals introduced by King Jerobam which were meant to supplant the festivals described in the Torah here. We have been told in Kings I 12,32 that King Jerobam introduced a festival in the eighth month (to supplant Sukkot in the seventh month), a month he had chosen of his own will (verse 34).  Furthermore, it is written in verse 38 of our chapter “apart from the Sabbaths days of the Lord,, etc.” The repetition of the word אלה, “ these,” in verse 37 of our chapter plus the word מלבד in verse 38 are the Torah’s way of saying that no other festivals are to be considered as “G’d’s” festivals. The ones listed in our portion will never be abolished; this is why they are called “G’d’s festivals.” Concerning these festivals the psalmist said in Psalms 111,8: “they are well-founded for all eternity, wrought of truth and equity.”"
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 13:6:2","What we have said so far applies only when such a “prophet” asks the people or some of them to commit an act known to be forbidden as idolatrous. If however, a prophet, who had legitimised himself and had been proven to be a legitimate prophet for an extended period of time, will call on the people to temporarily disregard one of the other commandments of the Torah we must listen to him and continue to believe him and to follow his instructions seeing he made it clear that the suspension of the particular commandment he called for was only temporary. This is the meaning of the words אליו תשמעון, “to him you shall hearken” in Deut. 18,15 where the subject of prophets occurs once more. [if the prophet merely called upon you to perform the commandments of the Torah, the Torah would not have had to tell us that we must be “listening to him;” we would be listening to G’d directly, without the need of a prophet’s call. to do so. Ed.] If we do rely on the miracles performed by such a prophet and do not treat them as deception and sleight of hand this is because he has a חזקה, an established reputation, of being a true prophet. If for some reason unknown to us such a prophet becomes a renegade, the Torah does not consider our being misled by him as our fault, but wrote in Deut. 29,28 הנסתרות לה' אלו-הינו, “hidden matters are G’d’s problem” (not our province to investigate). On the other hand הנגלות לנו ולבנינו , “matters which can be clarified by our using our means of detection, we ourselves are held responsible for.” Man must judge by what his eyes see, only G’d is able to look into a man’s heart (compare Maimonides Hilchot Yessodey Hatorah end of chapter 7). The Talmud Sanhedrin 90 also rules that when an established prophet such as Elijah at the time calls upon you to repair a private altar in order to discredit the priests of the Baal, we are to listen to such a prophet. The exception is if such a prophet were to ask you to commit an act of idolatry. The fact that Elijah offered a sacrifice outside the Temple, something prohibited in Leviticus 17,4 and 9, was prompted only by special circumstances.   Anyone arguing that a commandment should be canceled permanently is a false prophet seeing the commandments of the Torah (unless otherwise stated) are permanent This is the meaning of the last half of the verse we quoted from Deut. 29,28 לנו ולבנינו עד עולם לעשות את כל דברי התורה הזאת, “for us and for our children to carry out all the words of this Torah forever.” What the sages said in respect of Elijah at Mount Carmel is applicable in all similar situations when prophets cancel Torah injunctions as an emergency measure. When Joshua (compare Bamidbar Rabbah 14,5) violated the Sabbath when the priests carrying the shofarot and the Holy Ark marched around Jericho for seven days in a row, he did so at the express command of G’d. This was an emergency. We encounter a similar occurrence with the prophet Elisha in Kings II 3,25 when the Israelites in their battle against Moav cut down fruit-bearing trees and stopped up wells. Although the Torah had expressly forbidden this in Deut. 20,19 the prophet used his authority to set aside this injunction on a temporary basis. If the prophet gives such orders and they sound as if they are meant to be permanent he has discredited himself and people must not listen to his instructions. This is the meaning of a statement in Yevamot 102: “if Elijah were to come and tell you that the rites of chalitzah are performed with a shoe known as מנעל one follows his instructions; if he were to instruct that this procedure must not be performed with a sandal instead, one does not follow his instructions.” [The original practice had been to use a shoe known as מנעל. At the time of the Talmud, sandals had been in use for this for hundreds of years already. Even this established custom a prophet must not cancel permanently. Ed.]  The Talmud in Berachot 24,2 quotes a scholar saying that even if the greatest authority of his time had told him that it was permitted to recite the kriat shema in an otherwise unfit location by placing his hand over his mouth first, he would not obey this scholar in this matter. Moreover, the Talmud is also on record that even when such instructions are issued by means of a bat kol, a heavenly echo, this is without halachic significance when it involves permanent changes of Torah law. Prophecy is a higher authority than a בת קול and all the laws of the Torah have been communicated by the father of all prophets, by Moses. Rabbi Joshua used this latter statement in Baba Metzia 59 to aver that halachic decisions are arrived at by a majority of the competent scholars of their time and are not subject to divine interference (at a time when we have no prophets)."
29,28,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:28:1-7","הנסתרות לה’ אלוקינו והנגלות לנו ולבנינו, “The hidden (sins) are for Hashem, whereas the revealed (sins) are for us and our children forever to deal with.” Rashi comments that the reason why the eleven letters commencing with the letter ל in the word לנו have dots above them is to tell us that G’d did not punish the multitude for revealed sins committed prior to the crossing of the Jordan. Once they confirmed the blessings and curses at Mount Gerizim and Mount Eyval respectively, the period of reciprocal responsibility began. [The following is not found in our editions of Rashi’s commentary. Ed.] Rashi quotes the Jerusalem Talmud in Sotah 7,5 in support of his view. The Talmud quotes that Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said that at these two mountains the people accepted the responsibility for hidden sins.  Joshua had said to them: “if you do not accept reciprocal responsibility for the hidden sins you will all be swept away by a great flood.” Rabbi Shimon ben Sevidai added that we should know that the majority of the sages who were members of the Sanhedrin died during the battle of Ai (after the assembly at Mount Gerizim, proving that the elders are held responsible even for hidden sins, i.e. that of Achan ben Karmi). Joshua said to the people after that, that by the death of these 36 members of the Sanhedrin that בכם הותרה הרצועה “as of now you are held responsible also for hidden sins committed.” [This statement is not found in our editions of the Jerusalem Talmud; I am relying on the notes and research of Rabbi Chavell, Ed.] At that time, a heavenly echo was heard announcing that the Sanhedrin, and certainly lesser dignitaries, have no business investigating hidden sins. There are different interpretations of the meaning of the words בכם הותרה הרצועה. Some say that what is meant is that when Moses had warned the people (29,17) “lest there be amongst you a root flourishing with gall and wormwood,” that as of that time reciprocal responsibility for hidden sins already commenced. [seeing that the people at that time accepted the oath and the covenant. Ed.] This is Rashi’s view as it appears in Sanhedrin 43. The dots really should have appeared also over the letters in the words ל-י-ה-ו-ה אלוקינו in order to show that the hidden sins are not G’d’s exclusive domain to investigate, except that for reasons of etiquette it was deemed inappropriate to place those dots over the name of the Lord. According to Rashi there, although a penalty accrues to the people and/or their leaders for not bringing sinners who committed their sin in private to justice, the duty to investigate if such sins had been committed begins with the time when the people crossed the river Jordan. [If I understand Rashi correctly, investigation of such sins, rather than sentencing the sinner, is of the essence. We have to do what we can in order to become free from this reciprocal responsibility we described earlier. Ed] Seeing the dots could not be placed on the letters of the name of Hashem, they were moved sideways and had to include a dot over the letter ע of the word עד in order to total 11. Nachmanides, tackling the problem, writes as follows: “my opinion is that if we follow the plain meaning of the text the word הנסתרות refers to sins committed in private and not witnessed by credible witnesses. The word reflects David’s exclamation in Psalms 19,13: שגיאות מי יבין מנסתרות נקני, ‘who can be aware of errors? Clear me of unperceived guilt!’ David means that such hidden sins are exclusively G’d’s domain to investigate and to punish. No guilt attaches to the Jewish people or their representatives concerning such sins. However, the revealed sins, הנגלות, are forever our obligation to investigate and deal with as a חוקת עולם, an eternal statute, etc. This responsibility devolves upon us due to the wordsאשר איננו פה , (verse 17) for all future generations. Seeing that with these words all Israelites for all future times had been committed to observe the Torah, etc., the Torah saw fit in our verse to exempt us from sins committed without our knowledge so that we would not be held responsible from the curse devolving us for such sins.” Thus far Nachmanides. The sage Ibn Ezra writes as follows: “the word הנסתרות refers to acts of idolatry committed by individuals in the privacy of their homes. Bringing such people to justice is exclusively G’d’s business; He will take care of such individuals. No guilt attaches to us for the commission of those sins. I have heard it said in the name of Maimonides about this verse that that the words הנסתרות לה’ אלוקינו refer to the fact that mystical dimensions of the Torah, such as the true reason behind the various commandments, are the exclusive domain of the Lord; if man succeeds in revealing even a small portion of such reasons, this does not excuse him from fulfilling the respective commandment in accordance with what the Torah has revealed about it in the text. It is our duty to perform all the commandments as written, even if we are certain that seeing we know the true reason for them this would make performance redundant in our eyes. This is the meaning of והנגלות לנו ולבנינו עד עולם, i.e. “and what has been revealed we are duty bound to fulfill forever more.” While this is a wonderful and profound explanation, it has nothing to do with the text in our paragraph. We must understand the text as related to the previous verse in which the fact that the people have been exiled and apparently abandoned by Hashem has been described. One may explain the whole matter of reciprocal responsibility described here as follows: “the hidden ones (sins) are G’d’s problem, seeing that in the previous verse the syntax is exceedingly long, i.e. the words: ‘The Lord removed them from their soil in anger and wrath and with great fury and He expelled them to another land as of this day.’” The verse is a reference to this long and seemingly interminable exile we find ourselves in. The word הנסתרות is a warning not to try and figure out when this exile will end. This knowledge is reserved for Hashem alone. However, as soon as G’d reveals the advent of the redemption it will become clear that our future and that of our children will endure forever (in spite of the gloom and doom prevailing during the long years of exile). Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to carry out the commandments of the Torah seeing the Torah is valid forever. It will not become redundant even in the days of the Messiah. Its applicability is as basic during the years of exile as during the glorious era following our redemption.  This is reflected in the exegesis by our sages of the words in Deut. 16,3 למען תזכור את יום צאתך מארץ מצרים כל ימי חייך, “in order that you may remember (by the performance of this legislation) the day you came out of Egypt for all the days of your life.” Had the Torah omitted the word כל, “all,” in that verse, I would have been entitled to conclude that when a greater redemption such as that of the Messiah will take place, the provisions to observe Passover will become redundant. Seeing that the Torah wrote the word כל ימי, it is clear that it meant to legislate the observance of Passover (and other laws) even for the period when it is overshadowed by a more recent and all-embracing redemption (Berachot 12). By adopting this explanation, the whole verse by itself as well as how it relates to the previous verse and to what follows becomes crystal clear. As to the missing letter ו in the word הנסתרת which appears as if it were singular, the word as it is should be viewed as an allusion to the שכינה, the hidden Presence of G’d.  After all, G’d had warned us that in times of exile He would “hide” His face from us, אסתירה פני מהם in Deut. 32,20. The reason the Shechinah is described as something hidden is that the clouds of glory covered it both when it was inside the Tabernacle and elsewhere in the desert. The word הנסתרת in our verse may be understood as an appeal to the Lord our G’d by the Shechinah to reveal Himself, for His Presence to become manifest, and to reveal itself when this exile will come to an end. Our sages (Midrash Tehillim 9) follow a similar approach in the way they understand the words אגילה בישועתך, “I want to have a revelation of Your salvation” in Psalms 9,15. Significantly, the psalmist does not speak of ישועתנו, “our salvation,” but of “Your salvation.” This is not the only verse in which the Shechinah is perceived as asking mercy, salvation, for itself from the higher emanation of Hashem. Other verses in Scripture carrying a similar message are found in Isaiah 30,18, as well as in Psalms 60,7 where the words הושיעה ימינך וענני, “deliver Your right hand and I will have been answered,” are understood as an appeal by the Shechinah to Hashem to manifest Himself. Israel’s salvation and the Shechinah’s salvation are equated. A still clearer verse attesting to this phenomenon is found in Samuel II 7,23: “which You have redeemed for Yourself” [a reference to G’d’s personal self-interest (instead of Israel’s). Ed.]. We have already elaborated on the mystical aspect of this whole subject in our commentary on Deut. 5,26.  You ought to realize also that our sages derive from our verse here that an expert may be able to interpret dreams by his knowledge of the deeper meaning of the letters in the holy names of G’d and the ability to rearrange same. [The author goes into greater detail, the meaning of which escapes me. Ed.] "
29,28,Musar,"Shemirat HaLashon, Book II 23:4","And, in truth, since the Holy One Blessed be He created a man in His image, as written in the Torah, he must liken himself to the Blessed Creator in every way that he can. And it is because of the greatness of this trait [""to walk in His ways""], which is the fundamental principle in the service of the Blessed L-rd, that Scripture singled it out (in Devarim 19:9) — ""and to walk in His ways all of the days."" That is, it is not sufficient that one be adventitiously a good man, merciful, gracious, abundant in lovingkindness and the like, but ""all of the days"" he must take care to cultivate this holy trait of walking in His ways. And as to the rest of the mitzvoth, even though he must keep them, too, all of the days, Scripture did not single out each mitzvah by itself [(for ""all of the days"")], but spoke of them only collectively, in (Devarim 29:28): ""The hidden things are for the L-rd our G-d, but the revealed ones are for us and our children forever, to do according to all the words of this Torah."" The reason is as we have written."
29,28,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:28:1","If you should ask, What are we capable of doing? etc. Rashi is explaining the relevance of the hidden [matters], etc. in this parsha. "
29,28,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:28:2","As it is said, “Perhaps there is, among you a man, etc. This implies that an individual sinned. But afterwards [it is written], They will see the plagues of that land, which implies that the entire land will be punished on account of him. "
29,28,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 29:28:3","That, even with regard to what is exposed [the community was not punished] until they had crossed the Yarden, etc. Rashi explains that if not for the dots one would think that this has always been Hashem’s attribute, so the dots come here [for us] to expound that when it says ours and our children’s, that this attribute did not apply until now, but only from now on [i.e., once they cross the Yarden], because dots always come to exclude. You might ask that the dots should only appear on Hashem's Name [in this verse], as this would clearly indicate that [without the dots, certain] sins are Hashem our God’s, and with the dots it would also indicate that [certain] sins are ours and not Hashem's. How is this so? To to teach that, even with regard to what is exposed, etc. You might ask why there is a dot on the עין of עד (forever)? The answer is that there is a dot on the עין of עד so that [a total of] eleven letters have dots, corresponding to the eleven dots of Hashem's name [in the verse], to teach you that the dots should have been on Hashem’s Name to exclude [what is exposed, etc.], but it is not proper to put dots on Hashem’a Name. (I found this in the name of Maharitz). Re”m writes that the dot on עד is to indicate that this word עד should not be here but next to the hidden [matters], to indicate that this rule [that the public is not punished for hidden matters] is [in effect] for all time [even before crossing the Yarden]. Even though we would know that it refers to the hidden matters and not the exposed matters as explained above [because of the other dots], nevertheless, were it not for the dot on עד that teaches that it is written out of place, it would have seemed like an error because it is written next to the revealed matters. But once it has the dot, it is as if the Torah explicitly writes that its place is not here but above. You might ask, why was [the public] punished in the incident of Achan? The Gemora (Sanhedrin 43b) already answers because his wife and children knew [of his sin].

29,28,Jewish Thought,Sefer Yesodei HaTorah 31:1,"The retribution mentioned in the Torah is collective and individual — to the people in general and to each Israelite in particular. To the people in general — for open transgressions; and to each individual — for those committed in secret. For the will of the Giver of the Torah was to make all of Israel responsible for one another, this being a potent means of impeding the spread of subversion and corruption in the people. For, G-dly retribution being to the people collectively, it follows that if one sees his neighbor corrupting his ways, he will not say ""What business is it of mine?"", but he will reprove him. And if he continues sinning, he will testify against him in beth-din, which will punish him. ""And all the people will hear and fear."" Therefore, the blessings and curses (in the Torah) are to the nation in general. And it is only concerning those sins which are normally committed in secret and concerning the non-performance (in secret) of positive commandments (as per Rashbam, Ibn Ezra, and Ra'avan [Even Ha'ezer 45]) that it was said ""Cursed is the man."" And the L-rd desired that when they come to the land, the Levites proclaim to all the people the blessings and the curses, (""And it shall be if you will hear"" — Devarim 28:1; ""And it shall be if you will not hear"" — Ibid. 15), in order to impress upon them that they are all responsible for one another. For reward and punishment are for the people collectively. But before the blessings and the curses (vis-à-vis the people collectively), the L-rd desired that the Levites proclaim ""Cursed is the man who sins in secret"" (viz. Devarim 27:15). And this, for two reasons: The first, that the sinner in secret not say in his heart: ""Since the majority of the people are upright, if I sin what of it? Shall one man sin and He be wroth with the entire congregation?"" And second, that the people not despair and say: ""We are lost; all of us are lost. For perhaps one or many will sin in secret and His wrath will be against the entire nation."" But they will know and remember that (Devarim 29:28) ""the hidden things are for the L-rd our G-d to punish"" and ""the revealed ones for us and our children"" to punish the sinners. So that the proclamation of ""Cursed is the man who sins in secret"" is a blessing for the people in general, that it will not be punished for the secret sins (of the others). And this is the intent in Joshua 8:33-34 ""… as Moses the servant of Israel had commanded to bless the people first. And after that he read all the words of the Torah, the blessing and the curse."" (Thus there appears to me the depth of the plain meaning of these verses.)"
29,28,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Bereshit, Torah Ohr 37","The Talmud frequently states אדם חשוב שאני ""different yardsticks apply to important people."" (Berachot 19, Shabbat 51, 142 et al.) It is no more than appropriate that people who desire לחזות בנועם ה', באור הגנוז, of which it is said הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, ""to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord,"" i.e. the original light which has been hidden, of which the Torah says that the ""hidden things are G–d's alone,"" should be judged according to a different scale of values."
29,28,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Korach, Torah Ohr 15","Another difficulty in the instructions in 16,21, to separate themselves from Korach, etc, is Moses' comment: ""one man has sinned and You are going to be angry at the whole congregation?"" According to Rashi G–d changed His mind and agreed with Moses (16,22). Are we to assume that Moses was smarter than G–d? Some commentators have explained appropriately that originally Moses had misunderstood G–d's intentions, and that this is why he posed the question of ""האיש אחד יחטא"" G–d had meant that they should separate only from the community of Korach, whereas Moses had thought that G–d had meant for Moses and Aaron to separate themselves from the entire people. This answer is not satisfactory, since we know that G–d knows what goes on in our minds. Why then did He allow Moses to make such an error instead of expressing Himself in a manner Moses would understand correctly? When two human beings argue with one another, it is perfectly normal to say that one misunderstood the other, and that this is the reason they argued, but surely G–d knew how Moses would react to His comments?"
29,28,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Bereshit, Torah Ohr 31","The root of the emanations of תפארת and מלכות -the ""two-faced"" basis of the entire structure of our universe-have their original beginning in the emanations חכמה and בינה. This must be understood within the context of בנין, a structure. In the ""hidden"" regions of the ""senior"" emanations חכמה and בינה however, there is another Torah. This is the Torah that preceded the revealed Torah. Our sages had this in mind when they said הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, ""Concealed matters are the Lord's alone"" (Deut 29,28). These aspects of Torah have not been revealed to us. The aspects that have been revealed to us, i.e. והנגלות לנו ולבנינו (ibid.) represent the last two letters of the Ineffable Name of G–d, i. e. ו-ה The overwhelming majority of the revealed Torah belonged to the emanations ""below"" בינה; in those ""regions"" in which a merger of תפארת and מלכות is possible some people are endowed with נשמה, others with רוח, and still others only with the נפש type of spiritual potential, each according to his individual level. The select few, usually referred to as בני העליה by our sages, are able to penetrate into the regions above תפארץ, since they have also acquired the חיה or even יחידה type of soul, i.e. spiritual capacity. In that capacity they are able to absorb teachings from the תורה הקדומה, that Torah which remained hidden to the rest of us. When the sages of the Midrash have said that the concept of ""Israel"" was in G–d's mind before He commenced to create the universe, they referred to these בני העליה. The language of the Midrash עלה במחשבה -is a clear allusion to בני עליה. "
29,28,Quoting Commentary,Rashbam on Deuteronomy 27:15:1,"ושם בסתר, there are a total of 12 “curses” corresponding to the 12 tribes, all of the sins mentioned in them being of the type that one commits in private, when one is unobserved and no witnesses are present. I will explain all of them. There are only two of these which are sometimes committed in private and sometimes in public. These are idolatry and striking one’s fellow Jew. This is the reason that the Torah mentions the word בסתר specifically in connection with thee two sins that are listed here. The reason is that for sins committed in public there is no need to utter a curse as people sinning in public are not frightened of the curses either. Not only that, the court has a chance to deal with crimes/sins committed in public. This is the message in 29,28 הנגלות לנו ולבנינו עד עולם, we are forever obligated to deal with publicly committed offenses. Only when crimes are committed in secret do we leave punishment of the sinners to G’d, i.e. הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, “secretly committed sins are left to G’d to avenge.” (same verse) This includes the whole range of punishments to which the sinner had made himself liable, not only for sins carrying the death penalty.  You will note that the Torah does not write ארור שוכב עם אשת רעהו, as normally when one enters another’s house this does not go unobserved. Sleeping with one’s mother-in-law, however, is different, as both parties usually dwell in the same house. (verse  23). Insulting father or mother (verse 16) is something normally done in one’s parents’ home, where strangers are not present. The same is true of someone moving boundaries in the field; (verse 17) it is done at night away from prying eyes. If the one doing it were to do it in full view of his neighbour, surely he would be challenged. The same applies to misdirecting the blind, (verse 18) or someone sleeping with a beast (verse 21). Naturally, all forbidden sexual unions are naturally performed by consenting adults, each one making sure he or she is unobserved.  Verse 20 speaking of someone sleeping with his father’s wife (former, not his mother) is also something which normally occurs in the male’s home, the place he grew up in, where he is not an intruder. Intercourse with animals clearly occurs in the privacy of the home or the animal’s pen, no one wanting to take a chance at being found out in such depraved behaviour. All other incestuous couplings are presumed to take place at home and with consent of the second party.

That means that in the future, when the Holy One, blessed be He, inscribes the nations for an abhorrence, He will count the Israelites who are assimilated among them and those who were coerced [to abandon Judaism] among them and extract them from their midst, and [He shall] say, “This one was born of those of Zion,” and He will choose them for Himself. This is what Isaiah says (66:21): “And from them, too, will I take for priests and for Levites.” From the nations bringing them for tribute, I shall take those assimilated among them. And there will be among them priests and Levites who are unrecognizable, but they are revealed to Me, says the Lord. Now where did He say it? (Deut. 29:28) “The secret things belong to the Lord, our God.”"

29,28,Musar,Sha'arei Teshuvah 3:72,"“You shall surely reprimand your countryman and not bear sin because of him.” (Leviticus 19:17). We were warned with this not to incur sin from the sin of our fellow, in our preventing ourselves from rebuking them. And if one man sins when his sin is completely revealed and they did not rebuke him with a rod of reprimands, the whole congregation is punished. And it is accordingly written (Joshua 22:20), “When Achan son of Zerah violated the proscription, anger struck the whole community of Israel; he was not the only one who perished for that sin.” And it is stated (Deuteronomy 29:28), “but with overt [acts], it is for us and our children forever.“ And even the nations of the world said, (Jonah 1:7) “Let us cast lots and find out on whose account this misfortune has come upon us” - and certainly with Israel, who are responsible for one another."

Genesis 26:28). Thus, the teachings which he revealed after having been in the Land of Israel immeasurably eclipsed in insight and level those that he revealed before his journey; despite the fact that even previously his holy lessons had tremendously enlightened the world. The words of his teachings were always amazing, but just as ‘the heavens are high above the earth’ (Isaiah 55:9), so, too, the ways of the teachings which he revealed after visiting the Land of Israel are high above the ways of the teachings which he had earlier revealed, as we explicitly heard from his holy lips a number of times (see Tzaddik #55, #130-135, #357). The work itself is almost entirely made up of lessons which he disclosed after being in the Land of Israel. There are but a few lessons, perhaps two or three pages worth, which are from the lessons given prior to his pilgrimage (these are interspersed among the lessons bearing the mark leshon chaverim [written not by Reb Noson but by other followers], which appear between Lesson #73 and #110, and then only a very few of these)."

29,28,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 18:21:1,"V’CHI'(AND WHEN) THOU SAY IN THY HEART: ‘HOW SHALL WE KNOW THE WORD WHICH THE ETERNAL HATH NOT SPOKEN?’ “You are destined to say this when Hananiah the son of Azur [the false prophet] will come and prophesy, Behold, the vessels of the Eternal’s House shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon (Jeremiah 27:16.)  while Jeremiah [the true prophet] stands and proclaims concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels (Ibid., Verse 19.)  which were not exiled with Jeconiah, (Eleven years before the destruction of the First Temple, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took into captivity Jeconiah, king of Judah, together with some of the vessels of the Temple. In the interim, during the reign of Zedekiah the last king of Judah, the false prophet told the people that shortly the sacred vessels will be brought from Babylon and that, therefore, Zedekiah need not submit politically to Babylon. Jeremiah the true prophet warned that, if they would not submit to Babylon, even the vessels still remaining in the Sanctuary would be carried away.)  they shall be carried to Babylon (Ibid., Verse 22.)  with the exile of Zedekiah.” This is Rashi’s language from the Sifre. (Sifre, Shoftim 178.)  This interpretation [of the Sifre] is based on the fact that the verse does not state “v’im (and if) thou say in thy heart” [but it states ‘v’chi’ — (and when) thou say in thy heart]. This is as I have mentioned (Above, 4:25.)  that the Torah tells future events through allusions. But the purport of the verse is to say, “How shall we know the word which the Eternal hath not spoken, so that we can slay the one who so prophesies?” And he commanded that if the event does not come to pass then he should be killed because the Eternal hath not spoken it. (Verse 22.)  Do not fear him (Verse 22.)  because of his wisdom or because of the sign that he gave [even though] the sign or the wonder did come to pass. (Above, 13:3.)  Similarly the people could ask, “How shall we know the word which G-d had spoken, to which we have been obligated to hearken in whatever He shall command?” But this [Verse 22] is the answer to both questions, (I.e., how shall we know the word which G-d had not spoken, and how shall we know the word which He had spoken?)  for, in the case of every prophet we should look ahead to that which he foretold. If it does not come to pass we shall know that he is a false prophet and he is to be killed, and if all that he predicted does come to pass he is established to be a prophet of the Eternal, (I Samuel 3:20.)  and we are bound to hearken to him in all that he commands in the name of G-d, just as he said, unto him ye shall hearken. (Verse 15.)  Even to transgress the words of the Torah, [we are required to obey him] provided that it is to meet the particular need of the time, as in the case of Elijah on Mount Carmel (I Kings 18:23-39. See also Ramban above, 13:4.)  [who, in his attempt to discredit idolatry, brought offerings to G-d on Mount Carmel despite the fact that it was forbidden to do so outside the Sanctuary Court in Jerusalem]. This is the sense of the expression, [a prophet] like unto me, (Verse 15.)  [And G-d said, I will raise them up a prophet] like unto thee, (Verse 18.)  meaning that he will first be established a prophet of the Eternal either by a sign or wonder, similar to what is said [of Moses], and he did the signs in the sight of the people. And the people believed, (Exodus 4:30-31.)  — or that he foretells some future event and it occurs. And thus the Rabbis have said in Tractate Sanhedrin: (Sanhedrin 89 a-b.)  “Whoever disobeys a prophet, is liable to death by the hands of Heaven, as it is written, I will require it of him.” (Verse 19.)  And there the Rabbis asked: “And how is one to know that someone is a prophet [and that, for refusing to obey him,] he will be punished? If the prophet gave him a sign. But in the case of Micaiah (In I Kings 20:35 it is told that, following a decisive battle in which Ahab king of Israel defeated Ben-hadad of Syria, Ahab befriended Ben-hadad instead of killing him as a prophet had commanded him to do. To show G-d’s displeasure with Ahab, Scripture relates, And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of the Eternal: ‘Smite me, I pray thee.’ And the man refused to smite him. The following verse says that the man was slain by a lion because of his refusal to obey the prophet. The lesson was clear: just as that man was punished, so would Ahab be punished for disobeying the prophetic command to smite Ben-hadad. Now this certain man of the sons of the prophets is identified by tradition as having been Micaiah [a prophet mentioned there in Chapter 22 Verse 13]. When Micaiah ordered the man to smite him, he gave no sign that he was a prophet, yet the man was punished for disobeying! Hence the Gemara’s question: How was he to know that Micaiah was a prophet?)  the prophet gave him no sign and yet he was punished [for refusing to hearken to him! The Gemara answered]: It is different when a person is known to be an established prophet [in which case he need not give a sign]. And if this is not the case, how did Isaac hearken to Abraham on Mount Moriah [to submit himself to slaughter, a command, which had been given to Abraham but not to him]? And how did we rely on Elijah on Mount Carmel to bring offerings outside [the Sanctuary Court in Jerusalem? Obviously we must say that] it is different if the prophet is established [in which case he must be obeyed even if he does not offer a sign].” Now Rashi wrote: (Verse 22. Rashi attempts to answer the question, how we are to know when to obey some one who claims to be a prophet? Regarding such a case, he writes, “they have already etc.”)  “They have already been commanded that if one comes to entice you from [observing] one of the commandments [of G-d] you are not to hearken to him (Above, 13:9.)  unless it has been clearly established by you that he is an absolutely righteous man, like Elijah on Mount Carmel [who brought the offerings outside the Sanctuary Court] because of the needs of the time. Therefore it states, unto him ye shall hearken.” (Verse 15.)  — But this does not appear to be correct, for the necessary verification is not that he is a righteous man but that he is a true prophet known to all by having previously foretold future events which indeed came to pass, this being his “sign” as referred to in this section, (Verse 22: When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Eternal, if the thing follow not …)  or some wonders which he has done in our presence. (Above, 13:2.)  This constitutes the presumption of prophets. In saying “a perfectly righteous man,” perhaps Rashi meant what Harav Rabbeinu (“The Rabbi our teacher.”)  Moshe [ben Maimon] wrote in Hilchoth Yesodei Hatorah: (“The laws of the Foundations of the Torah,” 7:7.)  “When a prophet is assigned a mission, he is given a sign or wonder so that the people might know that G-d had truly sent him. We do not believe everyone who shows a sign or wonder to be a prophet. Only a man whom we already know to be worthy of prophecy — by reason of his wisdom and deeds wherein he stands pre-eminent among all his contemporaries, and follows the paths of prophecy, in its sanctity and renunciation [of physical lust] — who then comes and performs a sign or wonder and says that G-d sent him, it is a commandment to hearken to him, as it is said, unto him ye shall hearken. (Verse 15.)  It is possible that such a man may perform a sign or wonder and still not be a prophet [in which case] the sign must have some [other] meaning. (“There is something hidden in this matter which requires scrutiny” (Rashi, Kethuboth 111a, in explanation of a similar expression in the Gemara there).)  Nevertheless, it is a commandment to listen to him, since he is a great man, learned and worthy of prophecy, we assign him the presumption [that his claim is true], just as we have been commanded to render a decision [in court] by the testimony of two proper witnesses even though it is possible that they testified falsely, because we consider them to be legitimate witnesses [having no basis to assume the contrary] we assign them the presumption of legitimacy in their testimony. On such matters it is said, The secret things belong unto the Eternal our G-d, (Further, 29:28, meaning that we are required to judge human affairs based only on the available evidence.)  and it is further said, for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Eternal looketh on the heart.” (I Samuel 16:7.) "
29,28,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 29:28:2,"BELONG UNTO THE LORD OUR GOD. Its meaning is that his punishment is in the hands of God, and the Lord will exact punishment from him. However, if the sin was committed in public there is an obligation on us and our children to do in accordance with that which is written in the Torah. Others say (That the meaning of our verse is.)  that the secret and the revealed things belong to God. It is incumbent upon us only to observe the words of the Torah. Now this interpretation has no head or foot. (It makes no sense and has no legs to stand on.)  What reason is there to mention this here? (It does not continue the thought of the previous verse.)  Scripture states that if you return unto the Lord (Deut. 30:2), God will turn thy captivity (Ibid., v. 3) even though you are outside of the land because it stated earlier, and cast them into another land (v. 27). According to Rabbi Judah (Rabbi Judah Chayuj.)  the first grammarian, the meaning of ve-shav (then shall turn) (Deut. 30:3) means God will give rest; (See I.E. on Num. 10:36 (Vol. 4, p. 75). Rabbi Judah renders God will turn thy captivity (Ibid., v. 3) as God will give rest to your captivity.)  that is, he will give rest to the captives and be merciful to them, and after this He will return and gather. (Your captivity. It should be noted that Rabbi Judah renders the first ve-shav in 30:3 as will He give rest, and the second ve-shav as and will He return.) "

""I am Hashem your (plural) G-d"" is not written here, rather "" I am Hashem your (singular) G-d"". Said R' Yosi: In accordance with each and everyone's personal capacities did the word speak to him. Do not be astonished at the Manna which came down on Yisrael - each one tasting the flavour that he was capable of tasting - the infants in accordance with their capacities... the young men in accordance with their capacities... and the old in accordance with their capacities. If that was so in the case of the Manna, that everyone tasted the flavour that he could appreciate, the word (the word of Hashem at the receiving of the Torah), all the more so!

29,28,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Sotah 7:5:6,"Rebbi Simeon ben Laqish said, in the Jordan they accepted the secret matters (That the people as a whole will be punished for secret sins of an individual.

Simon ben Laqish is similar to that of the Tanna R. Jehudah. The responsibility of the public for hidden deeds of the individual is denied by R. Nehemiah.) . Joshua told them, if you do not accept the secret matters, the waters will come and sweep you away. Rebbi Simon bar Zabida said, that is correct. You should know that this is so, for Akhan sinned and the majority of the Synhedrion fell at Ai (Jos. 7:5; Cf. Babli Sanhedrin 44a.

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Renewed Exhortation 2-3","Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:4–6). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come. Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “book.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."

29,28,Liturgy,"Siddur Sefard, Upon Arising, Introductory Prayers 14","Elijah the prophet, remembered for his righteousness, did open his mouth and spake, saying, ""O Sovereign of the worlds, Thou who art One and not in count, Thou art the Supreme above all supremes, the Most Hidden of all that is hidden. No thought can apprehend Thee at all. Thou art He who hath emanated ten rectifications (Tikkunim), and they are called the ten emanations (Sefirot), to govern therewith the hidden worlds, which are not revealed, and the revealed worlds, and with them Thou dost conceal Thyself from the sons of men. Thou art He who binds them and unites them; and because Thou art indeed the One, whosoever separates one from another of these ten emanations (Sefirot) is considered as if he had effected separation in Thee. These ten emanations (Sefirot) proceed according to their order: the long (Arikh), the short (Qatzir), the intermediate (Beinoni); and Thou art He who guides them, and there is none that guides Thee, neither above, nor below, nor from any side. Thou hast appointed garments for them, from which souls blossom forth to the sons of men. And how many bodies hast Thou prepared for them, which are called body in respect to the garments that cover them. And these ten emanations (Sefirot) are called by Thy name: loving-kindness (Chesed) of the right arm, might (Gevurah) of the left arm, beauty (Tiferet) of the body, eternity (Netzach) and splendor (Hod) the two legs, foundation (Yesod) the end of the body, sign of the holy covenant, kingdom (Malkhut) the mouth, the oral law that we call it. Wisdom (Chokhmah) of the brain is a thought from Thee, understanding (Binah) of the heart, and in these two it is written, 'The hidden things belong unto the LORD our God.' The supreme crown (Keter Elyon) is the crown of the kingdom, and of it is said, 'Declaring the end from the beginning.' It is the skull where phylacteries lie (Karkafta d'tefillei). From Thee it is Yod 20 and Vav 20, which is the path of emanation, the irrigation of the tree with its branches and boughs, like the water that irrigates the tree, and it grows with that irrigation. O Sovereign of the worlds, Thou art the Cause of causes, and the Reason of reasons, who irrigates the tree with this flow, and this flow is like a soul to the body, and it is life to the body, and in Thee there is no likeness nor image at all, from all that is within and without, and Thou hast created heaven and earth. And from them Thou hast brought forth the sun and the moon and the stars and the constellations, and on earth, trees and grasses, and the Garden of Eden and herbs and living creatures and birds and fish and the sons of men, to make known with them the supremes and how they are conducted with the supremes and the lowers, and how they are known from the supremes and the lowers, and there is no knowledge in Thee at all, and except for Thee there is no unity in the supremes and the lowers, and Thou art known as the Cause of all and the Sovereign over all. And all the emanations (Sefirot), each one has a known name, and they are called angels (Malachim), and Thou hast no known name, for Thou art He who fills all their names, and Thou art the perfection of them all, and when Thou departest from them, all their names remain as a body without a soul. Thou art wise and not with a known wisdom, Thou art understanding and not with a known understanding, Thou hast no known place except to make known Thy power and Thy might to the sons of men, and to show them how Thou conductest the world in justice and in mercy, which are righteousness and judgment, according to the deeds of the sons of men. Judgment is might, judgment is the middle pillar, righteousness is the holy kingdom, the scales of righteousness are two supports of truth, behold righteousness is the sign of the covenant. All this to show how Thou conductest the world, but Thou hast no known righteousness, for it is judgment, nor judgment known, for it is mercy, nor from all these attributes at all. Blessed be the LORD forever, Amen and Amen."""
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"Simchat HaRegel on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, Ha Lachma Anya 3:8","Interpreted kabbalistically, this statement may allude to Rabbi Moses Cordovero’s (Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (1522–1570) was a central figure in the historical development of Kabbalah, leader of a mystical school in 16th-century Safed, Ottoman Syria.)  explanation. Mitzvah is made up of the letters of the blessed Divine name. The letters ו""ה are revealed aspects of Torah and the letters י""ה (are hidden). ( Vav Hay refer to Tiferent and Malchut while Yud Hay refer to Chochma and Binah.)  They stand for מ""צ in atbash (Atbash is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher originally used to encrypt the Hebrew alphabet.In the most common system Alef and Taf interchangeable, Beit and Shin, Gimel and Reish, etc.) ; when the letters are are combined they spell מצוה, Mitzvah. In the Zohar, Parshat Vayetze (See Zohar Volume One, 157a The translation adapted from The Zohar, Pritzker edition by Daniel Matt, Page 373.)  we find, “ When Israel was in Egypt..and the blessed Holy One desired to bring them closer, He gave them the realm of lechem ani, impoverished bread. Who is impoverished? King David (Shechinah)... Impoverished bread is called matzah, unleavened bread; female without male is poor. First they approach matzah. When they draw close, the Holy One draws them onto other rungs and male is united with the female. Then matzah - supplemented with vav - is united with the female and it becomes mitzvah, commandment, .” This is discussed at length in, Zekan Aharon… but I will explain it in a different way from Rabbi Cordovero. The meaning of the word ה""א in Ha lachma anya should be read Hei anya lachma; that is the final hei in the four letter name of God. The lower hei is the kingdom of heaven (malchut shamayim), the bread of poverty, the domain of David which hasn’t anything of its own, which our ancestors ate in the land of Egypt. There they only merited matzah, female without male, as the Zohar suggested. “All who are hungry come and eat” since it is a commandment. Afterwards we will merit through the commandment to have the male unite with the female. That is why we now perform the commandment. Every commandment unites the blessed Holy One and the Shechinah in fear and with compassion. It is possible that it was for this mitzvah that the letters ו""ה are revealed for we seek her through the performance of the commandments uniting the Holy One and his Shechinah. Since this is done through the higher Father and Mother, (Father and Mother refer to the Sefirot of Chokhmah and Binah)  they are hidden through atbash with the letters י""ה as מ""ץ. As Scripture states, “Concealed are the acts of the Lord our God,” the Mother and Father (See Deuteronomy 29:28 the two names of God refer to the two aspects of God in the Sephirotic system, male and female, compassion and justice. They are also connected to the first two letters of the divine name - Yud and Hay.)  while the vav hay are revealed, so that it applies to “All the provisions of this Torah.” (Deuteronomy 29:2)  With all the Torah one must have the correct intention to unite them in fear and love, especially in the case of the commandment of giving tzedakah whose general meaning and its details are meant to unite Blessed Holy One and the Shechinah in fear and love, as the Ari, of blessed memory stated. Therefore, we say,”All who are hungry,” to gain the merit of combining the male and the female. “Now we are here; next year in the land of Israel” for the commandments are laws of the God in the land. Being in exile takes away from the performance of the commandments for the essence of the commandments is fulfilled in the land of Israel. That is what is stated, “Now we are slaves here” that is to say, there is also an exile for the soul since we are unable to fulfill the commandments completely. What we do perform is not done properly as a result of the place we are in. “Next year (may we be) in the land of Israel,” where we can fulfill the mitzvot properly. Not only that but we will be free since God’s name and God’s throne will be complete and we will be free in the place of freedom (This is a reference to the Sefirah of Binah)  since none of the husks will rule over us. God’s name and God’s throne will be complete and from there God will command the blessing of a flow of spiritual energy."

Was für uns das Offenbare für immer und für jede Zeit das klar Bewusste, Zweifellose ist, das ist: daß, wie sich auch unsere Zukunft gestalten möge und welche Zeiten und Geschicke wir noch zu bestehen haben mögen, unsere und unserer Kinder ewige Aufgabe bleibt überall und immer, im Lande und im Exil: Gottes Gesetze treu zu erfüllen."
29,28,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 29:28:2","Sanhedrin 43b wird das נסתרות und נגלות in Beziehung auf die Verantwortung gefasst, die nach der mit diesem Gesetzesbunde eingetretenen Solidarität für die Erfüllung des Gesetzes (siehe Kap. 27, 1 u. 9) der Gesamtheit und jedem einzelnen obliegt und die mit dem לנו ולבנינו עד עולם לעשות וגו׳ erneut zum Ausspruch gekommen, da dies nicht nur zur Selbsterfüllung, sondern überhaupt für die Verwirklichung des Gesetzes alle verpflichtet erklärt. Diese solidarische Verpflichtung, ערבות, das: כל ישראל ערבין זה לזה, wird hier nur auf die נגלות, auf das offenkundige Tun und Lassen beschränkt, in welcher Beziehung alle, die durch ihren Einfluss Gesetzübertretungen oder Pflichtunterlassungen hätten verhüten können und diesen Einfluss nicht geübt, שהיה בידן למחות ולא מחן, mitverantwortlich sind. נסתרות aber, geheime Vergehungen gegen das Gesetz, bleiben jedoch לד׳ אלקינו, der göttlichen Waltung allein.

Demnach wäre die moralische Zusammenhörigkeit aller, die in der Solidarität aller für alle ihre so folgenschwere Bedeutung gewinnt, gerade erst mit der durch die Niederlassung im Lande eintretenden Vereinzelung zur wahren Wirklichkeit gelangt, und dürfte dafür wohl das Motiv in der Erwägung zu finden sein, daß gerade erst in der mit dem normalen Erwerbs- und Nahrungsstreben sich erzeugenden bürgerlichen Verkehrsgemeinsamkeit alle Einzelpersönlichkeiten diejenige Bedeutung gewinnen, welche auch den gegenseitigen moralischen Einfluss bedingt."

Yet “these as well as these are the words of the living G–d.” (Eruvin 13b.)  The plural (Elokim chayim, rather than eloka chay.)  is used as a reference to the source of life for the souls of Israel, which are generally divided into three categories—right, left, and center, namely, kindness (chesed), might (gevurah), and so on, (The third category is tiferet (“beauty”). See Iggeret Hakodesh, sect. 15.)  so that the souls, whose roots originate in the category of kindness, are likewise inclined toward kindness in the leniency of their decisions, and so forth, (See ibid., sect. 13 for more light on the subject.)  as is known."

29,28,Kabbalah,"Sha'arei Kedusha, Part 3 6:20","From then on, they only made use of the methods of ascending to the world of Action-Asiyah, and nothing more. However, because Action-Asiyah is the lowest of the four world, and additionally, because the angels of the world of Action-Asiyah themselves are composed of a majority of evil with a minority of good, and moreover, because the good and evil in them greatly adhere to each other, therefore there is no Godly comprehension and grasp in the world of Action-Asiyah, being that it is impossible to only grasp the good in it. Therefore, whatever grasp there is, is an admixture of good and evil, truth and false. ([The following passage from the Zohar, which is included as a note in this section, appears to either be an addition from an alternate manuscript, or added by the Chida]: This is similarly stated in Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 66 (97a), as follows: Rabbi Shimon said, “Woe to those people who set aside engagement in the study of the Torah, about which it states (Genesis 3:22), ‘And he shall take also of the Tree of Life,’ and engagement in the mitzvot, which are the fruit of the tree, about which it states (Gen. 3:22 ibid.), ‘and he shall eat and live forever.’ Woe to those who instead follow after those who entice them, who are from the side of the primordial snake (Nachash HaKadmoni). They entice them, telling them, “Come and learn how to command the angels who rule over the stars and the sun and the moon, and those who are appointed over the evil spirits and demons, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” It is about such people that it states (See Deuteronomy 17:3; Kings II 23:5; Jeremiah 44), “So says HaShem-יהו״ה to those who sacrifice and offer incense to the stars and constellations, to the sun and moon, and to all the hosts of the heavens; something that I never commanded.” The engagement in such matters is forbidden by the Holy One, blessed is He, as He commanded Adam (Genesis 2:17), “But as for the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat of it etc.” Yeshu the wicked one, made use of this knowledge, and the same is so of the generation of Enosh, the generation of the flood, and the generation of the dispersion. The Holy One, blessed is He, uprooted them all from this world and from the coming world, as it states (Genesis 2:17), “On the day that you eat of it, die you shall surely die (Mot Tamut-מות תמות).” That is, “you shall die” (Mot-מות) in this world and “you shall surely die” (Tamut-תמות) in the coming world. This sin of making use of the holy names to command angels and demons is what brought about the destruction of the first Holy Temple and the exile of the Jewish people among the nations of the world, through which many were killed. For, each man sacrificed and offered incense to angels and demons, and drew the powers of impurity upon themselves. When the prophets would come and chastise them, the verse (Kings II 17:13-14) attests that they did not listen to the voice of the prophets and the seers. How would the prophet chastise them? He would tell them, “Repent and do Teshuvah, and if not, there will be the fulfillment of the verse (Deuteronomy 11:17), ‘He will restrain the heaven so that there will be no rain, and the ground will not yield its produce, and you will be swiftly banished from the goodly Land that HaShem-יהו״ה gives you.’” They, however, made light of the words of the prophet, and ridiculed him, saying, “We need not be concerned with your words, as we will command the angels who are appointed over the rain, and we will force them to bring forth the rain.” However, because of them, the Holy One, blessed is He, exchanged His appointed angels in their tasks, and they were instead killed and the Holy Temple was destroyed because of them, and it is because of them that the Jewish people were exiled. This was the sin of Adam, through which the snake caused death to him and his wife. He enticed them with that tree, as written (Genesis 3:5), “God knows that on the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God etc.” For this reason, the Holy One, blessed is He, commands man and tells him to contemplate that which is permitted to be contemplated, but not engage in hidden matters (See Deuteronomy 29:28).)

The concealed deeds that you might commit are known only for the Lord our God. God punishes those who engage in idol worship in secret, as He alone is aware of their behavior, and therefore the communal covenant does not apply to those transgressions. But the revealed sins, those performed openly, are a responsibility assigned for us and for our children forever. It is our duty to eliminate them, as we have all undertaken to perform all the matters of this Torah."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Nitzavim 10","Another explanation is that there are some commandments that we don’t know the reason why the Holy One commanded them. Therefore it says, “Concealed acts concern the Lord our God” [29:28]. That is, we should do the concealed commandments for God’s sake, because He commanded them. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:28.) "
29,28,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Nitzavim 11-12","“Overt acts, it is for us and our children” [29:28]. That is to say, the commandments that we do whose reason is written and we understand. We should reveal them and tell their reason to our children, just as the Torah wrote concerning the Exodus from Egypt, “teach them to your children” [11:19]. This means, you should teach the Torah to your children and you should make them knowledgeable about the reason for every commandment, to the extent to which you know the reason. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:28.)  Another explanation is “Concealed acts concern the Lord our God” [29:28]. That is to say, concealed sins are for the Holy One. One should repent for the hidden sins that are against the Holy One. One should repent to God alone and He will forgive them. However, “Overt acts, it is for us and our children” [29:28]. That is to say, that which is overt, that is for us together and for our children. However, for the same sins one must publicly repent for what one did to one’s friend and must atone for what he did to him. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:28.) "
29,28,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Nitzavim 9-10","“Concealed acts concern the Lord our God” [29:28]. The concealed things are for God and the open things are for us. That is to say, the sins that we see Israelites commit, we are obligated to punish them. However, the hidden sins that Israelites commit are for God, since God will punish the concealed sins. Israel are guarantors for each other. Therefore, one should watch who commits a sin in order to punish them, so that the innocent should not be liable. (Rashi, Deuteronomy, 29:28.)  Another explanation is that there are some commandments that we don’t know the reason why the Holy One commanded them. Therefore it says, “Concealed acts concern the Lord our God” [29:28]. That is, we should do the concealed commandments for God’s sake, because He commanded them. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 29:28.) "

29,28,Chasidut,"Sefat Emet, Deuteronomy, Ki Tavo 3:3","When bringing Bikkurim, one declares, ""בערתי הקודש מן הבית"" (Devarim 26:13), meaning ""I have removed the holy from my house."" The focus seems to be on removing it from the house, rather than giving it to the Kohen and Levi. The Sefas Emes explains that separating Terumot and Maasrot represents dedicating the first part to Hashem, thereby connecting everything to the inner divine point. This concept applies to a person's general approach: one's chochma (wisdom) and mind, the elevated and primary part, should be devoted to Hashem. The phrase ""The hidden things are to Hashem"" (Devarim 29:28) implies that one's elevated chochma and desires should not be used for physical matters, but separated for Hashem. By not placing chochma into physicality, one can elevate and connect the physical to a higher realm. The Chidushei Harim explains this regarding Shabbos: even though the physical externalities do not become elevated, they ""allow"" the inner elements to be elevated. This is the meaning of ""בערתי הקודש מן הבית""—the word בערתי can also mean ""to clarify."" By realizing that one's physical actions are separated and elevating one's mind to be sanctified to Hashem, one adds more power to holiness. Through not bringing chochma into physicality, the elevated chochma will shine into all one's actions."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Isaiah 66:21:2,said the Lord. Now where did He say it? (Deut. 29:28) “The hidden things are for the Lord our God.” In this manner it is explained in the Aggadah of Psalms (87:6).
29,28,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 29:28:1,"הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, “concealed acts concern the Lord our G–d;” seeing that the Torah had written in verse 20 of our chapter that G–d singles out individual sinners for retribution,” and verse 21 sounds as if the sins of a single individual could cause G–d to react angrily against the whole people, or at least against a whole family all on account of that single rebellious Jew, Moses now reassures the people that precisely because He is omniscient and knows what goes on in the hearts of each one of us, He will deal with the individual who is guilty and not engage in punishing the innocent as “collateral damage.” However, sins committed openly, and ignored by the judiciary, thereby constituting collective guilt by the people who had appointed corrupt judges, will become the subject of what for the uninitiated looks like collective punishment. In fact, the retribution for openly committed sins and tolerated by the courts, will result in the punishment extending beyond a single generation as long as we do not wipe out the phenomenon of open rebellion against the covenant that the whole people had voluntarily entered into with Hashem. The Talmud in tractate Sanhedrin, folio 43 points out that the dots above the letters לנו ולבנינו and above the letter ע of the word עד, are to inform us that as long as the Israelites had not crossed the river Jordan and been on sacred ground, G–d had not punished anyone for sins committed in private, not witnessed by even family members. The reason for this was that only after crossing the Jordan did the Jews accept the Torah [most of whose commandments did not apply outside the Holy land. Ed.] individually and collectively, so that each Israelite became responsible also for the sins committed by his fellow Jew. At that point what is written the words לנו ולבנינו, “for us and our children,” became applicable. If you were to query that if the above were correct, why is the last dot on the word על instead of on ה' אלוקינו, perhaps the reason is that it would be inappropriate to do this when it is subject to being erased. The words: lashem elokeynu in Hebrew including the tetragram that I cannot spell out here, comprise eleven letters, and that is why our sages place 11 dots to hint to us that this is where the dots really should have been. [Since no Israelite who had not yet crossed the river Jordan ever saw a Torah scroll with these eleven dots, I find the interpretation offered quite irrelevant. Ed.] According to a text known as massoret hag’dolah, the dots are attributed to when Ezra had to rewrite the Torah after the redemption when different scrolls had variations in the text, and the time would come when Moses would challenge him why he had not done it differently, he would explain that because of his doubts he had placed the dots on top. If Moses would be satisfied with the way Ezra had done it, it would be easy to erase the dots without harming the text of the Torah scroll. From this it is clear that Ezra had his doubts about G–d not holding us responsible for not interfering when becoming aware of sins committed prior to crossing the Jordan."
29,28,Quoting Commentary,"Chizkuni, Genesis 18:9:1","ויאמרו אליו, according to Rashi, when the dots above the three letters איו, as well as elsewhere in the Torah when the complete word is longer than the number of letters having dots, we are to look for an interpretation for the letters that have no such dot. If you were to ask why the letter ל in this word does not have a dot? This fact prompts us to assume that the angels had first asked Sarah where Avraham was before they asked him where Sarah was. This cannot be correct, as clearly they had not even seen Sarah until after they had eaten. Now that the word has only three dots, it is clear beyond argument that they had first seen Avraham. Subsequently, they asked Sarah where Avraham was. This would also conform to Rashi’s commentary in Deuteronomy 29,28 where he says that the dots teach us that this verse was not written in its proper place, i.e. that the law promulgated there did not become effective until after the Israelites had stood at Mount Gerizim and Mount Eyvol. [It appears that Rashi’s point here is that it is good manners for a guest to enquire after the wellbeing of both one’s host and one’s hostess. This sentence has been omitted in our author’s quotation of Rashi’s commentary on this verse. [Seeing that I do not have the author’s Italian original, I prefer to assume that the Hebrew translator omitted it. Rashi’s commentary is based on the first opinion offered in Bereshit Rabbah 48,15 Ed.]"
29,28,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 29:28:1","הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, “sins committed in the privacy of one’s home, (which could not be witnessed and brought to court) will be taken care of by the Lord our G-d;” this had to be stated specifically in light of what we read in verse 18 about individuals who feel safe from punishment for their personal sins in periods when the community at large is Torahobservant."
29,28,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 29:28:2","לה׳ אלוקינו, “it is His duty to punish sins committed in places inaccessible to witnesses.”"
29,28,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 29:28:3","והנגלות, ”but the sins committed publicly, etc,” dealing with deliberate sins committed in full view of the public must be dealt with by the judiciary by both you and your children, as otherwise such phenomena cannot be eradicated from your midst. This law becomes effective from the moment the Jewish people will cross the river Jordan. From that moment on their acceptance of the covenant with G-d meant that each individual Jew shared in the responsibility for the conduct of each fellow Jew. From that moment on we also became responsible. In order that you should not say that this approach applies forever (under all circumstances), the words והנגלות לנו ולבנינו, “and the publicly committed sins are also the responsibility of us and our children,” have been dotted, i. e. as long as we observe that part of the law, by letting our judiciary punish sinners of sins committed in public, G-d will take care of those that were committed secretly.[The dots, wherever they appear, have been added by learned scribes long after the Torah had been given, i.e. have been added by human initiative. There are dots only on ten letters, whereas there are eleven sins that were listed in the list of curses as being typical of sins committed secretly in Deuteronomy chapter 27, commencing with verse 15. This is deliberate in order to avoid giving the impression that we are telling G-d how to administer His laws. This is also the reason why the dots which we would have expected over the words לה' אלוקינו, where they would have made more sense, appear instead over the words לנו ולבנינו, Ed.]"
29,28,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 29:28:4","הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, when the prophet Isaiah, at the end of describing the idyllic state of mankind on earth after the arrival of the Messiah, states that G-d will also select priests and Levites from among the gentile nations,(Isaiah 66,13) this is also something reserved for G-d’s judgment, covered by the line הנסתרות לה' אלוקינו, “that there are hidden matters which only G-d is aware of,” not man."
29,28,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 3:13,"“All those counted of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron counted by the directive of the Lord, by their families, all males from one month old and above, were twenty-two thousand” (Numbers 3:39).  “All those counted of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron [ve’aharon] counted” – the vav in ve’aharon is dotted because Aaron was not part of the census. (He was not counted, nor did he participate with Moses in the census.)  Similarly, “may the Lord judge between me and you [uveinekha]” (Genesis 16:5) – as she said it only regarding Hagar alone. (There is a dot over the yod in uveinekha, indicating that Sarah did not demand that God punish Abraham.)  Some say, it was regarding those who introduce discord between him and her. (While this interpretation also maintains that Sarah was referring to Hagar, it is not based on the dot over the yod, but rather on understanding “between me and you” as referring to one who introduces discord between them.)   Similarly, “They said to him [elav]: Where is Sarah?” (Genesis 18:9) – the alef in elav is dotted, as they knew where she was but made inquiries about her.  Similarly, “He did not know when she lay down and when she arose [uvkuma]” (Genesis 19:33) – the vav in the middle of uvkuma regarding the elder daughter is dotted; he did not know when she lay down, but he knew when she arose.   Similarly, “he kissed him [vayishakehu] (Genesis 33:4) (Esau kissed Jacob.)  – it is dotted, because he did not kiss him with all his heart.  Similarly, “his brothers went to herd et” (Genesis 37:12) – why is it dotted over et? It teaches that they did not go to herd, but rather to eat, drink, and be seduced.  Similarly, “or on a distant [reḥoka] journey” (Numbers 9:10) – the ḥet of reḥoka is dotted. (While the midrash here states that there is a dot on the ḥet, the Mishna (Pesaḥim 93b) and other sources state that the dot is on the heh. In our Torah scrolls the dot is on the heh.)  It teaches that even if it was not a distant journey, but just outside the threshold of the courtyard of the Temple. Some say, even if it was a near journey, but it (The path which he has to take to reach the Temple (Etz Yosef).)  is impure, he would not perform the rite of the paschal offering with them.  Similarly, “we laid waste until Nofaḥ that [asher]” (Numbers 21:30) – the reish in asher is dotted, as it was so even beyond there. Some say: It teaches that they did not destroy the entire country, but rather the large cities.  Similarly, “You shall offer one-tenth [isaron isaron] for each” (Numbers 29:15) – the first isaron of the first day of the festival is dotted. It teaches that there was only one one-tenth alone. (Namely, there was only a one-tenth measure, and for sacrifices which require two-tenths or three-tenths, each tenth would be measured separately.)   Similarly, “The concealed are for the Lord our God, but the revealed are for us and for our children [lanu ulvaneinu] forever [ad olam]” (Deuteronomy 29:28) – why is it dotted over lanu ulvaneinu and the ayin of ad? He said to them: ‘If you perform the revealed, I will inform you of the concealed.’   Some say: Why is it dotted? Rather, this is what Ezra said: If Elijah will come and say: Why did you write them? (I.e., you should not have written them.)  I will say to him: I dotted above them. If he will say: You wrote them well, I will erase the dots from above them."
29,28,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol VI, Chapter 12 The Case of the Poisoned Sandwich 62","R. Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, Ein Yizḥak, I, no. 8, resolves the issue raised by Havvot Ya'ir but in doing so he severely limits the ambit of the principle hal'itehu la-rasha. Ein Yizḥak observes that Jews are parties to a covenantal relationship requiring each person to serve as a surety for observance of the commandments by all others. The principle of suretyship, or arvut, is limited to transgressions of which one has knowledge; there is no responsibility, and hence no onus of suretyship, regarding the transgression of a fellow Jew of which one has no knowledge. The latter are in the category of nistarot, i.e., ""concealed"" or secret things, that are depicted in Deuteronomy 29:28 as matters to be dealt with solely by God. Applying that thesis to the paradigm case of hal'itehu la-rasha, viz., the situation described in Bava Kamma 69a, Ein Yizḥak asserts that, since the identity of the individuals who steal grapes from the vineyard is unknown, those infractions are ""concealed"" and hence there is no obligation to prevent transgression by such individuals. (See also R. Joshua Baumol, Teshuvot Emek Halakhah, II, no. 6.) "
29,28,Talmud,Avot DeRabbi Natan 34:5,"Ten words in the Torah are marked with dots. They are as follows: 1. “The Eternal will judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5). There is a dot above the letter yod in the term, “and you.” This teaches that Sarah did not say this to Abraham, but to Hagar. Some say that it means she was speaking about those who caused the fighting “between me and you.” 2. “They said to him, Where is Sarah?” (Genesis 18:9). There are dots above the letters aleph, yod, and vav in the term, “to him,” to indicate that they already knew where she was, but they nevertheless inquired about her. 3. (There is a dot on the verse,) “When she lay down and when she arose” (Genesis 19:33). There is a dot above the letter vav in the term, “When she arose” the first time it is used [with regard to Lot’s older daughter]. This teaches that he was not aware of what happened until the (younger daughter) arose. 4. “And Esau ran to greet him, and he hugged him, fell on his neck, and kissed him” (Genesis 33:4). The term for, “and kissed him,” has dots above every letter, to teach that he did not kiss him sincerely. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would say: It means that this kiss was sincere, but every other one he gave Jacob was not. 5. “His brothers went to shepherd their father’s flocks in Shechem” (Genesis 37:12). There are dots on the word just before “flocks.” This teaches that they did not actually go to shepherd the flocks, but to eat and drink (and indulge their temptations). 6. “All the Levites who were recorded, whom Moses and Aaron recorded” (Numbers 3:39). There are dots above Aaron’s name. Why? To teach that Aaron himself was not counted in this record. 7. “On a long journey” (Numbers 9:10). There is a dot above the letter hei in the word “long.” This teaches that this does not really mean a long journey, but any exiting the boundaries of the outer court of the Temple. 8. “We caused destruction all the way up to Nophach, which reaches into Medeba” (Numbers 21:30). There is a dot above the letter reish in the word “which.” Why? To teach that they destroyed the idolaters but not the countries themselves (whereas the practice of idolaters was to destroy entire countries). 9. “A tenth, a tenth for each” (Numbers 29:15). [This verse delineates the meal offering that accompanies the burnt offering] on the first day of the Sukkot festival. There is a dot above the letter vav in the [first occurrence of the] word “tenth.” Why? To teach that there is only one-tenth [measure] for each. 10. “The hidden things are for the Eternal our God, and the revealed things are for us and our children forever” (Deuteronomy 29:30). There are dots above the words “for us and our children,” and above the letter ayin in the word “forever.” Why? For this is what Ezra said: If Elijah comes and says to me: Why did you write it this way? I will say to him: I have already put dots above these words [to indicate I was not certain it was correct]. But if he says to me: You wrote it correctly, then I will remove the dots. There are eleven instances in the Torah where the Hebrew word for “she,” היא, is written as הוא (which means “he” or “it”) but vocalized to mean “she.” The first is: “The King of Bela, he is [i.e., “she is”] Tzur” (Genesis 14:1). The second: “He himself said to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and SHE also said, ‘He is my brother’” (Genesis 20:5). The third: “As she was being brought out, SHE sent a message to her father-in-law, saying” (Genesis 38:25). The fourth: “If one of your animals of which it is [i.e., “she is”] used for food dies” (Leviticus 11:39). The fifth: “And it [i.e., “and she”] has turned the hair white” (Leviticus 13:10). The sixth: “If the priest sees it…and it [i.e., “and she”] has faded” (Leviticus 13:21). [The seventh: “It (i.e., “she”) shall be a Sabbath of complete rest for you” (Leviticus 16:31). The eighth: “And SHE sees his nakedness” (Leviticus 20:17). The ninth: “SHE has disgraced her father” (Leviticus 21:9). The tenth: “And SHE has kept secret, and defiled herself (and she was not caught)” (Numbers 5:13). The eleventh: “A spirit of jealousy has passed over him, and he is jealous of his wife…but SHE has not defiled herself” (Numbers 5:14)."
29,28,Talmud,Avot DeRabbi Natan 34:6,"The Divine Presence descended to the world ten times. Once in the Garden of Eden, as it says (Genesis 3:8), “They heard the sound of the Eternal God moving in the garden,” and it [also] says (Song of Songs 6:2), “My beloved has gone down to his garden.” Once in the generation of the Tower of Babel, as it says (Genesis 11:5), “And the Eternal went down to see the city and the tower.” Once in Sodom, as it says (Genesis 18:21), “I will go down and I will see about the cries that have come up to Me.” Once in Egypt, as it says (Exodus 3:8), “I have come down to save them from the hands of the Egyptians.” Once at the sea, as it says (Psalms 18:10), “And He bent the heavens and came down.” Once at Sinai, as it says (Exodus 19:20), “And the Eternal came down upon Mount Sinai” before all the people. Once in the Temple, as it says (Ezekiel 44:2), “And the Eternal said to me, this gate must be kept closed and is never to be opened…because the Eternal, the God of Israel, has come through it.” And once in a pillar of cloud, as it says (Numbers 11:25), “And the Eternal came down in a cloud.” And once more in the future, in the days of Gog and Magog, as its says (Zechariah 14:4), “He will set his feet down, on that day, upon the Mount of Olives.”"

30,1,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 26:16:1,"APH ANI E’ESEH ZOTH LACHEM’ (ALSO I WILL DO THIS UNTO YOU). By way of the Truth, the meaning [of this verse is] as if it were inverted: ‘aph ani zoth e’eseh lachem’ [meaning: “also ani — the term for the Divine attribute called zoth, which signifies judgment — will do unto you”]. This is why He always mentions in this section the word ani (I): then will ‘ani’ (I) also walk; (Verse 24.)  And ‘ani’ (I) also will smite you; (Verse 24.)  and ‘ani’ (I) also will chastise you; (Verse 28.)  and ‘ani (I) will bring the Land into desolation; (Verse 32.)  ‘ani’ (I) also will walk contrary unto them. (Verse 41.)  And in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah [we find it interpreted]: (Sefer Habahir, 66. See Vol. I, p. 24, Note 42.)  “It will not suffice for Me [merely] to pronounce judgment [and have it executed by a messenger], but even I also will chastise [you], etc.” The principle [of this section] is that it is the Holy One, blessed be He, Who makes this covenant, and this is the meaning of the expressions: seven for your sins; (Verses: 18, 24, 28. See my Hebrew commentary p. 187.)  seven according to your sins. (Verse 21.)  And the oaths are [thus] the oaths of the covenant, for the expressions are from the mouth of the Almighty, [speaking] in the language of the first person: ‘I’ will do; (In Verse 16 before us.)  and ‘I’ will chastise; (Verse 28.)  and ‘I’ will smite. (Verse 24.)  Therefore Scripture states [concerning this covenant], which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel, (Further, Verse 46.)  for He by His Great Name made this covenant. But in the Book of Deuteronomy [Scripture] states, If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments, (Deuteronomy 28:15.)  and it continually mentions there an expression of cursing, thus it starts them [the words of the covenant] with: cursed shalt thou be, (Ibid., Verse 16.)  since the blessing is absent from them, and it further states, the Eternal will make. (Ibid., Verse 24.)  It is this which is the [intention of the] saying of our Rabbis: (Megillah 31 b.)  “The imprecations of the Book of Leviticus were [prounounced] in plural terms [if ‘ye’ will not hearken … if ‘ye’ shall reject …], and Moses, in saying them, said them from the mouth of the Almighty [stating: “Thus did the Holy One blessed be He, say unto me, ‘If ye will not hearken unto Me’ “], but those [imprecations mentioned] in the Book of Deuteronomy were [pronounced] in the singular [if ‘thou’ wilt not hearken … which I command ‘thee'…] and Moses in saying them said them [as though they came] from his own mouth, for the Almighty made Moses a messenger between Him and between all Israel.” Know and understand that these oaths [stated in this section] allude to the first exile [i.e., the Babylonian exile following the destruction of the First Temple], for it is with reference to the First Temple that all the words of this covenant, concerning the exile and the redemption therefrom, apply. For thus you will see in the exhortations [here] that He stated, And if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances, (Verse 15.)  and He further stated, that ye void My covenant, (Verse 15.)  mentioning among them [the rejected statutes]: the high places [on which they offered forbidden sacrifices], sun-images, and idols, (Verse 30.)  and it was [in the times of the First Temple] that they worshipped idols and did all evil things. It is in connection with this that He said, And I will bring your Sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors, (Verse 31.)  thus warning them that He will remove from them His Sanctuary and the acceptance of the offerings which were favorable to Him in that Sanctuary, and the punishments which were to follow upon them were: the sword, (Verse 25.)  wild beasts, (Verse 22.)  pestilence, (Verse 25.)  famine, (Verse 26.)  and finally exile. (Verse 33.)  And all these things occurred then [at the destruction of the First Temple], as is clearly stated in the Book of Jeremiah. Of that [first] exile He stated, Then shall the Land be paid her Sabbaths; (Verse 34.)  As long as it lieth desolate it shall have a rest; even the rest which it had not [in your Sabbath], (Verse 35.)  because the years of the [Babylonian] exile were [as many] as the years in which they failed to observe [the laws of] the Sabbatical years. (See Rashi in Verse 35, who explains how the seventy years of the Babylonian exile correspond exactly to the seventy Sabbatical and Jubilee years that Israel failed to observe in the Land.)  So also does Scripture state concerning that exile, [that it was] To fulfill the word of the Eternal by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the Land had been paid her Sabbaths; for as long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years. (II Chronicles 36:21.)  Thus He warned them and thus it happened to them. If so, it is clear that Scripture speaks here of that [first] exile. If you examine further the subject of the redemption from it [the Babylonian exile, you see], that He only assures [Israel] that He will remember the covenant of the fathers, (Verse 42.)  and of the remembrance of the Land, (Verse 42.)  but not that He will forgive their iniquity and their sin and that He will once again love them as of old, nor that He will gather together those of them who are dispersed. For such indeed happened when they came up from Babylon, for only [the tribes of] Judah and Benjamin returned together with a small group of Levites who were with them, and some (See Ramban’s Sefer Hage’ulah (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, pp. 272-4) for a full discussion of this important matter — that in the return from Babylon there were small groups from the other tribes besides Judah and Benjamin, but the main bulk of them remained in their places, and hence the words of the prophets announcing their complete return, not having been fulfilled during the Second Temple, will yet assuredly come to transpire in the future. This is the deeper significance of Ramban’s expression here: “and some of the other tribes …” — “some” but not all, and therefore the words of G-d as spoken by His prophets will still be fulfilled in the future when the ge’ulah shleimah (the perfect redemption) will take place, as the return from Babylon did not represent that final and complete redemption. It is obvious that this constitutes a major principle in our faith of Israel’s future and destiny. Ramban will touch upon this theme of the perfect redemption further on in the text. See also further, Note 154.)  of the [other] tribes that had been exiled to Babylon, and they returned in poverty, and in servitude to the kings of Persia. (See Ezra 9:9.)  Nor does He state that they will return to Him in complete repentance, but only that they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, (Verse 40.)  and we find that the people of the Second Temple did so, as Daniel confessed: We have sinned, we have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments etc. (Daniel 9:5.)  O Eternal, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers. (Ibid., Verse 8. Thus they confessed also the sins of their fathers. The same applies to the following verses.)  And it is further written, because of our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are a reproach. (Ibid., Verse 16.)  And so did Nehemiah confess. (Nehemiah 1:6-7.)  And Ezra said, Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept Thy law. (Ibid., 9:34. It should be noted that Scripture there ascribes the actual confession to the Levites, and Ezra’s name is not directly mentioned. However, the implication in Chapter 8 Verse 13 is clearly that it was at Ezra’s instigation that they kept the Festival of Tabernacles and the subsequent confession following it (see ibid., 9:1). Besides, Ezra being a priest (ibid., 8:2) he was automatically of the tribe of Levi and was thus included among the Levites who recited the confession.)  Thus they all deduced from the Torah that they should confess their iniquity and [also] the iniquity of their fathers. All these [matters] are clear indications that this covenant does indeed allude to the first exile and the redemption therefrom. However the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 28:1-69.)  alludes to this our [present] exile, and to the redemption by which we will be redeemed from it. Thus we observe first that there [in the second covenant] neither the end nor the duration [of the exile] are alluded to, and that He did not assure us of redemption [i.e., promising that it would take place at a certain future time as was the case with the Babylonian captivity, whose end was foretold as a definite event in our section here in Leviticus as explained above], but He made it dependent upon [our] repentance. Neither did He mention among the sins [for which they would be exiled that] they would make any Asherim and sun-images, or that they would worship any idols whatsoever. Rather, He said, But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes, (Deuteronomy 28:15.)  thus stating that because they will transgress some of His commandments, and will not keep and observe all of them, (I.e., they will “transgress” some of the negative commandments and “not keep and observe” the positive commandments.)  they would be punished. Such indeed was the case during the Second Temple, just as the Rabbis have said: (Yoma 9 b.)  “Why was the First Temple destroyed? Because of idolatry, immorality and bloodshed. But the Second Temple, of which we know that they [the people of that period], were engaged in the study of Torah and the practice of loving kindness, why was it destroyed? It was because of the causeless enmity which was among them.” Neither does He mention there [in the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy] the Sanctuary, or “the pleasing odor” [of the offerings], as He mentioned here, (Verse 31.)  because the [Heavenly] fire did not come down and consume the offerings [that were brought] in the Second Temple, as the Rabbis testified there in Tractate Yoma. (Yoma 21 b. Thus, as it were, there never was a “pleasing odor” in the days of the Second Temple which could be removed at its destruction.)  And He further states there among the imprecations, The Eternal will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the vulture swoops down, (Deuteronomy 28:49.)  alluding to the coming upon them of the Romans, who were very far from them. Thus He states there, a nation that thou hast not known; (Ibid., Verse 36.)  a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand, (Deuteronomy 28:49.)  because of their great distance from our Land. Such is not the case concerning the words of this covenant [before us], for [it speaks of the time when] they were exiled to Babylon and Assyria, which are near to [our] Land, and they always warred with them; (Therefore, the verse in Deuteronomy 28:49 [The Eternal will bring a nation … from the end of the earth …] could not apply to the period of the First Temple, as their warring enemies were nearby. The case was far different during the Second Temple when the Romans came from far-off Italy.)  and the stock of Israel comes from there, and they [the Jews] knew their language, as it is said, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Aramean language, for we understand it. (II Kings 18:26.)  Similarly, the verse stating [there in the Book of Deuteronomy], And the Eternal shall scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth unto the other (Deuteronomy 28:64.)  is [a reference to] our exile today, in which we are scattered from one end of the world to the other. Again He stated [there], And the Eternal shall bring thee back into Egypt in ships, (Ibid., Verse 68.)  and this happened in our [present] exile, when Titus filled the ships with them [captives], as it is written in the books of the Romans. (Reference is to the book of Josippon, Chapter 95. See Vol. I, p. 604, Note 249.)  Similarly, that which Scripture says there, Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thy eyes shall see; (Deuteronomy 28:32.)  Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and they shall not be thine, for they shall go into captivity (Ibid., Verse 41. Ramban’s illuminating comment on these verses (see following text) brings to light the ruthless cruelty of the Romans at the destruction of the Second Temple, when they deported all the young and only “the fathers [i.e. the old] remained in the Land.”)  — these are not references to the [Babylonian] exile, when both fathers and sons were exiled, but [refer] to that captivity of the sons alone [following the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans], when the fathers remained in the Land. Such is not stated in the first covenant, because the exile [which it speaks of] was a complete one [for both fathers and sons], but it is mentioned in the second covenant, because the Romans ruled in our Land and took the sons and daughters at their will. Similarly, [the verse stating], Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Eternal shall send against thee in hunger, and in thirst (Ibid., Verse 48.)  is a reference to our servitude when we were subject to the Romans in our Land, and their officers ruled over us, pressing upon us a heavy yoke and taking away our people and our wealth, as is known in the [history] books. Another proof [that the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy refers to the exile after the destruction of the Second Temple] is that He said, The Eternal will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, (Ibid., Verse 36.)  for King Agrippa (This was Agrippa II, a loyal servant of Rome. He was the last king of Judea. During the siege of Jerusalem he was with Titus, and following the fall of the city he took part in arranging the Roman triumphal celebrations in Caesarea! He was the opposite of his father King Agrippa I, who in his genuine attachment to the Jewish people and religion won the love of all classes of the people.)  went to Rome at the end of the [period of the] Second Temple, and on account of his going there the Temple was destroyed. (Ramban here is referring to Josippon Chapter 65, where it is narrated that “King Agrippa went to Nero, emperor of Rome, and told him all these things [concerning the Jewish uprising against Rome], whereupon Nero sent against the Jews the Roman general etc.” This was the beginning of the war which culminated in the fall of Jerusalem.)  Now Scripture does not state: “the king who will rule over thee,” but it says, thy king whom ‘thou shalt set’. Thus He, blessed be He, is hinting to us that he [that ruler] was not fit to be king, since he was forbidden to be king over Israel according to the law of the Torah [as he was a descendant of King Herod, the son of Antipater the Idumean, and Scripture states, thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother], (Deuteronomy 17:15.)  but they “set up” him and his fathers as kings over them against the law, as is mentioned in Tractate Sotah. (Sotah 41 b.)  Now all the hints such as these clearly indicate that the meaning of this matter is this our [present] exile, and the redemption [mentioned] in this second covenant, which will be a complete redemption, superior to all [preceding ones]. Thus He said, And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse etc.; (Deuteronomy 30:1.)  and He promised, And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers, (Ibid., Verse 5.)  this being a promise to all the tribes of Israel, not [merely] to one-sixth (I.e., the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which constitute one-sixth of the twelve tribes. Ramban is thus stating that the redemption from the Babylonian exile was not a complete redemption, since the return consisted mainly of two tribes [with small groups of the other tribes, see above Note 124]. But the Divine promise stated in Deuteronomy 30:5 [as mentioned here in the text] refers to all tribes of Israel. Hence the coming redemption will be more complete than all preceding ones.)  of the people; and there He promised [also] that He would cut down and destroy those who caused our exile, as it is said, And the Eternal thy G-d will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee, (Ibid., Verse 7.)  the expressions, thine enemies and those that hate thee alluding to the two nations (A reference to the two dominant religions in Ramban’s times — that of Edom and Ishmael — which persecuted the Jews [and still continue to do so] in countless ways. See my Hebrew commentary p. 190.)  that continually persecute us. Now these words [And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers (Ibid., Verse 5.) ] assure us of the coming redemption with a more perfect assurance than all the visions of Daniel. Similarly, that which He stated here, and your enemies that shall dwell therein shall be desolate in it (Further, Verse 32.)  constitutes a good tiding, proclaiming that during all our exiles, our Land will not accept our enemies. This also is a great proof and assurance to us, for in the whole inhabited part of the world one cannot find such a good and large Land (Exodus 3:8.)  which was always lived in and yet is as ruined as it is [today], (When these words were written — sometime after the middle of the thirteenth century — the Land of Israel had just experienced the Mongolian invasion (of 1259-60), which following upon the constant wars of the Crusaders, left the country in total ruin.)  for since the time that we left it, it has not accepted any nation or people, and they all try to settle it, but to no avail. (A clear reference to the many nations that have tried — and failed — to cultivate the Land of Israel since the Jews were driven from it by the Romans. This indubitable historical fact is, as Ramban correctly points out, “a great proof” that the Land belongs to Israel. Witness also the miraculous response of the Land since the recent return of the Jews to its borders.)  Now the first covenant mentioned in this section the Holy One, blessed be He, made, for His Great Name was indeed with us in the First Temple, and the second covenant in the section of V’hayah Ki Thavo (Deuteronomy 26:1. — The covenant referred to is ibid., 28:1-68.)  expressed by the mouth of Moses, alludes to the removal of his Divine Presence entirely, since in the Second Temple only the Glory of His Name was present, as it is said, and I will take pleasure in it i.e., the Second Temple] ‘v’ikavdah’ (and I will be glorified). (Haggai 1:8.)  The additional letter hei (The word v’ikavdah is in this instance actually written without the hei at the end. Ramban however is referring to the fact that according to the Masorah it is to be read as if it had the letter at the end. Hence his language: “the ‘additional’ hei” …)  alludes to the second hei in the Great Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton — which refers to the Glory of His Name]. (Abusaula. — Thus the verse establishes that in the Second Temple there was the Glory of His Name. Haggai was one of the prophets who lived at the time of the building of the Second Temple.)  The Rabbis have also already interpreted this verse by means of another exposition, (Yoma 21 b. Thus, as it were, there never was a “pleasing odor” in the days of the Second Temple which could be removed at its destruction.)  [that the missing hei in the word v’ikavdah, whose numerical value is five], alludes to the five things which the Second Temple lacked etc. (“They are: the ark with the cover and the cherubim, the Divine fire on the altar, the Divine Presence, the Holy Spirit, and the Urim and Thummim” (ibid.). For Urim and Thummim see Ramban on Exodus 28:30 (Vol. II, pp. 480-4).) "

30,1,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 30:11:1,"FOR THIS COMMANDMENT. The meaning thereof is that it refers to the entire Torah. But the correct interpretation is that when he refers to the entire Torah, he says [as above] Every commandment which I command thee this day. (Above 8:1.)  Rather [the expression used here] this commandment refers to [the commandment of] repentance aforementioned, for the verses, and thou shalt bethink thyself; (Above, Verse 1.)  and thou shalt return unto the Eternal thy G-d (Ibid., Verse 2.)  constitute a commandment, wherein he commands us to do so. It is stated in a future tense [rather than in the imperative] to suggest, in the form of a pledge, that it is destined [that Israel will repent]. And the sense thereof is to state that if thy outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven (Above, Verse 4.)  and you are under the power of the nations, you can yet return to G-d and do according to all that I command thee this day, (Ibid., Verse 2.)  for the thing is not hard, nor far off from you, but rather very nigh unto thee (Further, Verse 14.)  to do it at all times and in all places. This is the sense of the expression, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it (Further, Verse 14.)  meaning that they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers (Leviticus 26:40.)  by word of their mouth, and return in their heart to G-d and accept the Torah upon themselves this day to perform it throughout the generations, as he mentioned, thou and thy children with all thy heart, (Above, Verse 2.)  as I have explained. (Ibid., and in Verse 6.) "
30,1,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Repentance 7:5","All the prophets commanded [the people] to repent. Israel will only be redeemed through Teshuvah. The Torah has already promised that, ultimately, Israel will repent towards the end of her exile and, immediately, she will be redeemed as [Deuteronomy 30:1-3] states: ”There shall come a time when [you will experience] all these things... and you will return to God, your Lord.... God, your Lord, will bring back your [captivity].”"
30,1,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 6","“And it shall be, when all of these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall take them to your heart among the nations, to where Hashem has driven you. And you shall return unto Hashem your God, and heed His voice … And if your exiles shall be in the outermost regions of the cosmos, from there Hashem your God will gather you, and from there He will take you … And Hashem your God will circumcise your heart … to love Hashem your God … And Hashem your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and on those who hate you … And you shall return and listen to the voice of Hashem, and do all His mitzvot, which I command you this day.” (Devarim, 30:1–8) The way the Torah says “the blessing and the curse” has a special meaning. Within the curse, the blessing also exists in secret. “You shall take them to your heart,” means that you shall take to your heart that the blessing also exists within the curse. “And you shall return unto Hashem your God, and heed His voice” means the inner voice that exists in everything. This is as it is written in the Holy Zohar (Bereshit, 50b), “and Hashem your God shall return your captives and be merciful with you.” This means mercy in the purity and wholeness of heart that God will give you in words of Torah and the study of Torah with desire and wholeness of heart. “And if your exiles shall be in the outermost regions of the cosmos” means a place your whole understanding tells you is far from your ability to fix, “From there Hashem your God will gather you, and from there He will take you,” meaning that even there will God fix you. “And Hashem your God will circumcise your heart… to love Hashem your God,” means that he will take the desire you have for matters that are not good in the eyes of God, and fix it at the time when you return in complete teshuva (repentance) in the love of God and the desire for words of Torah. “And Hashem your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and on those who hate you” means he will take the evil lusts that exist in you and place them upon your enemies and those who hate you. “And you shall return and listen to the voice of Hashem, and do all His mitzvot” means that God will clarify all the lusts within you, and give this desire back to you to use in the fulfillment of His mitzvot and statutes."
30,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:1:2,"Perhaps we can understand this better in light of Berachot 54 that ""one must recite a benediction when he experiences something he perceives as a blessing as well as when he experiences something which appears to him as evil."" The Talmud there on folio 60 goes so far as to say that even when we experience something which we perceive as evil we must accept it joyfully. ..."
30,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:1:3,"This is what the Torah has in mind when it introduces this verse with the word והיה which always has a joyful connotation. Moses could not have made this point if he had written only: ""when the blessing or the curse come upon you."" I would then have read the words ""the blessing"" as referring to the word והיה, which implies something joyful. The words: ""or the curse,"" I would have understood as belonging to what follows, i.e. something that might lead to penitence but not something that the Israelite would acknowledge as being meant for his own good."
30,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:1:4,"When having a second look at our verse I have realised how much G'd's fondness for the Jewish people is reflected here. When referring to the blessing the Torah writes: כי יבאו עליך, when the blessing will come upon you,"" whereas when writing about the curse the Torah writes: והקללה אשר נתתי לפניך, ""the curse which I have presented before you."" This is another reason why the introduction והיה כי יבאו עליך כל הדברים האלה is necessary. ..."
30,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:1:5,"Had Moses not used this formulation we would have interpreted the word לפניך as applying both to the blessing and to the curse in equal measure. Only the introductory words enable us to realise that the nature of the curse will be different from the blessing. Do not worry about the fact that the Torah writes הדברים ""the things"" in the plural, whereas the blessing is mentioned in the singular. There are many examples in the Torah of constructions such as this."
30,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:1:6,"הברכה והקללה, ""the blessing or the curse, etc."" There is no need for the Torah to tell us that G'd will welcome Israelites with open arms if they sin and return in penitence before G'd has withdrawn the blessings they have become used to. The message of our verse is that even if the Israelites sinned so much that G'd has brought the curses upon them, He will still assist them in their penitence though it is due only to the afflictions the people have experienced."
30,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:1:7,"We have to explain the need for the Torah to mention the blessing at this juncture altogether. It would have sufficed to write the word הקללה, ""the curse,"" as this is the catalyst that sparks repentance. Perhaps the Torah describes some of the thought processes which preceded the penitence of the Israelites. As long as the Israelites had not sinned and had experienced blessings in abundance they had not attributed it to their lifestyle. They had taken such blessings for granted, considering them as their due. Only after being deprived of these blessings do the Israelites begin to perceive that the lifestyle they used to enjoy was due to G'd bestowing special blessings on them."
30,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:1:8,"והשבת אל לבבך, ""and you will take it to heart, etc."" The Torah uses this expression because sinners are misled by their hearts. "
30,1,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:1:9,"The Torah refers to an additional error the exiled Jew makes before he becomes a penitent. Even when he considers for a moment that the troubles he finds himself in are due to his having disobeyed G'd, the evil urge will tell him that this is not so. He will try and convince the Jew that they are not the only people who have experienced exile from time to time. The Torah counters this argument by writing בכל הגוים, ""amongst all the nations."" When other nations are exiled they are exiled to one or two countries. No nation has ever been scattered to the four corners of the earth as have the Jews."
30,1,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Balak, Torah Ohr 9","Concerning the above mentioned matters, the Torah wrote in Deut. 30,1: ""It will be when all these things befall you, the blessing and the curse that I have set before you, and you take them to heart amidst the various nations to which the Lord your G–d has banished you, and you return to the Lord your G–d, etc."" Why did the Torah see fit to mention הברכה, ""the blessing,"" in that verse? All that needed to be mentioned is the curse which eventually would lead to repentance! We therefore see, that the Torah wanted to make the point that the curse itself is really a dimension of the blessing. This is parallel to the verse in Nechemiah 13,2: ויהפוך אלוקינו הקללה לברכה"""" Our G–d turned the curse into a blessing."" Bileam, who had come prepared to curse, was forced to bless instead. The angel who delights in evil was forced to give his consent to the blessings; the accuser was turned into an advocate for the defense."
30,1,Commentary,Malbim on Deuteronomy 30:1:3,"...We have learned from that which it states, ""and cast them away to another land,"" that the exile will be in this manner of casting out only until they reach the other land; but in the lands of the nations, it was only in the manner of of driving away... And there is a difference between ""casting away"" and ""driving away"" in three things: A) In that one who casts [something] away and throws [it] makes the thing distant from him; B) that by being cast away, the thing spoils; and C) he shows that he does not want to know where it lays. But one who drives [something] away needs to be close to the thing the whole time he is driving it away; and by driving it away, the thing does not spoil; and he knows the place of that thing. So it is possible to explain, ""and you shall take it to heart amidst the various nations"" - when you dwell among the nations, you shall put into your heart, ""that which the Lord your God has driven you out"" - that He has driven you out to a special place. It is like someone who drives something from one place to another until he finds a place where it can rest properly. And this is a proof that the eyes of the Lord your God are upon you for the good."
30,1,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Hosea 2:1:1,"And the number...shall be What is the connection of retribution and consolation juxtaposed in one speech? Our Rabbis explained in Pesachim (87b): Hosea felt that he had sinned by saying, “Exchange them for another nation.” He stood and begged mercy for them (See above 1:2). And in Sifrei Devei Rav, in the section commencing: “And Israel abode in Shittim” (Num. 25) we learned: Rabbi says: Some sections are close to each other yet as far apart as east is far from west. “For you are not My people... And the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea.” What is the connection of one to the other? This can be compared to a king who became angry with his wife. He summoned a scribe to come and write a bill of divorcement. Before the scribe arrived, the king became reconciled with his wife. Said the king, “Is it possible that this scribe should leave here divided?” I.e. his heart should be divided and bewildered, saying, “Why did the king send for me?” He said to him, “Come and write that I am doubling her kethubah.” And according to its simple meaning, this is the reason for its juxtaposition. “For you are not My people, and I will not be yours.” I will show Myself as though I am not yours, and you shall be exiled among the nations, and even there you shall multiply and grow, and there you shall lay it to your heart to return to Me, as it is said through Moses (Deut. 30:1,3): “And you shall lay it to your heart among all the nations where...has exiled you etc. And the Lord your God shall return your captivity.” Here too, “And the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together.”"
30,3,Musar,Orchot Tzadikim 26:123,"The general rule of the matter is that a man should repent of all bad qualities, and one who does repent his evil qualities needs very great strengthening, for when a man is already used to them it is very difficult for him to abandon them, and on this subject it is said, ""Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts"" (Is. 55:7). And let not a man who is truly repentant think that he is far away from the status of the righteous because of the sins and the wrongs which he has committed. It is not so, for he is as beloved and dear before the Creator, Blessed be He, as though he had never sinned. Not only this, but his reward is great, for he has tasted the taste of sin, and yet abandoned it and conquered his evil inclination. Our Sages said, ""In the place where penitents stand, even the wholly righteous cannot stand"" (Berakoth 34b), that is to say, their status is even higher than that of those who never sinned, for they subdue the evil inclination more than the others. All of the prophets without exception commanded us concerning repentance (ibid.), and it is only through repentance that Israel is redeemed (see Yoma 86b, Sanh. 97b). And the Torah has already assured us that Israel will ultimately repent at the end of their exile, and they will immediately be redeemed. As it is said, ""And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessings and the curse which I have set before thee and thou shalt bethink thyself… and shalt return unto the Lord thy God… that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples"" (Deut. 30:1—3)."
30,1,Chasidut,Flames of Faith 12:34,"Even the sinner has an inner point—his yechidah—that is perfectly righteous. Teshuvah is when he returns to this inner essence and allows it to influence the rest of his personality. Perhaps this is the meaning of the verse, Ve-hasheivosa el levavecha (Deut. 30:1), which is literally translated, “Take it to heart,” but it may also mean, “Return to your heart.” (See further Noam Elimelech, Parashas Vaeschanan, s.v. hishamer lecha, who writes, “A person should constantly consider his Heavenly soul... for if he does not know himself he will definitely not know the Almighty.”) "

30,1,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 29:27:1,"AND THE ETERNAL ROOTED THEM OUT OF THEIR LAND, for He will exile the tribe that will do evil in the sight of the Eternal, as it is stated, and he [the king of Assyria] carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Menasheh. (I Chronicles 5:26.)  The correct interpretation is that he is now alluding to the exile of all Israel, all of them being evil, and they will be banished in a complete exile. Similarly, the following chapter, And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee (Further, 30:1.)  is a reference to the exile of all Israel, as he said, among all the nations whither the Eternal thy G-d hath driven thee, (Further, 30:1.)  and so he concludes the entire chapter."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,1,Jewish Thought,Kuzari 2:34,"34. The Rabbi: Do not believe that I, though agreeing with thee, admit that we are dead. We still hold connexion with that Divine Influence through the laws which He has placed as a link between us and Him. There is circumcision, of which it is said: 'My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant' (Genesis 17:13). There is further the Sabbath, 'It is a sign between me and you throughout your generations' (Exodus 31:13). Besides this there is 'the covenant of the Fathers,' and the covenant of the law, first granted on Hōreb, and then in the plains of Moab in connexion with the promises and warnings laid down in the section: When thou shalt beget children and grandchildren' (Deuteronomy 4:25). Compare further the antithesis: 'If any of thine be driven out unto the utmost parts of heaven' (Deuteronomy 30:10); 'Thou shalt return unto the Lord thy God' (Deuteronomy 30:2), finally, the song: 'Give ear' (Deuteronomy 32:1); and other places. We are not like dead, but rather like a sick and attenuated person who has been given up by the physicians, and yet hopes for a miracle or an extraordinary recovery, as it is said: 'Can these bones live?' (Ezekiel 37:3). Compare also the simile in the words: 'Behold my servant shall prosper'; 'He has no form nor comeliness,' 'Like one from whom men hid their faces' (Isaiah 52:13; which means that he is, on account of his deformity and repulsive visage, compared to an unclean thing, which man only beholds with disgust, and turns away; 'Despised and rejected of men,' 'A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief' (Isaiah 53:3)."

Allein Stellen wie hier und so auch ולא ישיב על לבו (Jes. 44, 19). זאת אשיב אל לבי (Klagel. 3, 21) dürften doch für eine andere Auffassung sprechen. Es scheint: die Tätigkeit des Erkennens außer uns gegebener Tatsachen wird als eine nach außen gehende Richtung des Geistes begriffen. Die Tätigkeit aber, die das so Erkannte nun vor das Forum des urteilenden und folgernden Nachdenkens bringt, wird als eine zurückbringende, von außen nach innen gerichtete, das in der Außenwelt Erkannte, an das Innere zurückbringende Tätigkeit gefasst, für welche השיב אל לב der geeignete Ausdruck ist. Ähnliches liegt ja dem Ausdruck: Reflexion zu Grunde. So Jes.: חציו שרפתי usw. sind dem Geiste sehr wohl bekannte äußere Tatsachen. Aber er bringt das Erkannte nicht seinem Innern zurück, um darüber nachzudenken und das daraus sich Ergebende zu folgern. Klagel.: חסדי ד׳ כי לא תמנו usw. sind äußere geschichtlich erfahrene Tatsachen, die er aus der äußeren Erfahrung in sein Inneres zurückbringt, um daraus Tröstliches zu folgern.

30,1,Chasidut,"Tanya, Part II; Shaar HaYichud VehaEmunah 1:2","“Know this day and take to your heart that Havaya is Elokim (G–d is the L–rd) (The Ineffable Name—the Name of four letters, Y-H-V-H—is pronounced in conversation Havaya. The prescribed traditional reading in Scripture and prayer is Ad-nay. Hence, the usual English rendition of L–rd. However, the name Havaya refers to G–d the Infinite, transcending creation and nature, omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient. Therefore, it is here translated “G–d.” The name Elokim emphasizes G–d’s justice and rulership (see Rashi’s commentary, Genesis 2:5, 6:2), therefore it is translated “L–rd” instead of the usual rendition of G–d. The original Hebrew readings of both names, rather than their translations, are retained throughout this text as their definition and explanation form a basic part of this treatise and are fully explained in chs. 4 and 6, below.)  in the heavens above and upon the earth below; there is no other.” (Deuteronomy 4:39.)  This requires explanation. For would it occur to you that there is a god “soaking” in the waters beneath the earth that it is necessary to negate it so strongly [as to say,] “Take to your heart?” (A simple negative statement would suffice to repudiate the absurd polytheistic notion of a deity inhabiting the waters. Obviously, the emphasis upon the importance of meditation and contemplation that “there is no other” points to a rejection of something far more subtle. The answer to this question will be found in ch. 6. The first five chapters give the reader sufficient background to understand it.) "
30,1,Kabbalah,"Sha'arei Orah, Tenth Gate, First Sefirah 59","Included in these principles is the Sefirah of the moon-Levanah-לבנה (Kingship-Malcut). Whoever knows the secret that is hidden and sealed in the White Head-Rosh HaLavan-ראש הלבן, will contemplate the secret of the moon-Levanah-לבנה – beginning-Rosh-ראש and end-Sof-סוף. Now, the primordial snake-Nachash HaKadmonee, that is drawn from the power of Lavan-לבן the Aramean, instilled blemish in the moon-Levanah-לבנה, through Adam, the first man, who could not wait a mere hour for the prohibition of Orlah to pass. (Midrash Bereishit Rabba 21:7; Vayikra Rabba 25:2 and elsewhere. Had he waited one hour until Shabbat, the fruit of the tree would have been permitted to him.)  As a result, he ate from the tree while it still was mingled with good and evil, and did not wait until the evil took its portion in the place called the foreskin-Orlah-ערלה. The tree would then have been called good-Tov-טוב and not evil-Ra-רע, and he would have been permitted to eat from it to his heart’s content, and he would eat and live forever. This is the secret of the Tree of Life-Etz HaChayim-עץ החיים which adheres to the Tree of Knowledge-Etz HaDa’at-עץ הדעת, but is only good-Tov-טוב. The sign for this is the verse, (Deuteronomy 30:15)  “See – I have placed before you today life-Chayim-חיים and good-Tov-טוב and death-Mavet-מות and evil-Ra-רע.” The whole matter is clearly explained by the verse, (Proverbs 31:12)  “She bestows goodness-Tov-טוב upon him, never evil-Ra-רע, all the days of her life,” for this is certainly so. If only Adam, the first man, would have waited to cut of the foreskin-Orlah-ערלה, it would no longer be the Tree of the Knowledge of good and evil, but would only be good. However, when he ate of it, it still was mingled with good and evil."

This is the intent of ""if you seek Him with all your heart and all your soul."" And this is the precondition for the Blessed One's redeeming us from among the nations and leading us erect back to our land. But even repentance of lesser perfection is of avail, protecting against afflictions and reducing suffering, as it is written (Deuteronomy 30:1-4): ""And it will be, when all of these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse… then the L-rd your G-d will return your captivity and have mercy upon you… If your outcasts be at the ends of the heavens — from there will the L-rd your G-d gather you, and from there will He take you.""

First it is stated ""and you return to your heart,"" and then ""and you return to the L-rd your G-d""; and the latter verse, too, first states ""then the L-rd your G-d will return your captivity,"" and then ""and He will return and gather You from all the nations."" Why these pairs? The apparent explanation is as follows: First it is written ""and you return to your heart"" — that is, if you have resolved upon repentance in your heart, but have not yet completed it by fulfilling it in deed — and then you strengthen yourself to complete it, as it is written ""and you return to the L-rd your G-d and listen to His voice"" — the result will be that the L-rd will reward you in kind for each of these two returnings. For the first, your resolving to return in your heart, ""the L-rd your G-d will return your captivity and have mercy upon you."" That is, he will make all your captors look compassionately upon you (""return"" [shav], in this context, being understood as ""ease,"" as in [Isaiah 30:15]: ""In ease [shuvah] and gentleness you will be saved""), but He will not redeem you entirely for this alone; for just as you have not completed your repentance, He will not complete your redemption. But for the second returning, your returning to the L-rd your G-d and listening to His voice — that is, completing your repentance entirely — ""He will return and gather you from all the nations"" — that is, He will complete your redemption entirely, it being written afterwards: ""If your outcasts be at the ends of the heavens, from there the L-rd your G-d will gather you, and from there He will take you. And the L-rd your G-d will bring you to the land which your fathers inherited, and you will inherit it. And He will do good to you and multiply you more than your fathers."""

And the other part of the people are those who - because of the troubles and the heaviness of the exile - have transgressed against His religion; as it is stated there (Deuteronomy 4:28), ""And you shall worship other gods there...,"" as I explained. Hence it stated corresponding to the two parts of the nation, ""you shall bring it to your heart amidst the various nations to which the Lord your God has banished you. And you will return to the Lord your God."" As behold the first statement is about those under duress (anusim) that have left the framework of the religion. Hence to those, it stated, ""you shall bring it to your heart"" - as their repentance will [only] be in the heart and not in the mouth. For they will not be able to publicize their repentance and their faith. And this is [the meaning] of its stating, ""amidst the various nations to which the Lord your God has banished you"" - meaning to say, that they are mixed in with them and considered like them. Nevertheless, they will return to the Lord in their hearts. And regarding the other part of the Jews that are known [to be Jews], it states, ""and you will return to the Lord your God, and you and your children will heed His voice with all your heart and soul, just as I enjoin upon you this day"" - meaning to say that they will repent and do the commandments and heed the voice of God publicly, they and their children. For they have not abandoned their God there. And when they repent to God, they will follow Him. But [both] these and those will run [to Him] - each one according to his condition and his context. It promised that God, may He be blessed, will gather them unto Him. And this is [the meaning of] ""And the Lord your God will return your captivity and have mercy upon you; and He will return and gather you."" Behold it said, ""And the Lord your God will return your captivity and have mercy upon you,"" about that part that are Jews publicly and hold on to their Judaism. And it states about them, ""your captivity,"" since they are in captivity and servitude. And it states, ""and [He will] have mercy upon you,"" as they will need mercy, due to their lowliness and troubles. However regarding the other part that have left the framework of the religion because of the their duress, it states, ""and He will return and gather you from all of the nations."" But it did not state regarding them, ""captivity"" nor ""mercy."" And this is the reason that it states that He will gather them from all the nations; as they are mixed in with them and have intermarried with them. And about these, it states (Deuteronomy 30:4), ""Even if your outcasts are at the ends of the world, from there the Lord your God will gather you, from there He will fetch you""..."
30,1,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 7:10,"Another matter: “Command the children of Israel” (Numbers 5:2) – the Rabbis interpreted that the verse refers to exile. “Command the children of Israel” – because they violated the mitzvot, they incurred liability to be banished; this is exile. That is what is written: “They shall send out from the camp” (Numbers 5:2); “they shall send out” is nothing other than an expression of exile, just as it says: “Send them out from My Presence, and let them go” (Jeremiah 15:1). “From the camp” – this is the Land of Israel, as the Divine Presence dwells there. “Every leper and every zav, and every one impure by means of a corpse” (Numbers 5:2) – He implied to them that if Israel violates these three transgressions, idol worship, illicit sexual relations, and bloodshed, they will incur liability to be exiled. “Leper” – this is idol worship. Just as a leper impurifies through entry, so idol worship impurifies through entry. (If a leper enters a house everything in the house becomes impure; if something which was offered to an idol is under a roof, everything under the roof becomes impure (see Ḥullin 13b).)  “Zav” – this is illicit sexual relations. These and those are impurified by means of a seminal emission. (Illicit sexual relations impurify the land. See Leviticus 18:24–28.)  “Impure by means of a corpse” – these are murderers, who impurify themselves and impurify the land with bloodshed. We learned that it is so: (Mishna Avot 5:12.)  Exile comes to the world for idol worship, for illicit sexual relations, for bloodshed, and for failure to leave the land fallow. (During the Sabbatical Year. )   For idol worship, how so? It says: “I will destroy your private altars, [and eliminate your sun-stones, and I will cast your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols]” (Leviticus 26:30). And it is written: “And you I will scatter among the nations…” (Leviticus 26:33). The Omnipresent said to Israel: Since you desire idol worship, I will exile you to a place where there is idol worship. That is why “I will destroy your private altars.”   For illicit sexual relations, how so? Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei said: Whenever Israel are steeped in illicit sexual relations [arayot], the Divine Presence departs from them, as it is stated: “And He will not see a shameful matter [ervat davar] (Erva is the singular of arayot.)  in your midst, and turn from behind you” (Deuteronomy 23:15)  For bloodshed how so? It is as it is stated: “You shall not pollute the land [in which you are, as the blood will pollute the land.… And do not impurify the land]” (Numbers 35:33–34). The verse tells that bloodshed impurifies the land, and the Divine Presence departs. It is due to bloodshed that the Temple was destroyed and Israel was exiled from their land.  These matters were in the first Temple, and that is why they were exiled and the Temple was destroyed, as Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Toreta said: Due to what reason was the first Temple destroyed? It was due to the fact that there were three matters in it: Idol worship, illicit sexual relations, and bloodshed. Idol worship, as it is written: “For the bedding is too short for stretching [mehistare’a]…” (Isaiah 28:20). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan said: This bed is too short for two counterparts [re’im] to dominate [mehistarer] as one. (Mehistare’a is a portmanteau of mehistarer and re’a.)  “And the covering [vehamasekha] is too narrow [tzara] for taking shelter [kehitkannes]” (Isaiah 28:20) – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that when Rabbi Yonatan would reach this verse, he would weep and say: For the One in whose regard it is written: “He gathers [kones] waters of the sea together as a mound” (Psalms 33:7), will the idol [masekha] became a rival [tzara]? Illicit sexual relations, as it is written: “The Lord says: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty [and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes]” (Isaiah 3:16). Bloodshed, as it is written: “Moreover, Menashe shed very much innocent blood…” (II Kings 21:16). That is why the Holy One blessed be He brought upon them three calamities corresponding to the three transgressions that they performed, as it is stated: “Therefore, due to you, Zion will be plowed as a field; [Jerusalem will become heaps, and the Temple Mount into forested heights [bamot]] (Micah 3:12). (The term bamot also refers to private altars, and in many instances, altars of idol worship, which were regularly built in elevated locations.)   This sending (“They shall send out from the camp” (Numbers 5:2).)  is stated regarding the Babylonian exile. “Male and female alike you shall send out” (Numbers 5:3) – that is stated corresponding to the exile of Media, as they went from Babylon to Media. Because they did not depart from the Land of Israel when they were exiled to Media, that is why “camp” is not stated here. Why is “male and female alike” written regarding the exile of Media? He implied to them that the kingdom of Media was destined to issue edicts upon them, “male and female alike,” as it is stated: “The scrolls were sent in the hand of the couriers to all the king’s provinces: To destroy, [to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews, from lad to elder, children and women]” (Esther 3:13). “Outside the camp you shall send them” (Numbers 5:3) – this is stated corresponding to the exile of Edom, (Edom refers to the Roman Empire.)  who destroyed the Temple and exiled Israel from their land. Why is the exile of Edom juxtaposed to the exile of Babylon? It is because just as Babylon destroyed the Temple and exiled Israel, so did the Edomites. Likewise it says: “Daughter of Babylon, marked for devastation” (Psalms 137:8) – the verse characterizes Edom as the daughter of Babylon; (The previous verse states: “Remember, Lord, the day of Jerusalem against the sons of Edom” (Psalms 137:7).)  even though the exile of Media is interposed between them in this verse, (“Male and female alike you shall send out” separates between the allusion to Babylon and the allusion to Edom.)  it is only because the exile of Media comes as an extension of the exile of Babylon, as when they were exiled to Media they departed from Babylon. “They shall not impurify their camp” (Numbers 5:3) – that is stated corresponding to the subjugation to Greece. This is why “sending” is not stated in its regard, as they did not exile them from their land. This is the reason that impurity is stated in its regard, as the Greeks impurified the Sanctuary with their idols.  “In which I dwell in their midst” (Numbers 5:3) – He implied to them that in every place they were exiled, the Divine Presence was with them. It is taught: Rabbi Natan says: Israel are beloved, as every place they were exiled, the Divine Presence was with them. They were exiled to Egypt; the Divine Presence was with them, as it is stated: “Did I not appear to your father's house, [when they were in Egypt]” (I Samuel 2:27). They were exiled to Babylon; the Divine Presence was with them, as it is stated: “For your sake, I sent to Babylon…” (Isaiah 43:14). They were exiled to Elam; the Divine Presence was with them, as it is stated: “I will place My throne in Elam” (Jeremiah 49:38). They were exiled to Edom; the Divine Presence was with them, as it is stated: “Who is this coming from Edom…” (Isaiah 63:1). When they are scattered, the Divine Presence is with them, as it is stated: “The Lord your God will return [veshav] your returnees…” (Deuteronomy 30:3). It is not written here: Will restore [veheshiv], but rather, “will return [veshav].” And it says: “With me from Lebanon, my bride, [with me from Lebanon, come]” (Song of Songs 4:8).  “The children of Israel did so, and sent them outside the camp” – when they sinned, they were exiled. “As the Lord spoke to Moses, so the children of Israel did” – what did the Holy One blessed be He speak to Moses? It is that if they will repent in the kingdoms where they will be, the Holy One blessed be He will gather them, as it is stated: “It will be when all these matters will come upon you, the blessing and the curse [that I have placed before you, you shall restore to your heart among all the nations that the Lord your God has banished you there. And you will return to the Lord your God].… The Lord your God [will bring you to the land]… The Lord your God will circumcise [your heart]…” (Deuteronomy 30:1–2, 5–6).  “So the children of Israel did [asu]” – that Israel is destined to repent [laasot teshuva] at the end of days and they would be redeemed, as it is stated: “With repose [beshuva] and stillness you will be saved” (Isaiah 30:15). Just as a leper, a zav, and one impure due to a corpse will never be purified until they enter pure water, so, the Holy One blessed be He is destined to sprinkle pure water upon them and to purify them, as it is stated: “I will sprinkle pure water upon you, and you will be purified…” (Ezekiel 36:25)."
30,10,Quoting Commentary,Depths of Yonah 3:3:14,"Conclusion However we explain it, Nineveh’s Teshuvah stands as an example of a communal Teshuvah that the Jewish people will perform which will initiate the arrival of Mashiach (Devarim 30:1-10 and Rambam Hilchot Teshuvah 7:5). Nineveh’s one hundred percent participation sets a powerful example for our people, an important message year round but especially as the day of Yom Kippur draws to a close."

30,1,Jewish Thought,"Crisis and Covenant; Jewish Thought after the Holocaust, Chapter 2; The Valley of the Shadow 30","Few followed Rubinstein in his abandonment of faith. For even if a backward-looking explanation in terms of sin and punishment failed to do justice to the tragedy, there was another traditional approach, namely to look forward and attempt to understand the Holocaust not in terms of divine punishment but divine purpose. The Holocaust was not the end of the Jewish people. Three years later, a no less epic event took place, the creation of the State of Israel. Emerging from the shadow of death, Jews had returned to the promised land. And was this not precisely what the Torah had foretold? “When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come upon you and you take them to heart wherever the Lord your God disperses you among the nations…then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and take you back in love. He will bring you together again from all the peoples where the Lord your God has scattered you.” (Deuteronomy 30: 1, 3.) "
30,2,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 30:2:1,"AND THOU SHALT RETURN UNTO THE ETERNAL THY G-D, AND HEARKEN TO HIS VOICE ACCORDING TO ALL THAT I COMMAND THEE THIS DAY, THOU AND THY CHILDREN. The meaning thereof is that you will return with all thy heart, and with all thy soul (In Verse 2 before us.)  and you will take it upon yourself and upon your children throughout their generations to do according to all that I command thee this day, just as they did at the second redemption [i.e., the redemption from Babylon], as it is written, and they entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in G-d’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of G-d, and to observe and do all the commandments of the Eternal our G-d, and His ordinances and His statutes. (Nehemiah 10:30.)  Or it may be that the expression that I command thee this day, thou and thy children is like “command you — to you and to your children,” (The word thou is gramatically difficult, because the verse begins with the accusative thee, and follows with the nominative thou. Ramban offers two explanations: First, that the verse contains two separate thoughts: that you will return to G-d, and that you will accept upon yourself and your children all that He commands us. Second, that the nominative thou is equivalent to the accusative thee [“to you”], and the verse is thus expressing a single thought: “that I command thee this day — to you and to your children.” Ramban proceeds to cite Scriptural examples of similar usage — a nominative in place of an accusative.)  similar to the expression ‘v’atah tzuveitha’ (Genesis 45:19. Here, too, the nominative v’atah (and you) is to be understood as lecha (“and to you”).)  [meaning lecha tzuveithi — “to you I ordered that the command be given”]. So also, and they dealt ill ‘othanu’ (Above, 26:6. Here likewise the literal meaning of othanu is “us,” but Ramban interprets it in the context of the verse as if it means “to us.”)  means lanu (“to us”). (So also in the verse before us, atah (you) means lecha (to you).)  And in my opinion there is in this matter a great secret; for it alludes to that which the Rabbis said, (Yebamoth 62a.)  “The son of David [i.e., the Messiah] will not come until all souls in the guf (Here understood as “a storehouse of souls in heaven.” Ramban’s concept is that the final redemption will come when all souls will have been purified and no longer in need of a sojourn on earth. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 479.)  are exhausted.” I have already spoken of this matter. (See Genesis 1:26 (Vol. I, p. 479).) "

30,2,Jewish Thought,Kuzari 2:35,"35. Al Khazari: How can this serve as a comparison for Israel, as it is said: 'Surely he has borne our griefs?' That which has befallen Israel has come to pass on account of its sins."
30,2,Jewish Thought,Kuzari 2:34,"34. The Rabbi: Do not believe that I, though agreeing with thee, admit that we are dead. We still hold connexion with that Divine Influence through the laws which He has placed as a link between us and Him. There is circumcision, of which it is said: 'My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant' (Genesis 17:13). There is further the Sabbath, 'It is a sign between me and you throughout your generations' (Exodus 31:13). Besides this there is 'the covenant of the Fathers,' and the covenant of the law, first granted on Hōreb, and then in the plains of Moab in connexion with the promises and warnings laid down in the section: When thou shalt beget children and grandchildren' (Deuteronomy 4:25). Compare further the antithesis: 'If any of thine be driven out unto the utmost parts of heaven' (Deuteronomy 30:10); 'Thou shalt return unto the Lord thy God' (Deuteronomy 30:2), finally, the song: 'Give ear' (Deuteronomy 32:1); and other places. We are not like dead, but rather like a sick and attenuated person who has been given up by the physicians, and yet hopes for a miracle or an extraordinary recovery, as it is said: 'Can these bones live?' (Ezekiel 37:3). Compare also the simile in the words: 'Behold my servant shall prosper'; 'He has no form nor comeliness,' 'Like one from whom men hid their faces' (Isaiah 52:13; which means that he is, on account of his deformity and repulsive visage, compared to an unclean thing, which man only beholds with disgust, and turns away; 'Despised and rejected of men,' 'A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief' (Isaiah 53:3)."
30,2,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 30:2:1,"ושבת עד ה' אלוקיך, your repentance will have as its exclusive purpose to henceforth carry out only G’d ‘s will to the extent that He has revealed it.

30,2,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 30:11:1,"FOR THIS COMMANDMENT. The meaning thereof is that it refers to the entire Torah. But the correct interpretation is that when he refers to the entire Torah, he says [as above] Every commandment which I command thee this day. (Above 8:1.)  Rather [the expression used here] this commandment refers to [the commandment of] repentance aforementioned, for the verses, and thou shalt bethink thyself; (Above, Verse 1.)  and thou shalt return unto the Eternal thy G-d (Ibid., Verse 2.)  constitute a commandment, wherein he commands us to do so. It is stated in a future tense [rather than in the imperative] to suggest, in the form of a pledge, that it is destined [that Israel will repent]. And the sense thereof is to state that if thy outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven (Above, Verse 4.)  and you are under the power of the nations, you can yet return to G-d and do according to all that I command thee this day, (Ibid., Verse 2.)  for the thing is not hard, nor far off from you, but rather very nigh unto thee (Further, Verse 14.)  to do it at all times and in all places. This is the sense of the expression, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it (Further, Verse 14.)  meaning that they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers (Leviticus 26:40.)  by word of their mouth, and return in their heart to G-d and accept the Torah upon themselves this day to perform it throughout the generations, as he mentioned, thou and thy children with all thy heart, (Above, Verse 2.)  as I have explained. (Ibid., and in Verse 6.) "
30,2,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Repentance 7:5","All the prophets commanded [the people] to repent. Israel will only be redeemed through Teshuvah. The Torah has already promised that, ultimately, Israel will repent towards the end of her exile and, immediately, she will be redeemed as [Deuteronomy 30:1-3] states: ”There shall come a time when [you will experience] all these things... and you will return to God, your Lord.... God, your Lord, will bring back your [captivity].”"
30,2,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 30:2:1","ושבת עד ה' אלוקיך, “and you will return unto Hashem your G’d;” the meaning of the term “return” is that you will henceforth hearken to His commandments in accordance with what Moses commands the people on that day. It also means that you will commit both yourself and the people for whose education you are responsible, i.e. your children as long as they are minors, to walk in the path of Torah.
    Alternately, the word ובניך, “and your children” in our verse may mean the same as it means when the Torah speaks of לך ולבניך, ”for you and your children,” that when G’d dispenses His blessing this automatically includes your children. (Compare Deut. 12,40; 12,25; 12,28) [As if the Torah had written ולבניך instead of ובניך. Such grammatical anomalies occur sometimes. Ed.]
"
30,2,Musar,Orchot Tzadikim 26:60,"It was a great kindness that the Holy One, Blessed be He, did for mankind when he established a way for wrong-doers and sinners to flee from darkness to light, and did not close the doors of repentance to them, even if they had sinned greatly, as it is said, ""Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings"" (Jer. 3:22). And repentance is accepted by God even if the sinner repents because of his great misfortunes; all the more so if he repents because of reverence and love of God. As it is said, ""In thy distress, when all these things are come upon thee, in the end of days thou will return to the Lord thy God; and hearken unto His voice"" (Deut. 4:30). And the Holy One, Blessed be He, helps penitents to repent even in matters which the strength of a man cannot attain, and he renews within them a pure spirit so that they may achieve the elements of repentance. As it is said, ""And shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and hearken to His voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul"" (Deut. 30:2). And further, at the end of that passage, ""And the Lord will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart"" (Deut. 30:6). What this means is that in that thing which is not within your power to attain, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will circumcise your heart and give you the strength to do it."
30,2,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 33:16:3","תבואתה לראש יוסף, “may it come to rest (the blessing) on the head of Joseph.” The word תבואתה is a strange word; it is composed of the two words באתה and תבא. Moses is trying to hint here that just as Joseph went into exile into Egypt long before the remainder of his brothers, so when the redemption will come he, (his tribe) will also enjoy that experience before the other tribes will. These are the 45 years discrepancy mentioned between the 1290 years and the 1335 years which Daniel speaks of in Daniel 12,11-12. There is a time lapse between the ingathering of the exiles referred to as נדחים, “outcasts,” and those referred to as נפוצים, “scattered.” (compare Deut. 30,2-3)."
30,2,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:2:1-2","ושבת עד ה’ אלוקיך...בכל לבבך ובכל נפשך...ושב ה’ אלוקיך את שבותך, “and you will return unto the Lord your G’d with all your heart and with all your soul. Then the Lord your G’d will bring back your captives, etc.” You have already become familiar with the statement of our sages in Avodah Zarah 5 “that the son of David (redeemer) will not come until all the souls in the bodies have expired;” this is based on Isaiah 57,16: “until a belated spirit from Me envelps them and the souls which I have made.” The meaning of the whole verse is that G’d will not be angry at the Jewish people forever, nor will He remain furious indefinitely by not redeeming the people, seeing that a spirit יעטוף מלפני, “certain spirits emanate from Me belatedly,” and the souls which I have created enter the body at this stage of history. [Rashi understand the word כי in that verse as meaning “when.” Ed.] The word יעטוף is a kind of “being late,” such as when it occurs in Genesis 30,42 “for the ones born late belonged to Lavan.” [If I understand correctly, the author understands that just as the evil spirit enters man at birth, whereas the urge to do good does not enter him until he is of age, (13), so one cause of his corruption is due to the belated entry of the יצר הטוב. This affords G’d an opportunity to find some excuse for man’s (the Jewish people’s) behavior and to redeem them after a sufficient interval. Ed.] Nachmanides, in commenting on our verse, focuses on the reason why the verses 2 and 3 appear sequentially, i.e. the words נפשך ושב follow each other. He understands the first verse as saying that if all the Jewish people (“all your souls,” כל נפשך) become penitents) only then will the redemption occur, i.e. G’d will bring back your captives (ושב ה’ אלוקיך את שבותך). The meaning is that totally new (renewed) souls will enter the bodies of the Jewish people. This is why the Torah here stresses אתה ובניך, i.e. this תשובה movement must embrace not just a single generation. These two words are an allusion to the whole people of Israel (historically speaking). We find yet another pronouncement on this subject by our sages in Yevamot 62, in which this conclusion is arrived at from the same verse in Isaiah, and the Talmud adds that immediately after this statement [actually immediately preceding this statement, Ed.] the prophet continues with the words ואמר סולו סולו פנו דרך, “Pave (a road,) pave a road, clear a path!” The prophet paints the scenario which alone will clear the way to the final redemption."
30,2,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:2:3","ושב וקבצך מכל העמים, ”then He will bring you back collectively from all the nations to which He scattered you.” I have already mentioned (29,27) that the previous paragraph speaks of the period of the first Temple when the people sinned by committing idolatry and they were punished by being banished to ארץ אחרת, a different country, and the ten tribes were cast out, הנדחים, by King Shalmanesser of Assyria to Chalach, Chavor on the river Gozan and the cities of Media (Kings II 17,6). This passage proves that our assumption was right, seeing it commences where the last passage had left off, i.e. the נדחים, the outcasts of King Shalmanesser, by referring (verse 1) i.e. “to which the Lord your G’d had cast you out there.” Clearly, it speaks of the exile to which the ten tribes had become doomed. They represented the bulk of the Jewish people. Having dealt with the ingathering of the ten tribes from their exile, the passage continues speaking about yet another ingathering, the countries to which the tribes of Yehudah and Binyamin had been exiled where we have been enslaved by people who hated us and persecuted us. These people are the Arabs and Edomites. We are scattered throughout their countries until this present day and this is why the Torah speaks of “the countries to which the Lord your G’d has scattered you” (verse 3). In that verse the Torah addresses us. The Torah twice mentions ושב, “He will bring back,” to hint that there will occur two separate ingatherings, one of the ten tribes and one of the tribes Yehudah and Binyamin. Concerning these ingatherings we read in the prophecy of Isaiah 56,8: “I will gather still more to those already gathered.” It appears therefore, judging by the syntax of the text in our verses, that the principal ingathering of the tribes who will do penitence will be that of the ten tribes, the ones described as אשר הדיחך ה’, “whom the Lord cast out.” G’d assures the ten tribes that repentance will immediately trigger their return to their homeland. After having dealt with the redemption of those tribes, the Torah adds ושב וקבצך, (verse 3) that there will occur a second ingathering, that of the tribes of Yehudah and Binyamin. This is why the Torah had employed the expression והפיץ, “He scattered,” seeing that these two tribes are scattered all over the globe. After that, the Torah once more addresses the נדחים, the ones who had been cast out, i.e. the ten tribes, assuring them that even if they had been scattered in the meantime to the ends of the earth, G’d would not fail to gather them in and bring them back to their homeland which they would once again inherit. Actually, we find allusions to three separate “inheritances” here. The third will outrank the former two inheritances, will encompass more territory than the Israelites controlled during the glorious days of King Solomon. Moreover, G’d promises the people that the evil urge will be banished and that such emotions as envy and jealousy will disappear from among them. This is the meaning of verse 5: ”He will do good to you and make you more numerous than your forefathers and circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring to love the Lord your G’d with all your heart, etc.” The meaning of the words ואתה תשוב, “and you will return,” in verse 8, is that the penitence of which G’d speaks is an assurance, a promise by G’d to the people."
30,2,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 6:3:5,"This is an aspect of the World to Come, which will be completely ShaBbaT —i.e., completely TeShuVah, as is written (Deuteronomy 30:2), “Then, ShaVTa (you will return) to God your Lord.” For the essence of the World to Come will be the ability to have a perception of His Godliness, as is written (Jeremiah 31:33), “they will know Me, from the least of them to the greatest.” Therefore, each time  a deeper perception,  to repent for the preceding perception."
30,2,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 49:6:5,"And ShaBbaT is the aspect of TeShuVah (repentance), as it is written (Deuteronomy 30:2), “Then ShaVTa (you will return) to God your Lord.”"
30,2,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 58:7:1,"7. Through the illumination from Shabbat, the world is roused to repentance motivated by love. This is because ShaBbaT is the aspect of TeShuVah (repentance), the aspect of “Then ShaVTa (you shall return) to God your Lord” (Deuteronomy 30:2). This repentance is motivated by love, the aspect of “O love of delight” (Song of Songs 7:7), for the love stems from the delight of Shabbat, the aspect of “if you call the Shabbat ‘delight’” (Isaiah 58:13) ."
30,2,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 79:2:2,"This is the meaning of that which was said concerning Shabbat: “Every person shall abide below his place”—i.e., below his level, lower than he actually is. At the very least “no man shall go out of his place”—i.e., reaching beyond his level; for example, by doing as Zimri, and asking for the reward of Pinchas (Sotah 22b). And when on Shabbat can he recognize his lowliness? When he does complete TeShuVah (repentance), which is ShaBbaT, as it is written (Deuteronomy 30:2), “Then ShaVTa (you shall return) to God your Lord.” Their letters are the same."
30,3,Musar,Orchot Tzadikim 26:123,"The general rule of the matter is that a man should repent of all bad qualities, and one who does repent his evil qualities needs very great strengthening, for when a man is already used to them it is very difficult for him to abandon them, and on this subject it is said, ""Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts"" (Is. 55:7). And let not a man who is truly repentant think that he is far away from the status of the righteous because of the sins and the wrongs which he has committed. It is not so, for he is as beloved and dear before the Creator, Blessed be He, as though he had never sinned. Not only this, but his reward is great, for he has tasted the taste of sin, and yet abandoned it and conquered his evil inclination. Our Sages said, ""In the place where penitents stand, even the wholly righteous cannot stand"" (Berakoth 34b), that is to say, their status is even higher than that of those who never sinned, for they subdue the evil inclination more than the others. All of the prophets without exception commanded us concerning repentance (ibid.), and it is only through repentance that Israel is redeemed (see Yoma 86b, Sanh. 97b). And the Torah has already assured us that Israel will ultimately repent at the end of their exile, and they will immediately be redeemed. As it is said, ""And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessings and the curse which I have set before thee and thou shalt bethink thyself… and shalt return unto the Lord thy God… that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples"" (Deut. 30:1—3)."
30,2,Musar,Sha'arei Teshuvah 1:1,"In explanation of repentance and its principles  Among the good things which God, may He be blessed, has bestowed upon His creations is the path which He prepared for them to ascend from the baseness of their actions, to escape the trap of their inequities, to hold their souls back from destruction and to remove His anger from upon them. Because of His goodness and uprightness, He has taught them and warned them to return to Him when they sin against Him - for He understands their nature, as it is stated (Psalms 25:8), ""Good and upright is the Lord; therefore He shows sinners the way."" [Even] if they greatly sin and rebel and act like treacherous betrayers - He does not close the doors of repentance to them, as it is stated (Isaiah 31:6), ""Return, to Him to whom they have been so shamefully false."" It is [also] stated (Jeremiah 3:22), ""Turn back, O rebellious children, I will heal your afflictions."" We are warned about repentance in several places in the Torah. It is explained that repentance is accepted even when the sinner repents because of his many troubles - how much more so [will it be accepted] if he returns because of fear or love of God - as it is stated (Deuteronomy 4:30), ""When you are in distress because all these things have befallen you and, in the end, return to the Lord your God and obey Him."" It is explained in the Torah that God will help those who repent beyond what their natural ability would allow; and that He renews a pure spirit within them, to reach great heights in His love - as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:2), ""And you return to the Lord your God, and you and your children heed His command with all your heart and soul, just as I enjoin upon you this day."" Further, it is stated about the body of the matter (Deuteronomy 30:6), ""Then the Lord, your God, will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your offspring,"" to acquire love for Him. And the Prophets and Writings constantly speak on the subject of repentance, such that the principles of repentance are all explained in their words, as will be explained."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

And though, at first glance, if a person considers the conditions for the final redemption, as written in the Torah Portion of Nitzavim, (Deuteronomy 20)  that it will be when we return to HaShem with all our heart and soul, to heed His voice in all the mitzvot that He commanded us, both us and our children, then HaShem our God will return our captivity etc., as explained there. Whereas, according to what we currently observe, the generation is not at all worthy of this, which leaves room to lose hope. However, the answer to this will now be explained."
30,3,Musar,Ma'amar Tzipita LeYeshuah 1:7,"Now, as a result of our many sins, in our generation we observe that all these matters have come to pass. (Moreover, all the other trials and tribulations have also come about). Now, at first glance, this is very astonishing, for do we not see the very opposite in the verses of Torah? That is, according to the verses of Torah the redemption will happen when we return to HaShem, as it states, (Deuteronomy 30:1-3)  “And it shall be, when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, that I have set before you, you will return to your heart, when you are amongst all the nations where HaShem your God has banished you. You will return to HaShem your God and hearken to His voice, in accordance to all that I am commanding you today; you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul. HaShem your God will return your captivity and have mercy upon you; He will return and gather you in from all the nations where HaShem your God dispersed you.” As Ramban (Rabbi Moshe ben Nachman)  explained, this is a promise from HaShem and will certainly come to pass."
30,3,Musar,Ma'amar Tzipita LeYeshuah 1:15,"About all such people it is very easy to say with certainty, that the above-mentioned Torah verses, (Deuteronomy 30:1-3)  “And it shall be, when all these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, that I have set before you, you will return to your heart… you will return to HaShem your God and hearken to His voice,” are fulfilled in them. For this remnant of the fully faithful of Israel “return to their hearts” and know the importance of serving HaShem and fulfilling His mitzvot, in devoting themselves and their children to fulfilling the Torah."

30,10,Quoting Commentary,Rambam on Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1:29,"The twelfth principle The Messianic era and that is to believe and to confirm that he will come and not to think that he is late. 'If the tarries, wait for him' and do not give him a [set] time and do not create analyses from the verses to extrapolate the time of his coming. And the sages said (Sanhedrin 97b), ""The spirit of those that calculate the end should blow up."" And [from this principle is] that he believes that [the Messiah] will have great advantage and stature and honor above all of the kings that ever were; according to that which all of the prophets prophesied about him; from Moshe, our teacher, - peace be upon him - to Malachi, peace be upon him. And one who doubts him or for whom his stature is diminished denies the Torah, as the Torah testifies about him in Parashat Bilaam and in Parashat Atem Netsavim. And included in this principle is that there should not be a king in Israel except from the House of David alone. And anyone who disputes [the status] of this family, denies the name of God, may He be blessed, and the words of His prophets."
30,2,Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 30:2:1,"ושבת עד ה' אלוקיך, “and (then) you will return to the Lord your G–d;” elsewhere (Deut.23,15) it says in indirect speech: ושב ה' אלוקיך את שבותך ורחמך, “and the Lord your G–d will return with your captives and have mercy on you. Why does this have to be repeated? In the Talmud, tractate “Yuma”, folio 86, the Talmud says that repentance is important as it hastens the arrival of the redemption. This is based on Isaiah 59,20: ובא לציון גואל, ”and the Redeemer will come to Zion,” why? The verse continues with ושבי פשע ביעקב, “when the sinners among Yaakov have repented.” Rabbi Yossi bar Yehudah added that when a person transgresses a commandment once he is forgiven. By the time he transgresses a fourth time he is no longer subject to forgiveness. He bases himself on Amos 2,6: “thus said the Lord; for three transgressions of Israel, for four I will not revoke it (evil decree);” this is how the Talmud in tractate Yuma folio 86 understands that verse. I heard a reason for this attributed to Rabi Meir Levi, who stated that access to the Lord is guarded by three different “fences.” The first is overwhelming noise, the second is fire, and the third is a region of strong wind; finally there is a region in which almost inaudible sound is heard; (Compare Kings I 19, 11-12) in each region of these fences there are angels. When a person sins for the first time, the angels in the first region obstruct such a person’s access to commit further sins. This results in his obtaining forgiveness [as without this he would continue to sin having started to do so. Ed.] This process continues in varying degrees if he commits a second or third sin [without having repented in the interval. Ed.] When he sins a fourth time, having already breached the fences separating him from the Presence of G–d three times, he is no longer subject to forgiveness, as we know from Isaiah 65,3-7: “the people who provoke My anger who continually, to My very face, sacrifice in gardens and burn incense on tiles etc. etc.   such things make My anger rage, like fire blazing all day long and I will not stand idly by but will repay deliver their sins into their bosom and the sins of their fathers as well.” In other words, G–d is patient until sinning has become a pattern of the sinner’s lifestyle before He reacts irrevocably."
30,10,Quoting Commentary,Depths of Yonah 3:3:14,"Conclusion However we explain it, Nineveh’s Teshuvah stands as an example of a communal Teshuvah that the Jewish people will perform which will initiate the arrival of Mashiach (Devarim 30:1-10 and Rambam Hilchot Teshuvah 7:5). Nineveh’s one hundred percent participation sets a powerful example for our people, an important message year round but especially as the day of Yom Kippur draws to a close."

30,3,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 30:3:1,"ושב ה' אלהיך את שבותך THEN THE LORD THY GOD WILL TURN THY CAPTIVITY — To express this idea it ought to have written והשיב את שבותך, “then He will bring back thy captivity”. But our Rabbis learned from this that, if one can say so of God, His Divine presence dwells with Israel in all the misery of their exile, so that when they are redeemed (i.e. when He speaks of their being redeemed), He makes Scripture write “Redemption” of Himself (i.e. He makes it state that He will be redeemed) — that He will return with them (Megillah 29a). Furthermore the following may be said in explaining the strange form ושב ... את, — that the day of the gathering of the exiles is so important and is attended with such difficulty that it is as though He (God) Himself must actually seize hold of each individual’s hands dragging him from his place (so that God Himself returns with the exile), as it is said, (Isaiah 27:12) “And ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel”. We find, however, the same expression in connection with the gathering of the exiles of other nations also, as e.g. (Jeremiah 48:47):  ושבתי שבות מואב  ""And I shall bring back the exiles of Moab""."

30,3,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 30:3:1,"ושב וקבצך , during the ingathering of the exiles."
30,3,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:3:1,"ושב ה׳ אלוקיך את שבותך, ""and the Lord your G'd will will bring back your captives, etc."" This is a reference to some of the sanctity which the Israelites had lost to their captors, i.e. Satan, as a result of their sins. The word ושב refers to the bodily return of the Jews from exile, whereas the words ושב השם refer to the invisible part of the exile of the people, i.e. parts of their holy souls."
30,3,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Genesis 18:10:1,"I WILL CERTAINLY RETURN UNTO THEE WHEN THE SEASON COMETH AROUND. Rashi comments, “The angel was not announcing that he would return to him, but he was speaking to him as G-d’s agent, [meaning that G-d would return]. This is similar to the verse: And the angel of the Eternal said to her [Hagar], I will multiply thy seed exceedingly. (Ibid., 16:10.)  But he [the angel] has no power to multiply, and he was therefore speaking as G-d’s agent. So also here, he spoke as G-d’s agent.” Now the Rabbi (Rashi. See Seder Bereshith, Note 139.)  found it necessary to say so because the Holy One, blessed be He, told Abraham here, At the set time I will return unto thee. (Verse 14 here. The words of the angel, in Verse 10 here, I will certainly return unto thee.)  However, whether it be a reference to the angel or to the Holy One, blessed be He, we do not find it recorded that at the set time He returned. Perhaps a reference to this return is included in the expression, And the Eternal remember-ed Sarah, as He had said, and the Eternal did unto Sarah as He had spoken. (Further, 21:1.)  Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the verse beginning, And the Eternal said to Abraham, (Verse 14 here. It ends with the promise: At the same time I will return unto thee.)  means that the angel said it in the name of Him Who sent him, and he did return at the set time which he had told him, even though it is not written in Scripture. The correct interpretation appears to me to be that [the expression, shov ashuv (I will certainly return)], is akin to the phrase, liteshuvath hashanah (at the return of the year). (II Samuel 11:1.)  The verse is thus stating: “I will surely bring back to thee a time as this time, that you will be alive and Sarah your wife will have a son.” This is similar to what was said to Abraham, At this set time in the next year. (Above, 17:21.)  The word ashuv will then be like, ‘Veshav’ (And) the Eternal your G-d (will bring back) thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee. (Deuteronomy 30:3. Ramban’s intent is as follows: The word ve’shov there means “and He will bring back.” Here too the word ashuv means “I will bring back a time, like the present, in which you will be alive, and in which time, in addition to your being alive, Sarah will have a son.”) "
30,3,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Exodus 27:20:1,"ואתה תצוה, ""And you shall command, etc."" We need to explore why the Torah had to write the words ""and you,"" seeing G'd had been speaking to Moses continuously; He had not spoken to anyone since He commenced chapter 25. Moreover, why did the Torah write תצוה instead of merely צו (as in Leviticus 6,2). Why did G'd employ an imperative altogether? Our sages in Torat Kohanim at the end of Parshat Emor have written a number of commentaries about this, such as that the word צו is employed when performance of the commandment involves a financial outlay by the person who is to fulfil the commandment."
30,3,Commentary,Haamek Davar on Deuteronomy 30:3:5,"And gather you from all of the nations: After the main exile returns from the nations, the Lord will return to gather the small pockets among the nations where the Lord scattered you. Likewise did Ramban write 1 in his commentary on Song of Songs (8:12), ""you may have the thousand, O Solomon"" - that at first, there will be a partial gathering of the exiles with the permission of the governments. And afterwards, the Lord will bring back His hand a second time, as it is written, ""and He will return and gather you."""
30,3,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Megillah 4:7","We are taught that R. Simeon b. Jachai said: ""Come and see how the Israelites are beloved by the Holy One, praised be He! Wherever they were exiled the Shechina accompanied them. When they were exiled in Egypt, the Shechina was with them, as is said (I Sam. 2, 27) Did I rveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt? When they were exiled into Babylon the Shechina was with them, as is said (Is. 43, 14) For your sake I was sent to Babylon. And in the future, when they will be redeemed, the Shechina will also return with them, as is said (Deut. 30, 3) The Lord thy God will return thy captivity, and have mercy upon thee, V'heshib (He win bring back you) is not said, but V'Shab (He will return).

30,3,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 11:1","In the future, the Messianic king will arise and renew the Davidic dynasty, restoring it to its initial sovereignty. He will build the Temple and gather the dispersed of Israel. Then, in his days, the observance of all the statutes will return to their previous state. We will offer sacrifices, observe the Sabbatical and Jubilee years according to all their particulars as described by the Torah. Anyone who does not believe in him or does not await his coming, denies not only the statements of the other prophets, but those of the Torah and Moses, our teacher. The Torah testified to his coming, as Deuteronomy 30:3-5 states: God will bring back your captivity and have mercy upon you. He will again gather you from among the nations... Even if your Diaspora is at the ends of the heavens, God will gather you up from there... and bring you to the land.... These explicit words of the Torah include all the statements made by all the prophets. Reference to Mashiach is also made in the portion of Bilaam who prophesies about two anointed kings: the first anointed king, David, who saved Israel from her oppressors; and the final anointed king who will arise from his descendants and save Israel in the end of days. That passage Numbers 24:17-18 relates: 'I see it, but not now' - This refers to David; 'I perceive it, but not in the near future;"" - This refers to the Messianic king; 'A star shall go forth from Jacob' - This refers to David; 'and a staff shall arise in Israel' - This refers to the Messianic king; 'crushing all of Moab's princes' - This refers to David as II Samuel 8:2 relates: 'He smote Moab and measured them with a line;' 'decimating all of Seth's descendants' - This refers to the Messianic king about whom Zechariah 9:10 prophesies: 'He will rule from sea to sea.' 'Edom will be demolished' - This refers to David as II Samuel 8:6 states 'Edom became the servants of David;' 'Seir will be destroyed' - this refers to the Messianic king as Ovadiah 1:21 prophesies: 'Saviors will ascend Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau....'"
30,3,Commentary,"JPS 1985 Footnotes, Deuteronomy 30:1",Others “captivity.”
30,3,Midrash,Sifrei Bamidbar 84:4,"""and let Your haters flee before You"": Now are there ""haters"" before Him who spoke and brought the world into being? The intent is, rather, that all who hate the righteous are, as it were, haters of the L-rd. Similarly, (Shemot 15:7) ""and in the greatness of Your grandeur you destroy those who rise against You."" Now are there any who ""rise"" before the L-rd? The intent is, rather, that all who rise against the righteous are, as it were, ""rising"" against the L-rd. And, similarly (Psalms 74:23) ""Forget not the voice of Your adversaries, the ever rising roar of those who rise against You,"" and (Psalms 83:3) ""For Your foes are tumultuous; Your haters have raised their heads,"" and (Psalms 4) ""They have been subtle in counsel against Your people,"" and (Psalms 138:21-22) ""Will I not hate Your haters, O L-rd? Will I not battle with those who rise up against You? I have hated them to the heights of hatred. I have deemed them my (own) enemies."" And thus is it written (Zechariah 2:12) ""Whoever touches you (Israel) touches the pupil of His eye"": It is not written ""the pupil of the eye,"" but ""the pupil of His eye"" — that of the L-rd, as it were, Scripture resorting to a euphemism (for ""the eye of the L-rd""). Similarly, (Job 7:20) ""Why do You make me Your target for Yourself, and a burden to myself?"" — (""myself"") a euphemism (for ""to You""?) Similarly, (Ezekiel 8:17) ""and they thrust the branch to their nostrils"" — a euphemism for (""My""). Similarly, (Chabakkuk 1:12) ""Are You not of yore, O L-rd, my holy G-d, and we shall not die"" — a euphemism (for ""You""). Similarly, (Psalms 106:20) ""They exchanged their glory for the image of a bull feeding on grass"" — a euphemism (for ""G-d""). Similarly, (Bamidbar 11:15) ""And if You will do thus to me, kill me, I pray You, if I have found favor in Your eyes, and let me not witness my evil"" — a euphemism (for ""them"" and ""their,"" respectively). Similarly, (Ibid. 12:12) ""who comes out of his mother's womb, and half his flesh being consumed"" — a euphemism (for ""our""). And if one helps the righteous, it is as if he is helping the L-rd, viz. (Judges 5:23) ""'Curse Meroz!' said the angel of the L-rd. 'Bitterly curse her dwellers. Because they do not come to the holy of the L-rd, to the help of the L-rd among the mighty.'"" R. Shimon b. Elazar says: There is nothing more ""beloved"" in a man's body than his eye. When a man is hit on his head, he closes only his eyes. And Israel is thus compared, viz. (Zechariah 2:12) ""Whoever touches you (Israel) touches the pupil of His eye."" R. Yossi b. Elazar says: He (the ""toucher"") is regarded as one who sticks a finger into His eye and gouges it out. Pharaoh, who ""touched,"" what did I do to him? (Shemot 15:4) ""Pharaoh's chariots and his army He cast into the sea."" Sisra, who ""touched,"" what did I do to him? (Judges 5:20) ""From heaven the stars fought. From their courses they fought against Sisra."" Sancherev, who ""touched,"" what did I do to him? (II Kings 19:35) ""And an angel of the L-rd went out and smote in the camp of Ashur, etc."" Nevuchadnezzar, who ""touched,"" what did I do to him? (Daniel 4:30) ""and he ate grass like cattle."" Haman, who ""touched,"" what did I do to him? (Esther 8:7) ""and they hanged him on a tree."" And thus you find that as long as Israel were subjugated in Egypt, the Shechinah was with them in their servitude, viz. (Shemot 22:10) ""And they saw the G-d of Israel, and under His feet, the likeness of a sapphire brick"" (viz. Ibid. 1:14) ""And thus is it written (Isaiah 63:9) ""In all of their afflictions, He was afflicted."" This tells me only of communal afflictions. Whence do I derive (the same for) individual afflictions? From (Psalms 91:15) ""When he calls Me, I will answer him. With him will I be in affliction."" And it is written (Bereshit 39:20-21) ""And Joseph's master took him in and the L-rd was with Joseph."" And thus is it written (II Samuel 7:23) ""… before your people whom You redeemed from Egypt — a nation and its G-d"" (together with them). R. Akiva says: If it were not explicitly written, it would be impossible to say it — Israel said before the L-rd: ""You have redeemed Yourself!"" You find that whenever they were exiled, the Shechinah was exiled with them, viz. (I Samuel 2:27) ""Was I not exiled to your father's house when they were in Egypt in the house of Pharaoh?"" When they were exiled to Bavel, the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Isaiah 43:14) ""For your sake I was sent to Bavel."" When they were exiled to Edom, the Shechinah was with them, viz. (Ibid. 63:1) ""Who is this, coming from Edom, etc.?"" And when they return, the Shechinah will return with them, as it is written (Devarim 30:3) ""And the L-rd will return, etc."" It is not written ""and the L-rd will return your captivity,"" but ""and the L-rd will return with your captivity."" And it is written (Song of Songs 4:8) ""With Me, from Levanon, My bride, with Me from Levanon will you come."""
30,3,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Repentance 7:5","All the prophets commanded [the people] to repent. Israel will only be redeemed through Teshuvah. The Torah has already promised that, ultimately, Israel will repent towards the end of her exile and, immediately, she will be redeemed as [Deuteronomy 30:1-3] states: ”There shall come a time when [you will experience] all these things... and you will return to God, your Lord.... God, your Lord, will bring back your [captivity].”"
30,3,Talmud,Megillah 29a:4,"§ It is taught in a baraita: Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Come and see how beloved the Jewish people are before the Holy One, Blessed be He. As every place they were exiled, the Divine Presence went with them. They were exiled to Egypt, and the Divine Presence went with them, as it is stated: “Did I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt?” (I Samuel 2:27). They were exiled to Babylonia, and the Divine Presence went with them, as it is stated: “For your sake I have sent to Babylonia” (Isaiah 43:14). So too, when, in the future, they will be redeemed, the Divine Presence will be with them, as it is stated: “Then the Lord your God will return with your captivity” (Deuteronomy 30:3). It does not state: He will bring back, i.e., He will cause the Jewish people to return, but rather it says: “He will return,” which teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, will return together with them from among the various exiles."
30,3,Responsa,"Iggerot HaRambam, Iggeret Teiman 12","In your letter you have adverted to the computations of the date of the Redemption and R. Saadia's opinion on the subject. First of all, it devolves upon you to know that no human being will ever be able to determine it precisely as Daniel has already intimated, ""For the words are shut up and sealed."" (Daniel 12:9). Indeed many hypotheses were advanced by scholars, who fancied that they have discovered the date, as was anticipated in Scripture, ""Many will run to and fro, and opinions shall be increased."" (Daniel 12:9). That is, there shall be numerous views concerning it. Furthermore we have a Divine communication through the medium of the prophets that many persons will calculate the time of the advent of the Messiah but will fail to ascertain its true date. We are cautioned against giving way to doubt and distrust because of these miscalculations. The longer the delay, the more fervently shall you hope, as it is written, ""And it declareth of the end and doth not lie, though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not delay."" (Habakkuk 2:3). Remember that even the date of the termination of the Egyptian Exile was not precisely known and gave rise to differences of opinion, although its duration was fixed in Scripture, where we read, ""and they shall serve them and afflict them four hundred years"" (Genesis 15:13). Some reckoned the period of four hundred years from the time of Jacob's arrival in Egypt, others dated it from the beginning of Israel's bondage, which happened seventy years later, while still others computed it from the time of the Covenant of the Pieces when this matter was Divinely predicted to Abraham. At the expiration of four hundred years after this event, and thirty years before the appearance of Moses, a band of Israelites left Egypt because they believed that exile had ended for them. They were subdued and slain by the Egyptians. The lot of the Israelites who remained was consequently aggravated as we learn from our sages, the teachers of our national traditions. David already alluded to the vanquished Israelites who miscalculated the date of the redemption in the verse, ""The children of Ephraim were as archers handling the bow that turned back in the day of battle"" (Psalms 78:9). In truth, the period of four hundred years commences with the birth of Isaac the seed of Abraham, par excellence, as may be gathered from the verse, ""For in Isaac shall seed be called to thee"" (Genesis 21:12), and the verse, ""Thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, they shall serve them, and afflict them four hundred years"" (Genesis 15:13). In exile, they would rule, enslave and maltreat them, this is the implication of this text. The four hundred years mentioned in this verse refer to the duration of the exile, and not [solely] to the Egyptian bondage. This fact was misunderstood until the great prophet (Moses) came, when it was realized that the four hundred years mentioned in this verse refer to the duration of the exile, and not [solely] to the Egyptian bondage. This fact was misunderstood until the great prophet (Moses) came, when it was realized that the four hundred years dates back precisely to the birth of Isaac. Now, if so much uncertainty prevailed in regard to the date of the emancipation from Egyptian bondage, the term of which was fixed, how much more would it be the case in respect to the date of the final redemption, the prolonged and protracted duration of which appalled and dismayed our inspired seers, so that one of them was moved to exclaim, ""Wilt Thou be angry with us forever? Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger to all generations?"" (Psalms 85:6). Isaiah, too, alluding to the long drawn out exile, declared: ""And they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the dungeon, and shall be shut up in prison, and after many days shall they be released"" (24:22). Inasmuch as Daniel has proclaimed the matter a deep secret, our sages have interdicted the calculation of the time of the future redemption, or the reckoning of the period of the advent of the Messiah, because the masses might be mystified and bewildered should the Messiah fail to appear as forecast. The rabbis invoked God to frustrate and destroy those who seek to determine precisely the advent of the Messiah, because the masses might be mystified and bewildered should the Messiah fail to appear as forecast. The rabbis invoked God to frustrate and destroy those who seek to determine precisely the advent of the Messianic era, because they are a stumbling block to the people, and that is why they uttered the imprecation ""May the calculators of the final redemption come to grief"" (Sanhedrin 97b). As for R. Saadia's Messianic calculations, there are extenuating circumstances for them though he knew they were disallowed. For the Jews of his time were perplexed and misguided. The Divine religion might well nigh have disappeared had he not encouraged the pusillanimous, and diffused, disseminated and propagated by word of mouth and pen a knowledge of its underlying principles. He believed, in all earnestness, that by means of the Messianic calculations, he would inspire the masses with hope for the truth. Verily all his deeds were for the sake of heaven. Consequently, in view of the probity of his motives, which we have disclosed, one must not decry him for his Messianic computations. I note that you are inclined to believe in astrology10 and in the influence of the past and future conjunctions of the planets upon human affairs. You should dismiss such notions from your thoughts. Cleanse your mind as one cleanses dirty clothes.11 Accomplished scholars whether they are religious or not, refuse to believe in the truth of this science. Its postulates can be refuted by real proofs on national grounds. But this is not the place to enter into a discussion of them. Mark well, however, what Scripture has to say about the astrologers. At the time when Moses rose to leadership the astrologers had unanimously predicted that our nation would never be freed from bondage, nor gain their independence, but fortune smiled upon Israel, for the most exquisite of human beings appeared and redeemed them at the very time which was supposedly most inauspicious for them. Furthermore, Egypt was smitten with the plagues at the very time for which the astrologers foretold an epoch of wholesome climate, abundance, and prosperity for its inhabitants. To the failure of their vaticination, Isaiah alludes when he says ""Where are they then thy wise men? and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the Lord of Hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt. (Isa. 19:12). Similarly the pundits, astrologers, and prognosticators were all of one mind that the administration of Nebuchadnezzar, the wicked, marked the beginning of an era of enduring prosperity. Forsooth, his dynasty was extinguished and destroyed, as was divinely forecast by Isaiah. He derided them for pretending to fore-knowledge, and held up to scorn the state which fancied itself in possession of sapient folk versed in futurity, as we read ""Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up and save thee"" (47:13). They are likewise wrong in their predictions concerning the era of the Messiah, may he speedily come. For while the Gentiles believe that our nation will never constitute an independent state, nor will they even rise above their present condition, and all the astrologers, diviners, and augurs concur in this opinion, God will prove false their views and beliefs, and will order the advent of the Messiah. Again it is Isaiah who makes reference to this event in the verse: ""That frustrate the tokens of the impostors, and maketh the diviners mad, that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish, that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers, that saith of Jerusalem, ""She shall be inhabited, and of the cities of Judah, They shall be built, and I will raise up the waste places thereof."" (44:25-26). This is the correct view that every Israelite should hold, without paying any attention to the conjunctions of the stars, of greater or smaller magnitude. I have observed your statement, that science is little cultivated, and that learning does not flourish, in your country, which you attribute to the influence of the conjunctions in the earthly trigon.12 Remember that this low state of learning and science is not peculiar too your country, but is widely prevalent in Israel today. Indeed, a Divine premonition of such a state of affairs is contained in a verse in Isaiah which reads, ""Therefore, behold, I will again do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work, and a wonder, and the wisdom of the wise men shall perish, and the prudence of the prudent men shall be hid."" (29:14). This condition is not due to the earthly or fiery trigon, as is proven by the fact that Solomon, King of Israel, lived during the earthly trigon, and yet Scripture testifies that ""he was wiser than all men."" (I Kings 5:11). So did Abraham of blessed memory, who was designated the Pillar of the World, discover the First Cause of the entire universe, and demonstrated the central importance of the principle of the Unity of God for all mankind. He, Isaac and Jacob, all three of them, carry the throne of glory in their hearts, to make use of a rabbinical metaphor ""The patriarchs are the chariots,"" (Genesis Rabbah 82:7), which in turn was suggested by the verse, ""And God rose up over him."" (Genesis 35:13). The meaning is that they have attained a true conception of the Deity. Now the three patriarchs lived during the earthly trigon.This matter will become clear if the following facts are borne in mind. There is first, the smaller conjunction, that is, the meeting of Saturn with Jupiter, which occurs once in approximately twenty solar years. These conjunctions continue to take place twelve times within the same trigon, covering a period of two hundred and forty years. Then conjunctions take place in the second trigon, which occur every two hundred and forty solar years. The shift to the next trigon is known as the medium conjunction. According to this calculation an interval of nine hundred and sixty years will elapse between the first and second meeting of two planets in the same point of the Zodiac.13 This is termed the great conjunction, and occurs once in nine hundred and sixty years. This is the time that must elapse between the first and second meeting of Saturn and Jupiter in the same degree of Aries. If you will calculate back, you will understand my statement above that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as well as David lived during the earthly trigon. My purpose in going into details was to dispel any suspicion of yours that the trigon exercises any influence upon human affairs. Furthermore you write that some people have calculated the forthcoming conjunction and have determined that all the seven planets will meet in one of the constellations of the Zodiac. This forecast is untrue, for no meeting of the seven planets will occur in the next conjunction, nor in the following ones. For such an event will not happen even in ten thousand years, as is well known to those who are familiar with the astronomical law of equation. Verily this is the calculation of an ignorant person, as is evinced by other remarks of his, quoted by you, to the effect that there will be a deluge of air and of dust. It is essential for you to know that these and similar assertions are fabricated and mendacious. Do not consider a statement true because you find it in a book, for the prevaricator is as little restrained with his pen as with his tongue. For the untutored and uninstructed are convinced of the veracity of a statement by the mere fact that it is written; nevertheless its accuracy must be demonstrated in another manner. Remember that a blind person submits to an individual having power of sight for intelligent direction knowing that he lacks the vision to guide him safely; and an ailing person, unskilled in the art of medicine, and uninformed as to matters detrimental to or beneficial for his health, defers to a physician for guidance and obeys him implicitly. Just so is it indispensable for the laity to yield unswervingly to the prophets, who were men of true insight, and to confide in them in respect to matters affecting the truth or the error of a given teaching. Next in importance are the sages who have studied day and night the dogmas and doctrines of our faith and have learned to distinguish between the genuine and the spurious. After this exposition you may trust me that the statements you have previously quoted are inaccurate and this applies equally to similar views which you heard expressed in conversation or met with in books. For the author of such sayings is either ignorant, a mountebank, or seeks to destroy the law and to demolish its bulwarks. Do you perceive the brazenness of these people who assert that there will be a deluge of air, and dust, and fire, in order to deceive and delude others to believe that the Deluge in the time of Noah was merely due to a concentration of water, and was not a Divine punishment for the immorality of the time, as is explicitly stated in Scripture that guides us against error and fallacy. Similarly Sodom, and the other cities were not destroyed because of the unbelief and wickedness of their inhabitants in direct contradiction to the Bible which says, ""I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come to me."" (Genesis 18:21). Thus whatever happens in this world through Divine intervention, they say is the inevitable consequence of the planetary conjunctions. They have affirmed the truth of their propositions in order to undermine the principles of our religion, and to give free reign to their animal instincts and passions as do the beasts and the ostriches. We were divinely admonished against those views in Scripture to the following effect: ""If you rebel against Me so that I bring disaster upon you as a punishment for your misdeeds, but you ascribe your reverses to chance rather than to your guilt, then shall I increase your afflictions and make them more grievous."" This is the intent of the verse in the Chapter of Admonition, If you will walk with me 'bekeri' I shall walk with you in the wrath of 'keri'"" (Leviticus 26:21, 24). Now ""keri"" signifies chance, hazard. Scriptures means to say if you regard My chastisement as a fortuitous event, then shall I bring the most severe calamities upon you ""sevenfold for your sins."" (Leviticus 26:24). These foregoing remarks have made it abundantly clear that the advent of the Messiah is in no way subject to the influence of the stars. Indeed one of our keen minds in the province of Andalusia, calculated by means of astrology the date of the final redemption and predicted the coming of the Messiah in a particular year. Every one of our distinguished scholars made little of his declaration, discounted what he did and censured him sharply for it. But grim fate dealt with him more sternly than we could have. For at the very time when the Messiah was supposed to arrive, a rebel leader appeared in Maghreb who issued an order of conversion as you are well aware. The event proved to be a great debacle for the partisans of this prognosticator. Indeed the hardships experienced by our people in the diaspora are responsible for these extravagances, for a drowning man catches at a straw. Therefore, my co-religionists, ""be strong and let your heart take courage, all you that wait for the Lord."" (Psalms 31:25). Strengthen one another, affirm your faith in the Expected One, may he speedily appear in your midst. ""Strengthen ye the weak hands and make firm the tottering knees."" (Isaiah 35:3). Remember! Isaiah, the herald of Israel's redemption predicted that the prolongation of the adversities of exile will impel many of our people to believe that God has relinquished and abandoned us (far be it from Him), as we read ""But Zion said: 'the Lord hath forsaken me, And the Lord hath forgotten me'."" (49:14). But he was given the Divine assurance that such is not the case, to quote the following, ""Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, these may forget, yet I will not forget thee."" (49:15). In truth, this Divine promise had already been divulged by the First Prophet, who declared: ""For the Lord thy God is a merciful God. He will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he swore unto them."" (Deuteronomy 4:31). ""Then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion on thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples whither the Lord thy God hath scattered thee."" (Deuteronomy 30:3). It is, my co-religionists, one of the fundamental articles of the faith of Israel, that the future redeemer of our people will spring only from the stock of Solomon son of David.14 He will gather our nation, assemble our exiles, redeem us from our degradation, propagate the true religion, and exterminate his opponents as is clearly stated in Scripture ""I see him but not now, I behold him but not nigh, there shall step forth a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall arise out of Israel. And shall smite through the corners of Moab, and break down all the sons of Seth. And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also, even his enemies, shall be a possession, while Israel doeth valiantly."" (Numbers 24:17-18). He will be sent by God at a time of great catastrophe and dire misfortune for Israel as was predicted in the verse ""There will be none remaining, shut up or left at large"" (Deuteronomy 32:36). And when he appears, he will fulfill the promises made in his behalf. A later prophet too was alluding to the Messianic tribulations when he declared ""But who can endure the day of his coming"" (Malachi 3:2). This is the proper understanding of this article of faith. From the prophecies of Daniel and Isaiah and the statement of our sages it is clear that the advent of the Messiah will take place some time subsequent to the universal expansion of the Roman empire and Arabic rule, which is an actuality today. This fact is true beyond question or doubt. Daniel in the latter part of his vision alludes to the Kingdom of the Arabs, to the rise of Mohammed and then to the arrival of the Messiah. Similarly Isaiah intimated that the coming of the Messiah will occur after the rise of the Madman, in the verse ""A man riding on an ass, a man riding on a camel, and two men riding on horses."" (21:7). Now ""the man riding on an ass"" is a symbolical reference to the Messiah as is evident from another verse which describes him as ""lowly and riding on an ass"" (Zechariah 9:9). He will follow the ""man riding on the camel"" that is, the Arabic kingdom. The statement ""two men riding on horses"" refers to both empires, the Roman and the Arabian. A similar interpretation of Daniel's vision concerning the image and the beasts is correct beyond doubt. They are conclusions derived from the plain meaning of the text. The precise date of the messianic advent cannot be known. But I am in possession of an extraordinary tradition which I received from my father, who in turn received it from his father, going back to our early ancestors who were exiled from Jerusalem, and who were mentioned by the prophet in the verse, ""And the exiles of Jerusalem that are in Spain"" (Obadiah 20). According to this tradition there is a covert indication in the prediction of Balaam to the future restoration of prophecy in Israel. Incidentally it may be stated that there are other verses in the Torah which contain cryptic allusions in addition to their simple meaning. For example, the word ""r'du"" in the remark of Jacob to his sons, ""r'du Shamah,"" ""Get you down thither"" (Genesis 42:2), has the numerical value of 210, and contains a hint to the length of Israel's stay in Egypt. Likewise, the statement of Moses our Teacher, ""When thou shalt beget children, and children's children and ye shall have been long in the land,"" (Deuteronomy 4:25), embodies a reference to the duration of Israel's stay in Palestine, from the date of their arrival to the exile in the time of Jehoiakim, which was eight hundred and forty years, corresponding to the numerical value of the word NoSHaNTeM. Similarly, many other verses could be cited. To come back to Balaam's prophecy, the verse ""After the lapse of time, one will tell Jacob and Israel what God hath wrought,"" (Numbers 23:23), contains a veiled allusion to the date of the restoration of prophecy to Israel. The statement means that after the lapse of an interval equal to the time that passed from the Six Days of Creation to Balaam's day, seers will again tell Israel what God hath wrought. Now Balaam uttered his prediction in the thirty-eighth year after the Exodus which corresponds to the year 2485 after the Creation of the World, for the Exodus took place in the beginning of the year 2448. According to the interpretation of this chronology, prophecy would be restored to Israel in the year 4976 after the creation of the world. It is doubtless true that the reappearance of prophecy in Israel is one of the signs betokening the approach of the Messianic era as is intimated in Scripture ""And your sons and your daughters shall prophecy ... And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth ... Before the great and terrible day of the Lord come"" (Joel 3:1, 3, 4). This is the most genuine tradition concerning the Messianic advent. We were admonished against, and strictly prohibited form blazening it abroad, lest some folk deem it unduly postponed. We have already apprised you concerning it, but God knows best what is true. Your statement that Jeremiah alludes to the advent of the Messiah in the verse ""It is a time of trouble unto Jacob"" (30:7) is incorrect, for it needs must refer to the war of Gog and Magog which will take place some time after the arrival of the Messiah. Neither the fall of Giron Gate16 nor similar omens portent the oncoming of the Messiah. Some of the supposed prophetic signs are mistakenly ascribed to the sages, while others owe their origin to figures of speech and enigmatic sayings of the rabbis, which should not be taken literally."
30,3,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 1:1:6","Seeing that this Book is the fifth and last of the five Books of the Torah I want to explain to you the reason why the Torah has been divided into 5 separate Books and why the sequence is that which we find in front of us. You are aware already that although this fact has already been alluded to (Midrash on Genesis 1,3 on the words “let there be light”) these “Books” are essentially all closely tied to one another. The reason that the Torah commenced with the Book of Bereshit is that the record of the world coming into existence is a basic foundation of our faith. Without this knowledge the concept of G’d supervising and taking an interest in all life on earth would not exist and all of us would consider ourselves as being no more than “accidents” on earth. Once we have established that G’d the Creator takes an interest in what He has created, and especially in the human beings, it follows that there is such a thing as “reward and punishment.” Seeing that these concepts are critical to the Torah they have all become part of the Book of Genesis. The Book of Bereshit therefore had to include some basic commandments, else, the fact that a system of reward and punishment for obedience to the Creator exists could not be demonstrated. These commandments must include positive as well as negative commandments.  As far as the reward for observing the commandments is concerned, the expulsion of Adam from Gan Eden illustrates punishment on a personal level, whereas the deluge demonstrates punishment on a collective level. Noach’s being saved demonstrates reward on a personal level. The prediction of both this reward and punishment demonstrated to both the victims and the survivors that G’d must be Master of the universe, i.e. of nature, ergo its Creator. What befell the people concerned proved that He (unlike a painter who completes a painting) did not sit back and leave His universe to self-destruct but made sure that it would endure (even while allowing man free will). After conclusion of the Book of Bereshit, the second Book of the Torah commencing with the names of the sons of Yaakov is the corollary of the story of the patriarchs who imbued their descendants with this faith in G’d and His Justice.   Once a person possesses faith in the fact that G’d was the Creator, it is only a small step to believe that He is Unique, and the Only G’d. The second Book of the Torah which contains so many examples of the Uniqueness of the Creator, and His revealing Himself to the people of Israel is a natural sequence to the Book of Bereshit.  The Book Vayikra, the Book dealing with the sacrificial service, follows next seeing that the sacrifices represent the bringing closer together and unifying the various forces in this universe until they ultimately reach the Original Cause. The righteous person succeeds in unifying these apparently different and heterogeneous forces through his devotions. Once the unifying force of these sacrifices has been demonstrated the next Book is that of Bamidbar Sinai which contains the story of Eretz Yisrael. It is the logical corollary of the Book of Vayikra, to point out that the sacrificial legislation applies only to the land of Israel. As soon as the Israelites had received the Torah, and the legislation concerning the sacrifices, they were meant to proceed directly to the land of Israel. Had it not been for the sin committed by the spies (and the people who accepted their estimate of their situation), the people’s progress would not have been delayed for 40 years by their wandering in the desert. After the Book of Bamidbar has been concluded and the people’s unity with G’d had been restored we come to the fifth Book, אלה הדברים. Seeing that the principal residence of the Jewish people in Eretz Yisrael was not the period during which the two Temples stood, but commences only with the final redemption which is not followed by another period of exile, the Torah wanted to conclude with a Book in which the ultimate redemption is discussed or alluded to. This will be an event comparable to a renewal of the universe itself (compare author’s comments on Deut. 30,3). This event will represent the true purpose and culmination of the creation of the universe, i.e. essentially another Book of Bereshit."
30,3,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 30:3:1","As it is said, “You shall be plucked, etc. This prophecy was said regarding the exile of Bavel. "
30,3,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Exodus 27:20:10,"The reason the Torah adds the word למאור, for light, may also be understood in line with our approach to the subject. During exile, the Jewish people are perceived as dwelling in darkness of a lunar eclipse, the moon being known as the המאור הקטן, ""the smaller luminary."" This means (homiletically speaking) that the one who used to be Master has been demoted from his true position of eminence so that the handmaid has inherited his former place. This is why G'd commanded that Moses should aspire that the olive oil for the Lampstand in the Tabernacle should provide an specially potent light, i.e. the light of the great luminary mentioned in Genesis when these luminaries are described as being hung in the sky. You know from the words of the sages in Megillah 29 on Deut. 30,3 where G'd is described as ""having returned with the exiles"" instead of as ""returning with the exiles in the future,"" that the presence of G'd had already previously returned with the Jewish people when they came out of exile. Our sages interpret Hoseah 11,9: ""The Holy one is in your midst and I cannot come to the city (i.e. celestial Jerusalem)"" in a similar fashion in Taanit 5."
30,3,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Leviticus 25:27:1,"וחשב את שני ממכרו, ""let him count the number of years of his sale,"" etc."" The sale occurred due to our sins as mentioned by Isaiah 50,1: ""here you have been sold due to your sins,"" and the sin is equivalent to a debt to be paid off. When the time comes to tear up the I.O.U. a careful accounting is made of any remaining indebtedness before the promissory note is torn up. The Torah speaks about the remaining years the Temple has been in foreign hands. The time it is redeemed depends on the quantity and severity of the collective sins of the people of Israel. We are told in Yuma 86 that if a person actually enjoyed the sins he committed, he has to flagellate himself in a measure which corresponds to the amount of pleasure he had when committing the sins he is guilty of. This is part of the rehabilitation of the sinner. In this manner he will repay his debt. G'd will deal with us in this manner at the time the redemption will be close at hand. This is also what the sages had in mind in Sanhedrin 98 when they refer to the חבלי משיח the birth-pangs to be endured as part of the coming of the Messiah. After that, ושב לאחוזתו, G'd will return to His heritage. The word ושב also refers to Israel. We have a parallel in Deut. 30,3 ושב ה׳ את שבותך ""and G'd will return with your captive ones;"" we would have expected the Torah to speak about והשיב i.e. ""He will bring back"" instead of ""He will come back"" (compare Megillah 29)."
30,3,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 33:29:2,"Another meaning of the words נושע בשם is that it may refer to the king of the Israelites enjoying G'd's deliverance when in difficulties. When discussing Deut. 30,3 we pointed out that since the Torah does not speak about G'd ""bringing back"" the exiles but about G'd ""returning"" (Megillah 29), this means that the Jews are in the enviable position of G'd descending into exile with them as it were, so that He returns with them to the Holy Land when the time is ripe. ואשר הוא חרב גאותיך. These words may mean: ""and Who is the sword drawn against those who feel superior to you."" Nobody enjoys a mightier sword than that of G'd who fights on Israel's behalf."
30,3,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Yitro, Derekh Chayim 20","When Israel continued to sin, we read in the Torah Numbers 21,1: וישמע הכנעני מלך ערד … וילחם בישראל וישב ממנו שבי, ""The Canaanite, king of Arad….engaged Israel in war and and took some of them captive."" This means that at that point in time even what had previously remained ""captive,"" i.e. the balance of the gifts from the Gentile nations prior to Israel accepting the Torah, was taken away from them. Whenever Israel will do תשובה, G–d will restore all these gifts. Israel will atone for its sins, and these gifts will act as protection for them."
30,3,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Terumah, Torah Ohr 9","When Israel sinned and as a result the Temple was destroyed, the שכינה went into exile with the Jewish people, seeing that it was a pledge G–d had entrusted to them. This is the mystical dimension of the verse: אלה פקודי המשכן, משכן העדות, ""These are the ""pledges"" of the Tabernacle, the ""pledges"" of the ""Testimony"" (Exodus 38,21). This is the basis for the Rabbinic statement in Megillah 29 that Israel is beloved (by G–d) since wherever the people of Israel are exiled, the שכינה is exiled with them. When they were exiled to Egypt the שכינה was with them, as we know from Genesis 46,4, where G–d told Jacob: ""I shall go down to Egypt with you."" When the Jewish people went into exile in Babylonia the שכינה accompanied them, as we know from Isaiah 43,14: ""For your sake I sent to Babylon."" When Israel was exiled in Elam the שכינה accompanied them, as we know from Jeremiah 49,38: ""I will set My throne in Elam."" When the Jewish people went into the Roman exile the שכינה also went with them, as we know from Isaiah 63,1: ""Who is this coming from Edom,…..it is I who contend victoriously, powerful to give triumph."" When the people of Israel return to their land from exile the שכינה will also accompany them as we know from Deut. 23,35: ושב ה' אלוקיכם את שבותך ורחמך, ""G–d will come back with your imprisoned ones and have mercy on you."" We would have expected the Torah to say: והשיב, ""He will bring back,"" instead of ""He will come back."" We also have a verse in Song of Songs 4,8: ""With Me from Lebanon O bride, come with Me!"" Rabbi Meir explains this as a parable: It is like a king saying to his servant ""if you need to seek me out, I shall be with my son."" This is the meaning of ""who dwells with them in their defilement,"" which we have quoted earlier. All this although G–d had warned Israel not to defile their encampments or the land they would live on, for it is the land G–d Himself has His abode in. "
30,3,Chasidut,"Me'or Einayim, Pekudei 1","""These are the records of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Pact, etc."" For it is known that Torah is the names of the Holy Blessed One.  The Name of the The Blessed One is, ""Was, Is, and Will Be - Eternal, Alive, Everlasting for Eternity.""  And Torah is also this.  So what does it mean that this was the time that the Tabernacle was made and what does it teach us about the path today?  The Torah should be read in order to teach us to way we should go.  Surely at every time and season the Torah is clothed for the needs of that particular time and season.  There are those who say: God created the world for the sake of the Torah which is called (Proverbs 8:22) “The beginning (ראשית) of His (God’s) way”, and for the sake of Israel who are called (Jeremiah 2:3) “The beginning (ראשית) of His (God’s) increase’.""  This is explained by way of a parable: A King who has wise children, capable of running the kingdom bring the King more satisfaction and joy than if he were to run the kingdom himself.  We are the children of the Ever-Present, and this explains the phrase ""No good comes to the world except through Israel.""  (Israel) makes a path to bring down the abundant flow to the lower realms.  This is ""Ascribe might to God, whose majesty is over Israel"" (Psalm 68:35)  Israel adds strength to the Entourage of Above, and the Angels do not sing praises above until Israel is singing them below. ""When the morning stars sang together and all the divine beings shouted for joy"" (Job 38:7).  Israel is likened to the stars, and thus aroused all of the Heavenly beings there.  This is the intention of the Creator that created all that is found because of Torah and because of Israel.  The content of this intention of the Holy Blessed One was that each person of Israel would be a ""Tabernacle"" of the Holy Blessed One.  As it is written (Exodus 25:8) ""Make for me a Sanctuary and I will dwell within them.  Within ""it"" is not written, rather, I will dwell within the children of Israel.  ""The Temple of the Lord, the temple of Lord are these. (Jeremiah 7:4).  But isn't it impossible for a person to be a Tabernacle of Hashem while the Evil Inclination is within a person?  ""The couch is too short for stretching out"" (Isaiah 28:20). )(Rabbi Yonatan) said: This bed is too short for two counterparts. (Yoma 9b)  Thus it is said ""Turn from evil"" (Psalm 34:15)  That a person should burn the evil from within him and thus it could be that Hashem Baruch Hu who is called, ""The Lord is good to all"" (Psalm 145:9) will reside inside of the person.  This happens after a person fulfills ""Turn from evil"" and thus makes the repair that the ""Good of the Lord"" will be within you.        “All the end-times have passed, and the matter [now] depends only on teshuvah” (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 97b).   And what is teshuvah?  For when a person was in his mother’s belly, God’s “candle burned over his head, and he saw from one end of the world to the other… and they taught him the entire Torah” (Niddah 30b); for he was a dwelling-place [mishkan] for Blessed God, and this is [the meaning of] the candle that was over his head.  But after he came out of his mother’s belly sin crouches at the door (Gen. 4:7), and an angel comes and slaps him on the mouth and makes him forget so that he will have free will, so he will have reward and punishment. And a person must do teshuvah to bring God back to him as at the beginning.  And this is [the meaning of] Then the LORD your God will turn back to your captives (Deut. 30:3) – it does not say “return,” but rather “turn back to,” meaning that after the teshuvah Blessed God will return to dwell [lishkone] within the person. Now, the essence of teshuvah is abandoning sin with a full heart and regret.  For what is written in the Books, that fasts correct sin, is because it is impossible for him truly to abandon the sin and truly regret until after he has afflicted himself; and then his uncircumcised heart will surrender and he will be able to regret and abandon the sin truly. And the root of the matter lies in the human’s being created by God’s Word.  And he is called “engraving” on account of his being surely hewn in supernal holiness. Now, when a person sins he is made into a corpse; for on account of the sin, Blessed God’s life-force left him.  But after verbal confession, along the lines of (incomplete)*"

30,4,Quoting Commentary,English Explanation of Mishnah Eduyot 8:7:2,"Rabbi Joshua said: I have received a tradition from Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, who heard it from his teacher, and his teacher [heard it] from his teacher, as a halakhah [given] to Moses from Sinai, that Elijah will not come to pronounce unclean or to pronounce clean, to put away or to bring near, but to put away those brought near by force and to bring near those put away by force. The family of Beth Tzriphah was on the other side of the Jordan and Ben Zion put it away by force; and yet another family was there, and Ben Zion brought it near by force. It is such as these that Elijah will come to pronounce unclean or to pronounce clean, to put away or to bring near.  Rabbi Joshua says that Rabban Yohanan ben Zakai had a tradition that can be traced all the way back to Moses who received it at Sinai, that when Elijah the prophet reappears in Messianic time, he will not clarify which families are clean, meaning they have not intermarried with forbidden relationships, nor will he clarify the opposite.  He will neither put away the unclean families nor draw near the clean families.  All that he will do is bring near the families who were forcibly and illegitimately put away and put away the families that were forcibly and illegitimately brought near.  In other words, decisions that humans had made as to which families were clean and which were not, and were made in a legal fashion without coercion, will be accepted by Elijah, even if he knows that they were wrong.  However, actions which were enacted by force and not consented to by the law-abiding sections of society will be corrected. A note about “a law from Moses on Sinai”.  The Rambam points out that Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai did not actually have a tradition that Moses said these very words.  Rather this is how the tradition understood Deuteronomy 30:3-4, which states that if you are scattered to the four corners of the earth, God will bring you back.  This is understood to mean that if a family was illegitimately not allowed to intermarry with other Jewish families, Elijah would redeem the situation. The mishnah now proceeds to mention one family that had been put away by force, meaning that this person Ben Zion, forcibly pronounced them unclean and made the rest of society abide by his will.  So too, Ben Zion, forcibly pronounced another family clean, and made society abide by his will."

And let not a man who is truly repentant think that he is far away from the status of the righteous because of the sins and the wrongs which he has committed. It is not so, for he is as beloved and dear before the Creator, Blessed be He, as though he had never sinned. Not only this, but his reward is great, for he has tasted the taste of sin, and yet abandoned it and conquered his evil inclination. Our Sages said, ""In the place where penitents stand, even the wholly righteous cannot stand"" (Berakoth 34b), that is to say, their status is even higher than that of those who never sinned, for they subdue the evil inclination more than the others. All of the prophets without exception commanded us concerning repentance (ibid.), and it is only through repentance that Israel is redeemed (see Yoma 86b, Sanh. 97b). And the Torah has already assured us that Israel will ultimately repent at the end of their exile, and they will immediately be redeemed. As it is said, ""And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessings and the curse which I have set before thee and thou shalt bethink thyself… and shalt return unto the Lord thy God… that then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples"" (Deut. 30:1—3)."

30,3,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 26:12:1,"AND I WILL WALK AMONG YOU. This means that My conduct with you will be well-known, as when a monarch walks in the midst of his army, supplying them with all their needs. This then is the way of the simple sense of the words of the covenant, and it is true, for so indeed will He do with them. Now Scripture did not mention here the reward of the existence of the souls in the World of Souls, (This is the world to which the soul of a person goes immediately following the death of the body. At the resurrection, body and soul will be reunited in the World to Come, which is the Olam Haba.)  and in the World to Come after the resurrection, for their existence [following the death of the body] is a matter of necessity in the way of creation, as I have explained in [the section on] excisions, (Above, 18:29.)  this form of punishment being the “cutting off” of the guilty ones [from life eternal], and all the other [souls] will continue to exist on account of their fundamental nature inherent in their creation. But by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], these blessings [in this section] are also heavenly blessings in matters above, as I have explained. (Above, Verse 11.)  Thus, And I will give peace in the Land; (Verse 6.)  and My soul shall not abhor you, (Above, Verse 11.)  and similarly, and I will walk among you, (Verse 12 before us.)  allude to the [Divine] attribute which our Rabbis have called Shechinah (the Divine Presence), of [the root found in the expression], And I will set ‘mishkani’ (My dwelling) among you, (Above, Verse 11.)  and as the Rabbis say: (See Rashi to Deuteronomy 30:3.)  “The Shechinah (Divine Presence) dwells with Israel.” And in Bereshith Rabbah they have said: (Bereshith Rabbah 19:13.)  “The Divine Presence was mainly in the lower world.” (That is, even after Adam committed the first sin, the Divine Presence was still mainly in the lower world. With each progressive sin on the part of mankind, this Presence withdrew to the remote heavens, until the patriarchs appeared and gradually brought His Presence back into the lower world. When the Tabernacle was completed and His Glory came to dwell therein, the process of return was completed.)  Thus the Garden of Eden [i.e., the World of Souls] and the World to Come [after the resurrection] are mentioned here (In the expressions: And I will set My dwelling (Verse 11); and I will give peace in the Land (Verse 6), as hinted to above (Ma’or V’shamesh).)  to those who know [the way of Truth]. Now these blessings in their perfection will only occur when all Israel do the will of their Father [in heaven], and when [as a result of this] the structure of heaven and earth will be perfect, in accordance with its [original] plan. There are no other blessings in the Torah as perfect as these, which constitute the words of the covenant and the conditions between the Holy One, blessed be He, and us. Know, [however], that Israel never attained these blessings in their perfection, neither many of them [i.e., as a people] nor as individuals, since their merits were never sufficient for them, just as the Rabbis have said with reference to David’s [captains]: (Moed Katan 16 b.)  “And he [Adino the Eznite] lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. (II Samuel 23:8.)  But he [David] was troubled about the [remaining] two hundred. (As the verse states, How should one chase a thousand (Deuteronomy 32:30) (Moed Katan 16b).)  Thereupon a Divine Voice came forth and said to him, Save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.” (I Kings 15:5. In other words, because of the affair of Uriah (see II Samuel, Chapter 11) King David did not completely achieve that particular blessing mentioned in the Torah.)  Therefore you will find our Rabbis of blessed memory speaking of [the fulfillment of] these verses [containing the blessings] in the future [which is yet] to come. [Thus they have said]. (Torath Kohanim, Bechukothai 2:2.)  “This teaches that a child of Israel will in the future stretch forth [his hand into the pupil of an adder’s eye, and remove his gall through his mouth.” Similarly they have said]: (Ibid., 3:3.)  “The Holy One, blessed be He, will in the future walk about with the righteous in the World to Come.” This is because [these blessings] have not yet been fulfilled, but they will be fulfilled for us at the time of [our] perfection."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,3,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 30:3:1","V. 3. ושב וגו׳. Sätze wie hier ושב וגו׳ את שבותך und so häufig in den Propheten und Psalmen: בשוב ד׳ שבות עמו (Ps. 14, 7) ושבתי את שבות עמי (Jirm. 30, 3), שב שבות אהלי יעקב (Jirm. 30, 18), ושבתי את שבות מצרים (Ezech. 29, 14) usw. legen die Ansicht nahe, daß in solchen Stellen שוב in transitiver Bedeutung, so viel als השיב, stehe. Allein abgesehen davon, daß, außer dieser Gedankenverbindung, es für eine transitive Bedeutung der Wurzel שוב kein Beispiel gibt, so dürfte schon unsere Stelle selbst gegen eine solche Auffassung sprechen. Offenbar sind ושב וגו׳ und ורחמך Akte, die der Zurückführung Israels in die Urheimat, dem ושב וקבצך usw. vorangehen. Nun könnte hier und in den meisten mit את konstruierten Stellen ושב את שבותך heißen: Gott kehrt mit deinen Vertriebenen zurück, d. h.: in demselben Grade und sobald du im Exil zu Gott zurückkehrst, kehrt er auch zu dir zurück. Allein die ohne את konstruierten Stellen wie: בשוב ד׳ שבות עמו usw. wären damit nicht erklärt. Vielmehr glauben wir, an die ganz normalen Erscheinungen erinnern zu dürfen, daß auch sonstige Verba intransitiva, ganz besonders aber, die eine Bewegung ausdrücken, das Ziel der Bewegung, und bei inneren Bewegungen das Moment, auf welches dieselbe gerichtet ist, das sie hervorgerufen und in welches sie sich konzentriert, im Akkusativ nach sich haben. So ja auch לך שוב מצרים :שוב (Schmot 4, 19), שובה ד׳ רבבות עמך (Bamidbar 10, 36), בשוב ד׳ ציון (Jes.52, 8), ויואב שב ירושלים (Sam. II. 20, 22). וצא השרה :יצא (Bereschit 27, 3), צאו ההר (Nehem. 8, 15), בצאתי שער (Job. 29,7). Auch mit את, wo dann der Akkusativ den Gegenstand bezeichnet, dessen Verlassen das Hinausgehen im Auge hat: יצאו את העיר (Bereschit 44, 4) כצאתי את העיר (Schmot 9, 26) und so auch בני יצאוני ואינם (Jirmija 10, 20). Auch ויגש דוד את העם :נגש (Sam. I. 30, 21). Auch הלך mit ואת בית ד׳ אני הולך :את (Richter 19, 18), wo er den ganzen Weg beschreibt, den er bereits zurückgelegt, und mit את בית ד׳ das eigentliche Ziel seiner Reise bezeichnet und hervorhebt, um hinzuzufügen: und doch nimmt mich keiner auf! ואין איש מאסף אותי הביתה."
30,3,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 30:3:2","Am Markiertesten erscheint dies in der Wurzel בוא mit den Pronominalsuffixen des Akkusativs. אל תבואני רגל גאוה (Ps. 36, 12). כל יד עמל תבאנו (Job 20, 22), כל זאת באתנו (Ps. 44, 18) שוט שוטף וגו׳ לא יבואנו (Jes. 28, 15) חוסר יבואנו (Prov. 28, 22). שודד יבואנו (Job. 15, 21) חרב מלך בבל תבואך (Ezech. 32, 11), מגורת רשע היא תבואנו (Prov. 10, 24), דורש רעה תבואנו (das. 11, 27), תבואהו שואה (Ps.35, 8), ויאהב קללה ותבואהו (Ps. 109, 11). In allen diesen Stellen steht das Suffixum keineswegs für den Dativ oder die Präposition אל, wodurch nur ein Hingelangen zu jemanden ausgedrückt wäre, sondern es sind reine Akkusative und bezeichnen das von einem Verhängnis erzielte und erreichte Objekt. Auch bei heilvollen Gewährungen wie תבואתך טובה (Job. 22, 21), יבאוני הסדיך (Ps. 119, 41), רחמיך (daselbst 77) bezeichnet es das Objekt, welches Ziel und Augenmerk der göttlichen Barmherzigkeit und Güte sein möge. In ähnlicher Weise, erklären sich die übrigen Akkusative bei intransistiven Verben wie: ויבך אותו אביו (Bereschit 37, 35), ולבכותה (daselbst 23, 2), את מי דאגת (Jes. 57, 11), אני דואג את היהודים (Jirmij. 38, 19). חלה את רגליו (Kön. I. 15, 23), לא חסרת דבר (Dewarim 2, 7), הצום צמתוני אני (Secharj. 7, 5) u. a. m. Auch die Konstruktion ירא mit את. Denn ירא ist eigentlich intransitiv. In allen diesen Fällen bezeichnet der Akkusativ den Gegenstand, welcher das Ziel, die Ursache oder Beziehung einer äußeren oder inneren Bewegung, eines Zustandes oder einer nicht übergehenden Tätigkeit bildet, und zwar ist diese Beziehung eine viel innigere, als die Konstruktion mit einer Präposition ausdrücken würde."
30,3,Commentary,"Rav Hirsch on Torah, Deuteronomy 30:3:3","Ganz in derselben Weise, glauben wir, sei die Konstruktion שוב mit dem Akkusativ aufzufassen, sei es mit Suffixum wie שובנו אלקי ישענו (Ps. 85, 5), mit את wie in unserer Stelle, oder ohne בשוב ד׳ שבות עמו :את u.s. Der Akkusativ bezeichnet den Gegenstand, der mit der rückkehrenden Bewegung aufgesucht wird, der das Motiv und Ziel derselben bildet, und drückt diese Konstruktion mit dem Akkusativ eine viel innigere Beziehung des Zurückkehrenden und seiner Bewegung zu dem mit derselben aufzusuchenden Gegenstande aus, als die Konstruktion mit ושב אל שבותך ,שוב אלינו ,אל ausdrücken würde. Dieses letztere könnte auch eine zufällige, gelegentliche, widerwillige und gezwungene Rückkehr sein, wie die Rückkehr der Taube zu Noach (Bereschit 8, 9) שוב את macht aber die Wiedervereinigung mit dem aufzusuchenden Gegenstand zum Motiv und Ziel der Rückkehr und lässt vielmehr die vorangegangene Entfernung als das Unfreiwillige erscheinen. Es steht dem nicht entgegen, daß der Ausdruck auch bei der Restauration anderer Völker: Moab, Sedom, Mizrajim (Jirm. 48, 46 sowie Ezechiel 16, 53 und 29. 14) vorkommt; denn auch dort ist das Aufblühen der Nation auf dem Boden des Heimatlandes die eigentliche Absicht der göttlichen Waltung, und war der zeitweilige Untergang eine nur infolge nationaler Ausschreitung mit Schmerz verhängte Katastrophe, wie dies namentlich bei Moab (daselbst) zum Ausdruck kommt.

30,3,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 7:10,"Another matter: “Command the children of Israel” (Numbers 5:2) – the Rabbis interpreted that the verse refers to exile. “Command the children of Israel” – because they violated the mitzvot, they incurred liability to be banished; this is exile. That is what is written: “They shall send out from the camp” (Numbers 5:2); “they shall send out” is nothing other than an expression of exile, just as it says: “Send them out from My Presence, and let them go” (Jeremiah 15:1). “From the camp” – this is the Land of Israel, as the Divine Presence dwells there. “Every leper and every zav, and every one impure by means of a corpse” (Numbers 5:2) – He implied to them that if Israel violates these three transgressions, idol worship, illicit sexual relations, and bloodshed, they will incur liability to be exiled. “Leper” – this is idol worship. Just as a leper impurifies through entry, so idol worship impurifies through entry. (If a leper enters a house everything in the house becomes impure; if something which was offered to an idol is under a roof, everything under the roof becomes impure (see Ḥullin 13b).)  “Zav” – this is illicit sexual relations. These and those are impurified by means of a seminal emission. (Illicit sexual relations impurify the land. See Leviticus 18:24–28.)  “Impure by means of a corpse” – these are murderers, who impurify themselves and impurify the land with bloodshed. We learned that it is so: (Mishna Avot 5:12.)  Exile comes to the world for idol worship, for illicit sexual relations, for bloodshed, and for failure to leave the land fallow. (During the Sabbatical Year. )   For idol worship, how so? It says: “I will destroy your private altars, [and eliminate your sun-stones, and I will cast your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols]” (Leviticus 26:30). And it is written: “And you I will scatter among the nations…” (Leviticus 26:33). The Omnipresent said to Israel: Since you desire idol worship, I will exile you to a place where there is idol worship. That is why “I will destroy your private altars.”   For illicit sexual relations, how so? Rabbi Yishmael ben Rabbi Yosei said: Whenever Israel are steeped in illicit sexual relations [arayot], the Divine Presence departs from them, as it is stated: “And He will not see a shameful matter [ervat davar] (Erva is the singular of arayot.)  in your midst, and turn from behind you” (Deuteronomy 23:15)  For bloodshed how so? It is as it is stated: “You shall not pollute the land [in which you are, as the blood will pollute the land.… And do not impurify the land]” (Numbers 35:33–34). The verse tells that bloodshed impurifies the land, and the Divine Presence departs. It is due to bloodshed that the Temple was destroyed and Israel was exiled from their land.  These matters were in the first Temple, and that is why they were exiled and the Temple was destroyed, as Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Toreta said: Due to what reason was the first Temple destroyed? It was due to the fact that there were three matters in it: Idol worship, illicit sexual relations, and bloodshed. Idol worship, as it is written: “For the bedding is too short for stretching [mehistare’a]…” (Isaiah 28:20). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan said: This bed is too short for two counterparts [re’im] to dominate [mehistarer] as one. (Mehistare’a is a portmanteau of mehistarer and re’a.)  “And the covering [vehamasekha] is too narrow [tzara] for taking shelter [kehitkannes]” (Isaiah 28:20) – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that when Rabbi Yonatan would reach this verse, he would weep and say: For the One in whose regard it is written: “He gathers [kones] waters of the sea together as a mound” (Psalms 33:7), will the idol [masekha] became a rival [tzara]? Illicit sexual relations, as it is written: “The Lord says: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty [and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes]” (Isaiah 3:16). Bloodshed, as it is written: “Moreover, Menashe shed very much innocent blood…” (II Kings 21:16). That is why the Holy One blessed be He brought upon them three calamities corresponding to the three transgressions that they performed, as it is stated: “Therefore, due to you, Zion will be plowed as a field; [Jerusalem will become heaps, and the Temple Mount into forested heights [bamot]] (Micah 3:12). (The term bamot also refers to private altars, and in many instances, altars of idol worship, which were regularly built in elevated locations.)   This sending (“They shall send out from the camp” (Numbers 5:2).)  is stated regarding the Babylonian exile. “Male and female alike you shall send out” (Numbers 5:3) – that is stated corresponding to the exile of Media, as they went from Babylon to Media. Because they did not depart from the Land of Israel when they were exiled to Media, that is why “camp” is not stated here. Why is “male and female alike” written regarding the exile of Media? He implied to them that the kingdom of Media was destined to issue edicts upon them, “male and female alike,” as it is stated: “The scrolls were sent in the hand of the couriers to all the king’s provinces: To destroy, [to kill, and to eliminate all the Jews, from lad to elder, children and women]” (Esther 3:13). “Outside the camp you shall send them” (Numbers 5:3) – this is stated corresponding to the exile of Edom, (Edom refers to the Roman Empire.)  who destroyed the Temple and exiled Israel from their land. Why is the exile of Edom juxtaposed to the exile of Babylon? It is because just as Babylon destroyed the Temple and exiled Israel, so did the Edomites. Likewise it says: “Daughter of Babylon, marked for devastation” (Psalms 137:8) – the verse characterizes Edom as the daughter of Babylon; (The previous verse states: “Remember, Lord, the day of Jerusalem against the sons of Edom” (Psalms 137:7).)  even though the exile of Media is interposed between them in this verse, (“Male and female alike you shall send out” separates between the allusion to Babylon and the allusion to Edom.)  it is only because the exile of Media comes as an extension of the exile of Babylon, as when they were exiled to Media they departed from Babylon. “They shall not impurify their camp” (Numbers 5:3) – that is stated corresponding to the subjugation to Greece. This is why “sending” is not stated in its regard, as they did not exile them from their land. This is the reason that impurity is stated in its regard, as the Greeks impurified the Sanctuary with their idols.  “In which I dwell in their midst” (Numbers 5:3) – He implied to them that in every place they were exiled, the Divine Presence was with them. It is taught: Rabbi Natan says: Israel are beloved, as every place they were exiled, the Divine Presence was with them. They were exiled to Egypt; the Divine Presence was with them, as it is stated: “Did I not appear to your father's house, [when they were in Egypt]” (I Samuel 2:27). They were exiled to Babylon; the Divine Presence was with them, as it is stated: “For your sake, I sent to Babylon…” (Isaiah 43:14). They were exiled to Elam; the Divine Presence was with them, as it is stated: “I will place My throne in Elam” (Jeremiah 49:38). They were exiled to Edom; the Divine Presence was with them, as it is stated: “Who is this coming from Edom…” (Isaiah 63:1). When they are scattered, the Divine Presence is with them, as it is stated: “The Lord your God will return [veshav] your returnees…” (Deuteronomy 30:3). It is not written here: Will restore [veheshiv], but rather, “will return [veshav].” And it says: “With me from Lebanon, my bride, [with me from Lebanon, come]” (Song of Songs 4:8).  “The children of Israel did so, and sent them outside the camp” – when they sinned, they were exiled. “As the Lord spoke to Moses, so the children of Israel did” – what did the Holy One blessed be He speak to Moses? It is that if they will repent in the kingdoms where they will be, the Holy One blessed be He will gather them, as it is stated: “It will be when all these matters will come upon you, the blessing and the curse [that I have placed before you, you shall restore to your heart among all the nations that the Lord your God has banished you there. And you will return to the Lord your God].… The Lord your God [will bring you to the land]… The Lord your God will circumcise [your heart]…” (Deuteronomy 30:1–2, 5–6).  “So the children of Israel did [asu]” – that Israel is destined to repent [laasot teshuva] at the end of days and they would be redeemed, as it is stated: “With repose [beshuva] and stillness you will be saved” (Isaiah 30:15). Just as a leper, a zav, and one impure due to a corpse will never be purified until they enter pure water, so, the Holy One blessed be He is destined to sprinkle pure water upon them and to purify them, as it is stated: “I will sprinkle pure water upon you, and you will be purified…” (Ezekiel 36:25)."
30,3,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 28:1:10,"He also explains how the Messiah as leader will outshine all previous leaders such as Abraham, Moses, and even the angels. "
30,3,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 28:1:12,The reader is referred to the original for study of this part of the chapter in which the author deals with many Midrashim on the subject. 
30,3,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 50:1:7,"When we examine the promise of the prophet Nathan to David concerning the future of his son Solomon, we find that G-d had almost precluded Himself from severing His covenant with Solomon even if the latter should be steeped in sin. (Samuel II 7, 12-17) We read there something that sounds like Solomon had been given carte blanche by G-d, come what may. Similarly, we see Eytan Haezrachi describe the absolute assurances G-d gave to David and his descendants. (Psalms 89,21-38) How does all this square with the statement ""G-d is not mortal man that He deceives?"" (Numbers 23, 19) Reading verses 39,53, in Psalms 89, certainly poses a difficult problem concerning the absolute nature of assurances from G-d. We also find Solomon being warned repeatedly that his kingdom would not endure if he failed to live up to G-d’s expectations of him. (Kings I chapter 9) Even though the tabernacle, i.e. temporary collapsible structure did endure long, -due to the sin of the spies-, G-d expressed His plan for residence on earth by giving all the instructions for such a residence. In G-d’s own good time, an enduring structure will be built, such as is envisaged in the concluding chapters of the book of Ezekiel. That however, will be when the Jewish people will have become so refined in character through having been persecuted in exile, that success can be ensured and the Divine Presence would not again be forced to withdraw. The entire book of Ezekiel can be viewed as concentrating on this subject, seeing that it commences with a vision of ma-asseh merkavah, i.e. G-d’s residence in the heavens, and concludes with visions of G-d’s residence on earth. The intervening chapters only provide the rationale why a permanent residence for G-d on earth had not been possible, due to the errant ways of G-d’s chosen people. Only after ""and I shall sprinkle on you cleansing waters...and give you a new heart,"" (chapter 36) have the conditions been met that must precede the establishment of a permanent home for G-d on this earth. Interestingly, when Ezekiel mentions the date of his first vision, he begins with the exile of the Divine Presence,- when Jewish exile began-, only to mention the date of the day of Atonement, when forgiveness is granted as the last day in all his recorded visions. If G-d did not command building of a temple when Israel entered the holy land, it was because Israel did not remove all the vestiges of idol worship and idol worshippers from that land. They left in place many people and many objects that would cause them to sin at a later date. Even though David, of his own accord, proposed to establish such a temple, G-d asked ""how could you do so unless I had commanded you?"" As to the promise that his son would be chosen to do so, the son referred to, is not Solomon, but the Messiah. G-d emphasized that He never requested from Moses a permanent residence, neither does He request it at that time. (Samuel II 7,7) However, ""your son"" meaning the Messiah, ""he will build it."" David prepared blueprints etc., but he did not realise that it was not Solomon who had been meant by the words of the prophet Nathan, but that the descendant who would build the permanent house would do so many years after David's departure from this earth. Chronicles I chapter 17, confirms this interpretation. Verse 14 reads ""I will make him stand in My house and My kingdom forever,"" a phrase that can certainly not be applied to Solomon. This is all in line with the prophecy in Isaiah chapter eleven, describing the nature of the Messiah. This is the person referred to already in David's time (Samuel II 7, 14) ""I will be his father"" etc. The kind of sins committed in those distant days will indeed be subject to forgiveness because the people will respond positively to teachings and rebukes. As the prophet Zecharyah (12,8) says ""anyone that stumbles in those days will be equal to David; the house of David will be G-d like, like an angel before the Lord."" G-d will not abandon them as He has not abandoned David himself."" Nathan's prophecy to David referred in large measure to this distant future. Whether Nathan himself was fully aware of this, does not matter. When David refers to G-d’s promise for the distant future in gratitude, (Samuel II 7, 19) we notice that he was not unaware of the meaning of Nathan's message. David also understood that the very nature of man made it necessary for this process of refinement to extend over millenia. Chronicles I 17, 17, states ""You have seen me and chosen me like the row (group) of men of the elite, Lord G-d."" As the Talmud (Baba Metzia 114) says ""man, i.e Israel will qualify for the term ADAM after going through long periods of trials and afflictions etc. before realising that the object of our hopes is the glory of G-d manifested by what He builds, not the glory of man manifested by what man has erected. "
30,10,Quoting Commentary,Depths of Yonah 3:3:14,"Conclusion However we explain it, Nineveh’s Teshuvah stands as an example of a communal Teshuvah that the Jewish people will perform which will initiate the arrival of Mashiach (Devarim 30:1-10 and Rambam Hilchot Teshuvah 7:5). Nineveh’s one hundred percent participation sets a powerful example for our people, an important message year round but especially as the day of Yom Kippur draws to a close."
30,3,Halakhah,"Abudarham, Weekday Prayers, Amidah 57","Accept (R’tzei), Adonai, our God, Your people Israel: is based on, “‘I will extend My favor (ratziti) to you,’ declares Adonai.” (Ez. 43:27) Our teachers, Saadia Gaon  (Saʿadiah ben Yosef Gaon, often abbreviated RSG (R”S”G); 882/892 – 942 was a prominent rabbi, gaon, Jewish philosopher, and exegete who was active in the Abbasid Caliphate. Saadia Gaon – Wikipedia)  and Sherira Gaon  (Sherira bar Hanina more commonly known as Sherira Gaon (c. 906-c. 1006) was the Gaon of the Academy of Pumbedita. He was one of the most prominent Geonim of his period, and the father of Hai Gaon, who succeeded him as Gaon. Sherira ben Hanina – Wikipedia)  wrote that in the Minchah Amidah, the prayer leader does not recite the opening words of R'tzei since kohanim do not lift their hands  (The lifting of the hands is the common expression used for recitation of the priestly benediction by the kohanim)  at Minchah because of drunkenness. Since people had just consumed a midday meal, (the kohanim do not recite the priestly blessing) lest they had consumed alcohol. Drunkenness is forbidden when performing the priestly duties. Rather, one begins with, “the fire-offerings of Israel….”  (I believe what he is suggesting is that one would “Accept the fire-offerings of Israel….” leaving out the middle words.)  But at Minchah on fast days, one says the entire paragraph (of r’tzei) and on Yom Kippur at Minchah it is still the custom to recite R’tzei even though one does not lift one’s hands in blessing. Rabbi Yaakov, son of the Rosh  (Jacob ben Asher – Wikipedia Jacob ben Asher (c. 1270 – 1340), also known as Ba'al ha-Turim as well as Rabbi Yaakov ben Raash (Rabbeinu Asher), was an influential Medieval rabbinic authority.)  writes, even though there is no lifting of the hands at Minchah, what is this matter of not reciting R’tzei? If it is because of what the sages stated in Masechet Sota, chapter V’eilu Neemarim (Ch.7): “Any priest who does not ascend during the Temple service…” Peirush – When R’tzei is recited in the Amidah “...may not ascend (and recite the benediction)”  (BT Sota 38b)  What is the practical implication of this statement? It is that if they ascended when they recited R’tzei, they do not say it if there is no lifting up of the hands. Pay heed to their prayers: is based on, “Adonai paid heed to Abel and his offering.” (Gen. 4:4) And restore the service to the Holy of Holies in Your abode: is based on, “In the innermost part of the House.” (I Ki. 6:19) And the fire-offerings of Israel; and speedily accept their prayer in love: even though there is no longer Temple service, we ask that these prayers be accepted willingly, by God. There are those who explain that one says, “Restore the service to the Holy of Holies in your abode,” and afterwards (separately, one says) “Speedily accept their prayers in love,” since it is the beginning of a phrase. According to this explanation, one should not begin with “the fire-offerings of Israel,” since it is not the beginning of the phrase. And may You always find pleasure with the service (avodah) of Your people, Israel. Is based on ”Their burnt offerings and sacrifices shall be welcome on My altar.” (Is. 56:7)  (The entire verse states – ”I will bring them to My sacred mount And let them rejoice in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices Shall be welcome on My altar; For My House shall be called A house of prayer for all peoples.” Note that the prayer associates sacrifice with prayer.)  And prayer is called Avodah as we explained in the introduction. And may our eyes behold with mercy return to Zion: is based on the verse, “let our eye gaze upon Zion.’” (Mic. 4:11) and it is written, “For every eye shall behold Adonai’s return to Zion.” (Is. 52:8) It says With Mercy, based on the verse, “then Adonai your God will restore your fortunes and take you back with mercy.” (Deut. 30:3) and it is written, “I will receive him back in mercy, declares Adonai.” (Jer. 32:20) Praised are You, Adonai, Who returns His Divine Presence to Zion, is based on the verse, “that I may dwell among them.” (Ex. 25:8 and, “To cause his name to dwell there.” (Deut. 26:2), and many other places. The expression, “One who causes to return,” is used frequently in rabbinic Hebrew."

30,4,Jewish Thought,"Crisis and Covenant; Jewish Thought after the Holocaust, Chapter 3; Israel; Between Exile and Redemption 3","Ever since the first century CE the contours of that history had been clear. The Jewish people was, as the liturgy declared, in exile because of its sins. It would one day repent and be forgiven and would return to its land. This vision was already present in the concluding chapters of the book of Deuteronomy. Disobedience to the terms of the covenant would bring about catastrophe. The people would lose their national sovereignty. They would go into captivity, and there suffer indescribable horrors. Eventually they would reflect on their situation and conclude, “Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?” (Deuteronomy 31:17.)  They would return to God and God would return to them. “Then the Lord your God will bring you back from captivity and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where He scattered you.

It occurs twice at the end of Bereshit when first Yaakov then Yosef assure the other members of the covenantal family that their stay in Egypt will not be endless. God will honour His promise and bring them back to the Promised Land. We hear it again, magnificently, as Moshe tells the people that even after the worst suffering that can befall a nation, Israel will not be lost or rejected (Devarim 30:3–4)."

30,4,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Masei 13:1","(Numbers 35:11:) “You shall provide yourselves with places to serve you as cities of refuge.” And it is written (in Numbers 35:13-14), “six cities of refuge shall there be for you. The three cities.” The three in the Land of Israel were in the West; and the three that were across the Jordan in the East were in the Land of the Children of Reuben, in the Land of the Children of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh, as stated (in Deut. 4:43), “Bezer, in the desert [...].” R. Johanan said, (Ibid.,) “’Bezer, in the desert [...],’ see, there were three in the East. And the three in the West were in Hevron of Judah, and Shechem of Ephraim, which is Napolin (Nablus), and Kadesh in the Galilee from the tribe of Naphtali.” Moshe only apportioned [land] for the Reubenites, the Gadites and for the half tribe of Manasseh, and he set aside three cities from them, as stated (in Deut. 4:41), “Then Moses set aside three cities.” But Joshua apportioned [land] to all of the tribes, and they took [it] according to their lots, and they gave forty-eight cities to the Levites; the priests took thirteen, and the rest went to the [other] Levites, and the three cities of refuge came into their lot. And the tribe of Levi did not take a portion in the land, as stated (Jos. 12:33), “But no [portion] was assigned by Moses to the tribe of Levi.” Why? [Because (as in Deut. 18:2),] “the Lord is his portion, as He spoke to him.” You find that Sennacherib exiled Israel in three exiles. (Numb. R. 23:14; cf. Lam. R. Proem 5.)  First, he exiled the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh. Second, [came] the tribe of Zebulon and the tribe of Naphtali, as stated (in Is. 8:23), “in the former time he abased the land of Zebulon and the land of Naphtali.” Third, he exiled the rest of the tribes, as stated (ibid., cont.), “and later he afflicted (hikhbid).” (Translations of this verse vary, but the translation given here fits the sense of the midrash.)  He swept (hikhbid) them as [with] a broom (makhbed). Nebuchadnezzar also carried out three exiles with the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. In the first he exiled Jehoiakim [and] in the second, Jehoiachin. What did he do? He bound him in his carriage (Lat.: carruca; Gk.: karrouchion.)  and [there] he became dear to him. (Buber suggests a translation such as, “and it was his favorite.”)  Thus it is stated, “Behold, I am sending you away like a queen mother.” (The text is not in Scripture, but cf. Jer. 29:2.)  Just as one honors the queen mother, so did Nebuzaradan act toward him. [Then] Nebuzaradan exiled Zedekiah, for a total of three exiles. From where do we know that Nebuchadnezzar was a world emperor? As he exiled these to here and those to there, and he exiled Israel to Babylon, and those in Babylon to the Land of Israel. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In this world Israel has gone into exile and spread among the gates of the world, because of iniquities, as stated (Jer. 15:7), “And I will scatter them with a winnowing fork to the gates of the world”; but in the future to come (according to Deut. 30:4), “If your banishment is to the end of the heavens, from there will the Lord your God gather you, even from there will He bring you back.” It also says (in Is. 11:12), “and he shall gather the dispersed of Judah […].” And it says (in Is. 31:11), “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with singing. Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads, they shall obtain joy and gladness, while sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” And so may it be His will. Amen and Amen!"

30,4,Quoting Commentary,English Explanation of Mishnah Eduyot 8:7:2,"Rabbi Joshua said: I have received a tradition from Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, who heard it from his teacher, and his teacher [heard it] from his teacher, as a halakhah [given] to Moses from Sinai, that Elijah will not come to pronounce unclean or to pronounce clean, to put away or to bring near, but to put away those brought near by force and to bring near those put away by force. The family of Beth Tzriphah was on the other side of the Jordan and Ben Zion put it away by force; and yet another family was there, and Ben Zion brought it near by force. It is such as these that Elijah will come to pronounce unclean or to pronounce clean, to put away or to bring near.  Rabbi Joshua says that Rabban Yohanan ben Zakai had a tradition that can be traced all the way back to Moses who received it at Sinai, that when Elijah the prophet reappears in Messianic time, he will not clarify which families are clean, meaning they have not intermarried with forbidden relationships, nor will he clarify the opposite.  He will neither put away the unclean families nor draw near the clean families.  All that he will do is bring near the families who were forcibly and illegitimately put away and put away the families that were forcibly and illegitimately brought near.  In other words, decisions that humans had made as to which families were clean and which were not, and were made in a legal fashion without coercion, will be accepted by Elijah, even if he knows that they were wrong.  However, actions which were enacted by force and not consented to by the law-abiding sections of society will be corrected. A note about “a law from Moses on Sinai”.  The Rambam points out that Rabban Yochanan ben Zakai did not actually have a tradition that Moses said these very words.  Rather this is how the tradition understood Deuteronomy 30:3-4, which states that if you are scattered to the four corners of the earth, God will bring you back.  This is understood to mean that if a family was illegitimately not allowed to intermarry with other Jewish families, Elijah would redeem the situation. The mishnah now proceeds to mention one family that had been put away by force, meaning that this person Ben Zion, forcibly pronounced them unclean and made the rest of society abide by his will.  So too, Ben Zion, forcibly pronounced another family clean, and made society abide by his will."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

He is the companion of the above-mentioned person, and is regarded as one who denies Torah.

He will build the Holy Temple and gather in the scattered of Israel. In his days all Torah laws will return as before. We will bring sacrificial offerings and observe the Shemitah and Yovel years fully, according to their commandments as expressed in Torah. Whosoever does not believe in him or does not await his coming (that is, loses hope in his coming, for whatever reason) does not only deny the other prophets, but is in denial of the Torah and of our teacher Moshe. For the Torah testifies about him, as it states, (Deuteronomy 30:3-5)  “HaShem your God will return your captivity and have mercy on you; He will return and gather you in from all the nations where HaShem your God dispersed you. If you have been banished to the ends of the heavens, HaShem your God will gather you from there. HaShem your God will bring you into the land that your forefathers inherited and you shall inherit it. He will benefit you and increase you more than your forefathers.”"
30,5,Musar,Ma'amar Tzipita LeYeshuah 1:4,"That is, on the contrary, in our times it actually is closer and more applicable than ever to anticipate the redemption. And though, at first glance, if a person considers the conditions for the final redemption, as written in the Torah Portion of Nitzavim, (Deuteronomy 20)  that it will be when we return to HaShem with all our heart and soul, to heed His voice in all the mitzvot that He commanded us, both us and our children, then HaShem our God will return our captivity etc., as explained there. Whereas, according to what we currently observe, the generation is not at all worthy of this, which leaves room to lose hope. However, the answer to this will now be explained."
30,5,Musar,Ma'amar Tzipita LeYeshuah 2:1,"Now, as known to all, whoever does not at all believe in the coming of Moshiach, his sin is too great to bear, for he lacks one of the thirteen fundamental principles of faith. (See Mishnah Sanhedrin, Perek Chelek, and Rambam’s introduction there.)  The same applies to one who does not await him, who loses hope in him for whatever reason. He is the companion of the above-mentioned person, and is regarded as one who denies Torah. As Rambam wrote in Laws of Kings, Chapter 11, “The king Moshiach is destined to arise and return the kingdom of the House of David to its old glory and original dominion. He will build the Holy Temple and gather in the scattered of Israel. In his days all Torah laws will return as before. We will bring sacrificial offerings and observe the Shemitah and Yovel years fully, according to their commandments as expressed in Torah. Whosoever does not believe in him or does not await his coming (that is, loses hope in his coming, for whatever reason) does not only deny the other prophets, but is in denial of the Torah and of our teacher Moshe. For the Torah testifies about him, as it states, (Deuteronomy 30:3-5)  “HaShem your God will return your captivity and have mercy on you; He will return and gather you in from all the nations where HaShem your God dispersed you. If you have been banished to the ends of the heavens, HaShem your God will gather you from there. HaShem your God will bring you into the land that your forefathers inherited and you shall inherit it. He will benefit you and increase you more than your forefathers.”"

Only these speak about a time when Israel is exiled and dispersed, scattered, as Moses later put it, “to the most distant lands under heaven” (Deut. 30:4). There are three major differences between the two curses, however. The passage in Leviticus is in the plural, that in Deuteronomy in the singular. The curses in Leviticus are the words of God; in Deuteronomy they are the words of Moses. And the curses in Deuteronomy do not end in hope. They conclude in a vision of unrelieved bleakness:"

And the sages said (Sanhedrin 97b), ""The spirit of those that calculate the end should blow up."" And [from this principle is] that he believes that [the Messiah] will have great advantage and stature and honor above all of the kings that ever were; according to that which all of the prophets prophesied about him; from Moshe, our teacher, - peace be upon him - to Malachi, peace be upon him. And one who doubts him or for whom his stature is diminished denies the Torah, as the Torah testifies about him in Parashat Bilaam and in Parashat Atem Netsavim. And included in this principle is that there should not be a king in Israel except from the House of David alone. And anyone who disputes [the status] of this family, denies the name of God, may He be blessed, and the words of His prophets."

30,4,Midrash,Bamidbar Rabbah 23:14,"“You shall designate cities for you” – and it is written: “Six cities of refuge.… three cities […and three cities]” (Numbers 35:13–14) – three in the Land of Israel in the west, and three across the Jordan in the east. The children of Reuben, the children of Gad, and half of the tribe of Manasseh, as it is stated: “Betzer in the wilderness, in the land of the plain, for the Reubenite; Ramot in Gilad for the Gadite; and Golan in the Bashan for the Manassite” (Deuteronomy 4:43) – these are the three in the east. And three in the west: Hebron from Judah, Shekhem in the Ephraim highlands, which is Neopolis, and Kedesh in the Galilee from the tribe of Naphtali. Moses distributed [land] for Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, and designated from them three cities, as it is stated: “Then, Moses designated three cities” (Deuteronomy 4:41). But Joshua distributed for all the tribes and gave the tribe of Levi forty-eight cities. The priests took thirteen, and the rest was for the Levites. They took three cities of refuge in their allotted portion. But the tribe of Levi did not take a portion of the land. Why? It is because “the fire offerings of the Lord and His inheritance they shall eat” (Deuteronomy 18:1).  You find that Sennacherib exiled them [in] three exiles. The first exile, he exiled the Reubenite, the Gadite, and half the tribe of Manasseh. The second, the tribe of Zebulun and the tribe of Naphtali, as it is stated: “Like the first time he was lenient with the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali” (Isaiah 8:23). (This second exile was lighter, like the first exile, since only a small number of tribes were exiled (see Radak, Isaiah 8:23).)  The third, he exiled the rest of the tribes, as it is stated: “But with the last he was severe [hikhbid]” (Isaiah 8:23) – he swept [hikhbidan] them away as with a broom.  Nebuchadnezzar, too, exiled them in three exiles from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin. In the first, he exiled Yehoyakim, and in the second, Yehoyakhin. What did he do? He bound them in his honored royal chariot, as it is stated: “Behold, I am sending you away like the queen mother” (There is no such verse. It is unclear what the intended verse is.)  – just as the queen mother, a person honors her, so he did to him. Nevuzaradan (Nevuzaradan was a high official of Nebuchadnezzar and was in charge of the actual destruction of the Temple and Jerusalem, and also the exile which followed.)  exiled Zedekiah. These are three exiles. From where is it derived that Sennacherib was the ruler of the world? It is because he would exile these to there and those to here, and he exiled Israel to Babylon and brought those in Babylon to here.   The Holy One blessed be He said: In this world, due to iniquities, they were exiled and scattered in the cities of the world. But in the future: “If your banished will be at the ends of the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there He will take you” (Deuteronomy 30:4). “He will assemble the scattered of Judah from the four corners of the earth” (Isaiah 11:12). Likewise, Isaiah says: “The redeemed of the Lord will return, and they will come to Zion with song and everlasting joy on their heads; gladness and joy they will attain, and sorrow and sighing will flee” (Isaiah 35:10).  "
30,4,Quoting Commentary,"Abarbanel on Torah, Deuteronomy 30:1:3","...and it is since the nation in exile is divided into two parts: The smaller part are those that hold on to the religion and follow the Torah of the Lord, and they are referred to as Israel - but they remain the few from the many. And the other part of the people are those who - because of the troubles and the heaviness of the exile - have transgressed against His religion; as it is stated there (Deuteronomy 4:28), ""And you shall worship other gods there...,"" as I explained. Hence it stated corresponding to the two parts of the nation, ""you shall bring it to your heart amidst the various nations to which the Lord your God has banished you. And you will return to the Lord your God."" As behold the first statement is about those under duress (anusim) that have left the framework of the religion. Hence to those, it stated, ""you shall bring it to your heart"" - as their repentance will [only] be in the heart and not in the mouth. For they will not be able to publicize their repentance and their faith. And this is [the meaning] of its stating, ""amidst the various nations to which the Lord your God has banished you"" - meaning to say, that they are mixed in with them and considered like them. Nevertheless, they will return to the Lord in their hearts. And regarding the other part of the Jews that are known [to be Jews], it states, ""and you will return to the Lord your God, and you and your children will heed His voice with all your heart and soul, just as I enjoin upon you this day"" - meaning to say that they will repent and do the commandments and heed the voice of God publicly, they and their children. For they have not abandoned their God there. And when they repent to God, they will follow Him. But [both] these and those will run [to Him] - each one according to his condition and his context. It promised that God, may He be blessed, will gather them unto Him. And this is [the meaning of] ""And the Lord your God will return your captivity and have mercy upon you; and He will return and gather you."" Behold it said, ""And the Lord your God will return your captivity and have mercy upon you,"" about that part that are Jews publicly and hold on to their Judaism. And it states about them, ""your captivity,"" since they are in captivity and servitude. And it states, ""and [He will] have mercy upon you,"" as they will need mercy, due to their lowliness and troubles. However regarding the other part that have left the framework of the religion because of the their duress, it states, ""and He will return and gather you from all of the nations."" But it did not state regarding them, ""captivity"" nor ""mercy."" And this is the reason that it states that He will gather them from all the nations; as they are mixed in with them and have intermarried with them. And about these, it states (Deuteronomy 30:4), ""Even if your outcasts are at the ends of the world, from there the Lord your God will gather you, from there He will fetch you""..."

The Jewish people was, as the liturgy declared, in exile because of its sins. It would one day repent and be forgiven and would return to its land. This vision was already present in the concluding chapters of the book of Deuteronomy. Disobedience to the terms of the covenant would bring about catastrophe. The people would lose their national sovereignty. They would go into captivity, and there suffer indescribable horrors. Eventually they would reflect on their situation and conclude, “Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?” (Deuteronomy 31:17.)  They would return to God and God would return to them. “Then the Lord your God will bring you back from captivity and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where He scattered you.

30,5,Halakhah,Sefer HaChinukh 340:4,"And that which our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, also said (Arakhin 31b) that if the [last] day of the twelfth month arrives and [the original owner] does not find the buyer [to redeem it from him, behold he places his money in the court, breaks the door of the house and enters; and when the buyer comes,] he shall come and take his money. And that which they said (Arakhin 31b) that one who sells a house in the walled cities and the Jubilee arrives in the midst of the year of the sale, it does not go back immediately with the [start of the] Jubilee, but its law is like in other years in the years of the Jubilee [cycle] — that it is finalized with the [end of the] year if the seller does not want to redeem it. And that which they said (Arakhin 33a) [regarding] the seller of a house in the open cities — that if he wants, he can redeem [it] immediately like the law of a house from the houses of walled cities; and if does not want to redeem [it] immediately, he can redeem it even after a year like the law of fields. As they have the better power of [both] the fields, and the houses of the walled cities. And that which they said (Arakhin 32a) that the law of everything that is inside the wall, such as gardens, bathhouses, and birdhouses, is like the law of houses — as from that it is written (Leviticus 25:30), “that is in the city,” it includes it all. But if there were fields inside the city, their law is like fields outside of the city, as it is stated, “the house will be established” — meaning to say, the house and all that is similar to a house, such as bathhouses, and birdhouses and even orchards, but not fields. And a house that does not have four ells by four ells is not called a house; and therefore, it is not finalized. And a house is not finalized in Jerusalem. And a city that its roofs are its walls does not have the status of of one surrounded by a wall, but rather we require that it has a wall besides its roofs. And we also require that it was first surrounded and settled afterwards, but if it was settled [first] and surrounded afterwards, that is not a walled city. And we only rely upon a wall that surrounded [a city] from the time that Yehoshua conquered the Land. And once they were exiled in the first destruction [of the Temple], the holiness of a walled city was nullified. But when Ezra came in the second coming [to the Land of Israel], all of the cities surrounded by walls at that time were sanctified; since their coming in the time of Ezra which was the second coming, was like their coming in the time of Yehoshua: Just like their coming in the time of Yehoshua [provided that] they counted the sabbatical years and Jubilees, the walled cities were sanctified and they become obligated in the tithe; so too at the time of Ezra was it so. And so too, when the messiah will come with the third coming, we will begin to count the sabbatical years and Jubilees, the houses of walled cities that will be surrounded at that time will be sanctified and every place that will be conquered will be obligated in tithes. As it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:5), “And the Lord, your God, will bring you, etc.” — and they said (Arakhin 32b), “It compares your inheriting to the inheriting of your ancestors, etc.” And the rest of its details are elucidated in Tractate Arakhin. (See Mishneh Torah, Laws of Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee 12.)"
30,5,Midrash,Seder Olam Rabbah 30:2,"... Rabbi Yossi says, ""A merit ends up being on a day of merit and a punishment ends up being on a day of punishment. For you will find to say that when the First Temple was destroyed, that day was the culmination of the Shabbat, and it was at the culmination of the sabbatical year and it was during the watch of Yehoyariv and it was the ninth of Av. And likewise with the Second. And in both this one and that one, the Levites were standing on the platform and reciting song. And what song did they recite? 'He will make their evil recoil upon them' (Psalms 94:23).""

30,5,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Kings and Wars 11:1","In the future, the Messianic king will arise and renew the Davidic dynasty, restoring it to its initial sovereignty. He will build the Temple and gather the dispersed of Israel. Then, in his days, the observance of all the statutes will return to their previous state. We will offer sacrifices, observe the Sabbatical and Jubilee years according to all their particulars as described by the Torah. Anyone who does not believe in him or does not await his coming, denies not only the statements of the other prophets, but those of the Torah and Moses, our teacher. The Torah testified to his coming, as Deuteronomy 30:3-5 states: God will bring back your captivity and have mercy upon you. He will again gather you from among the nations... Even if your Diaspora is at the ends of the heavens, God will gather you up from there... and bring you to the land.... These explicit words of the Torah include all the statements made by all the prophets. Reference to Mashiach is also made in the portion of Bilaam who prophesies about two anointed kings: the first anointed king, David, who saved Israel from her oppressors; and the final anointed king who will arise from his descendants and save Israel in the end of days. That passage Numbers 24:17-18 relates: 'I see it, but not now' - This refers to David; 'I perceive it, but not in the near future;"" - This refers to the Messianic king; 'A star shall go forth from Jacob' - This refers to David; 'and a staff shall arise in Israel' - This refers to the Messianic king; 'crushing all of Moab's princes' - This refers to David as II Samuel 8:2 relates: 'He smote Moab and measured them with a line;' 'decimating all of Seth's descendants' - This refers to the Messianic king about whom Zechariah 9:10 prophesies: 'He will rule from sea to sea.' 'Edom will be demolished' - This refers to David as II Samuel 8:6 states 'Edom became the servants of David;' 'Seir will be destroyed' - this refers to the Messianic king as Ovadiah 1:21 prophesies: 'Saviors will ascend Mount Zion to judge the mountain of Esau....'"
30,5,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee 12:16","Similarly, in the Ultimate Future, upon the third entry to the land, (I.e., when the Jews return to Eretz Yisrael led by Mashiach.)  we will begin to count the Sabbatical and Jubilee years and sanctify the homes in walled cities, and every place that will be conquered will be obligated in [the separation of] tithes, as [Deuteronomy 30:5]: ""And God your Lord will bring you to the land that your ancestors possessed as a heritage and you shall possess."" [The verse] equates [the Jews' ultimate] possession with that of their ancestors. Just as when your ancestors took possession of the land as a heritage, they practiced the renewal of all these observances, when you take possession of the land, you should practice the renewal of all these observances. (The Ra'avad and others question the Rambam's statements, because he accepts the principal (see Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.) that through Ezra's consecration, the land was consecrated until and including the ultimate future. Kina'at Eliyahu suggests a resolution based on the fact that the sanctification of the land by Ezra was only Rabbinic in origin, while the sanctification by Mashiach will have the power of Scriptural Law. Hence, a new sanctification will be necessary.) "
30,5,Talmud,Yevamot 82b:2,"As it is taught in a baraita in the anthology called Seder Olam, with regard to a verse that speaks of the Jewish people’s return to Eretz Yisrael following their exile: “And the Lord your God will bring you into the land that your fathers inherited, and you shall inherit it” (Deuteronomy 30:5). These two expressions of inheritance teach that they had a first inheritance of Eretz Yisrael in the days of Joshua and a second inheritance at the time of the return from the Babylonian exile. That is to say, since the sanctity of the land had lapsed when the First Temple was destroyed and the Jewish people exiled to Babylonia, a second sanctification was necessary when they returned to their land. But they will not have a third inheritance. In other words, it will never be necessary to sanctify the land for a third time, as the second sanctification was permanent."
30,5,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:5:1-3","אל הארץ אשר ירשו אבותיך וירשתה, “to the land which your forefathers had inherited, and you will inherit it.” Our sages in Seder Olam (chapter 30, an ancient historical text) have explained that the words: “which your forefathers inherited, and you will inherit it,” mean that whereas they inherited it twice, they did not (need to) inherit it a third time. The first time the people inherited the land and sanctified it by their presence was under Joshua. This sanctification remained effective only until their expulsion and the destruction of the Temple. The second sanctification (and inheritance) occurred during the time of Ezra. That sanctification was for all times so that after the present exile there is no need to inherit and sanctify the land once again. This is how my teacher Rabbi Shlomo Aderet, may his light shine, explained this matter to me. It is possible to explain our verse as meaning that whereas the first and second inheritance by the Jewish people extended only to the land of Israel, the third inheritance will include entitlement to any part of the globe. This is what the Torah means in our verse when it writes: “He will do good for you, and increase you more so than for your forefathers.” This is why the expression “inheritance” is used by the Torah in connection with the period of the first two Temples, but not in connection with the future. The expression used in that connection clearly envisages an additional distinction the Jewish people will enjoy then. This is similar to what our sages (Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1,37) expounded on as the reason why whenever we read about the word שירה in the Bible it is feminine, except when the song refers to events in the future, such as in Psalms 96,1 or Isaiah 26,1. It is the nature of a woman to become pregnant and give birth and to experience the same procedure time and again. The redemption of the Jewish people in the future will be a final redemption, something not needing to be repeated. This is why, when the Bible speaks of such times, the song sung then will be a masculine song, i.e. שיר חדש. It is the function of the male to inherit his father’s property absolutely, once and for all, as distinct from when daughters receive such an inheritance, as an emergency and interim measure. (Compare Ezekiel 48,33: שער יששכר אחד, שער זבולון אחד, “the gate of Issachar — one; the gate of Zevulun — one.”) Midrashim link the verse in Ezekiel with Zecharyah 13,8 describing the destruction of two thirds of the inhabitants of Israel. Midrash Tanchuma Shoftim 9 on the words לתת להם ולזרעם אחריהם, “to give to them and to their descendants after them,” breaks up this verse into three sections. The words לתת להם refer to the people leaving Egypt; the word ולזרעם refers to the immigrants in the time of Ezra, the word אחריהם refers to the eternal redemption. In a Midrash in Devarim Rabbah (not found in our editions, see Pesikta Zutrata on Deut.1,8), לתת להם refers to the people leaving Egypt, ולזרעם refers to the immigrants to Babylonia, אחריהם refers to the returnees during the messianic epoch."

And it is said: In all their affliction, He is afflicted, and the angel of His Presence delivered them; in His love and in His pity, He redeemed them, and bore them and carried them forever. (Isaiah 63:9.)  and it is said: Who is an Almighty like You, forbearer of iniquity and forgiver of transgression for the remnant of his heritage? He does not maintain His wrath forever, for He desires to do kindness. He will again show us compassion, He will suppress our iniquities; And you will cast into the depths of the sea all their sins. You will grant truth to Jacob, kindliness to Abraham as You swore to our fathers from the days of old. (Micah 7:18-20.)  And it is said: And I will bring them to My holy moutain; and make them joyful in My House of Prayer; their burnt-offerings and sacrifices will be accepted with favor on My Altar, for My House will be called a House of Prayer for all peoples.

30,5,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 26:16:1,"APH ANI E’ESEH ZOTH LACHEM’ (ALSO I WILL DO THIS UNTO YOU). By way of the Truth, the meaning [of this verse is] as if it were inverted: ‘aph ani zoth e’eseh lachem’ [meaning: “also ani — the term for the Divine attribute called zoth, which signifies judgment — will do unto you”]. This is why He always mentions in this section the word ani (I): then will ‘ani’ (I) also walk; (Verse 24.)  And ‘ani’ (I) also will smite you; (Verse 24.)  and ‘ani’ (I) also will chastise you; (Verse 28.)  and ‘ani (I) will bring the Land into desolation; (Verse 32.)  ‘ani’ (I) also will walk contrary unto them. (Verse 41.)  And in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah [we find it interpreted]: (Sefer Habahir, 66. See Vol. I, p. 24, Note 42.)  “It will not suffice for Me [merely] to pronounce judgment [and have it executed by a messenger], but even I also will chastise [you], etc.” The principle [of this section] is that it is the Holy One, blessed be He, Who makes this covenant, and this is the meaning of the expressions: seven for your sins; (Verses: 18, 24, 28. See my Hebrew commentary p. 187.)  seven according to your sins. (Verse 21.)  And the oaths are [thus] the oaths of the covenant, for the expressions are from the mouth of the Almighty, [speaking] in the language of the first person: ‘I’ will do; (In Verse 16 before us.)  and ‘I’ will chastise; (Verse 28.)  and ‘I’ will smite. (Verse 24.)  Therefore Scripture states [concerning this covenant], which the Eternal made between Him and the children of Israel, (Further, Verse 46.)  for He by His Great Name made this covenant. But in the Book of Deuteronomy [Scripture] states, If thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments, (Deuteronomy 28:15.)  and it continually mentions there an expression of cursing, thus it starts them [the words of the covenant] with: cursed shalt thou be, (Ibid., Verse 16.)  since the blessing is absent from them, and it further states, the Eternal will make. (Ibid., Verse 24.)  It is this which is the [intention of the] saying of our Rabbis: (Megillah 31 b.)  “The imprecations of the Book of Leviticus were [prounounced] in plural terms [if ‘ye’ will not hearken … if ‘ye’ shall reject …], and Moses, in saying them, said them from the mouth of the Almighty [stating: “Thus did the Holy One blessed be He, say unto me, ‘If ye will not hearken unto Me’ “], but those [imprecations mentioned] in the Book of Deuteronomy were [pronounced] in the singular [if ‘thou’ wilt not hearken … which I command ‘thee'…] and Moses in saying them said them [as though they came] from his own mouth, for the Almighty made Moses a messenger between Him and between all Israel.” Know and understand that these oaths [stated in this section] allude to the first exile [i.e., the Babylonian exile following the destruction of the First Temple], for it is with reference to the First Temple that all the words of this covenant, concerning the exile and the redemption therefrom, apply. For thus you will see in the exhortations [here] that He stated, And if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances, (Verse 15.)  and He further stated, that ye void My covenant, (Verse 15.)  mentioning among them [the rejected statutes]: the high places [on which they offered forbidden sacrifices], sun-images, and idols, (Verse 30.)  and it was [in the times of the First Temple] that they worshipped idols and did all evil things. It is in connection with this that He said, And I will bring your Sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors, (Verse 31.)  thus warning them that He will remove from them His Sanctuary and the acceptance of the offerings which were favorable to Him in that Sanctuary, and the punishments which were to follow upon them were: the sword, (Verse 25.)  wild beasts, (Verse 22.)  pestilence, (Verse 25.)  famine, (Verse 26.)  and finally exile. (Verse 33.)  And all these things occurred then [at the destruction of the First Temple], as is clearly stated in the Book of Jeremiah. Of that [first] exile He stated, Then shall the Land be paid her Sabbaths; (Verse 34.)  As long as it lieth desolate it shall have a rest; even the rest which it had not [in your Sabbath], (Verse 35.)  because the years of the [Babylonian] exile were [as many] as the years in which they failed to observe [the laws of] the Sabbatical years. (See Rashi in Verse 35, who explains how the seventy years of the Babylonian exile correspond exactly to the seventy Sabbatical and Jubilee years that Israel failed to observe in the Land.)  So also does Scripture state concerning that exile, [that it was] To fulfill the word of the Eternal by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the Land had been paid her Sabbaths; for as long as she lay desolate she kept Sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years. (II Chronicles 36:21.)  Thus He warned them and thus it happened to them. If so, it is clear that Scripture speaks here of that [first] exile. If you examine further the subject of the redemption from it [the Babylonian exile, you see], that He only assures [Israel] that He will remember the covenant of the fathers, (Verse 42.)  and of the remembrance of the Land, (Verse 42.)  but not that He will forgive their iniquity and their sin and that He will once again love them as of old, nor that He will gather together those of them who are dispersed. For such indeed happened when they came up from Babylon, for only [the tribes of] Judah and Benjamin returned together with a small group of Levites who were with them, and some (See Ramban’s Sefer Hage’ulah (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, pp. 272-4) for a full discussion of this important matter — that in the return from Babylon there were small groups from the other tribes besides Judah and Benjamin, but the main bulk of them remained in their places, and hence the words of the prophets announcing their complete return, not having been fulfilled during the Second Temple, will yet assuredly come to transpire in the future. This is the deeper significance of Ramban’s expression here: “and some of the other tribes …” — “some” but not all, and therefore the words of G-d as spoken by His prophets will still be fulfilled in the future when the ge’ulah shleimah (the perfect redemption) will take place, as the return from Babylon did not represent that final and complete redemption. It is obvious that this constitutes a major principle in our faith of Israel’s future and destiny. Ramban will touch upon this theme of the perfect redemption further on in the text. See also further, Note 154.)  of the [other] tribes that had been exiled to Babylon, and they returned in poverty, and in servitude to the kings of Persia. (See Ezra 9:9.)  Nor does He state that they will return to Him in complete repentance, but only that they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, (Verse 40.)  and we find that the people of the Second Temple did so, as Daniel confessed: We have sinned, we have dealt iniquitously, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, and have turned aside from Thy commandments etc. (Daniel 9:5.)  O Eternal, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers. (Ibid., Verse 8. Thus they confessed also the sins of their fathers. The same applies to the following verses.)  And it is further written, because of our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people are a reproach. (Ibid., Verse 16.)  And so did Nehemiah confess. (Nehemiah 1:6-7.)  And Ezra said, Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept Thy law. (Ibid., 9:34. It should be noted that Scripture there ascribes the actual confession to the Levites, and Ezra’s name is not directly mentioned. However, the implication in Chapter 8 Verse 13 is clearly that it was at Ezra’s instigation that they kept the Festival of Tabernacles and the subsequent confession following it (see ibid., 9:1). Besides, Ezra being a priest (ibid., 8:2) he was automatically of the tribe of Levi and was thus included among the Levites who recited the confession.)  Thus they all deduced from the Torah that they should confess their iniquity and [also] the iniquity of their fathers. All these [matters] are clear indications that this covenant does indeed allude to the first exile and the redemption therefrom. However the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 28:1-69.)  alludes to this our [present] exile, and to the redemption by which we will be redeemed from it. Thus we observe first that there [in the second covenant] neither the end nor the duration [of the exile] are alluded to, and that He did not assure us of redemption [i.e., promising that it would take place at a certain future time as was the case with the Babylonian captivity, whose end was foretold as a definite event in our section here in Leviticus as explained above], but He made it dependent upon [our] repentance. Neither did He mention among the sins [for which they would be exiled that] they would make any Asherim and sun-images, or that they would worship any idols whatsoever. Rather, He said, But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes, (Deuteronomy 28:15.)  thus stating that because they will transgress some of His commandments, and will not keep and observe all of them, (I.e., they will “transgress” some of the negative commandments and “not keep and observe” the positive commandments.)  they would be punished. Such indeed was the case during the Second Temple, just as the Rabbis have said: (Yoma 9 b.)  “Why was the First Temple destroyed? Because of idolatry, immorality and bloodshed. But the Second Temple, of which we know that they [the people of that period], were engaged in the study of Torah and the practice of loving kindness, why was it destroyed? It was because of the causeless enmity which was among them.” Neither does He mention there [in the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy] the Sanctuary, or “the pleasing odor” [of the offerings], as He mentioned here, (Verse 31.)  because the [Heavenly] fire did not come down and consume the offerings [that were brought] in the Second Temple, as the Rabbis testified there in Tractate Yoma. (Yoma 21 b. Thus, as it were, there never was a “pleasing odor” in the days of the Second Temple which could be removed at its destruction.)  And He further states there among the imprecations, The Eternal will bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, as the vulture swoops down, (Deuteronomy 28:49.)  alluding to the coming upon them of the Romans, who were very far from them. Thus He states there, a nation that thou hast not known; (Ibid., Verse 36.)  a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand, (Deuteronomy 28:49.)  because of their great distance from our Land. Such is not the case concerning the words of this covenant [before us], for [it speaks of the time when] they were exiled to Babylon and Assyria, which are near to [our] Land, and they always warred with them; (Therefore, the verse in Deuteronomy 28:49 [The Eternal will bring a nation … from the end of the earth …] could not apply to the period of the First Temple, as their warring enemies were nearby. The case was far different during the Second Temple when the Romans came from far-off Italy.)  and the stock of Israel comes from there, and they [the Jews] knew their language, as it is said, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Aramean language, for we understand it. (II Kings 18:26.)  Similarly, the verse stating [there in the Book of Deuteronomy], And the Eternal shall scatter thee among all peoples, from the one end of the earth unto the other (Deuteronomy 28:64.)  is [a reference to] our exile today, in which we are scattered from one end of the world to the other. Again He stated [there], And the Eternal shall bring thee back into Egypt in ships, (Ibid., Verse 68.)  and this happened in our [present] exile, when Titus filled the ships with them [captives], as it is written in the books of the Romans. (Reference is to the book of Josippon, Chapter 95. See Vol. I, p. 604, Note 249.)  Similarly, that which Scripture says there, Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thy eyes shall see; (Deuteronomy 28:32.)  Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and they shall not be thine, for they shall go into captivity (Ibid., Verse 41. Ramban’s illuminating comment on these verses (see following text) brings to light the ruthless cruelty of the Romans at the destruction of the Second Temple, when they deported all the young and only “the fathers [i.e. the old] remained in the Land.”)  — these are not references to the [Babylonian] exile, when both fathers and sons were exiled, but [refer] to that captivity of the sons alone [following the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans], when the fathers remained in the Land. Such is not stated in the first covenant, because the exile [which it speaks of] was a complete one [for both fathers and sons], but it is mentioned in the second covenant, because the Romans ruled in our Land and took the sons and daughters at their will. Similarly, [the verse stating], Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Eternal shall send against thee in hunger, and in thirst (Ibid., Verse 48.)  is a reference to our servitude when we were subject to the Romans in our Land, and their officers ruled over us, pressing upon us a heavy yoke and taking away our people and our wealth, as is known in the [history] books. Another proof [that the covenant in the Book of Deuteronomy refers to the exile after the destruction of the Second Temple] is that He said, The Eternal will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers, (Ibid., Verse 36.)  for King Agrippa (This was Agrippa II, a loyal servant of Rome. He was the last king of Judea. During the siege of Jerusalem he was with Titus, and following the fall of the city he took part in arranging the Roman triumphal celebrations in Caesarea! He was the opposite of his father King Agrippa I, who in his genuine attachment to the Jewish people and religion won the love of all classes of the people.)  went to Rome at the end of the [period of the] Second Temple, and on account of his going there the Temple was destroyed. (Ramban here is referring to Josippon Chapter 65, where it is narrated that “King Agrippa went to Nero, emperor of Rome, and told him all these things [concerning the Jewish uprising against Rome], whereupon Nero sent against the Jews the Roman general etc.” This was the beginning of the war which culminated in the fall of Jerusalem.)  Now Scripture does not state: “the king who will rule over thee,” but it says, thy king whom ‘thou shalt set’. Thus He, blessed be He, is hinting to us that he [that ruler] was not fit to be king, since he was forbidden to be king over Israel according to the law of the Torah [as he was a descendant of King Herod, the son of Antipater the Idumean, and Scripture states, thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother], (Deuteronomy 17:15.)  but they “set up” him and his fathers as kings over them against the law, as is mentioned in Tractate Sotah. (Sotah 41 b.)  Now all the hints such as these clearly indicate that the meaning of this matter is this our [present] exile, and the redemption [mentioned] in this second covenant, which will be a complete redemption, superior to all [preceding ones]. Thus He said, And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse etc.; (Deuteronomy 30:1.)  and He promised, And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers, (Ibid., Verse 5.)  this being a promise to all the tribes of Israel, not [merely] to one-sixth (I.e., the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which constitute one-sixth of the twelve tribes. Ramban is thus stating that the redemption from the Babylonian exile was not a complete redemption, since the return consisted mainly of two tribes [with small groups of the other tribes, see above Note 124]. But the Divine promise stated in Deuteronomy 30:5 [as mentioned here in the text] refers to all tribes of Israel. Hence the coming redemption will be more complete than all preceding ones.)  of the people; and there He promised [also] that He would cut down and destroy those who caused our exile, as it is said, And the Eternal thy G-d will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee, (Ibid., Verse 7.)  the expressions, thine enemies and those that hate thee alluding to the two nations (A reference to the two dominant religions in Ramban’s times — that of Edom and Ishmael — which persecuted the Jews [and still continue to do so] in countless ways. See my Hebrew commentary p. 190.)  that continually persecute us. Now these words [And He will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers (Ibid., Verse 5.) ] assure us of the coming redemption with a more perfect assurance than all the visions of Daniel. Similarly, that which He stated here, and your enemies that shall dwell therein shall be desolate in it (Further, Verse 32.)  constitutes a good tiding, proclaiming that during all our exiles, our Land will not accept our enemies. This also is a great proof and assurance to us, for in the whole inhabited part of the world one cannot find such a good and large Land (Exodus 3:8.)  which was always lived in and yet is as ruined as it is [today], (When these words were written — sometime after the middle of the thirteenth century — the Land of Israel had just experienced the Mongolian invasion (of 1259-60), which following upon the constant wars of the Crusaders, left the country in total ruin.)  for since the time that we left it, it has not accepted any nation or people, and they all try to settle it, but to no avail. (A clear reference to the many nations that have tried — and failed — to cultivate the Land of Israel since the Jews were driven from it by the Romans. This indubitable historical fact is, as Ramban correctly points out, “a great proof” that the Land belongs to Israel. Witness also the miraculous response of the Land since the recent return of the Jews to its borders.)  Now the first covenant mentioned in this section the Holy One, blessed be He, made, for His Great Name was indeed with us in the First Temple, and the second covenant in the section of V’hayah Ki Thavo (Deuteronomy 26:1. — The covenant referred to is ibid., 28:1-68.)  expressed by the mouth of Moses, alludes to the removal of his Divine Presence entirely, since in the Second Temple only the Glory of His Name was present, as it is said, and I will take pleasure in it i.e., the Second Temple] ‘v’ikavdah’ (and I will be glorified). (Haggai 1:8.)  The additional letter hei (The word v’ikavdah is in this instance actually written without the hei at the end. Ramban however is referring to the fact that according to the Masorah it is to be read as if it had the letter at the end. Hence his language: “the ‘additional’ hei” …)  alludes to the second hei in the Great Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton — which refers to the Glory of His Name]. (Abusaula. — Thus the verse establishes that in the Second Temple there was the Glory of His Name. Haggai was one of the prophets who lived at the time of the building of the Second Temple.)  The Rabbis have also already interpreted this verse by means of another exposition, (Yoma 21 b. Thus, as it were, there never was a “pleasing odor” in the days of the Second Temple which could be removed at its destruction.)  [that the missing hei in the word v’ikavdah, whose numerical value is five], alludes to the five things which the Second Temple lacked etc. (“They are: the ark with the cover and the cherubim, the Divine fire on the altar, the Divine Presence, the Holy Spirit, and the Urim and Thummim” (ibid.). For Urim and Thummim see Ramban on Exodus 28:30 (Vol. II, pp. 480-4).) "
30,5,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Sheviit 6:1:4-5,"Rebbi Eleazar said, they accepted the tithes voluntarily. What is the reason? (Neh. 10:1) “In view of all this, we execute a contract and write, signed by our princes, Levites, and priests. (Neh. 10 contains the contract between the people and God in which they accept the Biblical obligations connected with Land and Temple. If the obligations were Biblical, no contract would have been needed.) ” How does Rebbi Eleazar uphold (10:37): “The first-born of our cattle and flock (Even though Ex. 13:11 explicitly connects the sanctity of the first-born to the conquest of the Land, it is generally accepted that the obligation does not depend on the Land.) ”? Since they accepted upon themselves matters they were not obligated for, even matters they were obligated for are credited to them as if they were accepted voluntarily (The Babli (Qiddušin 31a, Baba Qama 38a, 87a, Avodah Zarah 3a) holds that the person who is obligated receives greater reward than the person who is not obligated.

Rebbi Yose ben Ḥanina said, they became obligated by the words of the Torah; that is what is written (Deut. 30:5): “The Eternal, your God, will bring you to the Land that your fathers had inherited and you will inherit it.” Just as the inheritance of your fathers was by the words of the Torah, so your inheritance is by the words of the Torah. “He will be good to you and give increase to you more than to your forefathers (In this homily, “increase” is interpreted as increase in obligations, not increase in benefits.) .” Your fathers had been free and became obligated, also you had been free and became obligated. On your fathers was no yoke of government (מלכות in both Talmudim means “Gentile government.”) , but you even though there is on you the yoke of government. Your fathers did become obligated only after 14 years, seven they conquered and seven they distributed (The universally accepted computation that from the crossing of the Jordan to the assembly at Shilo there passed 14 years is given in Seder Olam, Chap. 11 (in the author’s edition, Northvale NJ 1998, pp. 116–119.)) , but you became obligated immediately when you entered. Your fathers did become obligated only after they had acquired all, you become obligated for every single piece at the moment you acquire it."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

(See Mishnah Sanhedrin, Perek Chelek, and Rambam’s introduction there.)  The same applies to one who does not await him, who loses hope in him for whatever reason. He is the companion of the above-mentioned person, and is regarded as one who denies Torah. As Rambam wrote in Laws of Kings, Chapter 11, “The king Moshiach is destined to arise and return the kingdom of the House of David to its old glory and original dominion. He will build the Holy Temple and gather in the scattered of Israel. In his days all Torah laws will return as before. We will bring sacrificial offerings and observe the Shemitah and Yovel years fully, according to their commandments as expressed in Torah. Whosoever does not believe in him or does not await his coming (that is, loses hope in his coming, for whatever reason) does not only deny the other prophets, but is in denial of the Torah and of our teacher Moshe. For the Torah testifies about him, as it states, (Deuteronomy 30:3-5)  “HaShem your God will return your captivity and have mercy on you; He will return and gather you in from all the nations where HaShem your God dispersed you. If you have been banished to the ends of the heavens, HaShem your God will gather you from there.

30,5,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol II, Part II, Chapter VIII The Sanctity of the Liberated Territories 22","This explanation, however, presents an obvious conceptual problem. The original settlement as a result of conquest also resulted in the inhabitants being seized of the land. Since the original settlement involved ḥazakah as well, why did it lapse? Kesef Mishneh, Hilkhot Bet ha-Beḥirah 1:16, raises the question and leaves it unanswered. The question may perhaps be resolved on the basis of the Palestinian Talmud, Shevi'it 6:1. This source indicates that the mode of sanctification utilized by Ezra, viz., ḥazakah, could not have been employed in the original settlement. Citing the verse, ""And the Lord your God will bring you into the land … and He will do good unto you and make you more than your fathers"" (Deuteronomy 30:5) the Palestinian Talmud states that, in contradistinction to the earlier sanctification, Ezra sanctified the land even though it did not achieve political autonomy but remained a vassal state owing fealty to the kings of Persia and Medea. Since this sanctification was a divine beneficence, and not contingent upon conquest of territory, it did not lapse when the land was taken from Israel."
30,5,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol II, Part II, Chapter VIII The Sanctity of the Liberated Territories 55","However, in his article in Or ha-Mizraḥ, Rabbi Gershuni notes that both the Book of Maccabees and Josephus state that these territories were captured by both the Maccabees and by Herod. If this is the case, exclusion of these areas from the obligation of terumot and ma'asrot is puzzling. Rabbi Gershuni develops the thesis that only those areas settled by Ezra were permanently sanctified. Other areas settled at a later time do not share in this sanctity. (See also R. Ya‘akov Emden, Mor u-Keẓi‘ah 306.)  The Palestinian Talmud, Shevi'it 6:1, cites the verse ""… and He will do good unto you and make you more than your fathers"" (Deuteronomy 30:5) and interprets it as referring specifically to Ezra's resettlement of the Land of Israel. The beneficence spoken of and described as greater than that bestowed upon earlier generations is understood by the Palestinian Talmud as a specific allusion to the permanent nature of Ezra's sanctification. According to Rabbi Gershuni, the sanctity with which the territories captured by the Maccabees and by Herod were endowed was different in nature from the sanctity of the areas resettled by Ezra. The latter enjoyed permanent sanctity by virtue of settlement. No conquest was necessary since the return and resettlement of the land was accomplished with the permission of the Persian rulers. The areas captured by the Maccabees, and by Herod, argues Rabbi Gershuni, enjoyed sanctity solely by virtue of conquest, as was the case in the time of Joshua. Therefore, the sanctity of those territories lapsed when they were subsequently recaptured, just as the sanctity of the areas captured by Joshua lapsed when those territories were conquered by gentile nations."
30,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 92:1:11,"""Behold the Heavens, and the Heavens of the Heavens, belong to the Lord, the earth and all there is therein."" (10,14) This points out the difference between G'd and any other deities. Since the latter, not even laying claim to own the universe, cannot inspire ""fear"" as we have defined it, they are also unable to elevate man. G'd, by reason of His ownership of the universe, can claim obedience of all creatures. Should we ask that since He owns it all, what difference can one nation's claim to consideration by G'd make?, the answer given is ""He only took a liking to your ancestors, to love them and their seed after them."" (10,15) Even though the Jewish people are far from perfect, ""like the lily amongst the thorns,"" G'd chose Israel because of its relative merit. By the time you have realised and appreciated the meaning of your national history, says Moses, you will have arrived at the stage of love for G'd. At that point performance of the mitzvot will no longer be an act of obedience, but an expression of your love for G'd the Lawgiver. Reviewing the whole chapter, one is forced to conclude that far from making impossible demands upon us, G'd is in fact granting us privileges. The etnachta, tone sign under the words ""from you"" in verse twelve, as well as under the word ""today"" in verse thirteen, supports our view that the lines between have to be read as if in parenthesis. The verse then reads ""and now Israel what is it that the Lord asks of you this day; in order that you will be well off?..except to..."" After all that, the passage describing the land of Israel as one that needs rainfall, as distinct from Egypt, is a reminder that even after attaining their reward and successful takeover of the land of Canaan, Divine help will continue to be needed. The land will only deliver its bounty to Israel when such Divine help is forthcoming. The second paragraph of the keriyat shema which follows, spells out the conditions for such Divine help, and the consequences should Israel fail to meet these conditions. "
30,5,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 18:1:16,"(8) According to some, the promise that Abraham and Sarah would sire a child, made Abraham wonder if perchance Ishmael was destined to die, since otherwise his existence would have enabled G-d to fulfil His promise to Abraham to become the ancestor of a multitude of nations in a far more natural way. This consideration prompted Abraham to pray for Ishmael's continued existence. (6) When Abraham questioned G-d’s promise, his concern was legitimate, whereas when Sarah did so she had no such legitimate concern. Therefore, G-d criticized Sarah without criticizing Abraham. However, it is more likely that Abraham's remark was just as unseemly as Sarah's later, just as was that of Moses when he questioned G-d’s ability to feed all of Israel meat in the desert (Numbers 11,21). Since however, it was a day of glad tidings, a day on which Abraham had cheerfully accepted the commandment to circumcise himself, G-d did not want to spoil the occasion by criticizing him. Similarly, on the day the Torah was given, the leaders of Israel were not punished, although their conduct was deserving of punishment (Exodus 24, see Vayikra Rabbah 20). When G-d did criticize Sarah eventually for her similar lack of belief, He did so via Abraham. ""Why does Sarah laugh?"" (Genesis 18,13). He could have criticized Sarah without addressing Abraham on the subject. However, G-d wanted Abraham to get the message that he, too, had erred in a similar fashion on the same subject. (9) As it was, G-d’s answer was only meant to emphasize that Sarah deserved to bear a son. Ishmael's future was not in doubt at all. Abraham was to call the new son Isaac, as a reminder that he had considered his conception and birth as too amusing a flight of fancy to entertain seriously. G-d would let Ishmael become great, but the new covenant under discussion would be maintained with Isaac. (10) The statement that ""G-d had finished speaking with Abraham"" proves, that this whole vision had been of a superior nature compared to previous ones. This vision was more like the ones Abraham would enjoy from this point on, though in this instance we still find Abraham falling down due to the overwhelming impact of G-d’s Presence. The promptness with which Abraham carried out G-d’s commandment reflects the newly won awareness that he was as yet incomplete as a human being. Rabbi Berechya points out in Bereshit Rabbah 39 that in promising Isaac, G-d did not say, ""I will place you,"" but rather ""I will make you."" This indicates a direct action on G-d’s part, similar to such actions by G-d during the creation of man. The meaning is ""When I make a new creature out of you, be fruitful and multiply!"" When G-d had made a covenant with Noach, the sign of which was the rainbow, He limited the power of the forces of water and assured the continued existence of man. He promised that the future of a nation based on Abraham and Isaac would be assured just as the future of mankind had been assured through the covenant with Noach. No matter what sins will call for retribution, the nation as a whole will not perish. This implies that Israel's character even amid persecutions due to its infidelity vis a vis the Almighty, will exhibit traits that will qualitfy it for eventual redemption. "
30,5,Talmud,Arakhin 32b:11,"And so it says with regard to the return of the Jews from exile: “And the Lord your God will bring you into the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it” (Deuteronomy 30:5). The verse compares your possession to the possession of your fathers: Just as the possession of your fathers came with the renewal of all these matters, i.e., the Sabbatical Year and the Jubilee Year, and terumot and tithes, so too your possession comes with the renewal of all these matters, as the initial consecration was nullified."
30,10,Quoting Commentary,Depths of Yonah 3:3:14,"Conclusion However we explain it, Nineveh’s Teshuvah stands as an example of a communal Teshuvah that the Jewish people will perform which will initiate the arrival of Mashiach (Devarim 30:1-10 and Rambam Hilchot Teshuvah 7:5). Nineveh’s one hundred percent participation sets a powerful example for our people, an important message year round but especially as the day of Yom Kippur draws to a close."
30,10,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, Nitzavim, Two Concepts of Teshuva 8","When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come upon you and you take them to heart wherever the Lord your God disperses you among the nations, and when you and your children return to the Lord your God and obey Him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where He scattered you. Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back. He will bring you to the land that belonged to your fathers, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers.... You will again obey the Lord and follow all His commands that I am giving you today. Then the Lord your God will make you prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and crops of your land. The Lord will again delight in you and make you prosperous, just as He delighted in your fathers, if you obey the Lord your God and keep His commands and decrees that are written in this book of the law and turn to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. (Deut. 30:1–10) "
30,6,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 30:6:1,"AND THE ETERNAL THY G-D WILL CIRCUMCISE THY HEART. It is this which the Rabbis have said, (Shabbath 104a.)  “If someone comes to purify himself, they assist him” [from on High]. The verse assures you that you will return to Him with all your heart and He will help you. This following subject is very apparent from Scripture: Since the time of Creation, man has had the power (Literally: “the permission.”)  to do as he pleased, to be righteous or wicked. This [grant of free will] applies likewise to the entire Torah-period, so that people can gain merit upon choosing the good and punishment for preferring evil. But in the days of the Messiah, the choice of their [genuine] good will be natural; the heart will not desire the improper and it will have no craving whatever for it. This is the “circumcision” mentioned here, for lust and desire are the “foreskin” of the heart, and circumcision of the heart means that it will not covet or desire evil. Man will return at that time to what he was before the sin of Adam, when by his nature he did what should properly be done, and there were no conflicting desires in his will, as I have explained in Seder Bereshith. (Genesis 2:9 (Vol. I, pp. 72-73). See also Vol. III, pp. 456-457. — It should be noted here that Ramban’s intention is not to state that man in the era of Messiah will be completely devoid of the desire to do evil, for if that were the case there would be no place for reward and punishment, which is founded upon the principle of man’s freedom of choice between good and evil. Rather, the import of his words is to state that man will then be so motivated for good that he will naturally be doing the good and proper according to the Will of G-d, and it will appear as if the instinct for evil has been completely eliminated from him, although potentially it will still be with him. The case is similar to what we say now of a normal knowledgeable person that it is “impossible” for him to jump into a blazing fire. Of course, it is within his powers to do so, but it is his knowledge of the danger entailed that makes it “impossible” for him to do so. In the Messianic era man will have that kind of reaction to all things prohibited by G-d. There will, therefore, still be place for reward and punishment, since potentially man will still have his freedom of choice. See my Hebrew commentary, Vol. I, p. 36-37, where I quote this thought in the name of Rabbi Yeruchum, one of the great leaders of the Musar movement.)  It is this which Scripture states in [the Book of] Jeremiah, Behold, the days come, saith the Eternal, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers etc. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Eternal, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it. (Jeremiah 31:30-32.)  This is a reference to the annulment of the evil instinct and to the natural performance by the heart of its proper function. Therefore Jeremiah said further, and I will be their G-d, and they shall be My people; and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying: ‘Know the Eternal;’ for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them. (Ibid., Verses 32-33.)  Now, it is known that the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth (Genesis 8:21.)  and it is necessary to instruct them, but at that time it will not be necessary to instruct them [to avoid evil] for their evil instinct will then be completely abolished. And so it is declared by Ezekiel, A new heart will I also give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; (Ezekiel 36:26.)  and I will cause you to walk in My statutes. (Ibid., Verse 27.)  The new heart alludes to man’s nature, and the [new] spirit to the desire and will. It is this which our Rabbis have said: (Shabbath 151b.)  “And the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say: ‘I have no pleasure in them’ (Ecclesiastes 12:1.)  — these are the days of the Messiah, as they will offer opportunity neither for merit nor for guilt,” for in the days of the Messiah there will be no [evil] desire in man but he will naturally perform the proper deeds and therefore there will be neither merit nor guilt in them, for merit and guilt are dependent upon desire."
30,6,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 30:6:1,"AND THE LORD THY GOD WILL CIRCUMCISE. For He is the first cause of all actions. (I.E.’s paraphrase of I Sam. 2:3. In other words, God is the first cause who gave man the power to circumcise his heart. Since all things can be traced back to God, God can be said to “circumcise” man’s heart. And the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart seems to indicate that man has no free will, for it implies that God will change man’s nature so that he will no longer sin. Hence I.E.’s comment.)  After saying, you shall return unto the Lord and listen to His voice, (I.E.’s paraphrase of the opening of verse 6.)  Moses says that unlike the circumcision of the flesh, which you are obligated to execute, God will help you and will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed. "
30,6,Targum,Onkelos Deuteronomy 30:6,"And Adonoy, your God, will circumcise [remove the foolishness from] your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love Adonoy, your God, wholeheartedly and with all your being in order that you live."
30,6,Targum,Targum Jonathan on Deuteronomy 30:6,"And the Lord your God will take away the foolishness of your heart, and of your children’s heart; for He will abolish evil desire from the world, and create good desire, which will give you the dictate to love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul, that your lives may flow on for evermore.

30,6,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 30:6:1,"ומל ה' אלוקיך את לבבך ואת לבב זרעך, לאהבה, He will open your eyes so as to remove every erroneous conceptions which have prevented you from recognising the theological truth of all aspects of the Jewish religion. Once these “blinds” have been removed from your eyes you will realise that everything G’d has done was out of His love for you, and had to be done למען חייך, in order to ensure that you will be part of eternal life after your body dies.
"
30,6,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:6:1,"ומל ה׳ אלוקיך את לבבך, And the Lord your G'd will circumcise your heart, etc."" In view of the Torah already having described the Israelites as having done תשובה why would G'd have to circumcise their hearts? Besides, what does the Torah mean in verse 8 ואתה תשוב ושמעת בקול השם, ""and you will return and hearken to the voice of G'd?"" This seems to contradict the statement in verse 2? Moreover, the words ואתה תשוב after G'd has circumcised our hearts make no sense at all. What can still be lacking in the process of penitence once G'd has circumcised our hearts?"
30,6,Commentary,"JPS 1985 Footnotes, Deuteronomy 30:3",Others “circumcise.”
30,6,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 30:6:1","ומל ה' אלוקיך את לבבך, “the Lord your G’d will circumcise your heart, etc.;” we have a principle that if someone takes the first step in the direction of purifying himself he will experience a Divine assist during his continuing efforts in that direction. Moses assures the repentant sinner that Hashem will assist by removing hindrances, metaphorically described as a foreskin that are strewn on the path to one’s rehabilitation.
    Nachmanides writes that from the wording of the text it would appear that starting with the creation of man, he was free to act as he saw fit; [in the sense of “without interference on the part of the Creator”. Ed.] As long as the Torah that we received at Mount Sinai will be in force, this situation will continue, the reason being that G’d wants to have a reason to reward us for having chosen freely to obey Him, as opposed to the angels who do not possess such a choice. However, in the days after the Messiah will have arrived it will become natural for man to make the right choices, the heart no longer pining away for things that are not appropriate for man. This is what Moses meant when he spoke about a “circumcision” of the heart occurring. The urge for things forbidden is considered as a ערלה, a foreskin. At the time of the Messiah man will recapture the innocence possessed by the first man, Adam, before he had eaten from the tree of knowledge. [By the way, Adam had been created without a foreskin, so that the foreskin with which most of his descendants are born are a reminder of some impediment to purity having becoming a “normal” condition in man. Ed.] Man will revert to being a “parve” being, in the sense that there is no greater tendency to do good than to do evil or vice versa. From that time and on, everything will depend on man’s will. He will only need to will himself to be good in order to succeed. There will be no Satan trying to block his way.
"
30,6,Musar,Orchot Tzadikim 26:60,"It was a great kindness that the Holy One, Blessed be He, did for mankind when he established a way for wrong-doers and sinners to flee from darkness to light, and did not close the doors of repentance to them, even if they had sinned greatly, as it is said, ""Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings"" (Jer. 3:22). And repentance is accepted by God even if the sinner repents because of his great misfortunes; all the more so if he repents because of reverence and love of God. As it is said, ""In thy distress, when all these things are come upon thee, in the end of days thou will return to the Lord thy God; and hearken unto His voice"" (Deut. 4:30). And the Holy One, Blessed be He, helps penitents to repent even in matters which the strength of a man cannot attain, and he renews within them a pure spirit so that they may achieve the elements of repentance. As it is said, ""And shalt return unto the Lord thy God, and hearken to His voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul"" (Deut. 30:2). And further, at the end of that passage, ""And the Lord will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart"" (Deut. 30:6). What this means is that in that thing which is not within your power to attain, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will circumcise your heart and give you the strength to do it."
30,6,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Shemot 23:19:6","It is fairly clear that these various reasons are not an adequate explanation for such a basic legislation. Maimonides did not mean to advance this as the deeper meaning of the legislation. He only wanted to show the questioner that this commandment could be understood in terms of weaning the Jewish people from pagan practices.  The fact is that the entire legislation belongs to the category of חקים, the statutes for which no logical reason can be found, just as we cannot fathom a reason for the legislation of the red cow. The true meaning of these statutes will not be revealed to us until after the arrival of the messiah. The law about the scapegoat on the Day of Atonement is of a similar nature. All our attempts to understand it only touch the surface and do not reveal the true purpose G’d had in mind when He legislated it other than that by observing these laws we are to demonstrate our belief in His superior wisdom of what is good for us. Seeing that in the period following the arrival of the messiah there will neither be paganism nor coarseness of our character and bloodthirsty people, and there is no reason to believe that this legislation will then be abolished, it is clear that its true meaning is something far beyond what we have been given to understand. In the meantime we rely on the promise of Deut. 30,6 that there will come a time when the Lord will circumcise our hearts after the end of all exile and persecution when we will be able to comprehend what we cannot comprehend now. A similar promise has been spelled out in Tzefaniah 3,9: ”for then I will make the peoples pure of speech, so that they will all invoke the Lord by name and serve Him with one accord.” In the meantime it suffices to know that there is a mystical dimension to this commandment."
30,6,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:6:1","ומל ה' אלוקיך את לבבך, “the Lord your G’d will circumcise your heart, etc.” Nachmanides writes on this verse: “this means that the Lord will remove the ‘foreskin’ covering the people’s heart”, a simile for desires of sexual and other varieties which are described as ערלת הלב. We know that someone who is captive to such desires is known as ערל, from Jeremiah 9,25 where the prophet describes the Jewish people as being of uncircumcised heart [although they do not have a foreskin on their sexual organ. Ed.] Just as the removal of the foreskin of that organ helps to restrain excessive sexual urges, so the removal of its equivalent covering of the heart will control the cravings responsible for committing other sins. G’d assures the people in that verse in Jeremiah that a time will come when such obstacles to obedience to G’d’s laws will be removed. [Although what the author wrote here is the gist of what Nachmanides writes, it does not represent an accurate translation of his words. Ed.]"
30,6,Halakhah,Kitzur Shulchan Arukh 128:1,"[The days] from Rosh Chodesh Elul until after Yom Kippur, are days of Divine favor [and acceptance.] Even though throughout the entire year the Holy One, blessed is He, accepts the repentance of those who return to Him wholeheartedly, nevertheless, these days are unexcelled and most suitable for repentance, because they are days of mercy and favor. On Rosh Chodesh Elul, Moshe went up Mount Sinai to receive the Second Tablets; he remained there for forty days, and came down on the tenth day of Tishrei when the atonement was completed. From then on these days have been designated as days of Divine favor [and acceptance,] and the tenth day of Tishrei as Yom Kippur [Day of Atonement]. In most communities it is the custom to fast on the day before Rosh Chodesh Elul and to recite the prayers of Yom Kippur Katan [minor Yom Kippur], in order to be spiritually prepared for repentance. If Rosh Chodesh occurs on Shabbos, Yom Kippur Katan is held on the preceding Thursday. The Ari (Rabbi Yitzchak Luria), of blessed memory, wrote, ""If he did not lie in ambush but Hashem made it happen, then I will provide …"" (Exodus 21:13) The initials of the words [ina le'yado vesamti lecha] form the acronym Elul, to indicate that this month is a favorable time for repentance to be accepted for the sins committed during the entire year. It also alludes to the fact that sins done inadvertently also require repentance (The Scriptural verse referred to in the text deals with a homicide that was commited accidentally or inadvertently.)  during this month. The interpreters of allusions also commented: It is written (Deuteronomy 30:6) ""And Hashem your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your children;"" the initials of the words [es levavecho ve'es levav] form the acronym Elul. Also, the initials of Ani ledodi vedodi li, [""I am my Beloved's and my Beloved is mine,""] (During these forty days, since repentance is more readily accepted, our repentance brings our hearts closer to our Beloved One and thus He, (our Beloved) is closer to us by accepting our repentance. (Mishnah Berurah preface to Chapter 581))  [Song of Songs 6:3] form the acronym Elul. Also, the initials of Ish lerei'eihu umatanos la'evyonim [""One to another and gifts to the poor""] (Esther 9:22) form the acronym Elul. These acronyms are an allusion to three things: Repentance, Prayer and Charity which must be practiced zealously during this month. ""Hashem will circumcise etc."" alludes to repentance, ""I am my Beloved's etc."" alludes to prayer, for prayer is the song of love. ""One to another and gifts to the poor,"" alludes to charity."
30,6,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:6:2,"I have already pointed out in my commentary on כי תבא that there are three categories of blessings and punishments concerning three different parts of Torah observance. There is a separate reward and punishment for 1) Torah study, 2) observance of the negative commandments, 3) performing the positive commandments. "
30,6,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:6:3,"In accordance with this, the process of repentance must also include all these three areas of Torah observance. The words ושבת עד ה׳ אלוקיך refer to the Jews beginning to study the Torah again. This is why the Torah continues with the words ""and you listen to His voice."" Seeing that the Torah does not mention anything else in that context it is clear that the subject of ושבת is your return to Torah study. The words ושב ה׳ את שבותך ושב וקבצך, are a promise that the people will be redeemed by the merit of Torah study (Zohar volume three page 72). We also have it on the authority of Jeremiah 9,12 that the disaster struck the Jewish people as a result of their abandoning Torah. This is why when they rectify this error and devote themselves once more to Torah study G'd will gather them in and bring them back to ארץ ישראל."
30,6,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:6:4,"Concerning the failure to keep the negative commandments the Torah says: ""and G'd will circumcise your hearts."" We are familiar with the concept that the foreskin of the heart is a hyperbole for doing what is forbidden and a love for the forbidden. G'd now says לאהבה את ה׳ אלוקיך ""in order to love the Lord your G'd."" In response to the Israelites learning to love G'd, He in turn, will take care of all our troubles. He will deliver our enemies into our hands and He will afflict all our enemies with the curses mentioned previously. "
30,6,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:6:5,"Concerning the performance of the positive commandments as part of the Israelites' repentance the Torah writes: ""you will return….and carry out all the positive commandments, etc."" The additional reward accruing to the people as a result is described in verse 9 ""G'd will make you abundantly successful in your various endeavours, etc."""
30,6,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 32:34:3","The word למו at the end of verse 35 contains an allusion to the time of the redemption (seeing the three letters in that word are the acronym of למועד מועדים וחצי, the time described as the time of the redemption in Daniel 12,7). At that time ידין ה' עמו, “the Lord will judge His people.” May the Lord hasten the time when this will occur as He said when He spoke about circumcising our hearts (30,6)."
30,6,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 76:5:5,"However, it is impossible to pray with a clear mind unless one first repents fully for one’s sins. This is as it is written (Deuteronomy 30:6), “Then God  will circumcise your heart”—which Targum renders as: God will remove the foolishness of your heart—<“to love God your Lord”>. Of which repentance is this said? [It refers] to repentance motivated by love, on account of which every last trace is effaced."
30,6,Chasidut,Likutei Moharan 141:1:5,"This is the meaning of (Deuteronomy 30:6), “The Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed”—when God circumcises his heart, the heart of his seed will also be circumcised. [Such is the case] wherever the seed was drawn: if to [conceive] a human being, then his children will of necessity also experience thoughts of repentance due to the circumcision of their father’s heart; and if it was drawn somewhere else, God forbid, then the hearts will be circumcised there and they will feel, as mentioned."

30,6,Musar,Sha'arei Teshuvah 1:1,"In explanation of repentance and its principles  Among the good things which God, may He be blessed, has bestowed upon His creations is the path which He prepared for them to ascend from the baseness of their actions, to escape the trap of their inequities, to hold their souls back from destruction and to remove His anger from upon them. Because of His goodness and uprightness, He has taught them and warned them to return to Him when they sin against Him - for He understands their nature, as it is stated (Psalms 25:8), ""Good and upright is the Lord; therefore He shows sinners the way."" [Even] if they greatly sin and rebel and act like treacherous betrayers - He does not close the doors of repentance to them, as it is stated (Isaiah 31:6), ""Return, to Him to whom they have been so shamefully false."" It is [also] stated (Jeremiah 3:22), ""Turn back, O rebellious children, I will heal your afflictions."" We are warned about repentance in several places in the Torah. It is explained that repentance is accepted even when the sinner repents because of his many troubles - how much more so [will it be accepted] if he returns because of fear or love of God - as it is stated (Deuteronomy 4:30), ""When you are in distress because all these things have befallen you and, in the end, return to the Lord your God and obey Him."" It is explained in the Torah that God will help those who repent beyond what their natural ability would allow; and that He renews a pure spirit within them, to reach great heights in His love - as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:2), ""And you return to the Lord your God, and you and your children heed His command with all your heart and soul, just as I enjoin upon you this day."" Further, it is stated about the body of the matter (Deuteronomy 30:6), ""Then the Lord, your God, will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your offspring,"" to acquire love for Him. And the Prophets and Writings constantly speak on the subject of repentance, such that the principles of repentance are all explained in their words, as will be explained."

30,6,Quoting Commentary,"Peirush Hafla'ah on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, Rabban Gamliel's Three Things 6:2","Having completed the Maggid, Rabbi Horowitz now reveals the real significance of the practice of telling the story of the Exodus at the Seder. There is a mystical dimension to the telling. When we tell the story we experience the revelation of God’s hidden light which was first created at the very beginning of creation. The light from within is connected with the light from above. The word “This” becomes a key word in this passage. It is only in the radiance of the Divine light that we can point and say, “This!” Once again, Rabbi Horowitz returns to the theme of the wicked child who, like the non-Jews, is not able to see the light and therefore cannot benefit from it. In every generation each person is obligated to see himself as if he went forth from Egypt: The “seeing” here refers to the ability of the intellect to perceive the “hidden light of the Divine.” (On the first day of creation, God creates light – even before He has created the sun or the stars. This is not physical light but a spiritual light that was hidden away until the time of redemption. I believe that is the light that Rabbi Horowitz is speaking about here.)  Just as this light was revealed at the moment of Israel’s redemption, so it is revealed anew each year on Passover. This light was also revealed at the Red Sea, as Israel sang, “THIS is My God and I shall glorify Him!” (The word Zeh, THIS, suggests that when Israel sang these words they were pointing to the divine light.)  And in the time of future redemption, the people of Israel shall say, “THIS is our God!” (Isaiah 25:9)  So too, when we say, “It is because of THIS that God did for me when I went out of Egypt,” (Exodus 13:8)  what we are really saying is, “It was for THIS light which God revealed at the time of the Exodus,” That God redeemed us from Egypt. Others cannot be jealous of this light for those who cannot perceive it, cannot see of it. This light is also the light of Shabbat about which the sages said “a reward is given to those who perceive it.” We also say, “I have a precious gift in my treasury; it is the hidden light.” (Shabbat 10b, Mekhilta and other sources as well)  We also find the following verse in Scripture: “How abundant is the good that you have stored away for those who fear You; that You do in the full view of men for those take refuge in You. You can grant them the protection of Your Presence against scheming men.” (Psalms 31:20-21)  God reveals His light in the “full view of men” because they cannot be jealous since others are incapable of perceiving this Divine light. Therefore, “Then they shall say among the nations, the Lord has done great things. The Lord will do great things with us and we will rejoice.” (Psalms 126:2-3)  That is, in the future the nations will rejoice because they did not perceive the great things that God has done for Israel and therefore we will be able to rejoice! Similarly, the wicked child of whom we said “God did this for me, and not for him,” will not be able to perceive this divine light either because he is “uncircumcised,” not literally but spiritually. The wicked child has an uncircumcised heart, as we read in scripture, “Then the Lord you God will circumcise you heart and the hearts of your offspring…” (Deuteronomy 30:6)  and “Any person may eat of it, once he has been circumcised.” (Exodus 12:44)  The consuming here is both physical and spiritual, as we read in scripture, “They behold God and they ate and drank.” (Exodus 24:11)  This verse is translated in Targum, the Aramaic translation of the Torah as, “They rejoiced in their sacrifices as if they ate and drank.”"

30,6,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 19:8:1,"AND IF THE ETERNAL THY G-D ENLARGE THY BORDER. This section deals with a future event, and I have already mentioned it (Above, 12:20.)  in the section [i.e., the Seder] of Behold, I set before you. For first he stated, When the Eternal thy G-d shall cut off the nations, whose land the Eternal giveth thee, (Verse 1.)  the expression whose land the Eternal giveth thee referring to all the seven nations that He mentions everywhere. So also he speaks with reference to them, And the Eternal thy G-d will cast out those nations before thee; (Ibid., 7:22.)  whereas for the wickedness of these nations; (Ibid., 9:4.)  and the Eternal will drive out all these nations from before you; (Ibid., 11:23.)  but of the cities of these peoples, (Further, 20:16.)  and so also in many other places. And now he commanded that after taking possession of their land and dwelling in it, he (The third person singular here seems to refer to the leader of the people — Joshua — although the fulfillment of the commandment was incumbent upon all Israel.)  shall set aside three cities, completing [the performance of] the commandment with their designation, as He said there, there shall be for you six cities of refuge, (Numbers 35:13.)  and He further said, Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan. (Ibid., Verse 14. And since the three cities beyond the Jordan eastward had already been set aside by Moses (above, 4:41), the designation of the three cities in the land of Canaan thus completed the fulfillment of this commandment.)  He did not command in the Torah that there be more than these six cities. Similarly all commandments of the Torah that become binding after taking possession and settling upon [the Land] become obligatory after the conquest of these seven nations. Only regarding this commandment, however, he added here, And if the Eternal thy G-d enlarge thy border and he did not say “as He hath promised thee,” as he said in the section, When the Eternal thy G-d shall enlarge thy border, as He hath promised thee (Above, 12:20.)  with reference to meat of a secular meal. This was because G-d did not promise them anywhere to give them [land] except for [that of] these seven nations. However, here he mentioned the patriarchs, as he said, And if the Eternal thy G-d enlarge thy border, as He hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which He promised to give unto thy fathers, this being an allusion to all ten nations (Genesis 15:19-21.)  that were promised to Abraham. Now he made here a condition, if thou shalt [in time to come] keep all this commandment to do it etc. (Verse 9.)  [then another three cities of refuge would be designated in addition to the six already discussed in Scripture]. Now it is clear that they will not inherit even the seven nations if they transgress the Torah as he has said many times — hearken unto the statutes etc. that ye may live, and go in and possess the Land; (Above, 4:1.)  and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this Law etc. that thou mayest go in unto the Land; (Further, 27:3.)  For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment etc., then will the Eternal drive out all these nations from before you. (Above, 11:22-23.)  And when Achan, who was but an individual, transgressed the devoted thing, (Joshua 22:20.)  it was stated, Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, they turn their backs before their enemies. (Ibid., 7:12.)  If so, [the question arises], why was this condition made only concerning these three cities, stating, And if the Eternal thy G-d enlarge thy border etc. if thou shalt keep all this commandment [when the conquest of the seven nations is also conditional upon observing the Torah]? The reason for this is, that it was the Divine Will before Him, blessed be He, that yet in the days of Moses and Joshua, He would give them possession of the lands of the seven nations which He had promised them while they were still in Egypt (See Exodus 3:8.)  and in the wilderness, (See ibid., 34:11.)  because it was known to Him that they were deserving [of the lands] by virtue of their merits. Therefore He obligated them in the observance of all commandments upon the conquest of these [nations], and He further obligated them [in the commandment] of the six cities of refuge, and so Joshua designated [the cities]. But concerning the three remaining ones he made a condition, if thou shalt keep all this commandment etc. to love the Eternal thy G-d, and to walk forever in His ways etc., (Verse 9.)  that is to say, that they would all observe the entire Torah, [they would then become obligated to set aside three additional cities]. There is no commandment dependent upon this condition except for [the designation] of these three cities. But what reason was there to state, if thou shalt keep all this commandment etc. to walk ‘kol hayamim’ (forever) in His ways — then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, for who knows what will ever happen afterwards? Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: “kol hayamim — [all the days] without interruption between them.” This is not correct. Rather, the purport of the verse is as follows: “If thou shalt keep all this commandment, when your merit attains a degree that you will keep all the commandments, loving G-d with a perfect everlasting love, so that it should be apparent to Him that you will never again sin, then He will broaden your boundary and give you all the [ten] nations [He promised to Abraham].” This is a reference to the days of which he said, And the Eternal thy G-d will open thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, (Further, 30:6.)  the expression the heart of thy seed indicating [the people of] all future days, similar to what is written in the Prophets, (See above, Note 25.)  And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever; for the good of them, and of their children after them; and I will make an everlasting covenant with them etc., and I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me. (Jeremiah 32:39-40.)  Then when He shall make an everlasting covenant with them they will set aside these three cities [as cities of refuge]."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,6,Chasidut,"Tanya, Part IV; Iggeret HaKodesh 4:7","Now, concerning the excision of the prepuce itself it is written: “And you shall excise the prepuce of your heart,” i.e., you, by yourselves. But the removal of the thin membrane is a difficult matter for man, and of this it was said that with the coming of the Messiah “the L–rd, your G–d, will circumcise your heart…to love the L–rd your G–d with all your heart and all your soul, for the sake of your life,” (Deuteronomy 30:6. See the commentary of Nachmanides, ad loc.)  i.e., because the L–rd alone is literally your whole life. (This unique interpretation may be better understood by quoting a passage from Kuntres Hahitpaalut, by the author’s son, R. Dov Ber of Lubavitch, where this oft-quoted principle is elucidated: “It is written (Deuteronomy 30:20): ‘to love the L–rd your G–d, for He is your life.’ (The verse uses the masculine term for ‘He’—הוא, translit.: Hu.) It is impossible to explain that ‘for Hu is your life’ refers to ‘to love the L–rd’—i.e., that this love is your life. For if so, it would have to say ‘for היא (translit.: He, the feminine gender, since the Hebrew for love—ahavah—is a feminine word)…. Why then does it say ‘for Hu…’? No doubt that the meaning of this passage is intelligible to all, that is, that ‘for Hu is your life’ is a reason given: why should you love (the L–rd)? Because ‘He is your life.’” (Beginning of Kuntres Hahitpaalut; see also Iggeret Hateshuvah, ch. 9.))  That is why this love (The love spoken of in the verse quoted, which follows after the Divine excision of the heart’s thin membrane.)  stems from the depth of the heart, from the truly innermost point, as mentioned above, and transcends the faculty of daat."

When this person repents, circumcising the foreskin of his heart and creating a hollow in his heart, not only does his heart feel the pain of his sins, but the hearts of all of his offspring are also affected. In particular, the hearts of his spirit-children fall as they realize their situation. Then they suffer and burst out wailing. The best time for a person to repent so that all of his offspring will feel the pangs of repentance is the Hebrew month of Elul, which is the acronym for Et Levavchah Ve-et Levav (“your heart and the heart of [your offspring]”). (Deuteronomy 30:6.)  For the Month of Elul HaShem, my God and God of my fathers, help me soon feel the pain of my sins, which are many and grave. They rise to the heights of Heaven and descend to the deepest depths; they are more massive than the sands of the oceans, more numerous than the dust of the earth and the hairs of my head; and they overcome my soul and breath."
30,6,Quoting Commentary,Mishnah Berurah 581:1,"We are accustomed to getting up at the [concluding night] watch: Since the Holy One, blessed be He, floats through this world at the end of the night, so it is an opportune time. And regarding that which they  are accustomed [to doing so] from Rosh Chodesh (the first day of the month of Elul), it is because Moshe then ascended Mount Sinai to receive the later tablets, and they blasted a shofar in the camp. Moshe ascended to the mountain, such that they not err again after idolatry. So it became an opportune time. And there is a support from the verse (Song of Songs 6:3), ""I am for my Beloved and my Beloved is for me (Ani leDodi veDodi li)"" - the first letters of which [spell] Elul; and the last letters of which come to forty, which corresponds to the forty days from Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur. For during these forty days, repentance is [more readily] accepted, since one's heart is near to his Beloved (God) with repentance; and then his Beloved will be near to them to accept his repentance with love. And there is another support from the verse (Deuteronomy 30:6), ""And the Lord, your God, will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants (et levavkha ve'et lev zaraeikha),"" the first letters of which [spell] Elul. A) From Elul and onwards: But Rosh Chodesh itself, we don't say penitential prayers and supplications. And likewise, those who are accustomed to say Psalms all of Elul, together with the [prayer], ""May it be [His] will"" - they should not begin on Rosh Chodesh (Pri Meggadim). "
30,6,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 30:6,"The Lord your God will remove the obstruction from your heart and the heart of your descendants. He will remove the layers of insensitivity that obstruct your heart (see 10:16). God will influence your newly revealed heart to love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, for the sake of your life. You will no longer consider your service of God as a mere obligation; rather, it will be the very meaning of your life."

30,6,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Nitzavim 13","“You return to the Lord your God … with all your soul. Then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes” [30:2–3]. This verse teaches us that the Messiah does not come until all the souls have been created. There is a treasury in heaven and all the souls are there from the six days of creation. Therefore, the verse says here, when all the souls that have been created will come before the Holy One. At that time the Messiah will come to redeem us from all the ends of the earth where we have been dispersed. The Holy One will remove all the stopped up hearts, as the verse says, “the Lord your God will circumscribe your heart” [30:6]. The evil inclination will be removed in the days of the Messiah, and even the nations of the world will keep the Torah. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 30:2–3.) "

And the sages said (Sanhedrin 97b), ""The spirit of those that calculate the end should blow up."" And [from this principle is] that he believes that [the Messiah] will have great advantage and stature and honor above all of the kings that ever were; according to that which all of the prophets prophesied about him; from Moshe, our teacher, - peace be upon him - to Malachi, peace be upon him. And one who doubts him or for whom his stature is diminished denies the Torah, as the Torah testifies about him in Parashat Bilaam and in Parashat Atem Netsavim. And included in this principle is that there should not be a king in Israel except from the House of David alone.

30,6,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol II, Part II, Chapter XI Circumcision 29","Of particular moment is a later responsum authored by Rabbi Breisch, Helkat Ya'akov, III, no. 36, in which Rabbi Breisch suggests that circumcision may be performed on the eighth day in a manner which will leave sufficient foreskin for subsequent plastic surgery. The mizvah of milah requires that circumcision be performed in a manner which exposes the entire glans including the corona or crown. Hokhmat Adam, Binat Adam, klal 149, and Hamudei Daniel, cited by Pitḥei Teshuvah, Yoreh De'ah 264:13, rule that the foreskin covering this area must be entirely removed by excision. This is also the opinion of R. Judah Asad, Teshuvot Maharya, no. 250; Teshuvot Yeshu'ot Malko, Yoreh De'ah, no. 42; and R. Abraham Dov Kahana-Shapiro, Dvar Avraham, I, no. 27, sec. 2.

R. Mordecai Jaffe, Teshuvot Maharam Yafo, no. 12, discusses both possibilities and states that he is unable to resolve the question definitively. The question hinges primarily upon the meaning of the Hebrew word ""yimol—he shall circumcise"" (Lev. 12:3), i.e., whether the word means ""he shall cut"" or whether its connotation is ""he shall remove"" as is the apparent meaning of the term in Deut. 10:16 and Deut. 30:6."

30,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 33:1:6,"Man's life is lived on two planes. He lives privately within the circle of his family, and he lives as a member of society, and must interact with such society in greater or lesser measure. The good he does must be divided then between the good he does within the family circle, and the good he does by contributing to the well being of the community he lives in. He will receive rewards for both his good deeds within the family circle and for the good deeds performed as part of society. To the extent that the good performed as part of society benefits everyone in that society equally, the reward can be collective. Since every member of that society benefitted equally by the input of good, so the reward is the kind that lets everyone benefit equally. Output is commensurate with input. The promise of the Jewish people living together in security, enjoying economic prosperity etc., is a reward for such good deeds performed by dint of being part of a certain society. It is a reward for the physical part of man, but it is allocated on a collective basis. Reward for the spiritual part of the input of everyone involved, is based on the degree of dedication that each person's contribution represents. It is in the nature of things that every individual brings a different degree of kavanah, intent, dedication to the performance of his mitzvoth. That is why our sages say that in the world to come everyone will occupy a level of his own. Since there are many commandments which can be fulfilled only collectively, the building of the temple for instance, the reward for such mitzvot, spiritual though it may be, will be collective. The time for receiving a reward for such mitzvot performed collectively, but not because such mitzvot benefit society (called by our sages yishuv ha-olam), is in the post-messianic era, but on this earth when ideal conditions for physical life will exist. In all cases however, the reward for the degree of the spiritual input by each individual into each mitzvah, regardless if it is of the kind that can only be fulfilled collectively or if it is fulfilled individually, is in olam haba. "
30,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 13:1:5,"If one considers, as the Rambam does, for instance, that man is a microcosm compared to the universe, the macrocosm, and that the six days of creation symbolize the six thousand years of human existence on earth followed by one thousand years of transformation pending the advent of the messianic age, one may also see some significance in the seventy years allotted to man on this earth. If the first two thousand years of mankind's history are considered tohu, chaos, a period in which man was subject to juvenile errors, mistakes etc. and that this was why there was a need for a deluge after about sixteen hundred years, then in the life of individuals also, the juvenile years are the underlying cause of sinfulness. G-d’s resolve not to bring another deluge was due to recognition of this factor. Immaturity as a cause of sin is prevalent both in the species and in the individuals. If our sages describe the yetzer hara, evil urge as appearing in seven different guises, they refer to manifestations of the evil urge in seven different forms during seven different decades of man's life. Since with advancing age the evil urge within us weakens, his name changes also. The name ra refers to the way it manifests itself during the first ten years of our lives. At that time, we do not possess within us a force that compensates for the evil urge, something all of us have been born with. A youth's activities are largely dictated by the very immaturity of the victim of this ""evil."" Moses called the evil urge arel, the uncircumcised one; David referred to ist as tamey, impure. Solomon called it the soneh, the ""hater."" Isaiah called it michshol, hindrance, obstruction. Ezekiel called it tzefoni, the viper. If one were to subscribe to the theory that life has existed since time immemorial, that the universe existed prior to G-d, we would face the problem of how to account for the sudden depravity of man after millions of years of uninterrupted forward development. According to the theory of Solomon in Kohelet, the concept of kadmut ha-olam, the universe preceding G-d, pyramidical development of the human race is impossible; all there could be would be a never ending repetitious cycle of happenings. Clearly, according to such thinking, the very term ""development"" would be a misnomer. This is what Solomon means when he keeps talking about ""what has been is what will be."" "
30,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 37:1:4,"Since human life is precious, harmful substances must be shunned, and even merely potentially dangerous agents must be avoided. This is best illustrated in the laws governing the Nazirite, the self-appointed ascetic who must not only abstain from wine, but also from grapes, vineyards, and anything even remotely connected with the fruit of the vine. If this is so in the case of a Nazirite, who had imposed strictures upon himself that the Torah had not even demanded of him, how much more must this concept apply to products expressly forbidden by the Torah? The more serious the nature of the prohibition, the more stringent the cordon sanitaire around such a prohibition to insure that the actual prohibition would not be violated. Since the Torah takes a very grave view of immorality, our sages even discouraged idle conversation with one's own wife. Concerning bloodshed, another cardinal sin, our sages compare the infliction of a public insult as equivalent to the sin of bloodshed, and thereby hope to forestall even more serious expressions of one's hatred toward one's fellow man. The same principle applies to the most serious of all transgressions, the sin of worshipping idols. All other sins, especially if committed while one is under the influence of one's basic urges, can be atoned for by repentance relatively easily. After David had confessed his guilt, the prophet Nathan while remonstrating with David, whose apparent crimes included bloodshed and immorality, was able to say to David, ""G-d has removed your sin from you, you will not die"" (Samuel II 12,13). This is possible when the sinner had all along retained his faith in G-d. This is also what the prophet foretells concerning a future when man's knowledge of G-d will no longer be beset by doubts, ""And he that stumbles on that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be like a divine being, as the angel of the Lord before them"" (Zecharyah 12,8). In those days sin will not be due to lack of faith, but will be due only to the weakness of the flesh. Therefore, it can be expiated for at once, and the sinner, after his repentance, can be described as ""an angel of the Lord."" Nowadays, however, if someone knowingly commits idolatry, how could such a person obtain forgiveness? He would be subject to severance from his people, a penalty corresponding to the nature of his sin. Who could save him? Therefore the Torah includes laws which in themselves represent deterrents to the sin of idol-worship. The most common form of idol-worship is the adulation of heavenly objects such as the sun, the moon, and the stars. These bodies have lured people away from monotheism since time immemorial, and the Torah therefore does not tire of exhorting us ""that you may not raise your eyes heavenward and be led astray to worship"" (Deut. 4,19). There are many similar quotations, too many to list. All the prophets strove to wean the Jewish people away from these tendencies, and to prove to them that all these heavenly objects are merely tools which G-d uses in His wisdom to guide the progress of the universe. Jeremiah spends a whole chapter discussing this, employing even the chaldaic language to make sure that he would reach the whole nation, including those not fluent in Hebrew (Jeremiah 10). "
30,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 66:1:6,"Reflecting the high standard of Israel, the opening Midrash described the disease as epilepsy, a temporary affliction, of brief duration. The remedy quoted, the kami-a, amulet, is considered spiritual in nature, not something organic, (in Talmudic and Midrashic parlance) This suggests that the aberration had been brief, subject to prompt correction by proper spiritual orientation. Angels achieve their shleymut, perfection, by means of a single expression, i.e. experience. (Daniel 4,14), whereas man requires two expressions, i.e. experiences. The first was ""let Us make man in Our image,"" at the time man was being created. The second expression, a further stage leading to complete perfection was the revelation at Mount Sinai. Hopefully, the two experiences between them will achieve mankind's refinement, and convert our potential into the actual achievement of the finest our species is capable of. "
30,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 23:1:10,"(1) Since only Isaac and his descendants are called Abraham's seed par excellence, the Torah sees fit to restate Isaac's ancestry, stressing that it did not go back further than to Abraham. Anyone prior to Abraham could not claim a share in Isaac as his descendant. In Jewish law, we have the principle that upon conversion to Judaism, a proselyte's family ties are severed, he ceases to have legal family ties, and is considered like a totally new creature. Abraham having become the first Jew, his children's ancestry was rooted in him and in him only. (2) Isaac married at forty, having attained the mental maturity to found a family, as discussed in Chapter 22. Bethuel was called an Arami since he was deceitful, as implied by that word. For that reason, the two have to be mentioned separately. (3) Rebecca had no hope to have children until Isaac's prayer had been answered, otherwise we might have attributed her pregnancy to the blessing that had been given her by her brother Laban prior to her departure from home (Bereshit Rabbah 63). The meaning of the verse ""the Arami was about to cause my father's destruction"" (Deut.26,5) could be ""the latent traits of deceit and treachery inherited from Laban almost led to my destruction."" Isaac's prayer was solely for the benefit of Rebecca, since he as an olah temimah, a flawless offering, and could not have served as such if he had been physically blemished. The word lenochach used to describe Isaac's stance during prayer, means that he concentrated on a single objective. A similar use of that word occurs in Proverbs 4,25-27. (4) Perhaps the reason that we are told that Isaac loved Esau who brought venison to him is to point out that Rebecca possessed enough independence of spirit to love Jacob, whose behavior warranted this, and in whose character she could see the promise of the prophecy that had been revealed to her prior to the birth of the twins that in time the older one would become subservient to the younger one (Genesis 25,23). (5) Jacob's holding on to the heel of Esau may symbolize that values which Esau would stamp his foot on would be the very ones Jacob would cherish. "
30,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 14:1:21,"Rabbi Yitzchak proceeds to illustrate that the phenomenon we call eyesight, vision, at certain times and at certain angles, creates an image which, while known to us empirically, defies our ability to analyze and explain its cause. It therefore ranks with those phenomena which were created after sunset but before nightfall of the sixth day of creation (Avot 5,6). Scientists have concluded that the appearance of the rainbow after a downpour signifies immediate dispersal of rainclouds, clearing skies. This would be in line with the significance of the rainbow as described in the Torah. It also demonstrates that the concentration of disastrous rain was limited to a section of the earth, not its entire surface. Similarly, a rainbow over a relatively clear area of sky would signal approaching rainfall in other areas of the globe. (6) The whole ot brit, sign of the covenant would correspond to the moral lessons absorbed during the great flood. This in turn would make it unlikely that all of mankind would once more deserve terminal punishment at the same time. It is therefore the very naturalness of the rainbow's appearance that will recall to G-d the changed nature of man on earth. The Talmud in Ketuvot 77 states that in the generation of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi no rainbow was ever seen. This was due to two causes. 1) Reminders to G-d were not necessary, due to the righteousness of the leaders of that generation, a fact which was brought home to the people of that era by the absence of rainbows and the continued existence of the earth in spite of such absence. 2) Since the normal appearance of the phenomenon signifies rainfall due to G-d’s general Providence, in the generation of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi people were under G-d’s particular Providence, the proof of which was the absence of the rainbow. Rainfall in those days occurred simultaneously all over the earth at times which did not conflict with normal human outdoor activities. The verse in Isaiah 54,10 quoted earlier about no more deluges in the future does not constitute a promise which negates the attribute of justice, i.e. no undeserved preferential treatment was promised, rather it is a reference to the changed nature of man which makes the need for any future deluge obsolete. In the fullness of time and in accordance with prophetic visions, in the messianic age, all desire to deviate from the ways of the Lord will cease, and man observing G-d’s will in full will become a natural phenomenon at all times. This is what the Talmud (Shabbat 151) has in mind when it interprets ""the days when I have no more desire"" (Kohelet 12,1) as referring to the messianic age. One may then view the perfect state of man as something that existed or will exist at three distinct points in time. 1) At creation; at that time man was perfect, but that perfection was of an extremely fragile nature. 2) Immediately after the deluge, at that time, perfection was due to the personal experience that perfection was the only way to avoid disaster recurring. 3) In messianic times, when perfection will no longer be so fragile since it is the result of personality growth. "
30,6,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 92:1:11,"""Behold the Heavens, and the Heavens of the Heavens, belong to the Lord, the earth and all there is therein."" (10,14) This points out the difference between G'd and any other deities. Since the latter, not even laying claim to own the universe, cannot inspire ""fear"" as we have defined it, they are also unable to elevate man. G'd, by reason of His ownership of the universe, can claim obedience of all creatures. Should we ask that since He owns it all, what difference can one nation's claim to consideration by G'd make?, the answer given is ""He only took a liking to your ancestors, to love them and their seed after them."" (10,15) Even though the Jewish people are far from perfect, ""like the lily amongst the thorns,"" G'd chose Israel because of its relative merit. By the time you have realised and appreciated the meaning of your national history, says Moses, you will have arrived at the stage of love for G'd. At that point performance of the mitzvot will no longer be an act of obedience, but an expression of your love for G'd the Lawgiver. Reviewing the whole chapter, one is forced to conclude that far from making impossible demands upon us, G'd is in fact granting us privileges. The etnachta, tone sign under the words ""from you"" in verse twelve, as well as under the word ""today"" in verse thirteen, supports our view that the lines between have to be read as if in parenthesis. The verse then reads ""and now Israel what is it that the Lord asks of you this day; in order that you will be well off?..except to..."" After all that, the passage describing the land of Israel as one that needs rainfall, as distinct from Egypt, is a reminder that even after attaining their reward and successful takeover of the land of Canaan, Divine help will continue to be needed. The land will only deliver its bounty to Israel when such Divine help is forthcoming. The second paragraph of the keriyat shema which follows, spells out the conditions for such Divine help, and the consequences should Israel fail to meet these conditions. "
30,10,Quoting Commentary,Depths of Yonah 3:3:14,"Conclusion However we explain it, Nineveh’s Teshuvah stands as an example of a communal Teshuvah that the Jewish people will perform which will initiate the arrival of Mashiach (Devarim 30:1-10 and Rambam Hilchot Teshuvah 7:5). Nineveh’s one hundred percent participation sets a powerful example for our people, an important message year round but especially as the day of Yom Kippur draws to a close."

30,7,Midrash,Shemot Rabbah 38:4,"Another matter: “This is the matter” – that is what is written: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3). That is what the verse said: “I wash my hands in purity, [and I circle Your altar, Lord], sounding a voice of thanksgiving” (Psalms 26:6–7). Is it, perhaps, to sacrifice bulls and rams? The verse states: “Sounding a voice of thanksgiving.” Because Israel said: Master of the universe, the princes sin, (The reference is to the king; see Leviticus 4:22. )  they bring an offering, and it is atoned for them; the anointed (The reference is to the High Priest; see Leviticus 4:3. )  sins, he brings an offering, and it is atoned for him. We do not have an offering. He said to them: “If the entire congregation of Israel shall err unwittingly.… [they shall bring a young bull as a sin offering]” (Leviticus 4:13–14). They said to Him: We are poor, and we do not have the means to bring offerings. He said to them: I am seeking words, as it is stated: “Take words with you and return to the Lord” (Hosea 14:3), and I will forgive all your sins. “Words” are nothing other than words of Torah, as it is stated: “These are the words that Moses spoke” (Deuteronomy 1:1).  They said to Him: But we do not know. (We do not know Torah. )  He said to them: Weep and pray before Me, and I will accept it. When your ancestors were enslaved in Egypt, was it not through prayer that I redeemed them, as it is stated: “The children of Israel groaned due to the work, and they cried out” (Exodus 2:23)? In the days of Joshua, was it not through prayer that I performed miracles on their behalf, as it is stated: “Joshua rent his garments” (Joshua 7:6)? What did I say to him: “Extend the javelin” (Joshua 8:18). (Immediately, the city of Ai fell before them.)  In the days of the Judges, through weeping I heard their cry, as it is stated: “It was when the children of Israel cried to the Lord” (Judges 6:7). In the days of Samuel, was it not through prayer that I heard them, as it is stated: “Samuel called out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord answered him (I Samuel 7:9)? Likewise, the people of Jerusalem, even though they angered Me, because they wept, I had mercy on them, as it is stated: “For so said the Lord: Sing with joy for Jacob, and exult.… [they will come with weeping and supplications] (Jeremiah 31:6–8). That is, I ask of you neither sacrifices nor offerings, but rather, words, as it is stated: “Take words with you and return to the Lord” (Hosea 14:3). That is why David said: “I wash my hands in purity” (Psalms 26:6). He does not say: “To sacrifice to you” but rather, “sounding a voice of thanksgiving” (Psalms 26:7), that I thank you for the words of Torah.  Another matter: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3) – Moses said: “The abode of the God of eternity” (Deuteronomy 33:27), this is Israel, as by their merit the world was created and upon them the world stands. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] says: “He drove the enemy away from before you” (Deuteronomy 33:27) – this is Haman, as it is stated: “[Esther said:] A man who is an adversary and an enemy, [this evil Haman]” (Esther 7:6). Why “an adversary and an enemy”? An adversary [to God] above and an enemy [to Israel] below; an adversary to the fathers and an enemy to the children; (Haman descended from Amalek, an old enemy of Israel. )  an adversary to me and an enemy to you. (The phrase in the verse was spoken by Esther to Aḥashverosh. The midrash is asserting that she said that Haman was not just her enemy, he was an enemy to Aḥashverosh as well. )  “And He said: Destroy” (Deuteronomy 33:27) – these are his sons. (God said that Haman’s sons would be destroyed. )  “Israel dwelled securely, alone is the spring [ein] of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:28) – ein is nothing other than prophecy, as it is stated: “For the Lord poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep and He closed your eyes [eineikhem]; [He covered the prophets]” (Isaiah 29:10).  Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said: Great is [God’s] love of Israel, as the Holy One blessed be He changes the law of nature for their benefit, as He rains manna for them from the heavens and causes dew to rise for them from the ground, as it is stated: “The layer of dew lifted” (Exodus 16:14), and likewise, “His heavens drip dew” (Deuteronomy 33:28). (Manna fell from heaven, whereas generally food is grown from the ground. Dew, which was viewed as naturally falling from heaven, came from the ground in addition to coming from heaven. )  When Moses saw the reward given to the righteous, he said to them: “Happy are you, Israel; who is like you, a people saved by the Lord” (Deuteronomy 33:29), people who are served by the Holy One blessed be He. “The shield [magen] of your assistance” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – corresponding to Abraham, as it is stated: “Who delivered [migen] your adversaries into your hand” (Genesis 14:20). “And who is the sword of your honor” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – corresponding to Isaac, who extended his neck to the sword. “Your enemies will seek to deceive you” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – corresponding to Jacob, as it is stated: “And went to a land, due to his brother Jacob” (Genesis 36:6). (Esau feared Jacob, but claimed that he left because the land was not large enough for the two of them.)  “And you will tread on their high places” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – in the days of Mordekhai, as it is stated: “Haman took the garments and the horse” (Esther 6:11). (Haman took the royal horse and led Mordekhai on a celebratory procession. The Sages relate that in order for Mordekhai to get onto the horse, Haman bent over and Mordekhai stepped on him (see Megilla 16a; Esther Rabba 10:4). )   What caused Mordekhai to achieve this greatness? Say it is because he would constantly pray, as it is stated: “Mordekhai knew everything that was done […and cried a loud and bitter cry]” (Esther 4:1). Even after he saw himself achieve prominence, he never became haughty and never ceased from prayer, but rather, “Mordekhai returned” (Esther 6:12), just as he was initially. (Even after being paraded around in the king’s garment on the king’s horse, Mordekhai returned to his former position at the king’s gate. He did not grow haughty from the experience. )  “The Lord your God will place all these curses” (Deuteronomy 30:7), not on you, but “on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who pursued you” (Deuteronomy 30:7). And will you cease from prayer? No, but rather, what is written thereafter: “You will return and heed the voice of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 30:8), just as Mordekhai did, as it is stated: “Mordekhai returned to the king’s gate” (Esther 6:12), as he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting. That is why it is stated: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3). Here, too, it says: “This is the matter,” because the Holy One blessed be He acceded to Aaron only through prayer, as it is stated: “The Lord was incensed with Aaron to destroy him, [and I prayed on behalf of Aaron, as well, at that time]” (Deuteronomy 9:20)."
30,7,Midrash,Eikhah Rabbah 3:22,"“Pay them retribution, Lord, according to their handiwork” (Lamentations 3:64). “Pay them retribution” – Jeremiah said: “Pay them retribution.” Asaf said: “Pay our neighbors retribution sevenfold to their bosom [ḥeikam]” (Psalms 79:12). What is “to their bosom [ḥeikam]”? Rabbi Yehuda ben Gadya said: Pay them retribution for what they did to the Temple that is situated in the foundation [ḥeiko] of the world, just as it says: “From the foundation in the ground to the [lower] ledge” (Ezekiel 43:14). The Rabbis say: What they did regarding circumcision, which is positioned in man’s bosom, (The meaning here is that it is in the center of his body.)  as Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin and Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: They (The Amalekites would do this to the Israelites when they departed from Egypt.)  would take the circumcised organs of the Israelites and cast them upward, saying: This You chose; here is what You chose! Until Samuel arose and exacted retribution from them. That is what is written: “Samuel said: ""Bring me Agag, king of Amalek” (I Samuel 15:32), and it is written: “Samuel slashed Agag…” (I Samuel 15:33). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: He began chopping his flesh into numerous pieces and fed it to the ostriches. That is what is written: “It will consume the branches of his skin” (Job 18:13). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He brought four posts and stretched him upon them. “Agag said: Indeed, the bitterness of death is at hand [sar]” (I Samuel 15:32). Is this the way one kills princes, with bitter deaths? Rabbi Yitzḥak said: He castrated him, because he would take the circumcised organs and cast them upward. For this, retribution was exacted from him. That is what is written: “Samuel said: Just as your sword made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women” (I Samuel 15:33). “He slashed” – it teaches that he sliced him into four pieces. “May you give them hardness of heart, Your curse upon them” (Lamentations 3:65). “May you give them hardness of [meginat] heart” – two amora’im: One said: Heartbreak, and one said: Strength of heart. (The amora’im discussed the true meaning of the term meginat. One said it means heartbreak due to suffering. The other said it means strength of heart to endure a lot of suffering without dying.)  The one who said heartbreak, it is as it is stated: “Who delivered [migen] your enemies into your hand” (Genesis 14:20). (Just as the term migen here indicates that the enemies were broken, the word meginat regarding the heart means heartbreak.)  The one who said: Strength of heart, as it is written: “The shield [magen] of your protection” (Deuteronomy 33:29). “Your curse [taalatekha] upon them” – suspend [teli] them (Suspend them between life and death.)  in suffering. Bring upon them all the curses [alot] in the Torah, just as it says: “The Lord your God will place all these curses [alot] on your enemies, and on those who hate you…” (Deuteronomy 30:7)."

30,7,Quoting Commentary,Haamek Davar on Genesis 24:60:2,"2. ""And your descendants will inherit the gate of their enemies (those who hate them)."" This is a bracha that they (the descendants) will be wise men, seated at the gate (ie, a place of public prominence). Even in the gates of their enemies (those who hate them [Hebrew root Sin-Nun-Aleph]) there will be people who seek out their wisdom and advice. Earlier on in the story of the Akeida (the Binding of Isaac) there was a similar blessing ""ויירש זרעך את שער אויביו"" ""and your descendants will inherit the gates of their enemies (those who would seek to do them harm [Hebrew root Aleph-Vav-Yud-Bet])."" See Bereishit 22:17, and see Haamek Davar ad loc. In that case, the Holy One Blessed Be He who knows the thoughts [of the ""enemies""] described them with the root Aleph-Vav-Yud-Bet [rather than Sin-Nun-Aleph] which describes a feeling in their hearts. But a hater enemy [Sin-Nun-Aleph] implies action as well, as in Devarim 30:7 ""upon your enemies [root Sin-Nun-Aleph] who chase after you."" And people do not appreciate the wonder this is that even those who actively hate us will need the wisdom of Israel."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,7,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:7:1","על אויביך ועל שונאיך, “against your enemies and those who hate you.” The former are the Ishmaelites, Arabs; the latter refer to the descendants of Esau. The prophet Micah (Micah 5,8) speaks of “your hand shall prevail over your foes, and all your enemies shall be cut down.” This is a reference to the two nations to which we are enslaved and amongst which we are scattered. This is why the sages in Baba Batra 73 refer to two geese in a story related by Rabbi Bar bar Chana. The story goes as follows: “I once walked in the desert and we saw these two geese which lost their feathers due to their excessive obesity. I extracted a continuous thin line of honey from them. I said to them: “are we going to have a share in the world to come?” One of them lifted its body, whereas the other lifted its flank.” When Rabbi Bar bar Chana came to Rabbi Eleazar (and told him of his experience) the Rabbi said to him that the meaning is that in the future the Jewish people will have to render an accounting. Thus far the Talmud. [The fact is that the entire story does not appear in our editions of the Talmud. Rabbi Chavell claims he has found it in a similar form in Agadot haTalmud. Ed.]  The meaning of the whole story is that the sage (Rabbi Bar bar Chana) saw in his mind, while in an isolated part of the world, i.e. the desert, that these two Empires, that of the Mohammedans and that of the Romans, attained tremendous power in this world. This was symbolized by the obesity of the geese. When the Rabbi asked them: “are we not going to have a share in your prosperity in the future?,” the meaning of the words: “one of them lifted its wings” is a reference to Ishmael This was a symbol that the Ishmaelites will flee to us in the future and take refuge under the wings of the Shechinah. They will give us their beasts to use as sacrifices to the Lord on their behalf. This is the meaning of Isaiah 60,7: “all the flocks of Kedar shall be assembled for you (the Jewish people); the rams of Nevayot shall serve your needs.” This indicates that these Ishmaelites will convert to Judaism. It also is an allusion to the fact that they will wear phylacteries, seeing the phylacteries have been compared to wings (Shabbat 49). Concerning the other goose which raised its rump, this is a reference to Edom, whose protective angel had dislocated Yaakov’s hip joint in the nocturnal encounter described in Genesis 32,26. It is also an allusion to the commandment of circumcision, i.e. that in the time under discussion these people would convert and circumcise themselves. There is no need to add that at that time political and moral sovereignty will be restored to the Jewish people. This is the symbolism portrayed by the fatness of these two geese and the honey which dripped from them. As to the words of Rabbi Eleazar that the Israelites would be called upon to give an accounting at that time, the meaning is that they will have to give an accounting for not having become penitents during all the preceding years, and have tarried so long before living as true Jews. The reason the term אויב is applied to the Roman Empire, whereas the term שונא is applied to the Islamic Empire, is that the former is a term describing fiercer hatred and animosity than the word שונא. אויב is an enemy who is full of hatred in his heart, knows no mercy. A שונא, on the other hand, though he too inflicts hurt and death, tempers it with a degree of mercy. Proof of this found in Isaiah 47,6: ”but you showed them no mercy. Even upon the aged you made your yoke exceedingly heavy.” [actually in that chapter the prophet speaks of the cruelty of the Babylonians, not the Ishmaelites. Ed.] The very etymology of the word אויב, reflects that it refers to unrelenting hatred; it is derived from אבוי, a word which has the same letters as אויב, and means “woe.” The reason that the Torah mentions אויביך before speaking of שונאיך, [when we would have expected the Torah to describe matters in an ascending order, Ed.] is that it wanted to link the שונאיך to the pursuit, i.e. אשר רדפוך, “who have pursued you.” This nation has traditionally uprooted our exiles wherever their rule extended. The reason they are referred to by the term שונא, “someone who hates,” is that G’d Himself describes His relationship with Esau with the words: “I have hated Esau,” (Maleachi 1,3). Midrash Mishley confirms this when explaining the words (Proverbs 30,23) “because of the loathsome woman when she becomes married.” The “loathsome, hateful one,” is understood to be a reference to Esau. The verse from Scripture cited as proof is also the one from Malachi I,3. The final words in that verse in Proverbs, i.e. ושפכה כי תירש גברתה, “and when a slave-woman inherits her mistress” (another phenomenon confounding Solomon who describes such phenomena as intolerable), is a reference to Ishmael, seeing his mother Hagar was the slave-woman of Sarah.) Seeing that the attitude of the Ishmaelites towards the Jews is more hostile than that of the Edomites, the Torah describes them as “your enemies.” This is confirmed by the popular saying: “rather under the Edomites than under the Ishmaelites.” [The idea is that if Jews have a chance which exile to choose they would invariably prefer to live under the yoke of the former. Ed.] G’d, when describing for how long He will hold generations responsible for the deeds of their forefathers, says ועל רבעים לשאוני, “and to the fourth generation concerning those who qualify for the term שונאי, “those who hate Me” (Exodus 20,5).  Concerning G’d’s אויביו, “His enemies,” however, we read in Psalms 37,20: ואויבי ה' כיקר כרים כלו בעשן כלו, “and the enemies of the Lord shall be consumed like meadow grass consumed in smoke.” The verse teaches that nothing at all will remain of these “enemies.” This is why they are compared to the fat of the fat sheep which goes up completely in smoke (on the altar). Solomon refers to both of these nations as “two daughters,” mentioning that both are destined for Gehinom, hell. This is what he meant when he wrote in Proverbs 30,15 that “the leech has two daughters, ‘give give’!;” He compared Gehinom, the place where judgment is meted out to the souls of the wicked, to a leech which is a blood-sucker. Concerning these two nations the prophet in Isaiah 66,17 wrote: “those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to enter the groves;” the former who sanctify themselves are the Edomites whose habit it is to shake their fingers in different directions. The latter are the Ishmaelites whose habit it is to bathe their hands and feet (to cleanse them) but not their hearts, which is their essence. The prophet in that verse continues אחר אחד בתוך, and alludes to the manner in which the Edomites sanctify themselves in the center of the garden. Alternatively, these last three words may be an allusion to the day of their judgment, a day already appointed for that purpose. One of these nations will be judged on a Friday preceding the onset of the Sabbath, whereas the other will be judged immediately after the Sabbath, the Sabbath remaining “in the center;” when the prophet describes one of these people as “consuming swine,” he refers to the Edomites, whereas the ones described in that same verse as eating reptiles and mice, are the Ishmaelites. The verse concludes by saying: “they will perish together.”"

'If the tarries, wait for him' and do not give him a [set] time and do not create analyses from the verses to extrapolate the time of his coming. And the sages said (Sanhedrin 97b), ""The spirit of those that calculate the end should blow up."" And [from this principle is] that he believes that [the Messiah] will have great advantage and stature and honor above all of the kings that ever were; according to that which all of the prophets prophesied about him; from Moshe, our teacher, - peace be upon him - to Malachi, peace be upon him. And one who doubts him or for whom his stature is diminished denies the Torah, as the Torah testifies about him in Parashat Bilaam and in Parashat Atem Netsavim. And included in this principle is that there should not be a king in Israel except from the House of David alone. And anyone who disputes [the status] of this family, denies the name of God, may He be blessed, and the words of His prophets."

30,7,Halakhah,"Abudarham, Weekday Prayers, Amidah 51","(Translator’s note: The following passage is missing in many manuscripts and printed versions of Abudraham. In recent additions of the work it has now been reinserted See Abudraham Keren Re’em by Rabbi Eliyahu Greentzieg, 2015 Volume 1, Page 293) לַמְּשׁוּמָּדִים אַל־תְּהִי תִקְוָה “For apostates, let there be no hope,” (Note the version of this blessing in the Amida that is recited today is different from the one in “Abudraham’s version of the Amida. The Ashkenazic and Sephardic tradition begins with וְלַמַּלְשִׁינִים אַל תְּהִי תִקְוָה and there are a variety of the Eidot HaMizrach version beginning לַמִּינִים וְלַמַּלְשִׁינִים אַל־תְּהִי תִקְוָה.  See note in Sefaria, JT Berachot 4:3: ”The benediction has been changed in Christian surroundings beyond recognition. The text of Jabneh must have been close to today’s Yemenite version: למשומדים אל תהי תקוה, כל המינים והמוסרים כרגע יאבדו ומלכות זדון תעקור ותשבור מהרה בימינו. ברוך אתה יי֨ שובר אויבים ומכניע זדים.” Apparently the version Abudraham was also similar to this version.)  is based on, “Hope of Israel, Adonai!” (Jer. 14:8) and on, “So there is hope for the wretched,”  (Job 5:16) It is also written in Scripture, “And there is hope for your future…” (Jer. 31:17) This refers to Israel but for the apostates, there is no hope, for they shall have no hope in this world or in the world to come since they will be condemned to Gehenom forever, as is stated, “For You, O God, will bring them down to the nethermost Pit…” (Ps. 55:24)  The word, משומד, apostate, is explained by the Ramban; this is what he writes: “No foreigner shall eat of it,” (Ex 12:43) “Onkelos translate: “There shall no ‘ben neichar’ eat thereof, i.e, any Israelite who has become an apostate,” meaning he has estranged himself from his brethren and from his Heavenly Father through his evil deeds. This is the word neichar, mentioned by the Sages in all places, which means estranged, and the purport thereof is m’shumad, one who is an opponent of Torah. The usage of the word is similar to the Aramaic expression, ‘ve’isht’moda’ (And) Joseph (knew) his brethren, but they ‘isht’modei’ (knew) him not. (Gen. 42:8) In the case of the word m’shumad, it is missing the letter ayin, just as it is absorbed in many [Aramaic] words: midam (anything) in place of mida’am; dor kati in place of dor katia (a chopped generation)(BT Ketubot 10b), baki in place of b’kia (expert) (BT Sanhedrin 5b).” (For the full Ramban see Ramban on Exodus 12:43)  וכל המינים כְּרֶֽגַע יֹאבֵֽדוּ “And for the heretics, let there be no hope,” is based on “Some die suddenly in the middle of the night.” (Job 34:20) There is the same judgment for the heretics and the apostates, specifically when they do not repent. If they sincerely repent, we receive them in their repentance, for nothing stands in the way of repentance.  וְכָל־אֽוֹיְבֶֽיךָ וְכָל־שֽׂוֹנְאֶֽיךָ “All Your enemies and all Your haters,” is based on, “God will inflict all those curses upon the enemies and foes who persecuted you.” (Deut. 30:7)  מְהֵרָה יִכָּרֵֽתוּ,  “May they quickly be terminated,” this is the language (Apparently the word M’haira is rabbinic. The verse is showing the source of the second word, Yikaraitu.)  of the Talmud, based on, “When HaShem your God has cut down before you the nations…” (Deut. 12:29)  ומלכות זדון “And the arrogant kingdom,” This is the kingdom of Amalek (Rome). In the first chapter of Shavuot, they are called a wicked kingdom. Therefore the sages decreed to curse them evening and morning (and afternoon) since it says in a verse regarding Amalek, “(Moses’ hands grew heavy; so they took a stone and put it under him)... thus his hands remained steady until the sun set.” (Ex. 17:12) Other kingdoms only wage war until the sixth hour of the day but a “wicked kingdom” wages war morning and night. Also Amalek is from the offspring of Esau.  מְהֵרָה תְעַקֵּר “May they be quickly uprooted,” is based on the verse, “In Your fury put an end to them; put an end to them that they be no more,” (Ps. 59:14)  וּתְשַׁבֵּר “And smash,” is based on the verse, “O break the power of the wicked and evil one.” (Ps. 10:15)  וְתַּכְנִ֑יעַ “And subdue,” is based on the verse, “I will subdue all your enemies.” (2 Chr. 17:10) Many people do not say וּתְשַׁבֵּר וְתַכְנִיעֵם but rather only תַּכְנִ֑יעַ. It is proper to say this because one should have the language of the concluding blessing juxtaposed to the final blessing.  בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה', שׁוֹבֵר אוֹיְבִים וּמַכְנִֽיעַ זֵדִ֑ים   “Praised are you who smashes enemies and subsidies the arrogant,” is based on the verse, “You break the teeth of the wicked,” (Ps. 3:8) and “You subdued the heat ...” (Is. 25:5)  And if you wonder, how can we mention cursing the heretics and apostates in our prayers? Do we not say in the first chapter of Berachot regarding a heretic who troubled Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, “it is not proper to curse people, even if they are wicked.” ‘To punish the innocent is surely not right,’” (BT Berachot 7a A certain heretic who was in Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s neighborhood would upset him by incessantly challenging the legitimacy of verses. One day, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi took a rooster and placed it between the legs of the bed upon which he sat and looked at it. He thought: When the moment of God’s anger arrives, I will curse him and be rid of him. When the moment of God’s anger arrived, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi slept. When he woke up, he said to himself: Conclude from the fact that I nodded off that it is not proper conduct to do so, to curse people, even if they are wicked. “His mercy is over all His creations.’ (Psalms 145:9) is stated even with regard to sinners.)   (Pr. 17:25) Even if he is a sectarian? What is the reason? Scripture states, “God’s mercy is upon all of his creations,” (Ps. 145:9) One might answer that this only refers to curses that result in complete destruction, (or that are against a whole community). Or else, it may be because causing trouble is not grounds (for cursing one’s enemies) as the Talmud says there. Here, however, in our prayers, we do so for the honor of God because he denies God."

This period will be ushered in by the arrival of the Messiah after the hostile nations have been eliminated. Moses contrasts what will happen to those nations and what will happen to the Jewish people at that time. G’d will never exile you again. All this has been spelled out by Jeremiah 4,1 when he said:אם תשוב ישראל....אלי תשוב....ולא תנוד, “if you return Israel….return to Me, and you do not waver, …nations shall bless themselves by you, etc.”"

30,8,Midrash,Shemot Rabbah 38:4,"Another matter: “This is the matter” – that is what is written: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3). That is what the verse said: “I wash my hands in purity, [and I circle Your altar, Lord], sounding a voice of thanksgiving” (Psalms 26:6–7). Is it, perhaps, to sacrifice bulls and rams? The verse states: “Sounding a voice of thanksgiving.” Because Israel said: Master of the universe, the princes sin, (The reference is to the king; see Leviticus 4:22. )  they bring an offering, and it is atoned for them; the anointed (The reference is to the High Priest; see Leviticus 4:3. )  sins, he brings an offering, and it is atoned for him. We do not have an offering. He said to them: “If the entire congregation of Israel shall err unwittingly.… [they shall bring a young bull as a sin offering]” (Leviticus 4:13–14). They said to Him: We are poor, and we do not have the means to bring offerings. He said to them: I am seeking words, as it is stated: “Take words with you and return to the Lord” (Hosea 14:3), and I will forgive all your sins. “Words” are nothing other than words of Torah, as it is stated: “These are the words that Moses spoke” (Deuteronomy 1:1).  They said to Him: But we do not know. (We do not know Torah. )  He said to them: Weep and pray before Me, and I will accept it. When your ancestors were enslaved in Egypt, was it not through prayer that I redeemed them, as it is stated: “The children of Israel groaned due to the work, and they cried out” (Exodus 2:23)? In the days of Joshua, was it not through prayer that I performed miracles on their behalf, as it is stated: “Joshua rent his garments” (Joshua 7:6)? What did I say to him: “Extend the javelin” (Joshua 8:18). (Immediately, the city of Ai fell before them.)  In the days of the Judges, through weeping I heard their cry, as it is stated: “It was when the children of Israel cried to the Lord” (Judges 6:7). In the days of Samuel, was it not through prayer that I heard them, as it is stated: “Samuel called out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord answered him (I Samuel 7:9)? Likewise, the people of Jerusalem, even though they angered Me, because they wept, I had mercy on them, as it is stated: “For so said the Lord: Sing with joy for Jacob, and exult.… [they will come with weeping and supplications] (Jeremiah 31:6–8). That is, I ask of you neither sacrifices nor offerings, but rather, words, as it is stated: “Take words with you and return to the Lord” (Hosea 14:3). That is why David said: “I wash my hands in purity” (Psalms 26:6). He does not say: “To sacrifice to you” but rather, “sounding a voice of thanksgiving” (Psalms 26:7), that I thank you for the words of Torah.  Another matter: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3) – Moses said: “The abode of the God of eternity” (Deuteronomy 33:27), this is Israel, as by their merit the world was created and upon them the world stands. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] says: “He drove the enemy away from before you” (Deuteronomy 33:27) – this is Haman, as it is stated: “[Esther said:] A man who is an adversary and an enemy, [this evil Haman]” (Esther 7:6). Why “an adversary and an enemy”? An adversary [to God] above and an enemy [to Israel] below; an adversary to the fathers and an enemy to the children; (Haman descended from Amalek, an old enemy of Israel. )  an adversary to me and an enemy to you. (The phrase in the verse was spoken by Esther to Aḥashverosh. The midrash is asserting that she said that Haman was not just her enemy, he was an enemy to Aḥashverosh as well. )  “And He said: Destroy” (Deuteronomy 33:27) – these are his sons. (God said that Haman’s sons would be destroyed. )  “Israel dwelled securely, alone is the spring [ein] of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:28) – ein is nothing other than prophecy, as it is stated: “For the Lord poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep and He closed your eyes [eineikhem]; [He covered the prophets]” (Isaiah 29:10).  Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said: Great is [God’s] love of Israel, as the Holy One blessed be He changes the law of nature for their benefit, as He rains manna for them from the heavens and causes dew to rise for them from the ground, as it is stated: “The layer of dew lifted” (Exodus 16:14), and likewise, “His heavens drip dew” (Deuteronomy 33:28). (Manna fell from heaven, whereas generally food is grown from the ground. Dew, which was viewed as naturally falling from heaven, came from the ground in addition to coming from heaven. )  When Moses saw the reward given to the righteous, he said to them: “Happy are you, Israel; who is like you, a people saved by the Lord” (Deuteronomy 33:29), people who are served by the Holy One blessed be He. “The shield [magen] of your assistance” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – corresponding to Abraham, as it is stated: “Who delivered [migen] your adversaries into your hand” (Genesis 14:20). “And who is the sword of your honor” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – corresponding to Isaac, who extended his neck to the sword. “Your enemies will seek to deceive you” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – corresponding to Jacob, as it is stated: “And went to a land, due to his brother Jacob” (Genesis 36:6). (Esau feared Jacob, but claimed that he left because the land was not large enough for the two of them.)  “And you will tread on their high places” (Deuteronomy 33:29) – in the days of Mordekhai, as it is stated: “Haman took the garments and the horse” (Esther 6:11). (Haman took the royal horse and led Mordekhai on a celebratory procession. The Sages relate that in order for Mordekhai to get onto the horse, Haman bent over and Mordekhai stepped on him (see Megilla 16a; Esther Rabba 10:4). )   What caused Mordekhai to achieve this greatness? Say it is because he would constantly pray, as it is stated: “Mordekhai knew everything that was done […and cried a loud and bitter cry]” (Esther 4:1). Even after he saw himself achieve prominence, he never became haughty and never ceased from prayer, but rather, “Mordekhai returned” (Esther 6:12), just as he was initially. (Even after being paraded around in the king’s garment on the king’s horse, Mordekhai returned to his former position at the king’s gate. He did not grow haughty from the experience. )  “The Lord your God will place all these curses” (Deuteronomy 30:7), not on you, but “on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who pursued you” (Deuteronomy 30:7). And will you cease from prayer? No, but rather, what is written thereafter: “You will return and heed the voice of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 30:8), just as Mordekhai did, as it is stated: “Mordekhai returned to the king’s gate” (Esther 6:12), as he returned to his sackcloth and his fasting. That is why it is stated: “Take words with you” (Hosea 14:3). Here, too, it says: “This is the matter,” because the Holy One blessed be He acceded to Aaron only through prayer, as it is stated: “The Lord was incensed with Aaron to destroy him, [and I prayed on behalf of Aaron, as well, at that time]” (Deuteronomy 9:20)."
30,8,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:8:1","ועשית את כל מצותיו אשר אנכי מצוך היום, “and you will carry out all His commandments which I command to you this day.” After having spoken about Israel’s repentance, and their return to the Holy Land, the Torah now speaks of the commandments being commanded “this day;” we find a similar formulation already in verse 2 of our chapter where the repentance had also been featured. All of this is to focus on the fact that the essence of repentance is to accept the Torah as governing our lives. This is why whenever repentance is mentioned the reference to the commandments of the Torah is appended. The prophet Jeremiah employs a similar style when he writes (Jeremiah 2,17) “is this not what has happened to you for forsaking the Lord your G’d at the time He led you on the way?” “The way” is the path of Torah. This was the path which earlier generations of Jews observed and their lives were successful."
30,8,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Vessels of the Sanctuary and Those Who Serve Therein 3:1","The descendants of Levi were singled out for service in the Sanctuary, as [Deuteronomy 10:8] states: ""At that time, God separated the tribe of Levi."" (See also Hilchot Shemitah VeYovel 13:12 which states: Why did the Levites not receive a portion in the inheritance of Eretz Yisrael and in the spoils of war like their brethren? Because they were set aside to serve God and minister unto Him and to instruct people at large in His just paths and righteous judgments, as [Deuteronomy 33:10] states: ""They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Torah to Israel."" Therefore they were set apart from the ways of the world. )  It is a positive commandment (Sefer HaMitzvot (positive mitzvah 23) and Sefer HaChinuch (mitzvah 394) include this mitzvah in their reckoning of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.)  for the Levites to be free and prepared for the service of the Sanctuary, whether they desire to do so or not, (The Sifri to the prooftext quoted states that they can be compelled to do so against their will.)  as [Numbers 18:23] states: ""And the Levite shall perform the service of the tent of meeting."" When a Levite accepts all the mitzvot of the Levites with the exception of one matter, he is not accepted unless he accepts them all."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

And [from this principle is] that he believes that [the Messiah] will have great advantage and stature and honor above all of the kings that ever were; according to that which all of the prophets prophesied about him; from Moshe, our teacher, - peace be upon him - to Malachi, peace be upon him. And one who doubts him or for whom his stature is diminished denies the Torah, as the Torah testifies about him in Parashat Bilaam and in Parashat Atem Netsavim. And included in this principle is that there should not be a king in Israel except from the House of David alone. And anyone who disputes [the status] of this family, denies the name of God, may He be blessed, and the words of His prophets."
30,8,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 94:1:5,"The references to man as beloved of G'd do not mean that the love of G'd was demonstrated before its recipient had demonstrated some personal accomplishment in the field of yir-at shamayim, fear of Heaven. All men are created with equal opportunity in this respect, though G'd provides blandishments to attract those who choose His way, whereas no incentives are provided for the potential sinner. The fact that we find ba-aley teshuvah, repentant sinners on the one hand and on the other hand one encounters people who have lived a devout life most of their years only to suddenly forsake that path, shows clearly that we are all free agents in this respect. The initial amount of Divine love each person is endowed with at birth, is augmented as man pursues the path of righteousness. emet me-eretz titzmach, truth grows from the earth. (Psalms 85,12) This means the recognition of truth is rooted in our world. ""Righteousness however, is subsequently looking down from above."" Solomon's prayer at the beginning of his career, (Kings I 3,6) is the best illustration of our contention. Solomon said: ""You have done great kindness with Your servant David my father, when he walked before You in truth and righteousness and with upright heart; You preserved this kindness for him, and gave him a son who sits on his throne as of this day."" Solomon talks of two acts of kindness by G'd. The first is the kindness extended to all men at birth, the second that which accrued due to David's personal conduct. In chapter sixteen we have explained in detail why in the case of Abraham, G'ds special love is reported before we know of Abraham's good deeds. The initial endowment of man by G'd at birth can be divided into three categories. 1) The physical aspect; the gift of life, a sound body. 2) Endowment with certain character tendencies that will help to smooth his path in life. 3) Endowment with certain intellectual powers. When we quoted the Talmud in Makkot at the outset, the three types of decrees the rabbis instituted may reflect these three categories. (1) The reading of the megillah annually, is an act of appreciation that our physical lives had been preserved at the time of Haman. When Jews found that this basic gift of G'd had become endangered, they did penitence, a gift G'd had granted mankind prior to man having been created. This act therefore awakens the bond that links man to G'd. By fasting, i.e. denying oneself the needs of the body, Jews atoned for having indulged their bodies at the feast of Ahasverus some years previously. (2) When the Rabbis expanded the tithes legislation, they imposed restraints on certain character traits, primarily greed. The giving of alms is proof that one is able to restrain one's natural greed. Once man makes a move in this direction, he can be sure that G'ds kindness will respond in equal or even far greater measure. Also, the dispensation of alms, tithes, on a regular basis, eventually results in such acts of kindness becoming part of our very nature. When one observes good deeds being performed, one cannot always be sure of the motive of the person performing such good deeds. It may be an outgrowth of a mature personality, or it may still be motivated by ulterior considerations. The only criterion that offers guidance in this respect is the donor's facial expression at the time he performs the deed of kindness. If he seems to genuinely enjoy performing the deed, we can be sure he has attained the personality level when this mitzvah has become a natural for him. Such a person is called nadiv, generous, the other kind is merely called noten, a donor. David expressed this thought very clearly in Chronicles I 29,17. After having acknowledged that all the silver and gold man has amassed is in truth G'ds, he continues ""and I am aware my Lord that you examine the heart, that you are desirous of uprightness; I have donated all these items from the uprightness of my heart; and now Your people present here, I have observed that they donate for You joyfully."" G'd can tell motivation by examining the heart. David only has the venue of watching people's faces when they make their donations to tell how genuine their motivation may be. The verse commencing with the words asser te-asser, tithe repeatedly, (14,22) just like the words naton titten, give repeatedly, (14, 10) reminds us that only repeated action of that kind leads to generous gestures becoming second nature to us. Alternately, the repetition could mean that for every act of generosity we perform, a compensating act is performed in Heaven. "
30,10,Quoting Commentary,Depths of Yonah 3:3:14,"Conclusion However we explain it, Nineveh’s Teshuvah stands as an example of a communal Teshuvah that the Jewish people will perform which will initiate the arrival of Mashiach (Devarim 30:1-10 and Rambam Hilchot Teshuvah 7:5). Nineveh’s one hundred percent participation sets a powerful example for our people, an important message year round but especially as the day of Yom Kippur draws to a close."

Our author quotes ‎‎Tikkuney Hazohar 68 according to which on New Year’s Day ‎all of mankind implores G’d for His largesse to be generous in the ‎year just commencing. There are, however, two classes of human ‎beings who ask for this, i.e. those who truly deserve it on the ‎basis of past performance, and those who in the past did not ‎deserve it, but on the basis of their promise to improve their ways ‎in the year commencing, expect to receive this largesse of G’d “on ‎credit,” as it were.‎ When the souls of the Jewish people “line up” to be judged on ‎New Year’s Day, G’d derives a great deal of satisfaction from the ‎ones immediately inscribed for a good year.  G’d’s pleasure is ‎described in a proverb cited in Pessachim 112 which says that ‎the mother cow is more anxious to provide its new born calf with ‎milk than the calf is to suckle it. The Zohar II 32 describes the ‎following scenario, (Kings I 22,19) where Michayoh, the only true ‎prophet in the Northern Kingdom advises King Achav against ‎trying to recapture Ramat Gilad, as it would cost the king’s life. ‎We read there: ‎ראיתי את ה' יושב על כסאו וכל צבא השמים עומד מימינו ‏ומשמאלו‎, “I have seen a vision of G’d sitting on His throne ‎whereas all the heavenly hosts stood above Him.” [not ‎around him. Ed.] The unusual phrase of the angels being ‎above G’d, prompt the Zohar to understand this verse as ‎the angels being about to “judge” G’d. This also makes more ‎plausible something that we have read in a book reportedly given ‎to Adam by the angel ‎רזיא'ל‎ in which G’d is referred to as ‎מלך עלוב‎, ‎‎“a king in a miserable, wretched frame of mind.” [more ‎about this angel in ‎מלאכי עליון‎ by Rabbi Reuven Margolies. ‎Ed.]‎"

It is written concerning the wilderness (ibid.), “These are the words;” and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 42:16), “I will turn darkness before them into light and rough places into level ground. These things (elleh hadevarim) I will do, and I will not forsake them.” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 20:15), “Now all the people saw the thunderings (qol in the plural)”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Jer. 33:11), “The sound (qol) of joy and the sound (qol) of gladness, [the voice (qol) of the bridegroom and the voice (qol) of the bride].” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Ps. 68:9), “The earth quaked”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Hag. 2:6), “I will cause the heavens and the earth to quake.” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 13:21), “And the Lord went before them by day”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 52:12), “for the Lord shall go before you.” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Deut. 30:9), “for the Lord shall be glad over you again”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 65:19), “I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people.” [Also (according to Is. 35:1),] “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” What did Isaiah see to say this? It is simply that, when Israel transgressed the Torah, Hosea arose and said (in Hos. 2:5), “I will make her like a wilderness and render her like an arid land.” For that reason Isaiah has said (in Is. 35:1), “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” Now all the consolations of which Isaiah spoke are double, because (according to Is. 40:2) “she (i.e., Jerusalem) has received from the hand of the Lord double for all her sins.” (Lam. R. 1:22.)  So for that reason the consolations are double (in vs. 1) “Comfort, O comfort My people.” [Similarly (in Is. 51:12),] “I, I am the one who comforts you.” [Also (in Is. 51:9),] “Awake, awake.” [Also (in Is. 51:17),] “Rouse yourself, rouse yourself!” [Also] (in Is. 61:10),] “I will be glad with rejoicing.” [Also] (in Is. 35:2),] “It shall blossom with blossoms.” Another interpretation (of Is. 35:1), “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” For what reason was this written? To teach you that when the Holy One, blessed be He, reveals His Divine Presence over Israel, He does not reveal it all to them on one occasion, because they would not have been able to persevere in this bounty all at once; for if He had revealed His bounty to them at one time, they would all have died. See what is written (in Is. 64:3), “From time immemorial they have not heard, nor has an ear perceived, nor has an eye seen a God besides you, who works for those who wait for him.” Go and learn from Joseph; for when he made himself known to his brothers after so many years, [when] Joseph said to them (in Gen. 45:3), “I am Joseph,” they all died, “and they could not answer him; [for they were dismayed because of him].” How much the more [would Israel be dismayed] at [a sudden revelation of] the Holy One, blessed be He! So what does the Holy One, blessed be He, do for them instead? He reveals himself to them little by little. At the beginning, He makes the mountains glad, as stated (in Is. 35:1), “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” Then after that (ibid.), “the steppes shall rejoice […].” Then after that (in vs. 2), “It shall bloom abundantly.” Then after that (ibid.), “the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it.” Then after that (ibid.), “they shall see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God.” For that reason David said (in Ps. 102:17), “For the Lord has built up Zion; He has appeared in His glory.” It also says (in Is. 52:8), “for eye to eye they will see the return of the Lord to Zion.” And it also says (in Is. 25:9), “In that day they shall say, ‘See, this is our God; we waited for Him, and He delivered us; [this is the Lord; we waited for Him, let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.’”"

It is written concerning the wilderness (in Ps. 68:9 [8]): THE EARTH QUAKED; and it is written concerning Zion (in Hag. 2:6): I WILL CAUSE THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO QUAKE. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 13:21): AND THE LORD WENT BEFORE THEM BY DAY; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 52:12): FOR THE LORD SHALL GO BEFORE YOU. It is written concerning the wilderness (in Deut. 30:9): FOR THE LORD SHALL BE GLAD OVER YOU AGAIN; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 65:19): I WILL ALSO REJOICE IN JERUSALEM AND BE GLAD IN MY PEOPLE. [ (according to Is. 35:1): THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD.] What did Isaiah see to say this? It is simply that, when Israel transgressed the Torah, Hosea arose and said (in Hos. 2:5 [3]): I WILL MAKE HER LIKE A WILDERNESS [AND RENDER HER LIKE AN ARID LAND]. For that reason Isaiah has said (in Is. 35:1): THE WILDERNESS  SHALL BE GLAD. Now all the consolations of which Isaiah spoke are double, because (according to Is. 40:2:) SHE (i.e., Jerusalem) HAS RECEIVED FROM THE HAND OF THE LORD DOUBLE FOR ALL HER SINS. (Lam. R. 1:22 (57).)  So for that reason Isaiah has comforted her doubly (in vs. 1) COMFORT, O COMFORT .  (in Is. 51:12): I, I .  (in Is. 51:9): AWAKE, AWAKE, !  (in Is. 51:17): ROUSE YOURSELF, ROUSE YOURSELF!   (in Is. 61:10): I WILL BE GLAD WITH REJOICING .  (in Is. 35:1–2)  IT SHALL BLOSSOM WITH BLOSSOMS."
30,9,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:9:1","כי ישוב ה' לשוש עליך לטוב כאשר שש על אבותיך, “when Hashem will return and rejoice over you for good as He rejoiced over your forefathers.” It is possible that this verse alludes to the time when the King will return with His bride (the Jewish people), i.e. an allusion to the time of the redemption. At that time He will provide you with all the benefits accompanying such a return to favor. Should you inquire when exactly all this would happen, the Torah adds: “when you will hearken to the voice of the Lord your G’d to observe, etc.” The Jewish people are always expected to make the first move towards reconciliation with G’d, i.e. observing His commandments. Immediately G’d notices this, He in turn will hasten the rapprochement. Our fortunes depend on our becoming penitents. All this has been expressed in unmistakable language by Malachi 3,7: “שובו אלי ואשובה אליכם, “return to Me and I will return to you.” The letter ה at the end of the word אשובה in that verse is a reference to the final letter in the tetragrammaton, the attribute which created the universe."
30,9,Quoting Commentary,Malbim on Job 9:1:20,"—  is that the exchange mechanism is just a prophylactic; that when God foresees that a righteous person is by his nature likely to sin at some time in the future, He makes him suffer in advance, thereby bending his will (Leviticus 26:41) and preventing him from slipping; (Psalms 37:31) and then the Lord will again rejoice over him for good (Deuteronomy 30:9).

30,9,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Balak, Torah Ohr 3","This statement resolves a major problem that arises from Deut. 28,63: ""And as G–d once delighted in making you prosperous and many, so will He now delight in causing you to perish and in wiping you out."" Our sages wonder: How can one describe G–d as actually enjoying our misery? Do we not have repeated statements describing G–d's pain and discomfiture whenever the Jewish people undergo afflictions (Megillah 10b)? Rabbi Eliezer answers that it is not G–d Himself who delights in our misfortunes, but rather He causes others to. This answer is supported by the grammatical meaning of the word ""Yassis,"" used by the Torah. If the Torah were to describe G–d's personal delight, it would have written “Yassos” instead. Rabbi Eliezer's answer is difficult, seeing the Torah states explicitly כן ישיש עליך ה' אלוקיך, which clearly means that He Himself derives pleasure from what is happening! Why then the strange combination of ישיש with עליך? We also find the wording שוש אשיש, meaning: ""I will personally rejoice"" (Isaiah 61,10). Hence we cannot explain the expression ישיש as meaning something other than deriving personal joy. We also have Deut. 30,9, in which after describing the penitence of the Jewish people, the Torah says of G–d: ""He will once again delight in your well-being, etc,"" and the expression used is “La-ssus”. We must conclude that the construction Yassis, therefore can have two meanings. On occasion it is a Hiphil, transitive, and would mean making others rejoice, whereas on other occasions it is used intransitively and means to derive personal joy."
30,9,Midrash,Eikhah Rabbah 2:21,"“The Lord accomplished what He devised: He implemented His statement that He commanded from the days of old; He destroyed and had no compassion.

Rather, “the Lord accomplished [what He devised: He implemented [bitza] His statement that He commanded from the days of old].” He compromised. (The term bitzua  also means compromise.)  Rabbi Yaakov of Kefar Ḥanan said: He rent [beza] His raiment. “He caused the enemy to rejoice over you.” Rabbi Aḥa said: In good times, He rejoiced with them, as it is written: “For the Lord will return to rejoice over you for good, as He rejoiced over your fathers” (Deuteronomy 30:9). But in bad times, He causes others to rejoice. That is what is written: “He caused the enemy to rejoice over you, raised the horn of your antagonists.” In that regard it is said: “Their heart cried to the Lord: Wall of the daughter of Zion, [let tears] fall…” (God caused the enemies to rejoice but He did not rejoice with them.)

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

Abraham made a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned” (Genesis 21:8).  “The child grew and was weaned” – Rabbi Hoshaya the Great said: He was weaned from the evil inclination. The Rabbis say: He was weaned from his milk.  “Abraham made a great feast” – Rabbi Yuda ben Rabbi Simon said: [This means that] the Great One of all worlds was present there. Rabbi Yudan bar Masparta said: “The king made a great feast” (Esther 2:18) – the great leaders of the world were there. That is what is written: “As the Lord will return to rejoice over you for good” (Deuteronomy 30:9) – in the days of Mordekhai and Esther, “as He rejoiced over your fathers” (Deuteronomy 30:9) – in the days of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.   Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said: “A great feast” – a feast of all the great people; Og and all the great men were there. They said to Og: ‘Did you not used to say: Abraham is a like barren mule and cannot beget a child?’ He said to them: ‘Now, what is his gift [Isaac], is it not puny? If I place my finger on him I could crush him.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Why are you disparaging his gift? By your life, you will [live to] see thousands upon thousands and myriads upon myriads emerging from his grandchildren, but that man [you, Og] will meet his end only by his hand,’ as it is stated: “The Lord said to Moses: Do not fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand…” (Numbers 21:34). It is as Rabbi Levi said: A cradle was rocked first only in the house of Abraham our patriarch. (Babies used to be born strong enough not to require a cradle. Isaac was the first child who required a cradle. That is why Og mocked his puniness.)   Rabbi Yehoshua ben Menaḥama said: Those sixty-two kings that Joshua killed, all of them were at the feast of Abraham our patriarch. But were they not thirty-one? (See Joshua 12:24.)  It is, rather, like what Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Ḥelbo, and Rabbi Parnakh said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: “The king of Jericho, one, [the king of Ai one, etc.]” (Joshua 12:9) — Why does the verse state: “One” [after each of the kings]?

Compare further the antithesis: 'If any of thine be driven out unto the utmost parts of heaven' (Deuteronomy 30:10); 'Thou shalt return unto the Lord thy God' (Deuteronomy 30:2), finally, the song: 'Give ear' (Deuteronomy 32:1); and other places.

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,10,Quoting Commentary,Rambam on Mishnah Sanhedrin 10:1:29,"The twelfth principle The Messianic era and that is to believe and to confirm that he will come and not to think that he is late. 'If the tarries, wait for him' and do not give him a [set] time and do not create analyses from the verses to extrapolate the time of his coming. And the sages said (Sanhedrin 97b), ""The spirit of those that calculate the end should blow up."" And [from this principle is] that he believes that [the Messiah] will have great advantage and stature and honor above all of the kings that ever were; according to that which all of the prophets prophesied about him; from Moshe, our teacher, - peace be upon him - to Malachi, peace be upon him. And one who doubts him or for whom his stature is diminished denies the Torah, as the Torah testifies about him in Parashat Bilaam and in Parashat Atem Netsavim. And included in this principle is that there should not be a king in Israel except from the House of David alone. And anyone who disputes [the status] of this family, denies the name of God, may He be blessed, and the words of His prophets."
30,10,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 30:10:1","כי תשמע בקול...כי תשוב, “if you will listen to the voice of Hashem.....and return to the Lord;” we learn here that the time for the redemption from exile depends on two factors, a) penitence, b) performance of the positive commandments and avoiding the transgressions listed in the negative commandments."
30,10,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 30:10:2","הכתובה, “which has been recorded in writing; we would have expected this word to be in the plural mode as it covers multiple laws. Instead we find a singular feminine mode. This is not something unique; for instance we find something analogous in Exodus 17,12 where Moses’ hands are described as remaining steady, i.e. ויהי ידיו אמונה."
30,10,Quoting Commentary,Depths of Yonah 3:3:14,"Conclusion However we explain it, Nineveh’s Teshuvah stands as an example of a communal Teshuvah that the Jewish people will perform which will initiate the arrival of Mashiach (Devarim 30:1-10 and Rambam Hilchot Teshuvah 7:5). Nineveh’s one hundred percent participation sets a powerful example for our people, an important message year round but especially as the day of Yom Kippur draws to a close."

Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the Lord your God will gather you and bring you back. He will bring you to the land that belonged to your fathers, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers.... You will again obey the Lord and follow all His commands that I am giving you today. Then the Lord your God will make you prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and crops of your land.

30,11,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 8:1-2,"Halakha: A person of Israel who did not pray the morning prayer, the additional prayer, or the afternoon prayer, as many times he was too occupied to pray, because he was relieving himself, or he was walking on the way and forgot to pray – until what hour is it permitted for him to pray and fulfill his obligation? How must he act? So taught the Sages: The morning prayer is until noon. the afternoon prayer is until the evening.   the evening prayer has no fixed time, but the additional prayer is all day. Rabbi Elazar said: If one forgot and did not pray the additional prayer, and comes to pray the afternoon prayer, he prays the afternoon prayer and then the additional prayer. Why? It is because everything is recited at its time. The evening prayer has no fixed time, until dawn. Why? (Why is it important to know until when one can pray?)  It is as it is written: “I love those who love me, and those who seek me will find me” (Proverbs 8:17). And anyone who prays and focuses his heart in prayer, it is a positive indicator that his prayer was accepted, as it is stated: “Lord, You hear the desire of the humble” (Psalms 10:17).  Great is prayer before the Holy One blessed be He. Rabbi Elazar said: Is your wish to know the power of prayer? If it does not accomplish all of it, it accomplishes half of it. Cain stood against his brother Abel and killed him. An edict was issued: “Restless and itinerant you shall be on the earth” (Genesis 4:12). Immediately, he stood and confessed before the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “My iniquity is too great to bear” (Genesis 4:13). He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, You bear the entire world, but you cannot bear me? You wrote: “Bearing iniquity and overlooking transgression” (Micah 7:18) – pardon my iniquity, which is great.’ Immediately, he found mercy before the Holy One blessed be He, and the “itinerant” half of the edict was withheld from him, as so it is written: “He resided in the land of Nod” (Genesis 4:16). From here you learn that prayer is great before the Holy One blessed be He. Likewise Hezekiah, when the prophet said to him: “Instruct your household, as you are dying” (Isaiah 38:1). Immediately, “Hezekiah turned his face to the wall [and he prayed to the Lord]” (Isaiah 38:2). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “I have heard your prayer… behold, I am adding fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5), as it is written: “He grants the wishes of those who fear Him, and He hears their cry and saves them” (Psalms 145:19). “For this mitzva that I command you today, it is not hidden from you, and it is not distant” (Deuteronomy 30:11).  “For this mitzva” – halakha: A person of Israel who stands to read the Torah, how does he recite the blessing? So the Sages taught: One who begins and one who concludes reading the Torah recites a blessing before it and after it. From where is it derived that it requires a blessing before it and after it? It is as it is written: “Blessed are You, Lord” (Psalms 119:12) and then: “Teach me Your statutes” (Psalms 119:12); that is the blessing before it. From where is it derived that it requires a blessing after it? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: It is as it is written after the song: (Within the portion Ha'azinu (Deuteronomy 32:1–43).)  “This is the blessing” (Deuteronomy 33:1). From the fact that he taught them the Torah and then recited a blessing; we learn the blessing after it.  Another matter, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you uttered the blessing of the Torah, I, too, will bless you,’ as it is stated: “In every place that I mention my name, (The verse is being interpreted as meaning ""wherever you mention my Name."" See Rabbeinu Beḥayei on the verse.)  [I will come to you and I will bless you]” (Exodus 20:21).  Another matter, the Rabbis said: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you recited a blessing on the Torah, you recited the blessing for yourself.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “For with Me your days will be increased, and years of life will be added for you” (Proverbs 9:11). [God said:] ‘If you say, perhaps I gave you the Torah to your detriment; I gave it to you only for your benefit, as the ministering angels desired it, but it was vanished from them,’ as it is stated: “It is vanished from the eyes of all living” (Job 28:21) – these are the ""heavenly creatures,"" (See Ezekiel 1:5.)  “and hidden from the birds [umeof] of the heavens” (Job 28:21) – these are the angels. From where is it derived? (That the word ""birds"" can refer to angels.)  It is as it is stated: “One of the seraphim flew [vayaaf] to me” (Isaiah 6:6). He said to them [the Israelites]: ‘My children, it is hidden from the ministering angels, but from you it is not hidden,’ from what we read regarding the matter: “For this mitzva that I command you today, it is not hidden from you.”"
30,11,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 8:4,"What the verse said: “For they are life for those who find them…” (Proverbs 4:22) – Rabbi Ḥiyya said: It is a salve for the eye and a remedy for a wound, and a cup of roots for the intestines. A salve for the eyes, as it is written: “The commandment of the Lord is pure, it enlightens the eyes” (Psalms 19:9). A remedy for a wound, as it is written: “It will bring health to your body” (Proverbs 3:8). A cup of roots for the intestines – as it is written: “And an elixir for your bones” (Proverbs 3:8).  Another matter, “for they are life for those who find them [lemotzeihem]” – to one who issues them [lemotzian] out of his mouth. (Studies out loud.)  There was an incident involving a certain disciple of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, who would complete all his learning in one hour. (He did not say the words out loud.)  One time, he fell ill and forgot all his learning. What caused this to befall him? It is because he did not recite it with his mouth. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov prayed on his behalf and all his learning was restored.  Another matter, “for they are life for those who find them [motzeihem]” – for one who imparts it [shemotzian] to others. Alternatively, “for they are life for those who find them [motzeihem]” – for one who completes [shemamtzi] (This is a variation of the word mematze, which means exhausts or completes.)  all the mitzvot. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “All the mitzva” (Deuteronomy 8:1). What is “all the mitzva”? It is until you complete all the mitzvot. ""And an elixir for your bones” (Proverbs 3:8), the 248 limbs that you have. That is ""For this mitzva.""  Another matter, “for this mitzva” – Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Anyone who begins a mitzva and does not complete it, causes that he will bury his wife and his children. From whom do you derive it? It is from Judah, who began a mitzva but did not complete it. How so? When Joseph came to his brothers and they sought to kill him, as it is stated: “Let us go and kill him” (Genesis 37:20). Judah stood and did not allow them. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “What profit is it if we kill our brother?” (Genesis 37:26). They heeded him because he was king over them. Had he said to them: ‘Let us return him to our father,’ they would have heeded him. Because he began the mitzva but did not complete it, he buried his wife and his children, as it is stated: “Bat Shua, Judah’s wife, died” (Genesis 38:12), and it is written: “Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 46:12).  Another matter, “for this mitzva” – Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: Anyone who begins a mitzva but does not complete it, and another comes and completes it, it is attributed to the one who completed it. How so? Moses began the mitzva, as he took Joseph’s bones with him. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Moses took Joseph’s bones with him…” (Exodus 13:19). But because he did not take them into the Land of Israel, it is attributed to Israel, who buried him, as it is stated: “The bones of Joseph that the children of Israel took up from Egypt, they buried in Shekhem” (Joshua 24:32). “That Moses took up from Egypt” is not written here, but rather, “that the children of Israel took up.” Why did they bury him in Shekhem? To what is the matter comparable? It is to thieves who stole a barrel of wine. The homeowner was aware of their presence. He said to them: ‘Enjoy it, but, as you live, after you drink the wine, return the barrel to its place.’ So, when the brothers sold Joseph, they sold him from Shekhem, as it is stated: “Israel said to Joseph: Are your brothers not herding in Shekhem?” (Genesis 37:13). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘You sold him from Shekhem, return him to Shekhem.’ Since they completed the mitzva, it is attributed to them. That is, “for this mitzva.”"
30,11,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 8:5,"Another matter, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you read the Torah, you are performing a mitzva for the sake of My world, as were it not for the Torah, the world would have been restored to emptiness and disorder.’  Another matter, “for the mitzva” – what is “the mitzva”? The Rabbis say: It is a hard matter. To what is the matter comparable? It is to a king who had a gem and he entrusted it to his friend. He said to him: ‘I beseech you, pay attention to it and guard it properly, as if it is lost, you do not have anywhere from which to repay me, and I do not have another one like it. The result will be that you will have sinned against me and against you. Instead, perform the mitzva on behalf of both of us, and guard it properly.’ So, Moses said to Israel: ‘If you observe the Torah, you will not only be acting charitably [tzdaka] for yourselves, but for Me and for you, as it is stated: “It will be, therefore, to our merit [tzdaka]” (Deuteronomy 6:25) – for Me and for you.’ When? “[It will be, therefore, to our merit…] if we observe to perform all this mitzva” (Deuteronomy 6:25)."
30,11,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 8:6,"“It is not in the heavens, to say: Who will ascend for us to the heavens, and take it for us, and communicate it to us, that we will perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:12).  Another matter, “for [this] mitzva…it is not in the heavens” – Moses said to them: ‘So you will not say: Another Moses will stand and bring us another Torah from Heaven, I am already informing you: “It is not in the heavens,” as nothing of it remained in Heaven.’  Another matter, Rabbi Ḥanina said: It and all the tools of its craft were given; its humility, its righteousness, its uprightness, and the giving of its reward.  Another matter, what is “it is not in the heavens”? Shmuel said: The Torah cannot be found among the astrologers, whose craft is in the heavens. They said to Shmuel: ‘But you are an astrologer and a Torah giant.’ He said to them: ‘I would look into astrology only when I was unoccupied in Torah. When? It is when I would enter the bathhouse.’ (One is not allowed to study Torah in the bathhouse.)  “And it is not across the sea, to say: Who will cross for us to the other side of the sea and take it for us, and communicate it to us that we will perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:13).  “Rather the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:14).  Another matter, “it is not in the heavens” – they said: ‘Our master, Moses, you are saying: “It is not in the heavens” and “it is not across the sea.” Where is it?’ He said to them: ‘It is is a place that is near: “in your mouth and in your heart to perform it.” It is not distant from you, it is near to you.’  Another matter, “in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” – the Rabbis said: Solomon said seven matters regarding the idler, but what Moses said was greater than all of them. How so? They said to the idler: ‘Your teacher is in the city, go and learn Torah from him.’ He answers them and says to them: ‘I am afraid of the lion on the way.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The idler says: There is a lion on the way” (Proverbs 26:13). They said to him: ‘Your teacher is in the neighborhood, get up and go to him.’ He says to them: ‘I am afraid that there might be a lion outside,’ as it is stated: “A lion in the streets” (Proverbs 26:13). They said to him: ‘He is residing next to your house.’ He said to them: ‘But the lion is outside,’ as it is stated: “The idler says: There is a lion in the street” (Proverbs 22:13). They said to him: ‘Inside the house.’ He said to them: ‘But if I go and find the door [of his room] locked, I will need to come back.’ They said to him: ‘It is open.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The door turns on its hinges, and the idler is on his bed” (Proverbs 26:14). Ultimately, he did not know what to answer. He said to them: ‘Whether the door is open or locked, I wish to sleep a bit longer.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “How long will you lie down, idler? [When will you arise from your sleep?]” (Proverbs 6:9). He awakened from his sleep in the morning, they placed before him to eat. He was too lazy to put it in his mouth. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The idler inserts his hand into the dish; he is too weary to return it to his mouth” (Proverbs 26:15). Which is the seventh? “From the winter, the idler will not plow; he will ask at harvest, and there is nothing” (Proverbs 20:4). What is, “from the winter, the idler will not plow”? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: This is one who does not study Torah in his youth and seeks to study in his old age, but is unable to do so. That is, “he will ask at harvest, and there is nothing.” But what Moses said was greater than all of them. From where is it derived? “Rather, the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” – take the matter out of your mouth."
30,11,Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 30:11:1,"FOR THIS COMMANDMENT. The meaning thereof is that it refers to the entire Torah. But the correct interpretation is that when he refers to the entire Torah, he says [as above] Every commandment which I command thee this day. (Above 8:1.)  Rather [the expression used here] this commandment refers to [the commandment of] repentance aforementioned, for the verses, and thou shalt bethink thyself; (Above, Verse 1.)  and thou shalt return unto the Eternal thy G-d (Ibid., Verse 2.)  constitute a commandment, wherein he commands us to do so. It is stated in a future tense [rather than in the imperative] to suggest, in the form of a pledge, that it is destined [that Israel will repent]. And the sense thereof is to state that if thy outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven (Above, Verse 4.)  and you are under the power of the nations, you can yet return to G-d and do according to all that I command thee this day, (Ibid., Verse 2.)  for the thing is not hard, nor far off from you, but rather very nigh unto thee (Further, Verse 14.)  to do it at all times and in all places. This is the sense of the expression, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it (Further, Verse 14.)  meaning that they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers (Leviticus 26:40.)  by word of their mouth, and return in their heart to G-d and accept the Torah upon themselves this day to perform it throughout the generations, as he mentioned, thou and thy children with all thy heart, (Above, Verse 2.)  as I have explained. (Ibid., and in Verse 6.) "
30,11,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 30:11:1,"לא נפלאת הוא ממך [FOR THIS COMMANDMENT …] IS NOT נפלאת FROM YOU i.e. is not concealed from you, just as it is said, (Deuteronomy 17:8): כי יפלא which is rendered in the Targum by “If there be concealed [from thee]”; and (Lamentations 1:9): ותרד פלאים which means, she went down into concealment, i.e. being covered and bound in the place of concealment."
30,11,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 30:11:1,"TOO HARD. The word niflet (too hard) means concealed. (See Rashi.)  Or its meaning is, wondrous, that is, something that will cause you to grow weary while trying to accomplish it. (In other words, too hard.) "

"
30,11,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 30:11:1,"כי המצוה הזאת, and the reason that I said in verse 1 that the repentance must be wholehearted and among the nations, i.e. while you are still in exile, is so that it can trigger your salvation. For, indeed this commandment, i.e. the one to return to G’d in sincere penitence אשר אנכי מצוך היום, Moses reminds the people that in the list of sacrifices in Leviticus 5,5 et al, where various kinds of sin and guilt offerings are listed as means to expiate for the error committed, the essential refrain is always “והתוודה אשר חטא,” that the guilty person first confesses his mistake, his sin, even the one committed inadvertently. Compare also Numbers 5,6-7)"
30,11,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:11:1,"כי המצוה הזאת אשר אנכי מצוך היום, ""For this commandment which I command to you today, etc."" Why did the Torah have to write the word ""today?"" Besides once the Torah had told us that the Torah is not hidden from you, is it not clear that it is not very distant? Why did the Torah bother to write לא רחוקה היא? Why did the Torah have to remind us that Torah is not beyond the ocean? Even if it were, it is an accessible location and we could have secured it by means of ships!"
30,11,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 8:3,"What the verse said: “Wisdom is lofty to a fool; at the gate, he will not open his mouth” (Proverbs 24:7) – what is “wisdom is lofty to a fool”? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: This fool enters the synagogue, and he sees them engaging in talmudic discourse, but he does not know what they are saying. He is ashamed, as it is stated: “At the gate, he will not open his mouth.” “Gate” is nothing other than the Sanhedrin, as it is written: “His brother's widow shall go up to the gate, to the elders” (Deuteronomy 25:7).  Another matter, the Rabbis said: This fool enters the synagogue and sees them engaged in Torah study, and he says to them: ‘How does a person study Torah from the outset?’ They say to him: ‘One reads a scroll; (Children are given a scroll with letters, vocalization, and some verses.)  then [one reads] in the Torah scroll, then in the Prophets, and then in the Writings. When one completes the Bible, one studies the Talmud, then halakhot, and then aggadot.’ When he hears this, he says in his heart: When can I learn all this? He returns from the gate; that is, “at the gate, he will not open his mouth.” Rabbi Yannai said: To what is the matter comparable? It is to a loaf that was suspended in the air. (It was suspended from the ceiling in a house.)  The fool said: ‘Who will be able to retrieve it?’ The clever one says: ‘Did someone not suspend it?’ He brings a ladder or a rod and takes it down. Likewise, everyone who is a fool, says: ‘When will I read the entire Torah?’ But one who is clever, what does he do? He studies one chapter each and every day until he completes the entire Torah. The Holy One blessed be He said: “It is not hidden,” and if it is hidden, it is from you, because you did not engage in it. That is, “for this mitzva.”"
30,11,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Exodus 8:18:1,"והפליתי means I WILL SEPARATE. Similar is, (Exodus 9:4) “And the Lord will make a separation (והפלה)”; so, also, (Deuteronomy 30:11) “It is not נפלאת from thee״ — that is, “it is not separated and set at a far distance from thee”."
30,11,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 30:11:2,"לא נפלאת היא ממך, so that you would need to ask the prophets in order to understand it correctly."
30,11,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 30:11:3,"ולא רחוקה היא, so that you have to ask the leading Torah scholars of your generation who live a long way from you to explain how to observe this commandment. You can easily observe this commandment even in the Diaspora where you may not have any Torah scholars nearby.
"
30,11,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Psalms 19:10:2,"enduring for ever: – because these are commandments which are limited as regards place and time, while the things which stand in the fear of the Lord endure for ever. They have no time-limit. Or he says endure for ever with reference to the whole Law, inasmuch as God did not appoint it for a time only, but it is for ever and ever. It is not as the unbelieving Nazarenes say when they assert that the Law which was given on Mount Sinai was valid only for a time, until the advent of Jesus the Nazarene; that unto his time it was carnal, while after his advent he commanded it to be understood spiritually; but their words are windy, empty, and vain. For the. commandments, which they say are figurative and not to be understood according to their literal sense, God enjoined explicitly and not by way of figure. Such being the case, no one would understand the rest of the commandments in a figurative sense, but according to their literal meaning; for if the commandments were figurative they would be uncertain; one would say that the hidden meaning is such and such, and another would say it is so and so; but the Scripture says (Deut. 30:11) ""For this commandment which I command thee this day is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off."" And if there had been in the commandments hidden meanings, and if they were not to be understood in their literal sense, then they would be ""hard ""and ""far off."""
30,11,Midrash,Midrash Tehillim 119:8,"""Reward Your servant, that I may live and keep Your word."" This is what Isaiah said (Isaiah 59:18), ""According to their deeds, so will He repay wrath to His adversaries."" The Lord pays the wicked according to their deeds, and to the righteous, He pays them according to their works. He pays the wicked (Isaiah 34:5), ""For My sword shall be bathed in heaven; behold it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of My curse, to judgment."" And He rewards the righteous, as it says in Psalm 73:1, ""Truly God is good to Israel, to such as are pure in heart."" And it says in Isaiah 63:7, ""I will mention the loving-kindnesses of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which He has bestowed on them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His loving-kindnesses."" The Lord does not pay anything for free, neither to the wicked nor to the righteous. The evil that comes upon the wicked is not brought upon them by the Lord. As it says in Lamentations 3:38, ""Out of the mouth of the Most High proceedeth not evil and good."" But they bring it upon themselves. And it says in Isaiah 3:9, ""The shew of their countenance doth witness against them."" What does He reward the righteous with? Life, without any charge. And it says in Psalm 103:2-4, ""Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits, who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction."" And not only this, but He does many righteous deeds, as it says in Psalm 146:7, ""The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed."" And it says in Psalm 116:7, ""Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee."" And David said to the Lord, ""Reward Your servant with life, that I may keep Your word."" And why does He reward me with life? Because I keep Your word. Life is the Torah. And it says in Proverbs 4:13, ""Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life."" Therefore it is said, ""Recompense on Your servant, I will live."" David said to him, ""Master of the universe, it is Your will that I keep Your word. Unveil my eyes that I may perceive wonders from Your Torah. And if You do not unveil my eyes, how can I know? Therefore it is said, 'Unveil my eyes and I will perceive wonders.' Even though my eyes are open, I know nothing. Come and see, even though Samuel was a prophet, he knew nothing until the Holy One, blessed be He, unveiled his ear, as it is said (I Samuel 9:15), 'And the Lord had revealed to Samuel.' Likewise, Nebuchadnezzar said (Daniel 2:47), 'Truly your God is a God of gods and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of mysteries.' And so did Daniel say (Daniel 2:30), 'But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living man, but in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king.' And he said (Daniel 2:22), 'And He reveals the deep and secret things.' So did David say, 'Unveil my eyes that I may perceive wonders from Your Torah.' And why does he say (Psalms 119:129), 'Your testimonies are wonderful?' 'Wonderful' refers to the Torah. And so the Scripture says, 'Wonderful are Your testimonies.' Therefore it is said, 'Wonders from Your Torah are treasures.' And so the Scripture says (Proverbs 21:20), 'A desirable treasure.' It is a hidden treasure, as the Scripture says (Deuteronomy 33:19), 'And of the hidden treasures of the sand.' There are many doors and many entrances in it, as it says (Psalms 24:7-8), 'Lift up your heads, O gates, and be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in!' And so David said, 'The Torah is full of wonders.' Moses said, 'It is not a wonder from you, as it says (Deuteronomy 30:11), 'For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you.' It is not too hard for you, but it is a wonder from you, because you did not toil in it. Therefore it is said, 'Wonders from Your Torah.'..."
30,11,Jewish Thought,Nineteen Letters 12:1,"Mitzvoth. — Commandments. — The next requirement, which, though second in rank, gives life its completion and perfection, is love. Never be the instrumentality of curse or misfortune to yourself or your neighbor, but strive, like Deity, to do all your deeds in love, and thus become a blessing to yourself and your surroundings. First become a blessing to yourself in order that you may become it to others. Seek to equip yourself with all the capacities and means which can be of good service to the welfare of your fellow beings; make yourself rich with abundant store of good and noble principles, and then devote yourself to the world for perfect service of blessing. To become the means of blessing, learn first to honor your parents as messengers of God, mankind, and Israel to you; learn also to revere wisdom, age, and virtue, as guides and models, wherever and whenever they appear realized in human character. Illuminate yourself with the revealed wisdom of the Torah, avoid the evil and seek the good. "
30,12,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 7","“It is not in heaven, that you should say, who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it? Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us hear it, and do it? But the word is very near unto you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.” (Devarim, 30:12–14) The Holy Zohar (in Bamidbar 176 and other places,) tells us, “How precious are the words of Torah! This seems as if it is beyond the sea, and then it says some more supernal words of Torah, and it seems as if it is in the highest heavens.” This can be understood through what is written in the Tanna Dvei Eliyahu (Zuta, Ch. 12), “A parable. A mortal king builds a wall by way of which one enters vast palaces. In the wall, he opens a narrow passageway, so narrow that one who does not love the king will not exert himself to enter. Yet one who truly loves him will push himself for he knows that after difficulty, great delights await him.” So too here, where initially he not yet understood words of Torah, how high and precious they are. Then when one comes to the meaning of words of Torah, then “it is not in heaven, and not across the sea … but it is near unto you, in your mouth,” etc. Therefore, Moshe Rabeynu specifically wrote these words in this Parsha, which follows the fiftieth Parsha in the Torah, for then he had attained this level (the fiftieth gate of understanding), that of “it is not in heaven, but near.” This means that even though a man needs fences and boundaries while he does not yet understand words of Torah, once he understands them, he does not need this. “It is not across the sea,” that is to say, he does not need to be far from the delights of this world, which we call, “a sea,” for “sea” teaches of desire. Only at the beginning, for he can only initially enter into words of Torah through great restraint and separation from earthly delights, but this is not the main principle. The main principle is in the doing (the performance of God’s will). This is “in your mouth and in your heart to do it. This is the principle, as it is said in the Tikkunei Zohar (on what Isaac said to Yaakov), “‘make me tasty delights that I love’ [Bereshit, 27:4], these are positive mitzvot [that are done].” This is as it says in the Gemara (Ta’anit, 10a), “better a flooded land than a dry land.” It is good have even a little desire instilled in him and not to be completely dry, as we have explained on the verse (Mishlei, 19) “the desire of man is his kindness;” see there."
30,11,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 30:11:1","כי המצוה הזאת אשר אנכי מצוך היום, “for this commandment that I command you on this day, etc.” Nachmanides writes that the proper interpretation of our verse is that Moses here does not refer to the entire Torah, as if he did he should have spoken about כל המצות or a similar expression. Moses refers to the commandment to repent of one’s sins that was the last commandment discussed. The reason why this commandment had not been couched as such, i.e. Moses using the imperative mode שוב instead of ושבת, for instance, is that he wants to assure the people by means of this allusion that repentance in the near or even distant future, will be a natural when it does finally occur, and it cannot be hastened by being draconically commanded. If it were, it would not be the real thing, would only be lip service.
    The reason that Moses uses exaggerations such asאם יהיה נדחך בקצה השמים, “if you were to find yourselves cast out at the edge of heaven, etc.,” seeing that actually you will find yourselves among other nations that are your unwilling hosts, is that he makes the point that however physically distant you may be from your homeland, and however mentally absurd you would consider the chances of regaining your former stature, repentance is welcome, and will be able to overcome otherwise insurmountable obstacles. This is also why Moses adds the words בפיך ובלבבך לעשותו, If you commence your repentance with your lips, and proceed to internalize it in your heart, you will be able to carry it out absolutely.

30,11,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 8:2,"“For this mitzva that I command you today, it is not hidden from you, and it is not distant” (Deuteronomy 30:11).  “For this mitzva” – halakha: A person of Israel who stands to read the Torah, how does he recite the blessing? So the Sages taught: One who begins and one who concludes reading the Torah recites a blessing before it and after it. From where is it derived that it requires a blessing before it and after it? It is as it is written: “Blessed are You, Lord” (Psalms 119:12) and then: “Teach me Your statutes” (Psalms 119:12); that is the blessing before it. From where is it derived that it requires a blessing after it? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yonatan: It is as it is written after the song: (Within the portion Ha'azinu (Deuteronomy 32:1–43).)  “This is the blessing” (Deuteronomy 33:1). From the fact that he taught them the Torah and then recited a blessing; we learn the blessing after it.  Another matter, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you uttered the blessing of the Torah, I, too, will bless you,’ as it is stated: “In every place that I mention my name, (The verse is being interpreted as meaning ""wherever you mention my Name."" See Rabbeinu Beḥayei on the verse.)  [I will come to you and I will bless you]” (Exodus 20:21).  Another matter, the Rabbis said: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘If you recited a blessing on the Torah, you recited the blessing for yourself.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “For with Me your days will be increased, and years of life will be added for you” (Proverbs 9:11). [God said:] ‘If you say, perhaps I gave you the Torah to your detriment; I gave it to you only for your benefit, as the ministering angels desired it, but it was vanished from them,’ as it is stated: “It is vanished from the eyes of all living” (Job 28:21) – these are the ""heavenly creatures,"" (See Ezekiel 1:5.)  “and hidden from the birds [umeof] of the heavens” (Job 28:21) – these are the angels. From where is it derived? (That the word ""birds"" can refer to angels.)  It is as it is stated: “One of the seraphim flew [vayaaf] to me” (Isaiah 6:6). He said to them [the Israelites]: ‘My children, it is hidden from the ministering angels, but from you it is not hidden,’ from what we read regarding the matter: “For this mitzva that I command you today, it is not hidden from you.”"
30,11,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Introduction of the Author 37","Afterwards, the Torah reduced all [religious] service to the service of the heart and tongue in saying ""For this commandment which I command you today is not hidden from you, neither is it far off; It is not in Heaven...But the matter is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it"" (Deut.30:11). And in the other books of the prophets, they spoke extensively on the matter and mentioned it in several places. I do not need to mention them because they are numerous and well-known. "
30,11,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:11:1","כי המצוה הזאת, “for this commandment, etc.” In this instance the word המצוה refers to the entire Torah, just as it did in Deut. 8,1 where the Torah spoke of כל המצוה.  לא נפלאת היא, “it is not hidden.” The Torah is not so mysterious and mystical that you cannot fulfill its commandments. This is why Moses added immediately: “it is not in heaven.” Neither is it beyond the ocean. All these comparisons are only variations of the words לא נפלאת. The ocean that Moses speaks about here is the great ocean, which is dark and beyond man’s ability to navigate (Ibn Ezra). Moses does not refer to seas which man is able to navigate [with the existing means of navigation, Ed.] The words compare such an ocean to “heaven,” neither of which is accessible to man."

For, all the matters elucidated in the Aleph Bet of Old are not remote and not distant (based on Deuteronomy 30:11) from the one studying them -- to come to its property, to understand and comprehend from where the items effuses. Albeit, without the Rav, who illuminated our eyes with these matters, it would not have occurred to the reader to extract these matters from within the holy books.

Re”m already answered this question in parshas Shoftim (above 17:8) on the verse If a matter of law is too abstruse (יפלא), [where] Rashi explains that הפלאה always denotes separation, or setting apart, etc. See there.

30,11,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:11:2,Perhaps the Torah refers to two factors which contribute to failure of Torah observance by the people. 1) Ignorance of what is written in the Torah. 2) The difficulty in keeping the commandments. Moses told the people that although prior to his going up on Mount Sinai the Torah had indeed been in the heavens it was no longer in heaven but accessible to all.
30,11,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:11:3,"He told the people that it was not in a distant land or across the sea, i.e. that although he personally had not been favoured by G'd to keep these commandments on holy soil, they would be more fortunate. When Moses asked the rhetorical question: ""it is not across the ocean so that you would have to ask who would cross the ocean to get the Torah for you,"" he lamented his own inability to even cross the Jordan to be able to keep the Torah commandments applicable on the other bank. He portrayed the Jordan as an insurmountable obstacle for him, much like crossing an ocean."
30,11,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:11:4,"Nonetheless, the principal meaning of this line is that there are no valid excuses for not observing Torah. It is easily accessible. "
30,11,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:11:5,"The reason the Torah added the word ""today"" is the imminence of the Israelites crossing the Jordan."
30,14,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Introduction 27","We read in Deut. 30, 11-14: ""Surely, this Instruction which I enjoin you this day is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond reach. It is not in the heavens that you should say 'who among us can go up to the heavens and get it for us and impart it to us that we may observe it?' Neither is it beyond the sea that you should say 'who among us can cross to the other side of the sea and get it for us and impart it to us, that we may observe it?' No, the thing is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart to observe it.' The verses above reveal all that I have written concerning observance as well as vicarious observance of the Torah laws, i.e. that everyone is obligated to fulfill all the 613 commandments.

The regulations that apply to the Nazirite however, are stricter than those that apply to the Priest. The Priest attained the status of holiness only by being anointed with holy oil, whereas the Nazirite attained this status merely through his vow. This needs explanation. Once we explain this, the introductory words of the Torah איש כי יפליא נדר לה', ""if someone expresses the special desire to vow a vow of Nazirdom to G–d,” may also become clearer. The meaning of the word מופלא, is ""hidden, concealed."" A similar example in the Torah is Deut.30,11, ""It is not concealed from you, not inaccessible."" "

Therefore, answer him, “Even where you are! You are immersed in the abode of the evil forces, yet, there too you can find His Godliness.” This is because He gives life to everything, as in, “You keep them all alive.” And from there, you can attach yourself to God and return to Him in complete repentance.

30,11,Halakhah,"Shev Shmateta, Introduction 22","(Kof) “Robbing an ordinary person is more severe than robbing the Most High, (i.e., taking consecrated property). As with [robbing an ordinary person, the Torah] has sin precede me’ilah (trespass), [whereas with robbing the Most High], it has me’ilah preceding sin.” With robbing an ordinary person, it is written (Lev. 5:21), “If any one sin, and commit a trespass, etc.” But with one who misuses consecrated items, it is written (Lev. 5:15), “If any one trespasses in misuse (timol ma’al) and sins unwittingly, etc.” And this is a statement of Rabbi Levi in the chapter [entitled] HaSfina (Bava Batra ). (Only the first part of this appears in our standard text of the Talmud, but the meaning is the same.)  And it requires explanation – as [just] because it had sin precede me’ilah, [does that mean] it is more severe? As both [terms] appear in both.  And it appears to me that it can be explained according to that which is written by Rabbi Yitschak Arama in Parashat Chukkat of Akeidat Yitschak, that even the most complete person sins in something, etc. Indeed, he is compelled by his nature, as the verse states (Ecclesiastes 7:20), “For there is no man who is righteous in the world [… who does not sin].” But when it is in the manner of either being from the light sins or after complete repentance, he will certainly not be punished; as the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Rosh Hashanah 12b) “I am He before he sins, and I am He after he sins and repents.” (The Talmud (the wording of which is slightly different than the quote) is referring to God’s attributes of mercy in Exod. 34:6).)  However we do not understand from this that no sinner is ever punished. As even though – in his not being God – he is compelled to sin, he is not compelled to wallow in sin and have it become habitual. See there.  And [so] it is elucidated that man is not fitting to be punished for sinning, since he is compelled to it – and especially if it is from the lighter sins. Rather the main punishment comes in his wallowing in it and making it habitual, and not repenting.  As anyone [can repent]; as it is written (Deut. 30:11), “it is not a wonder […] and not distant, etc.” – and the Sages, may their memory be blessed, say this is referring to repentance. (The first known source for this is actually Ramban on this verse.)  And that is because while the [fulfillment of all the] actual commandments [is] a wonder for man and distant from him since he is a man and not divine, and is [so] compelled to sin – especially with the lighter sins – he is not compelled to wallow in them and make them habitual. And he needs to regret and repent, [as] the commandment of repentance is not a wonder and distant. And it is because of this that Rabbi Levi decides that stealing from an ordinary person is more severe than from the Most High. For with stealing from the Most High, [the Torah] had trespass precede sin; as since it is from the lighter sins, it is not called a sin for a man, given that “there is no man who is righteous in the world who only does good.” And the main sin [here] is because he wallows in it and does not immediately regret [it] after doing it. And that is why it has trespass before sin; as the sin is [afterwards] when he does not regret [it]. For this reason, it is written (Num. 5:7), “and they shall confess,” (In another section dealing with misusing sanctified property.)  such that they shall repent. But the trespass itself is not in the category of sin, since man is compelled to do such a light sin; which is not the case with robbing an ordinary person. [As] that is more severe, since a man can withstand [its temptation]. Even though he is not divine, he is not compelled to rob his fellow – [something that is] in the category of friendship and brotherhood. Hence with robbing an ordinary person, the trespass itself is the sin. And for this reason it had sin precede trespass."
30,14,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part III 10:25","Therefore, the correct interpretation [of la’asoso”] is [“to create it,”] which refers to the deep [analysis] of the halachah that is incumbent upon you to infer, [even though] it is distant from you. As explained in the above-mentioned reference, (The verses in Deut. 30:11–14 are elaborated further in Eruvin 54b–55a: “R. Eliezer said: [The verse] ‘You shall call understanding modah [a relative]’ [Prov. 7:14] teaches one to make signs for the Torah. Rava said: ‘[This teaches one] to set moadim [times] for Torah study.’ And this is what was stated by Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa, What is the meaning of what Scripture states: ‘It is not in the heavens… nor is it across the sea’? [The words], ‘It is not in the heavens’] implies that if it were in the heavens, you would be required to go up in pursuit of it; and if it were across the sea, you would have to cross the sea in pursuit of it.” The She’iltos explains that Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa is saying that if a Talmud scholar has a teacher who lives overseas, he is required to travel overseas in order to study from him. The Netziv writes that the She’iltos understands that we infer from the verse in Proverbs that since one achieves understanding mainly by studying daily with a rabbi, it is important to set times for Torah study – that is, to organize classes. Since the Talmud connects the inference from Proverbs to Deuteronomy, the She’iltos understands Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa to be stating that Deuteronomy is exhorting one to study from his rabbi even if it means that he must travel to his rabbi who lives overseas. The Netziv explains that the verses in Deuteronomy state further that if “it is in the heavens” – if the Torah seems to be too holy and difficult to grasp – we must discuss it aloud with others and apply deep analysis. As stated in Proverbs according to R. Eliezer: “Make signs for the Torah” – in other words, devise and pursue whatever strategy is necessary to understand and grasp the Torah.)  you may think that it is in the heavens or overseas. In other words, it may appear to you [to be impossible] to produce laws from deep analysis [by yourselves], and thus it is as if [these laws] were in the heavens. Or [you may think] that you will have to travel overseas [to find] a rabbi who has already learned these laws. Therefore, Scripture states that this is not so. Rather, it is within the ability of your mouth and heart to produce these matters of halachah. The interpretation of la’asos is similar to the way we previously explained [in chapter 8], “good understanding to all oseihem (who perform them),’ (Psalms 111:10.)  where [oseihem should be translated as “make them”], i.e., to produce the halachah. (Therefore, the verse is to be translated as, “It is with your mouth and your heart to produce it.”)  Thus, one can explain that the words “and your heart” is tied to “and your mouth”; the speech [of Torah study] should be with the toil of the flesh, influencing the heart [understanding], and this is how one brings the halachah to light. This is the interpretation of the Midrash which infers [from: “For by the mouth of these words’ (Ex. 34:27. Usually translated as, “for according to these words.”) ] that one must toil [in the Torah with one’s mouth]."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,11,Commentary,"Tze'enah Ure'enah, Nitzavim 14-23","“It is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond your reach” [30:11]. The verse teaches us that the Torah is easy for the people to learn, since one can learn Torah with one’s mouth and heart. One does not have to go to heaven or across the sea for the Torah. Therefore, it says here, “in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it” [30:14]. Since all the commandments are in these three. The first is to speak Torah with the mouth. The second is to think that God is one with his heart. The third is that one must go to fulfill commandments. Concerning this, our sages said: the world stands on three things. On Torah, this is speaking with the mouth, and on prayer, this is having good thoughts for God in one’s heart, and charity, that one must do with one’s money. (Bahya, Deuteronomy, 30:14.)  Ramban writes. This verse teaches us about repentance that it is easy for the person, but with mouth and heart to have good thoughts of regret. Therefore, it says here, “the thing is very close to you in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it” [30:14]. (Ramban, Deuteronomy, 30:11.)  Therefore, it also says here, “see, I set before you this day life and prosperity” [30:15]. (From here to the end of this Torah portion is drawn from, Aboab, Menorat ha-Maor, Ner 5, Klal 1, Helek 1, Perek 1–3.)  That is to say, see before you the day that is written for a person to live, for life and good and for death and evil. Therefore, think to repent. The time comes that God accepts the repentance of the person. Therefore, one must begin to remind people about repentance. It is known that repentance among people is divided into seven parts. The first repentance and the best repentance is that the person repents as soon as he committed the sin. He repents for it and has regret for it. Concerning this repentance, the Talmud says in chapter ten [in tractate Sanhedrin], that in the place where the penitents stand in the Garden of Eden, even the greatest righteous people cannot stand there, since the place of the penitents in the Garden of Eden is higher than that of the righteous. (B. Sanhedrin, 99a.)  The righteous person who never had any desire for a prostitute, since he was very careful to separate himself from women, it is no novelty that he did not solicit a prostitute. However, the evildoer who was accustomed to go to prostitutes and he repents. He accustoms himself and when he has the opportunity to go after prostitutes, he compels his evil inclination and afflicts his body, since he does not want to go to prostitutes. He has a great reward from the Holy One and his place in the Garden of Eden is greater than that of all the righteous ones. Some rabbis say that the penitent stands in such a place in the Garden of Eden where no righteous person should stand. That is to say, the penitent must have a different path where he should go to the Holy One in the Garden of Eden, since on the way, before he comes to the Holy One, there are many evil angels who do not want to allow the penitent to go before the Holy One. They say to him: you have committed great sins. You are not worthy to come before the Holy One. Thus, the Holy One must make him a different path, not where the other righteous people go before the Holy One, expecting that he should miss these evil angels. The Holy One is compassionate and wants that people should repent. Concerning this, Rabbi Abahu said: where the penitents stand, no righteous people stand in that place, (B. Berakhot, 34b.)  since the Holy One makes a separate place for the penitents. The penitents soon have regret for their sins. This is the best repentance among the seven parts that we will write about. This means that the penitent had a desire for such sins that the intellect itself did not think of, like illicit sex with a married woman, since it was contemptible. The person said: it is not wrong, but the evildoer has a desire for such sins and refrains for the sake of God, because God has forbidden it. Therefore, his reward from the Holy One is great. His intellect thinks that it is not wrong, but when he desires to kill or maim people and to rob and steal, the person himself could think on his own that killing is wrong, even if the Torah had not forbidden it. Therefore, when the person desires to commit these sins and he stops himself and does not do them, his reward is not as great, since what kind of novelty is it that he does not do it? His intellect does not allow him to do it, even if the Torah had not forbidden it. The second group of penitents is when someone is full of sins all of his days and recognizes in his youth to repent and has regret when he is young. The evil inclination burns very strongly in a young person, more than in an old person from whom the evil inclination has departed. However, when he is young and has committed a sin a number of times and he desires to do it again and can do it again, but if he leaves the sin for the sake of the Holy One and not do it, as the Talmud says in [tractate Yoma] chapter eight. Who is called a penitent? Rabbi Judah said: when he is still young and has previously committed the same sin with the same woman and he does not do it again, he is called a penitent. (B. Yoma, 86b.)  The third group is when he is young and strong. When the sin is not before him, as in the previous case, or he is ashamed and removes himself from doing it, this is also a form of repentance that the Holy One accepts. Concerning this, the Talmud says in the first chapter of [tractate] Avodah Zara. “Happy is the man who fears the Lord” [Psalms, 112:1]. Rabbi Amram said: happy is the man who fears God, when he is a man and is strong and young. Therefore, the verse says, man. That is to say, a young and strong man. (B. Avodah Zara, 19a.)  The fourth attribute of repentance. He commits no sin because he fears troubles and people who would punish him, as we find concerning the city of Nineveh. They did not repent until they were punished and Jonah made the people afraid that the city of Nineveh would be destroyed in forty days. They immediately repented out of fear, yet the Holy One accepted their repentance because they had regret. Thus, the Holy One accepted their prayer and repentance, as the Talmud says in [tractate Ta’anit] chapter two. The one who dons a sack or fasts does not help much, but repentance and good deeds do help, as the verse says concerning the city of Nineveh, “God saw what they did, how they were turning back from their evil days” [Jonah, 3:10]. (B. Ta’anit, 16a.)  This means, the Holy One saw their good deeds and they had regret for their evil deeds, but fasting and donning a sack were not mentioned. The fifth attribute of repentance is when someone has regret for his sins because he has troubles, yet the Holy One accepts his repentance, as the verse says, “when you are in distress because all these things have befallen you and in the end, return to the Lord your God” [Deuteronomy, 4:30]. This means, when you will have troubles and you will repent, the Holy One will forgive you. The sixth form of repentance is when he is old and does not have the strength to commit sins. He has regret even for the sins that he committed when he was young. When he repents with his whole heart, the Holy One accepts the repentance, as the verse says, “you return man to dust” [Psalms, 90:3]. This means, you should repent when you are old and have no more strength. Though you are buffeted and broken; yet the Holy One will accept your repentance. Concerning this, the Talmud says in the first chapter of [tractate] Kiddushin. Rabbi Simeon said: a righteous person who is righteous all his life and in his last days he becomes evil, he has lost all of his merits, as the verse says “the righteousness of the righteous shall not save him when he transgresses” [Ezekiel, 33:12]. (B. Kiddushin, 40b.)  This means, the righteous deeds that the righteous person did for a long time do not help when he becomes an evildoer in the end. When somebody was an evildoer all of his days and he becomes righteous, his earlier sins are wiped out, as the verse says, “nor shall the wickedness of the wicked cause him to stumble when he turns back from his wickedness” [Ezekiel, 33:12]. This means, the sins of the evildoer are not remembered when he repents for his earlier sins and regrets the sins that he had committed for a long time. The seventh form of repentance is when he has no regret all of his days, but when he sees that he is close to death, then he has regret and repents now, when he is about to die. This repentance is very small and the worst form of repentance of all the forms of repentance, yet the Holy One accepts it, as the Talmud says in [tractate Shabbat], chapter two. When the person is still healthy he should let himself think that he has been called before a judge, and that he must die the way he will defend himself. If he has become sick, then he should let himself think as if he has been imprisoned. When he is lying in bed and ill, he should let himself think that he is being led out to be put to death. When he has many good intercessors, then he might be protected. (B. Shabbat, 32a.)  However, when it is not so, he must die. However, when the person repents when he is about to die with his whole heart and has regret, the Holy One forgives his sins. However, when the person dies and has no regret for his sins, then he goes into Gehenna forever. Concerning this, King Solomon said: “for there is no action, no reasoning, no learning, no wisdom in Sheol, where you are going” [Ecclesiastes, 9:10]. This means, when you can repent in this world, do it soon, before you will die, since in the depths of Gehenna there are no good deeds and no repentance. Therefore, the prophet wrote, “turn back from your evil ways, that you may not die, O House of Israel” [Ezekiel, 33:11]. That is to say, repent before you will die, and when you repent, the Holy One will forgive you. It is known that the penitents are divided into five parts. It is like five groups that are traveling on a ship on the sea. They travel for a long time and cannot reach the shore. A day comes when the wind blows strongly and leads the ship onto a mountain in the sea. It is surrounded on all four sides by the sea and there are beautiful trees with many varieties of good fruit on that mountain. There are also very nice fountains on that mountain and the people enjoyed themselves very much there. There were five groups on the ship. One group thought to itself. How can we leave the ship and go onto the mountain? Perhaps a strong wind might come and carry away the ship, and we will be stranded on the island and will die. Should we be lost for the sake of fruits and other delights? They did not want to leave the ship. The second group went a short distance from the ship and did not tarry long and soon went back to the ship and took their places in the ship. The third group leaves the ship and goes out onto the mountain and eats good fruits until a wind comes and the ship’s crew trumpet that they should come back to the ship. This group runs quickly to the ship, but they find it is tight in the ship since other people were sitting in their seats. The fourth group is those who eat and drink good fruits on the mountain for a long time. They go all over the mountain for a long time to see everything and when they trumpet from the ship, this group says: they first have to raise the sails; we will remain for a while. When they raise the sail, this group says that they will eat first. They tell the crew: we will remain for a while and eat and drink on the mountain, until they see the ship moving away from the mountain. This group says: if we tarry a bit longer, we will not be able to get to the ship. They immediately run to the ship and have to go into the water up to their necks, since the ship had left the port. They come into the ship and find their place is very tight. They have lost their place. The fifth group eats and drinks on the mountain and do not think about coming to the ship. The ship left long ago and they must remain on the island. Winter comes and it is very cold and all the fruits fall off and wild animals come after them and they are all killed and destroyed. So too is the person in this world. The good deeds are like the ship. When the person goes in a good way, this way leads him to the world to come. So is the first group of people, the very righteous who never committed sins. They do not follow the evil inclination, but they study day and night and watch their place. They do not go onto the mountain of delights, which are the sins. The second group from the ship is those who went to the garden on the mountain and run back to the ship. So are some people who go a little after the evil inclination and soon report, because they are still young and this is the best repentance. The third group goes onto the mountain, but when they hear the trumpet from the ship, they quickly run back to the ship. So are some people who do not repent until they are old and they see that their time is short; then they repent. He is afraid that he will die without repentance, and even though they repent, they find their place in the Garden of Eden to be cramped. The fourth group is those who remained on the mountain until the ship began to leave, and had to go into the water up to their necks. So too are the people who do not repent until they are about to die. He is afraid of death, and even though the repentance helps, yet his place in the Garden of Eden is very cramped. The fifth group is those who remain on the mountain forever. So too are some people who do not repent and they die without repentance. They come into Gehenna, into the great fire. The Midrash also writes this. “Who cries, woe! Who, alas!” [Proverbs, 23:29]. (Tanna Debe Eliyahu Rabba, end of ch. 15.)  This means, to whom is it woe and alas? To those who leave behind much money and take many sins with them into the grave. They are those who gather much money unjustly and do not properly give charity from it. He does not want to have guests in his house, and he does not lend money to the poor. When the person dies, the charity and good deeds accompany him, and he must leave the silver behind. (Aboab, Menorat ha-Maor, Ner 5, Klal 1, Helek 1, Perek 1–3, ends here.) "
30,11,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 8:7,"“Rather the matter is very near to you” – Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Naḥman said: To what is the matter comparable? It is to the daughter of a king whom no person knew. The king had a certain friend who would enter to the king all the time, and the king’s daughter was standing before him. The king said to him: ‘See how beloved you are to me, as there is no creature who knows my daughter, and she stands before you.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘See how beloved you are to me, as there is no creature in my palace who knows the Torah, and I gave it to you,’ as it is stated: “It is vanished from the eyes of all living” (Job 28:21) . But you, “it is not hidden from you,” (Deuteronomy 30:11), but rather, “the matter is very near to you” (Deuteronomy 30:14). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘My children, if the matters of Torah are near to you, I call you near as well, as so it is written: “For the children of Israel, the people who are near to Him. Halleluya”’ (Psalms 148:14)."
30,11,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol VI, Chapter 7 New York City Water 88","How did Hafez Hayyim become aware of the fact that his cow had developed adhesions? Certainly not on the basis of some prophetic inspiration. Had such information been revealed to him, presumably he would have been duty-bound to inform his family so that they not inadvertently fall into transgression. (Although the principle “it is not in heaven”(Deuteronomy 30:11) establishes that subsequent to revelation of the Torah at Sinai there will never be a supplemental revelation of halakhic information, that principle does not preclude prophetic revelation of factual information having halakhic ramifications. See R. Zevi Hirsch Chajes, Torat Nevi’im: Eleh ha-Miẓvot, chap. 2 and addendum to chap. 2, as well as R. Elchanan Wasserman, Kuntres Divrei Soferim (Pietrokow, 5684) no. 5, secs. 3-7. Republished in his Koveẓ Shi’urim, II (5720).)  There is a quite simple explanation for Hafez Hayyim's behavior. As animals age, they, no less so than humans, become prone to illness. Hafez Hayyim realized that his cow had reached a stage in bovine life at which disease and illness were more than remote possibilities. Concern for his spiritual welfare caused him to eschew milk that might be tainted with even the suspicion of spiritual harm. Was he halakhically required to act as he did? Certainly not. Unless empirically rebutted, the halakhic presumption that the majority of animals are not tereifot applies even to aging animals. Hafez Hayyim's avoidance of the milk of that particular cow reflected a finely-honed sensitivity to the possibility of transgression."
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 16:1:6,"Though man's original equipment is supplied by G-d, and though his eventual accomplishments are subject to G-d’s benevolent guidance or otherwise, the fact that he was created ""in the image of G-d,"" i.e. was given free choice, has made him the master of his own destiny. This means that he can achieve whatever he is capable of achieving since the means to do so have been placed at his disposal to use at his discretion. Once man begins to travel the path towards what his natural talents enable him to achieve, he can count on the active assistance of His Maker to facilitate his progress along that route. ""He who comes to purify, is extended help"" (Shabbat 104). This is what Moses meant when he said (Deut.30,11-14), ""This commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you....in fact it is quite close to you."" If one applies oneself properly to the truth of G-d’s revealed word, i.e the Torah, then appreciating it becomes a simple matter. From that point onwards there are no real impediments or difficulties in achieving one's aim. In this respect, the fortitude of Abraham surpassed that of anyone before him, since during the preceding generations people had become progressively more corrupt until they endangered the survival of their species. Even the few whose conduct at the time of their respective deaths merited a suspended sentence had failed to look toward heaven for inspiration to recognise their Creator. They were content merely not to question the tradition that G-d had indeed created the universe. Noach was such a person. His righteousness was tamim, whole, meaning he continued to believe what Lemech his father had believed and what both his father and his grandfather Methuselah had taught him. He made no intellectual effort to understand the basis for this belief or to develop it so that it would influence his personality development. ""IN HIS GENERATIONS,"" i.e. through successive generations his righteousness remained static, did not become dynamic. His heart was pure, but his intellect was not involved. In Deut. 18,14, we are told, ""Be whole with the Lord your G-d,"" that we are to accept the truths taught by our prophets. This means in particular that the request of the Jewish people at Mount Sinai to have Moses talk to them and be the intermediary between G-d and them would result in a perfect and enduring faith. The belief resulting from the experience of revelation is called emunah of a temimut quality. There are two ways of acquiring this absolute faith. The easy way is study of the Torah, a method granted to the Jewish people. The other way is via intellectual analysis, the only method available to man prior to the revelation at Mount Sinai. This method does not only require the determination of the truth seeker, but active help from G-d Himself. Those who in their search for understanding of this truth also employ all their intellectual faculties, arrive at a far deeper and lasting understanding. This is why David told his son Solomon, ""Now my son Solomon, know the G-d of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart, a willing soul"" (Chronicles I 28,9). Abraham's tremendous achievement was that though he did not have the tradition of a Noach since both his father and grandfather had been pagans (Joshua 24,2), he began to develop this faith through an intellectual approach. At first, he concentrated on demonstrating the complete bankruptcy of the belief held by his contemporaries. Afterwards, having travelled as far as it is possible to travel by means of one's intellect alone, with the help of G-d’s Personal Providence, he arrived at that level of faith in his Creator which the Torah describes as ""He believed in the Lord, and the Latter gave him credit for this"" (Genesis 15,6). Later, at the time of his cirumcision, Abraham would be asked, ""Walk in front of Me,"" to demonstrate a degree of faith that surpasses what his intellect can comprehend. In this way, he would outclass Noach who had only ""walked with G-d,"" his faith only keeping step with his intellectual faculties, never exceeding them. "
30,11,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 44:3:5,"In order to achieve maximum impact by His revelation at Mount Sinai, G-d resorted to extraordinary phenomena both before, during and after matan Torah, the presentation of the Torah to the people. This becomes evident when one studies the story of the Jewish people's arrival in the desert of Sinai. First we are told that they arrived in Sinai on the first day of the third month. Next, though we know that their last stop had been Refidim, the fact that they set out from Refidim and arrived in Sinai is repeated. Next it says that Moses ascended to G-d and called to Him from the Mountain. The order really should have been ""G-d called to Moses and the latter ascended."" From the manner of the text, it appears as if Moses was on a higher level than the one calling to him. Next we have the emphasis on the order of addressing Israel, ""thus you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel."" Furthermore, ""these are the words you shall speak to the children of Israel."" This suggests that Moses had no latitude in the words he could use. However, it is worth noting that anyone who has a major request of his fellow man would do well to pay attention to the following prerequisites in order to assure himself of an optimal chance of success. He must watch (a) timing, (b) place, (c) method of presentation of the request, (d) the ability of the party petitioned to grant the petition, (e) explain the advantages accruing to the petitioned party if he grants the petition. He must also bear in mind the position in society of the party petitioned. Queen Esther is a prime example of how all these points need to be heeded when she petitioned king Ahasverus. She chose the timing very carefully, saying ""tomorrow I shall do what the king says."" She chose the place, inviting him to lunch at her palace, so as to be undisturbed. She chose the method, i.e. wine, in order to put the king into a good frame of mind, and at the same time to make Haman relaxed and careless. She adhered to the order of priorities by begging for her own life first. Concerning the king's ability to deliver, and the advantage to him by granting her request, she said ""we have been sold, and the king stands to lose heavily financially."" In our situation, G-d demonstrates the same care in His request from Israel. The time chosen, the third month after the Exodus, allowed Israel to have recovered from the slavery experienced.They had been given ample opportunity to observe the way in which G-d had looked after their needs thus far. The mountain, frequently referred to as ""the mountain of G-d"", was meant to impress itself on those who beheld it. (by far the highest mountain in that part of the world). When one contrasts unpleasant memories with pleasant experiences, the latter seem much more impressive than when contrasted with everyday events. Since the events in Refidim had been exceptionally upsetting, mentioning the contrast of their departure from there with the arrival at Sinai, left an especially favourable impression. The site was well chosen, therefore. As far as how G-d’s request was related to the Jewish people, this was accomplished through the good offices of Moses who was the most suitable instrument, being someone who had reached the highest level of humanity without the benefit of Torah legislation. Concerning the exact formulation of the request, the word ""thus"" indicates that Moses indeed was not given any leeway in the precise wording he had to employ. The content of the message concentrated on reminding the addressee of prior events which have a bearing on his attitude. In this case, these would be G-d’s actions against Egypt, which form the background for His present request. There follows the purpose of the request, namely that Israel become a holy nation, a nation of priests, precious to the Lord etc. That such a carefully planned scenario elicited a favourable response from Israel is hardly surprising then. Although Moses relayed G-d’s request only to the elders, fearing that the nation as a whole might not be so responsive, the nation's response shows how effective G-d’s planning of this event had been. The wonderfully effective things G-d was going to do during the actual revelation is introduced by His saying to Moses ""here I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people will hear Me talk to you and will also believe in your leadership forever more"". The objective of becoming a ""holy nation"" by means of the mitzvot is described in Deuteronomy 30,11, as a very easily attainable goal. ""For this commandment is not so wonderfuL.it is easily achievable..up to your mouth and your heart to implement"". Our sages tell us that the Torah is so structured that even ""the empty ones among you are as full of mitzvot as pomegranates are full of pips"". This is so, because the mitzvot apply to our body's activities and do not require intellectual brilliance in order to be performed. "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 60:1:3,"In defining the relative merit of ""good,” it can be said that the greatest ""good"" is that which confers the greatest number of benefits on the greatest number of people, without at the same time restricting the rights of the individual. Sunlight and warmth which embraces all people in equal measure, is a greater ""good"" than candlelight for instance. The latter provides light for only a limited number of people, the candle is not available for everyone, but has to be paid for by someone. Compared to the bounty of government, whose wealth and ability is very limited when measured against the wealth of the Almighty, only G'd has the ability to provide for everyone from an inexhaustible reservoir. ""The Lord is good to All” (Psalms 145,9) This point is made by king Saul in Samuel I 22,7-8. He says that even if David had the best of intentions, he could not possibly grant everyone what they desire. Also, since the universe is constructed in a manner which makes each of its constituent parts indispensable to the proper functioning of the whole, the whole cannot merely be a multiplicity of components which each perform the identical function, and therefore are all of the same rank. To view the fact that some creatures appear more distinguished than others as proof of injustice, or to view the fact that parts of the body seem more precious than others, as proof of discrimination, is foolish. To arrive at the conclusion that these distinctions are the result of accident or lack of ability on the part of the Creator, is equally erroneous. ""And His mercy extends to all His creatures,"" (Psalms 145,9) Each part in creation is equipped to perform its allotted task in the grand scheme of the Creator. In spite of all the foregoing, G'd has bestowed special loving care on His people Israel. The yovel year legislation etc prevents permanent loss of a family's inheritance, i.e. landed wealth. Jews must not be given menial tasks to perform. He who sells himself, is punishable; the Torah takes a dim view of such action. In short, Torah legislation is aimed at preserving the lofty status of the Jewish nation at the time when that nation accepted Torah as its national constitution. Vayikra Rabbah 13, mentions that the food and drink legislation also aims at the purification of man, just as Torah legislation as such, aims at purifying and refining man by limiting his indiscrimate indulgence in pleasurable activities meant only to gratify his body. Yalkut Shimoni Bereshit 31, points out that ""he who wants to live, will die; he who is prepared to die, will live."" Whatever man denies himself in this world, will ensure his life in the eternal world. The more he indulges himself in this life, however, the more likely is he to forfeit his share of eternal life. The aggadah in Baba Batra 74, portraying G'd as castrating the male leviathan, and killing the female, salting away its flesh for consumption by the righteous in the world to come, may express a similar idea. The separate creation of the males and females may symbolise the defusion of the physical and the spiritual. If the most powerful union of body and spirit in this universe, (Leviathan) would be allowed to roam completely unfettered, they could destroy the entire civilisation, G'd forbid. If human intelligence were to be used exclusively to advance his materialistic aspirations, the results could be disastrous. Alternately, if the body would be used exclusively to advance the interests of the spirit, this would also be contrary to G'ds plan for His universe. Therefore, G'd insured the survival of both as separate entities. As such, both are able to make their respective contributions to G'ds overall design for the world, without being able to completely upset such design. Pursuing the same subject matter, Pessachim 119, relates a strange story. In the world of the future, G'd will prepare a meal for the righteous. After having eaten and drunk, the cup is offered to Abraham to lead the other guests in reciting grace. Abraham declines the honour, saying that since he had sired Ishmael, he did not think he deserved this honour. Using similar reasoning, also Isaac declines, seeing he had fathered Esau. Jacob too declines, citing the fact that he had married two sisters while they were both alive. (something that would be forbidden once the Torah had been revealed) Moses declines the honour, saying that he had not been found fit to enter the holy land. Joshua declines, saying that he had not been found worthy to have a son. When the cup was offered to David, he accepted. He proclaimed ""I shall raise the cup of salvation and call out in the name of the Lord."" What we learn from here is that self control is valued so highly, that David was considered worthy to recite grace more than his illustrious ancestors including prophets. He alone of all those present, had possessed an active yetzer hara, sensual urges. Even though he might have sinned, compared to the many temptations he had been exposed to throughout his life, his sins were insignificant. All the others present must be viewed as tzaddikim gemurim, saintly by nature. (compare our commentary on chapter 41) Esther, who had been the only one among all the contestants for Ahasverus' favour, who had not availed herself of every means to enhance her physical charms, was rewarded by becoming queen. This was precisely because she did not make demands on life. External circumstances play an important part in shaping one's character. ""The air of the land of Israel, makes wise."" (Baba Balra 158 ) Exposure to certain climates advances one's ability to absorb knowledge. Inhabitants of parts of the globe subject to extremes of heat or cold, reflect this in their general behaviour. Since the land of Israel was considered as possessing a superior climate, being called eretz hatzvee, the choicest of countries, its climate can bestow benefits on its inhabitants. Rabbi Tanchum in Vayikra Rabba 13, says that a doctor who had two patients only one of whom he diagnosed as capable of making a recovery, imposed a rigorous diet on the patient he thought had a chance to recover. He did not place any restrictions on the other patient. Similarly, Israel and the gentiles. Israel, which has its after life at stake, must ensure that its food habits are such that that this after life is not jeopardised. The gentiles, who have not qualified for such after life, do not need to impose any restrictions on their food intake, therefore. On no account is the legislation of forbidden foods to be seen in the context of contributing to or detracting from physical well being, bodily health. Chapter fourteen in Deuteronomy begins by listing the otherness of the Jewish people. ""You are children to the Lord your G'd; do not make incisions on your body when mourning the dead, neither make bald spots, because you are a holy nation...Do not eat anything which is an abomination."" With this preamble, the Torah introduces the legislation about forbidden foods. If this legislation had hygiene, sanitary considerations, as its objective, it would reduce Torah to being a medical textbook, and a very abbreviated one at that. This thought is intolerable, if only for the fact that many of the health hazards in certain foods could be neutralized by the use of spices and other preservatives. Since we observe many nations who do eat foods that we consider abominations, enjoy good health, it is clear that the legislation is not aimed at our physical health, but rather at our mental health. Such foods as are listed as forbidden, might drive out the holy spirit that dwells within each Jew. David asks the Lord in Psalm 51,13, ""do not take away Your holy spirit from me!"" Since our sages suggest that the names of certain forbidden animals symbolise characteristics of different nations, and since many of these nations did not exist at the time the legislation was formulated, it is clear that they felt that consuming certain foods would eventually leave its mark on the character of such people. Examples are gamal for the Babylonians; arnevet for the Creeks; shafan for the Medes. The fact that these names seem repeated unaccountably in scripture, gave rise to these interpretations. Since G'd had said to Moses concerning achievements of our individual goals in life ""it lies within your mouth and within your heart to accomplish,"" (Deut 30,11-14) it is no more than reasonable to include our food intake in that advice, i.e. ""within your mouth."" "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 65:1:12,"When perusing our Parshah, we are confronted with a number of difficulties. 1) In order to convince someone to work on perfecting himself, one would expect the demands to be made on such a person to increase gradually, not to shock the student by listing all the demands that are made upon him all at once. That this is sound psychology, is attested to by the Torah itself, where we read (Deuteronomy 30, 11-14)) ""for this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you, neither is it far away; it is not in Heaven so that you could say ""who shall go up to the Heavens for us and bring it to us? For it is very close at hand, in your mouth and in your heart to perform."" On the other hand, what can frighten someone off more than a command such as ""be holy for I am holy?"" 2) Why do the commandments in our Parshah that parallel the ten commandments appear in a different order? (""Honour your parents,"" is listed as the first instead of the fifth commandment; ""keep the Sabbath,"" is listed as number two instead of as number four. ""Do not worship idols,"" is listed in third position instead of in second place) 3) After the Torah has completed the list, and concluded by saying ""sanctify yourselves,"" (20,7) why begin once more with such commandments as ""not to curse parents, not to commit adultery etc?"" 4) Why is the matter of attaining holiness mentioned three times?

30,12,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Foundations of the Torah 9:1","It is clear and explicit in the Torah that it is [God's] commandment, remaining forever without change, addition, or diminishment, as [Deuteronomy 13:1] states: ""All these matters which I command to you, you shall be careful to perform. You may not add to it or diminish from it,"" and [Deuteronomy 29:28] states: ""What is revealed is for us and our children forever, to carry out all the words of this Torah."" This teaches that we are commanded to fulfill all the Torah's directives forever. It is also said: ""It is an everlasting statute for all your generations,"" and [Deuteronomy 30:12] states: ""It is not in the heavens."" This teaches that a prophet can no longer add a new precept [to the Torah]. Therefore, if a person will arise, whether Jew or gentile, and perform a sign or wonder and say that God sent him to: a) add a mitzvah, b) withdraw a mitzvah c) explain a mitzvah in a manner which differs from the tradition received from Moses, or d) if he says that the mitzvot commanded to the Jews are not forever, but rather were given for a limited time, he is a false prophet. He comes to deny the prophecy of Moses and should be executed by strangulation, because he dared to make statements in God's name which God never made. God, blessed be His name, commanded Moses that this commandment is for us and our children forever, and, God is not man that He speak falsely."

Do not read it Sima (put it) but read it Simana (its signs)."" When R. Tachlipha heard this in the West (Palestine), he told it to R. Abuhu, who said: ""Ye derive it from that passage, but we derive it from the following (Jer. 31, 20.) Set thyself up waymarks, i.e., set up way-marks to the Torah."" Whence do we know that the word Tziyun means marks? For it is written (Ez. 39, 15.) Then when anyone seeth a human bone, he will set up a 'Tziyun' around it."" R. Elazar said: ""[We know it] from the following, (Pr. 7, 4.) And call understanding thy kinswoman, i.e., make a kins-woman of the Torah."" Raba said: [This means] ""Set a fixed regular (Fol. 55a) time for the study of the Torah."" This also is intended by R. Abdimi b. Dosa, who spoke thus: ""What is meant by the passage (Deu. 30, 12.) It is not in heaven, neither is it beyond the sea. It is not in heaven means that even if it were in heaven, one would have to ascend to reach it; neither is it beyond the sea, i.e., even if it were beyond the sea, one would have to cross the sea to reach it."" Raba said: ""It is not in heaven, means that knowledge cannot be found in him who exalts himself [in wisdom] as high as the heavens; Neither is it beyond the sea, means that neither is it with him who considers his opinion as broad as the sea.""

"
30,12,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Bava Metzia 4:10","We are taught in a Mishnah: Concerning an oven which was separated and then it was pasted together by using sand between the lime sections. R. Eliezer declares it to be clean and the sages, unclean, (Ib. b) and this is the oven of a snake. What does this mean? Said R. Juda in the name of Samuel: ""It intimates that they encircled it with their evidence as a snake winds itself around an object."" In a Baraitha it was taught that R. Eliezer used every possible argument, but they were not accepted. Then he said: ""Let this carob-tree prove that the Halacha prevails as I state;"" the carob was [miraculously] thrown off to a distance of one hundred ells, and according to others four hundred ells. But they said: The carob proves nothing. He again said: ""Let, then, the spring of water prove that so the Halacha prevails."" The water then began to run backwards. But again the sages said that this proved nothing. He again said: ""Then, let the walls of the house of study prove that I am right."" The walls were about to fall. R. Joshua, however, rebuked them, saying: ""If the scholars of this college are discussing upon a Halacha, wherefore should ye interfere!"" They did not fall, out of respect for R. Joshua, but they did not become straight again, out of respect for R. Eliezer. (They consequently remain to this very day in the same condition). He said again: ""Let it be announced by the heavens that the Halacha pervails according to my statement,"" whereupon a heavenly voice was heard, saying: ""Why do you quarrel with R. Eliezer, whose opinion should prevail everywhere!"" R. Joshua then got up on his feet and proclaimed (Deut. 30, 12) The Law is not in the heavens. What is the meaning of The Law is not in the heavens? Said R. Jeremiah: ""It means, the Torah was given already to us on the Mount Sinai, and we do not care for a heavenly voice, since it is written in the Torah (Ex. 23, 2) To incline after the majority."" R. Nathan met Elijah [the Prophet] and questioned him: ""What did the Holy One, praised be He! do at that time"" [when R. Joshua proclaimed the above answer to the heavenly voice]? And he rejoined: ""He laughed and said, My children have overruled Me, My children have overruled Me."" It was said that on the same day all the cases of Levitical cleanliness, on which R. Eliezer decided that they were clean, were brought into the college and were destroyed by fire. And they cast a vote, and it was decided unanimously to bless him (to place him under the ban). The question arose, as to who should take the trouble to inform him. R. Akiba said: ""I will go [and inform him our decision] lest one who is not fit for such a message go and inform him suddenly, and he will destroy the world."" What did R. Akiba do? He dressed himself in black and wrapped himself with the same color, and sat at a distance of four ells from R. Eliezer. And to his question: ""Akiba, what is the matter?"" he answered: ""Rabbi! It seems to me that your colleagues have separated themselves from you."" Immediately thereupon, he (R. Eliezer) tore his garments, took off his shoes, and sat on the floor, and from his eyes tears began to flow. The world was then beaten a third in olives, a third in wheat, and a third in barley. According to others, even the dough which was already in the hands of the women, became spoiled. A Baraitha states that he was so great in that day that wherever R. Eliezer fixed his eye, it was burnt. And also Rabban Gamaliel, who had at that time been sailing, was in danger of being drowned in a stormy ocean, and he said: ""It seems to me that this storm is because of R. Eliezer b. Hurkanus."" He then arose and offered the following prayer: ""Sovereign of the Universe, it is known and revealed to Thee that neither for the sake of my honor nor for the honor of my father's house have I done so, but for Thy glory, so that [single-handed] quarrels shall not increase in Israel."" Whereupon the sea became quiet. Eima Shalum, the wife of R. Eliezer, was a sister of Rabban Gamaliel, and since that time she prevented her husband from falling upon his face. It happened, however, on a day which was the last of the month, and she erred, thinking that this day was the first of the month [in which the falling upon the face is not customary], according to others, a poor man knocked at the door and she was going to give him some bread, that he fell on his face, and when she returned and found her husband falling on his face, she said to him: ""Arise, you have already killed my brother!"" In the meantime it was heralded by the house of Rabban Gamaliel that he was dead, and to the question R. Eliezer asked her: ""Whence did you know this?"" she answered: ""I have a tradition from the house of my grandfather that all gates are closed for prayers, except for him who cries upon annoying."" "

[This applies] even if he performs a wonder, for he is coming to deny the Torah, which states: ""It is not in the heavens.""

30,12,Chasidut,"Kedushat Levi, Exodus, Yitro 25","Careful analysis of ‎Yitro’s words will show that he spoke of two separate acts of ‎‎“saving” the Jewish people. Yitro had heard not only about the ‎physical salvation the Israelites had experienced but also about ‎the manner in which the spirit of the Jewish people, a people ‎downtrodden by many years of slavery, had been transformed in a ‎short space of time to being the most steadfast people, afraid of ‎no human force on earth.‎ This brings us to another nuance in the exegesis in Shabbat ‎‎105 according to which the word ‎אנכי‎ is an acronym for the words ‎אנא נפשי כתבית יהבית‎, “I Myself have written it and handed it ‎over.” We know that another meaning of the word ‎נפש‎ is ‎רצון‎, ‎will, desire, as in Genesis 23,8: ‎אם יש את נפשכם‎, “if it is your desire, ‎etc.” The word ‎אנכי‎ accordingly sums up G’d’s message that by ‎committing the Torah to writing, He had expressed His will, and ‎desire. By handing over this document to the Jewish people, He ‎had authorized them to interpret it and to guide their lives by ‎means of these interpretations. Upon hearing this daring exegesis some people might ‎consider that G’d had taken a great chance that His people would ‎exploit this authority to pervert the Torah by “being victorious” ‎over Him. The reverse is true, however. G’d is pleased when as a ‎result of our delving more deeply into the hidden parts of the ‎Torah we discover heretofore unknown aspects of it. We have it ‎on the authority of Baba Metzia 59 where in a halachic ‎discussion among the various sages one of them called upon G’d ‎to demonstrate that his opinion was the correct one, and he ‎wanted the wall to collapse to prove this and the wall really began ‎to bend, that the opposing scholar quoted Deuteronomy 30,12 ‎where the Torah is described as not being a possession of heaven, ‎i.e. ‎לא בשמים היא‎, to stop the wall from falling. A heavenly voice ‎was heard by the people present exclaiming that ‎נצחוני בני מצחוני‎, ‎‎“My children have triumphed over Me, My children.” [Students ‎of that episode in the Talmud will find that that there are also ‎other interpretations of that episode. Ed.] Another quotation ‎from the Talmud Pessachim 119 reads as follows: the ‎opening words in psalms 4 ‎למנצח בנגינות מזמור לדוד‎, translated ‎literally, as “a psalm to the victor by David,” that the point David ‎is making is that whereas in interpersonal relations the loser in a ‎competition is downcast, not so when the contestants are man ‎and G’d respectively. It is G’d’s nature to rejoice in His children ‎having prevailed over Him.” As proof of this interpretation the ‎Talmud there quotes: psalms 106,23 ‎ויאמר להשמידם לולי משה בחירו ‏עמד בפרץ לפניו להשיב חמתו מהשחית‎, “He had already said that he ‎would destroy them, had not Moses His chosen, confronted Him ‎in the breach to avert His destructive wrath.” This reflects ‎another interpretation on Shabbat 105 where the introductory ‎words of the Ten Commandments are described as ‎אמירה נעימה ‏כתיבה יהבה‎, (compare page 431) When a son wins a game of chess ‎against his father for the first time, the father derives great ‎satisfaction of having taught his son so well. Similarly, if during a ‎discussion on the meaning of a certain verse in the Torah, the ‎‎“son,” i.e. one of the Torah scholars, has shown outstanding skill ‎and understanding of the Torah’s deeper meaning, the author, ‎G’d, derives great satisfaction from this.‎ Coming back to why G’d did not introduce the Ten ‎Commandments with reminding the listeners that He was the ‎Creator and therefore had preceded every other phenomenon in ‎the universe, but stressing that He had taken the Israelites out of ‎slavery in Egypt, G’d did so because he wanted to be on record ‎concerning His love for His people. He was certain that by doing ‎this He would reinforce the people’s enthusiasm to serve Him ‎rather than any other so-called deities. By using a play on words ‎‎[in the Hebrew language, Ed.] our author ‎considers the whole episode between slavery-physical ‎redemption, and now spiritual redemption of the Jewish people, ‎as turning ‎צרה‎ into ‎רצה‎, “suffering and distress into joy and ‎happiness.” Henceforth the Jewish people are always referred to ‎as G’d’s children [even when errant children, Ed.] ‎This factor is an overriding consideration in our relationship to ‎G’d. This also explains that G’d chooses to “live,” i.e. be at home ‎among the Jewish people after they build a Sanctuary for Him ‎here on earth. If, in spite of this, the Israelites were ever to turn ‎to idolatry, this sin would be ever so much harder to atone for.‎ ‎"
30,12,Chasidut,"Kedushat Levi, Deuteronomy, Vaetchanan 15","‎(Exodus 19,20) “The Lord descended on Mount ‎Sinai;”  The statement by our sages in B’rachot  5 that  ‎the yardsticks we apply to actions of human beings must not be ‎applied when the Torah appears to apply them also to actions by ‎G’d, is well known. The example quoted by the Talmud, describes ‎the average person selling some of his belongings as feeling ‎saddened that circumstances forced him to do so, while the buyer ‎is overjoyed to have come into possession of what had been ‎offered for sale. Not so with G’d. When He “sells” something, both ‎the buyer and the seller rejoice. When G’d “sold” His Torah to ‎Israel, He was happy that He had found someone worthy of ‎receiving that exclusive “merchandise.”‎ In Baba Metzia 59 there is an interesting statement in ‎connection with an ingenious construction of a certain baking ‎oven, the builders of which had found a way of protecting that ‎oven against contracting ritual pollution. In spite of the fact that ‎Rabbi Eliezer, the outstanding sage of the time, gave his blessing ‎to this oven, the majority of the sages outvoted him and declared ‎it as requiring the same procedures for purification that was ‎required for ordinary ovens if the latter had become polluted. ‎When Rabbi Eliezer invoked support for his opinion from celestial ‎sources and a heavenly voice proclaimed him as being correct in ‎his ruling, the other sages ignored that voice, saying that ever ‎since the Torah had been given to man, i.e. Moses and the Jewish ‎people, heaven no longer had a legal standing in how to interpret ‎it. This is also a practical example of the ability of the righteous ‎to override or reverse heavenly decrees. In the parlance of the ‎sages: ‎צדיק מושל ביראת אלוקים‎. There is a somewhat enigmatic ‎statement in Moed Katan 16 which reads as follows, based ‎on Samuel II 23,3 (David speaking) ‎אמר אלוקי ישראל  לי דבר צור ‏ישראל מושל באדם צדיק מושל יראת אלוקים‎. On the face of it, the ‎translation would go something like this: “the G’d of Israel has ‎spoken, the Rock of Israel said concerning me; He who rules men ‎justly, He who rules in awe of G’d.”‎ The Talmud, i.e. Rabbi Abahu after a short discussion, ‎explained the verse as follows: “the Rock of Israel spoke to me, ‎saying: “I rule man.” To the question of who “rules” G’d? David ‎was given the answer: “the tzaddik.” G’d then elaborated by ‎saying that  the tzaddik’s “rule,” meant that whereas He, ‎G’d, formulates decrees, the tzadddik by dint of his ‎relationship to G’d, ‎ביראת אלוקים‎, can reverse it.‎ Rabbi Abahu may have been inspired by our verse when the ‎Torah describes G’d as “descending” onto Mount Sinai, i.e. as ‎giving us the Torah, this may be understood as Israel, i.e. the elite ‎of Israel, the righteous having scored a victory over “Him.” In ‎commemoration of this the Talmud describes Moses as adding an ‎additional day to the preparations for receiving the Torah ‎‎(Compare Shabbat 87) Ordinarily, we would have presumed ‎that when G’d decreed two days of preparation i.e. ‎היום ומחר‎, ‎‎“today and tomorrow,” (Exodus 19,10) how could Moses arrogate ‎to himself the right to delay the giving of the Torah by an ‎additional day? Does G’d’s subsequent statement that He would ‎descend on the Mountain on the third day not signify that He ‎had accepted Moses’ addition of an extra day of sanctification? ‎‎(Exodus 19,11)‎ The answer is that Avraham had observed all the laws of the ‎Torah even in his own lifetime, without the Torah having been ‎revealed to him. (Compare Yuma 25) The Torah had been in ‎existence, according to Pessachim 54 and other ‎‎midrashim (2000 years) before G’d created the universe and ‎its letters had served G’d as “building blocks” for the universe. If ‎an Avraham could divine the contents of the Torah without ‎having had it revealed to him, Moses felt that if even at this stage ‎the Jewish people could only qualify for the giving of the Torah ‎after segregating themselves from their wives, that in order for ‎the Torah to become firmly ours, so that we could ignore the ‎interference of a heavenly voice if our interpretation of the Torah ‎would be challenged, an extra day of sanctification might ensure ‎this. By being able to do this, we would demonstrate that the ‎Torah is indeed not in heaven, as Moses told the people in ‎Deuteronomy 30,12. When G’d said that He would descend on ‎Mount Sinai only on the third day, He did not mean that He ‎would delay giving the Torah [after all we observe Shavuot ‎on the 6th day of Sivan Ed.] but that the Torah ‎would become truly the property of the Jewish people only on ‎that day. This is also what G’d had meant when He told the ‎people to be prepared “for three days.” (Exodus 19,15)‎"

30,12,Jewish Thought,"Kol Dodi Dofek, Missing the Appointed Hour 2","The well-known metaphysical query surfaces and the sufferer asks: “Why do you show me ‎iniquity ‎and cause [us] to behold mischief  …  for the wicked man besets the righteous, so that ‎justice goes ‎out perverted?” (Habakkuk 1:3–4).

For ‎‎“you cannot see ‎My face, for man may not see Me and live” (Exodus 33:20).

30,12,Quoting Commentary,Rambam Introduction to the Mishnah 7:49,"[This is] since Torah is not given after the first prophet, and there is nothing to add and nothing to subtract, as is is stated (Deuteronomy 30:12), ""'It is not in the heavens.'"" And we have not been permitted to learn from the prophets, but rather from the sages, the men of reasoning and discernment. It did not say, ""and you shall come to the prophet who will be at that time, but rather (Deuteronomy 17:9) ""and you shall come to the Levite priests, or the judge."" And the sages already spoke about this matter very much, and it is the truth. "
30,12,Chasidut,"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 7","“It is not in heaven, that you should say, who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it? Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us hear it, and do it? But the word is very near unto you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.” (Devarim, 30:12–14) The Holy Zohar (in Bamidbar 176 and other places,) tells us, “How precious are the words of Torah! This seems as if it is beyond the sea, and then it says some more supernal words of Torah, and it seems as if it is in the highest heavens.” This can be understood through what is written in the Tanna Dvei Eliyahu (Zuta, Ch. 12), “A parable. A mortal king builds a wall by way of which one enters vast palaces. In the wall, he opens a narrow passageway, so narrow that one who does not love the king will not exert himself to enter. Yet one who truly loves him will push himself for he knows that after difficulty, great delights await him.” So too here, where initially he not yet understood words of Torah, how high and precious they are. Then when one comes to the meaning of words of Torah, then “it is not in heaven, and not across the sea … but it is near unto you, in your mouth,” etc. Therefore, Moshe Rabeynu specifically wrote these words in this Parsha, which follows the fiftieth Parsha in the Torah, for then he had attained this level (the fiftieth gate of understanding), that of “it is not in heaven, but near.” This means that even though a man needs fences and boundaries while he does not yet understand words of Torah, once he understands them, he does not need this. “It is not across the sea,” that is to say, he does not need to be far from the delights of this world, which we call, “a sea,” for “sea” teaches of desire. Only at the beginning, for he can only initially enter into words of Torah through great restraint and separation from earthly delights, but this is not the main principle. The main principle is in the doing (the performance of God’s will). This is “in your mouth and in your heart to do it. This is the principle, as it is said in the Tikkunei Zohar (on what Isaac said to Yaakov), “‘make me tasty delights that I love’ [Bereshit, 27:4], these are positive mitzvot [that are done].” This is as it says in the Gemara (Ta’anit, 10a), “better a flooded land than a dry land.” It is good have even a little desire instilled in him and not to be completely dry, as we have explained on the verse (Mishlei, 19) “the desire of man is his kindness;” see there."
30,12,Talmud,Eruvin 55a:1,"And this idea, that one must exert great effort to retain one’s Torah knowledge, is in accordance with what Avdimi bar Ḥama bar Dosa said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “It is not in heaven…nor is it beyond the sea” (Deuteronomy 30:12–13)? “It is not in heaven” indicates that if it were in heaven, you would have to ascend after it, and if it were beyond the sea, you would have to cross after it, as one must expend whatever effort is necessary in order to study Torah."
30,12,Quoting Commentary,Rambam on Pirkei Avot 2:5:1,"A boor (bur) is one who does not have wisdom nor [proper] traits. And an ignorant person (literally, a man of the land - am haarets)  is one who does not have intellectual virtues but he would have some character virtues. And [the meaning of] a person prone to being ashamed is known. And an impatient person is one who is impatient about everything and gets angry. And the matter of striving is to accustom your soul and lead it to acquire the virtues. And since there are no wise men [there] to teach you, you should teach yourself. And the [Aramaic] translation of (Genesis 32:25), ""and a man struggled with him"" is ""and a man strived with him"" (Onkelos Genesis 32:25). And they said that the Torah is not found with men of pride and arrogance and not with those that go to far lands. And they supported this by way of a flourish with a verse and said (Eruvin 55a), ""'It is not in the heavens, that you should say, etc. Neither is it beyond the sea, etc.' (Deuteronomy 30:12-13)."" They said, ""It is not with the arrogant (who elevate themselves like the sky) and it is not with those that go across the sea."""
30,12,Responsa,"Iggerot HaRambam, Iggeret Teiman 11","In your letter you mention that the apostle has spurred on a number of people to believe that several verses in Scripture allude to the Madman, such as ""bimeod meod""5 (Genesis 17:20), ""he shined forth from Mount Paran""6 (Deuteronomy 33:1), ""a prophet from the midst of thee"" (Deuteronomy 18:15), and the promise to Ishmael ""I will make him a great nation"" (Genesis 17:20). These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; nay, to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. For these are not matters that can confuse the minds of anyone. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them, believe in them or entertain any illusions about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. But the Muslims themselves put no faith in their own arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so fallacious. Inasmuch as the Muslims could not find a single proof in the entire Bible nor a reference or possible allusion to their prophet which they could utilize, they were compelled to accuse us saying, ""You have altered the text of the Torah, and expunged every trace of the name of Mohammed therefrom."" They could find nothing stronger than this ignominious argument the falsity of which is easily demonstrated to one and all by the following facts. First, Scripture was translated into Syriac, Greek, Persian and Latin hundreds of years before the appearance of Mohammed. Secondly, there is a uniform tradition as to the text of the Bible both in the East and the West, with the result that no differences in the text exist at all, not even in the vocalization, for they are all correct. Nor do any differences effecting the meaning exist. The motive for their accusation lies therefore, in the absence of any allusion to Mohammed in the Torah. The phrase ""a great nation"" cited above does not connote a people in possession of prophecy or a Law, but merely one large in numbers just as in reference to idolaters Scripture says ""nations greater and mightier than yourselves."" (Deuteronomy 11:23). Similarly, the phrase ""bimeod meod"" simply signifies ""exceedingly."" Were there any allusion in the verse to Mohammed, then it would have read ""and I shall bless him bimeod meod,"" and whoever likes to hang on to a spider's web might then discover a reference to Mohammed therein. As it is, since Scripture says ""I shall increase him bimeod meod,"" it can only denote an extravagant increment in numbers. There is no question that the Divine assurance to Abraham to bless his descendants, to reveal the Torah to them, and to make them the Chosen People, refers only to the offspring of Isaac. For Ishmael is mentioned as an adjunct and appendage in the blessing of Isaac, which reads ""and also of the son of the bond-woman will I make a nation."" (Genesis 21:13). This verse suggests that Isaac holds a primary position and Ishmael a subordinate place. This point is made even more explicit in the blessing which ignores Ishmael entirely. ""For in Isaac shall seed be called in thee."" (Genesis 21:12). The meaning of God's promise to Abraham is that the issue of Ishmael will be vast in numbers but neither pre-eminent nor the object of divine favor, nor distinguished for the attainment of excellence. Not because of them will Abraham be famed or celebrated, but by the noted and illustrious scions of Isaac. The phrase ""shall be called"" simply means, shall be renowned, as it does in the verse, ""Let thy name be called in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac."" (Genesis 48:16). Other verses also indicate that when God promised Abraham that His law would be vouchsafed to his children as is implied in the words ""And I will be their God"" (Genesis 17:8), He meant Isaac to the exclusion of Ishmael as is intimated in the declaration ""But My covenant will I establish with Isaac"" (Genesis 17:21), although He had already conferred His favor upon Ishmael when He said ""Behold I have blessed him"" (Genesis 17:20). Similarly, Isaac by bestowing the blessing of Abraham upon Jacob exclusively, debarred Esau from it, as we read in his benediction ""And may He give you the blessing of Abraham"" (Genesis 28:4). To sum up, the Divine covenant made with Abraham to grant the sublime Law to his descendants referred exclusively to those who belonged to the stock of both Isaac and Jacob. Hence the prophet expresses his gratitude to God for ""the covenant which He made with Abraham, and His oath unto Isaac, which He established unto Jacob for a statute, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant."" (Psalms 105:9, I Chronicles 16:16). It is also to be noted that the name of the Arabian prophet which the Mahommedans believe to be mentioned in the Torah, by way of allusion, which the Jewish apostates find in the phrase ""bimeod meod,"" is A.H.M.D. and not M.H.M.D. So it is explicitly stated in the Koran: ""They find him mentioned in the Torah and the Gospels (Sura 7:156); his name is Ahmad."" But the numerical value7 of the latter is not equal to that of the words ""bimeod meod"" which is supposed to contain an allusion to the prophet of Islam. The argument from the phrase ""He shined forth from Mount Paran"" (Deuteronomy 33:2) is easily refutable. Shined is past tense. Had Scripture employed the future tense ""he will shine forth from Mount Paran"" then the imposters might have had a semblance of truth on their side. However the use of the past tense ""he shined forth"" demonstrates that this phrase describes an event that has taken place, namely the theophany on Sinai. When the Deity was about to reveal Himself on Sinai, the heavenly light did not descend suddenly like a thunder-bolt, but came down gently, manifesting itself gradually first from the top of one mountain, then from another, until He reached His abode on Sinai. This notion is implied in the verse ""The Lord revealed himself at Sinai, after His light had radiated to them from Seir and glimmered from Mount Paran."" (Deuteronomy 33:2). Mark well, that the phrase ""unto them"" refers to Israel. Note also how Scripture indicates the various gradations in the intensity of the Divine Splendor. It speaks of the light that glimmered from Mount Paran which is further removed from Sinai, but of the light that radiated from Mount Seir, which is nearer to it, and finally of the revelation of the full splendor of God on Sinai which was the goal of the theophany as is related in the verse ""And the glory of God abode on Mount Sinai"" (Exodus 24:16), ""and the Lord came from Sinai"". (Deuteronomy 33:2). Similarly, the idea that the light descended gradually from mountain to mountain is conveyed in Deborah's description of the grandeur of Israel at the Revelation on Sinai when she exclaimed ""Lord when Thou didst go forth out of Seir, when Thou didst march out of the field of Edom"" (Judges 5:4). Our sages of blessed memory, tell us that God, may He be praised and exalted, charged a prophet before the time of Moses to go to the Romans and another to go to the Arabs with the purpose of presenting them the Torah, but each of them in turn spurned it. When Moses was later sent to us we signified our acceptance in the words ""All that the Lord hath spoken will we do, and obey"" (Exodus 24:7). The aforementioned event happened before the Sinaitic Revelation, consequently Scripture speaks in the past tense: ""He came, radiated forth, and shone,"" which proves that no prophecy is intended in these words."" You write in your letter, that some people were duped by the argument that Mohammed is alluded to in the verse ""A prophet will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren"" (Deuteronomy 18:15), while others remained unconvinced because of the phrase ""from the midst of thee."" It is most astonishing that some folks should be deluded by such specious proof, while others were almost persuaded, were it not for the phrase ""from the midst of thee."" Under these circumstance it is incumbent upon you to concentrate and understand my view in the matter. Remember that it is not right to take a passage out of its context and to draw inferences from it. It is imperative to take into consideration the preceding and following statements in order to fathom the writer's meaning and purpose before making any deductions. Were it otherwise, then it would be possible to assert that Scripture has prohibited obedience to any prophet, and interdicted belief in miracles, by quoting the verse, ""Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet,"" (Deuteronomy 13:4). It could likewise be affirmed that a positive command exists requiring us to worship idols, by citing the verse ""And ye shall serve other gods"" (Deuteronomy 11:16). Other illustrations could be multiplied ad libidinem. To sum up, it is wrong to interpret any given verse apart from its context. In order to comprehend unequivocally the verse under discussion namely, ""A prophet will the Lord thy God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren,"" it is necessary to ascertain its context. The beginning of the paragraph whence the verse is taken, contains prohibitions of the acts of soothsaying, augury, divination, astrology, sorcery, incantation and the like. The Gentiles believe that through these practices they can predict the future course of events and take the necessary precautions to forestall them. The interdiction of these occult proceedings were accompanied with the explanation that the Gentiles believe they can depend upon them to determine future happenings. But you may not do so. You will learn about the time to come from a prophet who will rise up among you, whose predictions will come true without fail. You will thus arrive at a foreknowledge of circumstances without being obliged to resort to augury, divination, astrology and the like, for he will spare you that. Matters will be facilitated for you by the fact that this prophet will live within your borders. You will not be compelled to go in search after him from country to country, nor to travel to distant parts, as is implied in the phrase, ""from the midst of thee."" Moreover, another notion is conveyed in the words ""from the midst of thee from thy brethren like unto me,"" namely, that he will be one of you, that is, a Jew. The obvious deduction is that you shall be distinguished above all others for the sole possession of prophecy. The words ""like unto me"" were specifically added to indicate that only the descendants of Jacob are meant. For the phrase ""of thy brethren"" by itself might have been misunderstood and taken to refer also to Esau and Ishmael, since we do find Israel addressing Esau as brother, for example, in the verse, ""Thus saith thy brother Israel"" (Numbers 20:14). On the other hand, the words ""like unto me,"" do not denote a prophet as great as Moses, for this interpretation is precluded by the statement ""And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses."" (Deuteronomy 34:10). The general drift of the chapter points to the correctness of our interpretation and will be confirmed by the succession of the verses, to wit ""There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire etc.,"" (Deuteronomy 18:10), ""For these nations, that thou art to dispossess, hearken unto soothsayers, and unto diviners; but as for thee, the Lord thy God hath not suffered thee so to do ."" (Verse 14). ""A prophet will the Lord why [sic] God raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of they brethren, like unto me,"" (Verse 15). It is obviously clear that the prophet alluded to here will not be a person who will produce a new law, or found a new religion. He will merely enable us to dispense with diviners and astrologers, and will be available for consultation concerning anything that may befall us, just as the Gentiles confer with soothsayers and prognosticators. Thus we find Saul advising with Samuel concerning his lost asses, as we read, ""Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said: 'Come and let us go to the seer'; for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer."" (Samuel 9:9). Our disbelief in the prophecy of Omar and Zeid8 is not due to the fact that they are non-Jews, as the unlettered folk imagine, and in consequence of which they are compelled to justify their standpoint by the Biblical statement ""from thy midst, out of thy brethren."" For Job, Zophar, Bildad, Eliphaz, and Elihu are all considered prophets and are non-Jews. On the other hand, although Hananiah, the son of Azur was a Jew, he was deemed an accursed and false prophet. Whether one should yield credence to a prophet or not depends upon the nature of his doctrines, and not upon his race, as we shall explain presently. Our ancestors have witnessed Moses, our Teacher, foremost among the prophets, holding a colloquy with the Divinity, reposed implicit faith in him when they said to him, ""Go thou near and hear,"" (Deuteronomy 5:24). Now he assured us that no other law remained in heaven that would subsequently be revealed, nor would there even be another Divine dispensation, as the verse, ""It is not in heaven,"" (Deuteronomy 30:12) implies. Scripture prohibits us from making any amendments to the Law or eliminating anything, for we read ""Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it"" (Deuteronomy 13:1). We pledged and obligated ourselves to God to abide by His Law, we, our children, and our children's children, until the end of time as Scripture says ""The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever."" (Deuteronomy 29:28). Any prophet, therefore, no matter what his pedigree is, be he priest, Levite, or Amalekite, is perfidious even if he asserts that only one of the precepts of the Torah is void, in view of the Mosaic pronouncement ""unto us and unto our children forever."" Such a one we would declare a false prophet and would execute him if we had jurisdiction over him. We would take no notice of the miracles that he might perform, just as we would disregard the wonder-working of one who seeks to lure people to idolatry, as we are enjoined in the verse ""And the sign or wonder came to pass ... thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet"" (Deuteronomy 13:3). Since Moses, of blessed memory, has prohibited image worship for all the time, we know that the miracles of a would-be-seducer to idolatry are wrought by trickery and sorcery, Similarly, since Moses has taught us that the Law is eternal, we stamp definitely as a prevaricator any one who argues that it was destined to be in force for a fixed duration of time, because he contravenes Moses. Consequently we pay no attention to his assertions or supernatural performances. Inasmuch as we do not believe in Moses because of his miracles, we are under no obligations to institute comparison between his miracles and those of others. Our everlastingly firm trust and steadfast faith in Moses is due to the fact that our forebears as well as he, had heard the Divine discourse on Sinai, as it is intimated in the Scripture, ""and they will also believe thee forever"" (Exodus 19:9). This event is analogous to the situation of two witnesses who observed a certain act simultaneously. Each of them saw what his fellow saw and each of them is sure of the truth of the statement of his fellow, and does not require proof or demonstration, whereas other people, to whom they would report their testimony, would not be convinced without confirmation or certification. Similarly, we of the Jewish faith, are convinced of the truth of the prophecy of Moses, inasmuch as our ancestors in common with him witnessed the Divine revelation on Sinai, and not merely because of his miracles.9 He performed all of these only as the occasion demanded and as is recorded in Scripture. We do not give credence to the tenets of a miracle worker, in the same way we trust in the truth of Moses our Teacher, nor does any analogy exist between them. This distinction is a fundamental principle of our religion, but seems to have fallen into oblivion, and has been disregarded by our co-religionists. This thought was present in the mind of Solomon when he addressed the Gentiles in behalf of Israel, ""What will you see in the Shulamite? as it were a dance of two companies."" (Song of Songs 7:1). The verse means to say, ""If you can produce anything like the revelation on Sinai then we shall concede some misgivings concerning Moses."" If a Jewish or Gentile prophet urges and encourages people to follow the religion of Moses without adding thereto or diminishing therefrom, like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the others, we demand a miracle from him. If he can perform it we recognize him and bestow upon him the honor due to a prophet, but if he fails to do so, he is put to death. We require only a miracle as his credentials, although it may be wrought by stratagem or magic, just as we accept the evidence of witnesses although there is a possibility of perjury. For we are divinely commanded through Moses to render judgment in a suit at law in accordance with the testimony of two witnesses, the possibility of false swearing notwithstanding. Similarly we are enjoined to yield obedience to one who asserts that he is a prophet provided he can substantiate his claims by miracle or proofs, although there is a possibility that he is an impostor. However, if the would-be-prophet teaches tenets that negate the doctrines of Moses, then we must repudiate him. This point was made abundantly clear in the introduction to our large work on the commentary of the Mishnah, where you will find some useful information concerning principles which form the foundation of our religion, and the pillars of our faith. It is incumbent upon you to know that the rule that nothing may ever be added to or diminished from the Laws of Moses, applies equally to the oral law, that is the traditional interpretation transmitted through the sages of blessed memory. Be cautious and on your guard lest any of the heretics, may they speedily perish! mingle among you, for they are worse than apostates. For although this country is, as you know, a place of scholars, students and schools, they indulge in bombastic talk and we warn our people against their occasional errors, heresies and mistakes. As for you, in this distant country, although you are scholars, learned in the law, and pious, you are few in number, may God increase your number and hasten the time of gathering you all together. If any of the heretics rises up to corrupt the people, they will undermine the faith of the young folks and they will not find a savior. Beware of them and know that it is permitted to slay them in our opinion for they repudiate the statement in the prophecy of Moses who commanded us to act ""According to the law which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee thou shalt do."" (Deuteronomy 17:11). They assert in wicked defiance that they believe most firmly in the prophecy of Moses, as the Arabs and Byzantines say, yet they destroy and nullify his law and kill the adherents thereof. Whoever joins them is just like his seducer. We deemed it imperative to call your attention to these facts, and to raise the young generation on these tenets, because they are a pillar of faith!"
30,12,Chasidut,"Sha'ar HaEmunah VeYesod HaChasidut, Introduction to Beit Yaakov 24:2","In God’s great mercies, He established Torah scholars in every generation to seek the knowledge of God, and open the gates of Torah knowledge according to the needs of the times. The Zohar (Bo, 2b) quoted above makes mention of this idea, how the prophecy of Yehezkel was suited to the needs of his generation. In the same way God sent a redeemer to Israel, whose splendor was as the Holy One of Israel, (This is a play on words, the Baal Shem Tov, whose name was Israel, was a redeemer for the nation of Israel. )  our master and teacher, whose name pleasant and whose pleasantness fit his name, Rabbi Yisrael Baal Shem Tov. God opened the gates of wisdom, understanding, and consciousness for the Baal Shem Tov. He sought out the knowledge of God’s perfect Torah, and prepared his heart to explicate and discourse on the hidden realms of wisdom. In his days, he managed to bring the sublime secrets of wisdom down into the boundaries of human understanding. He succeeded in making the Torah accessible to the masses of Israel. For the Torah was not given to God’s holy angels, but to the seed of Yaakov whom God had chosen, (This is referring to the famous story in the Talmud that relates and angel’s complaint, when God gave the Torah to Israel. In defence of God’s decision, Moshe asked the angels, “What is written in the Torah? ‘I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt.’ Did you go down to Egypt? Were you enslaved to Pharaoh? Do you worship idols, kill or steal? Why then should the Torah be yours?” From here, concludes the Midrash, we see that the Torah is meant for man, not for angels. In R. Gershon Henokh use of the image, he means to say that even the highest realms of Torah – the secrets of Kabbalah – is meant for the masses, and not merely elite scholars.)  and it is essential for every soul of Israel to reach everything that is written in the Torah and bring it within the boundaries of his mind’s grasp and knowledge. And even for our generation, a generation of lowly status and little knowledge, did God send him with the perfect language necessary to teach, understand, and come close to even the most sublime of the Torah’s mysteries. The Baal Shem Tov opened up an inner gate that had been closed until his days. He opened it before the entire community of Yaakov, for the Torah is not in Heaven, (See Devarim 30:12. BT Bava Meziah 29b.)  but the birthright and fiancée (See BT Berachot, 57a: “If one dreams he has intercourse with a betrothed maiden, he may expect to obtain knowledge of Torah, since it says (Devarim 33:4): “Moses commanded us a law [Torah], an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. Read not morashah [inheritance], but me’orasah [betrothed].”)  of every Jew. Everyone who seeks God with a full heart will find in the Baal Shem Tov’s words the way of understanding and clear path for the upright in order to understand, discern, hear, learn, teach, guard, perform, and uphold all the words of the Torah. (Weekday morning liturgy, blessing preceding the recitation of the Shema Yisrael.)  All of the Divine attributes and Sefirot, whether mentioned or hidden, contain the whole order of God’s governance of everything, from the highest heights of the spiritual world down to lowliest of levels, and man is capable of receiving them within the limits of his mind. And all of the events recounted in the Torah are experienced by every one of Israel in every generation, in general and in particular. The Torah is the essential teaching for every Jew to enable him to conduct all his affairs justly. (See Tehillim 112:5.)  The Baal Shem Tov opened a gate in the brilliant light of the firmament, the holy teachings of the Zohar and the writings of the Arizal, explaining all their words in clear and straightforward language, the language of wisdom. In this way the Divine abundance of the mysteries may drip into the heart of man, so that he may behold God from his very flesh. (See Iyov 19:26.)  From the days of the Baal Shem Tov and onward, the gate to the garden of God and the paradise of wisdom had been opened, inviting man to enter. From his days, the spring has begun to flow from the House of God, (See Yoel 4:18.)  and with the passage of time, it only grows stronger and stronger. The Baal Shem Tov established many students, all geniuses and holy servants of God."
30,12,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Torah Study 3:8","It is written in the Torah [Deuteronomy (Rav Kapach renders this: ""It is written about the Torah,"" emphasizing that according to the Rambam, the antecedent of the pronoun ""it"" in the above verse is Torah study and not Teshuvah, as explained by the Ramban and others.)  30:12, 13]: ""It is not in the heavens....It is not across the sea...."" [This implies:] ""It is not in the heavens"" (i.e., it is not found in the proud spirited. - and self-centered. Such an attitude runs contrary to the spirit of Torah and, ultimately, prevents one from grasping it, as explained in the following halachah.)  - i.e., it is not found in the proud spirited. ""It is not across the sea"" (i.e., it is not found in those who travel across the sea - for business purposes. In contrast, one is advised to travel to study Torah, as Avot relates: ""Exile yourself to a place of Torah."")  - i.e., it is not found in those who travel across the sea. Therefore, our Sages said: (Avot 2:5)  ""Not everyone who is involved in business will become wise."" (In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam quotes the content of this halachah.)  Our Sages also commanded: (Avot 4:12)  ""Minimize your business activities and occupy (The Hebrew, la’asok, is also used in the Ashkenazic text of the blessings recited before Torah study. In most contexts, that word is rendered as ""business."" Thus, employing it in the blessing implies that the manner in which a person applies himself to Torah study should resemble the way a businessman applies himself to his business, making it the central matter of his life.)  yourself with Torah."" (The practical applications of these concepts are found in the following halachah.) "
30,12,Musar,Orchot Tzadikim 27:6,"It is written in the Torah, ""It is not in heaven"" (Deut. 30:12) and the meaning of this is : it is not to be found among those that are arrogant and consider themselves as high as heaven. ""Neither is it beyond the sea"" (Deut. 30:13), which means that it is not to be found among those who are constantly travelling on sea voyages (Erubin 55a). Therefore, our Sages, of blessed memory, said, ""Nor can one who is engaged overmuch in business grow wise"" (Aboth 2:6). And they said, ""Engage less in business, but occupy yourself with the Torah"" (Aboth 4:12)."
30,12,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 25:1:2","Solomon contrasts the opposite natures of the righteous and the wicked. He reveals to us that the wicked are proud and arrogant by nature, whereas the righteous is modest and self-effacing. He does so in order to encourage us to practice the positive virtues of the righteous and to avoid practicing the negative virtues of the wicked. The word לענות used by Solomon when describing the righteous is the same word applied by Moses to Pharaoh in Exodus 10,3 when he asked Pharaoh how long he would still refuse to humble himself, לענות, before the Lord? Moses challenged Pharaoh saying that since he had not yet humbled himself before the Lord his answer to the requests made of him by G’d through Moses would reflect his arrogance. Man’s speech is a mirror of how or what he thinks. The חכמי המוסר (Chovot HaLevavot section HaBechinah chapter 5) describe language as the writing quill of the heart. Seeing the righteous person has a clean conscience the words he speaks truly reflect what he thinks and what is in his heart. The reverse is true of the wicked person. It is not enough that he has arrogant thoughts in his heart, but he has enough effrontery to verbalize his arrogance, showing one and all that he is a foolish person.  It is a well known fact that self-effacement is one of the finest positive virtues as our sages have taught us (Chulin 89) the universe endures only due the people who perceive themselves as if they were of no consequence; this is what is meant by Deut. 33,27: ומתחת זרועות עולם, “and he who perceives of himself as beneath (everybody else) is what results in the world being planted successfully.” Examples of how the righteous down- graded their own selves are found in Genesis 18,27 when Avraham described himself as עפר ואפר, “dust and ashes.” Moses and Aaron when challenged by the people in Exodus 16,8 exclaimed ונחנו מה “who are we?” They meant that since they themselves derived all their spiritual input only from G’d why would the people complain against them! We find that in Psalms 22,7 David describes himself as “a worm, not a man.” Furthermore, we have a tradition that the presence of G’d manifests itself only to the humble, the self-effacing (compare Mechilta on Exodus 12, item 9). This is also what is meant in Isaiah 57,15: “I dwell on high, in holiness; yet with the contrite and the lowly in spirit - reviving the spirits of the lowly.” Similarly, Torah knowledge becomes the permanent property only of the lowly in spirit (compare Derech Eretz Zuta 8). Our sages in Taanit 7 ask: “why is the Torah compared to water so that the prophet Isaiah 55,1 when inviting people to learn Torah, called out: “come all you who are thirsty for water and get water!” Just as waters leave the elevated place they originate in and flow downwards, so the Torah cannot be at home for long in someone whose heart feels proud and superior to others. In the Aggadah of Eiruvin 55 we also have a statement that the words of Moses in Deut. 30,12 that the Torah is not found in heaven refers to arrogant people and that Torah does no make its home in the brain of such people. People who raise their own importance as if it reached heaven, are not liable to retain their Torah knowledge. True Torah knowledge is attained by those who “kill” themselves (i.e. kill their ego) in order to attain it. The Torah speaks of אדם כי ימות באוהל “when someone dies in the tent” (of Torah), compare Numbers 19,14. Our sages (Bereshit Rabbah 19,7) have formulated the principle that עיקר שכינה בתחתונים, that the principal manifestation of G’d’s attribute of כבוד is found among the terrestrial beings, as we know from Genesis 3,8 “they heard the voice of G’d walking by Himself in the garden following the prevailing wind of the day.” David alluded to the mystical element in all this in Psalms 104,17 when he said: “the stork has her home in the junipers.” [The word חסידה here translated as “stork,” was also the name of a daughter of Avraham who excelled in deeds of loving kindness for mankind which is why her name became known as חסידה, (as opposed to חסיד, masculine). Compare Zohar Pinchas 217. Rabbi Chavell. Ed.] Seeing that Adam sinned, the Shechinah began its gradual retreat from the terrestrial universe, a retreat which was reversed only with the advent of Avraham and which was reversed totally with the inauguration of the Tabernacle. The Torah was revealed on Sinai, a low mountain instead of on a high mountain such as Mount Hermon. This was intended to further make the point that what appears to dwarf all else physically is not necessarily what Torah and its message is all about. In Psalms 68,17 David refers to the hostility of the mountains of Bashan toward the mountain on which the Torah was given, Mount Sinai. Those mountains thought that they had a far better claim to serve as G’d’s residence on earth. [I have translated the author’s words according to the text in my and other editions, although, personally, I feel that the jealousy of the mountains in Bashan described in the verse quoted was directed against Mount Zion, the site of the Temple, much lower than the mountains of Bashan. After all, the psalm speaks about לשבתו “serving as His residence.” Mount Sinai never served as the site of G’d’s residence on earth. Ed.]"
30,12,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 32:43:6","You will find a total of 18 sequences in the written Torah in which the tetragrammaton has been spelled either forward or backward either in the last letters of the words or the first letters of the words of a sequence of four words, such as the ones we showed you in verse 39. Seeing that our verse (39) is the last of these 18 examples, I have used the opportunity to list all of them and to elaborate a little about them.  The following is the sequence in which these 18 groups of four words each appear in the Torah; I am listing first four examples in which the first letters of the respective words read forward spell the tetragram 1) (Genesis 1,31) יום הששי ויכולו השמים. 2) (Genesis 38,24-25) יהודה הוציאוה ותשרף היא. 3) )Exodus 4,14) ידבר הוא וגם המה. 4) (Deut. 11,2) ידו החזקה וזרועו הנטויה. These are the four examples in which the letters of the tetragram appear in the proper sequence, i.e. right to left and as the first letters in each of the words. The next 4 examples refer to the last letters of the four words respectively, but they too are read from right to left. They are: 5) Genesis 19,13) .פנ'י ה-' וישלחה-ו ה-'. 6) (Ex. 3,13) ל-י מ-ה שמ-ו מ-ה. 7) (Deut. 24,8) נק-י יהי-ה לבית-ו שנ-ה. 8* מ-י יעל-ה לנ-ו השמימ-ה, (Deut. 30,12). The next 10 examples all feature the sequence of the letters of the tetragram from left to right, i.e. backward. (sometimes these letters are at the beginning of the words in question, sometimes at the end, such as in our example in the verse above). In all these examples the allusion is to the attribute of Justice. You can figure these out for yourselves by looking at: 9) Genesis 11,9 ו-משם ה-פיצם י'-ה;ה-ארץ it is clear from the context that the attribute of Justice had been poised to strike at all these people at that time. The same is true of 10) (Genesis 44, 3-4) ה-מה ו-חמוריהם ה-ם י-צאו. The Torah already alludes to the impending crisis when the goblet will be found in Binyamin’s sack. [I am only pointing to the verses now without elaborating. Ed.] Exodus 4,15; Exodus 4,14; Exodus 4,3; Exodus 16,7; Exodus 26, 21-22; Numbers 1,51 (compare commentary by author). Numbers 5,18 (compare commentary by author). Numbers 14,24-25 (compare commentary by author). Numbers 14,43. Finally, there is our verse here completing the ten occasions when he Torah provides allusions that the attribute of Justice, as an appendix of the tetragram, was invoked by G’d. By way of contrast, the eight examples we quoted first, in which the respective letters of the tetragram appear in their usual order, i.e. from right to left, are indications that the subject matter is the attribute of Mercy. Seeing that between them we have a total of 18 such 4-word sequences, the easy way to remember this is by reference to the short line חי ה'."
30,12,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:12:1","לא בשמים היא, “it is not in heaven;” it is possible that the reason Moses makes this point is because prior to bringing the Torah to the people it had indeed resided in heaven, and we have quoted arguments offered by the angels opposing its descent to earth. The word היא which we might have considered as redundant, is a reference to the highest level of חכמה, the emanation wisdom, which does indeed reside in heaven."
30,12,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:12:2-3","ולא מעבר לים היא, “neither is it beyond the sea.” This is a reference to the great ocean which surrounds all the land mass, an area where this superior wisdom is located. The reason the Torah (Moses) had to refer to it as ים, is that otherwise it would have to be described as תהום, and the Torah would have had to write לא בתהום היא. This is the way Job referred to it when he quoted the deep as saying: “it is not with me” (referring to wisdom compare Job 28,14). It is stylistically more elevating to refer to the ocean as something elevated than as something conjuring up visions of a deep abyss, as does the word תהום. The reason Moses added the word היא to each of these descriptions of different locations is that each time the word היא appears it represents a diminution of the area meant. In order to include the supreme wisdom we spoke of, the planetary system should also have been included seeing it surrounds the ocean. Seeing that the supreme wisdom surrounds the entire visible universe, Moses when referring to parts of it, made this point plain by limiting each part with the word היא, i.e. “it only.” The word הים used here is a reference to the part of the universe inhabited by man. This is why he added: “it is not too far from you,” implying that there are indeed levels of wisdom which are beyond man to attain [even by means of studying the Torah and observing it. Ed.].  We may surmise that Moses used the word היא four times in order to allude to the four basic celestial fundamentals which are emanated from this supreme wisdom. They are alluded to in the names of the patriarchs Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, and David. The vision of the prophet Ezekiel (chapter 1) in which four חיות, beast-like figures equipped with angels, are featured also correspond to these four fundamentals of celestial wisdom emanated to creatures on earth. They are described elsewhere as ארבע אופנים, “four wheels,” an allegorical description of what supports the מרכבה, the chariot the Shechinah is perceived as riding in. Translated into our terrestrial language, these are the four elements which are the constituent parts of all tangible matter on earth. They ensure the continued existence of the terrestrial universe when they are combined in the correct proportions. A Midrashic approach to our verses, based on Eiruvin 55: The words “it is not in heaven,” mean that Torah is not to be found amongst haughty, arrogant people. The words: “it is not beyond the ocean,” mean that Torah is not to be found among people who constantly journey from place to place to make their livelihood, i.e. hawkers. Samuel said that Torah cannot be found among astrologers or professional astronomers, seeing that the Torah writes: “it is not in heaven.” The Torah may be found only among people preoccupied with the pursuit of matters which are oriented toward heavenly concerns. People challenged Samuel, saying to him that seeing he himself was an astronomer how could he make such a statement? He answered: “in all my days I have never looked at חכמה except when I was relieving myself” [at a time when I was forbidden to engage in the pursuit of Torah. Ed.] (compare Devarim Rabbah 8,6). Thus far the Midrash.  Concerning these disciplines, i.e. astrology and astronomy, Isaiah warned the people of Israel, saying to them (Isaiah 55,2) “why do you spend money for what is not bread and your toil for that which does not satisfy?” Isaiah meant that his compatriots were wasting their money in order to acquire “wisdom” which would neither satisfy their bodies nor their souls; he added: “give heed to Me, (G’d) and you shall eat choice food and enjoy the richest viands. Hearken and you shall be revived.” Torah is described in Proverbs 4,2 as לקח טוב, “a good purchase.” It is the true food, satisfying those that “consume it.” When Isaiah said תתענגו בדשן נפשכם, “enjoy with your souls the richest foods,” he refers to the “bread” which truly satisfies the soul of man, spiritual food, the Torah. The simile of דשן, something physical, material, is used by the prophet to illustrate in human language the spiritual essence of what Torah supplies to those who study it. Such metaphors for spiritual matters are also found in Psalms 63,6: “milk and fatness satisfy my soul.” Clearly, David does not mean for the soul to be fed milk.  All of the above teaches that Samuel did not engage in the study of astronomy at a time when this would have competed with the study of Torah. Seeing that it is forbidden to engage in the speaking of Torah, or even contemplating thoughts of Torah, while one is in the bathhouse or in the toilet, he could use such time to increase his knowledge in other disciplines. Our sages (Menachot 99) said: “go and study Greek philosophy at a time which is neither day nor night.” What they meant was that preoccupation with any disciplines other than Torah study exposes the student to the danger of being influenced by the theologically unsound element, some of which is always found scattered in those texts. This is the reason these disciplines have been compared to silver, seeing that silver invariably contains some impurities unless it has been refined over and over again. Our Torah is compared to such silver, i.e. כסף צרוף. This is what David meant in Psalms 12,7 when he wrote: “the words of the Lord are pure words, silver purged in an earthen crucible, refined sevenfold.”"
30,12,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:12:4-5","מי יעלה לנו השמימה , “who would ascend heaven for us?” The acronym of these words is מילה from which we find a hint here that only people who have been circumcised have a chance to attain a true appreciation of the unique nature of Hashem. Only the Jewish people who wear the sign of the covenant on their very bodies have a chance to attain such a spiritual level. We also find that even prophets cannot prophesy while in a standing position unless they had been circumcised. As long as Avraham had not been circumcised he always fell down when G’d spoke to him [other than in a dream when he was prostate anyway. Ed.] Compare Genesis 17,3: “he fell on his face.” This was prior to his circumcision. On the other hand, after he had been circumcised and recovered from the effects, and prayed on behalf of the righteous people in Sodom, the Torah speaks of him as עודנו עומד לפני ה', “still standing in the presence of the Lord.” (Genesis 18,22 compare Tanchuma Lech Lecha 20). Bileam, by contrast, prophesied only when in a prone position as we know from Numbers 24,4. Moses also alluded to the inability of the Jewish people in his time to attain a true appreciation of the holy name of G’d. This is why he said to G’d: “if the people will ask me what is His name (the G’d in whose name you claim to speak), what shall I tell them?” He may have meant that the few Israelites who were circumcised at that time would ask such a question. Seeing that המצוה (the term used in our passage for the entire Torah) which bears the seal of the Holy Covenant requires as a precondition of being fulfilled that the persons doing so have been circumcised, the sages of the Midrash (Shir Hashirim Rabbah 2,18) said concerning בצבאות או באילות השדה, “by the Hosts or by the hinds of the fields,” that the word “Hosts” refers to the Upper Hosts as well as the lower Hosts, those on earth who witnessed the covenant (Song of Songs 2,7). The Hosts referred to are the ones which already bear a distinguishing mark, (circumcision) as opposed to those who will only bear this mark in the future.  Our verse indirectly refers to the circumcision of our flesh after having openly referred to the circumcision of our hearts with the words: “and the Lord your G’d will circumcise your heart.” This latter circumcision brings in its wake the neutralization of the evil urge. Once this has occurred all organs of a person are eager to play their respective parts in the fulfillment of the Torah’s commandments, something that reason dictates. Being drawn to the name of the Lord will then be a natural state of affairs. This is all alluded to in the words: “who will ascend to heaven on our behalf?” [At such times when you no longer suffer from the evil urge, there is no need for an intermediary, for someone to ascend to heaven in your behalf; you can do it yourself. Ed.] The prophet Jeremiah refers to this state of affairs when he writes (Jeremiah 31,33) “for all of them know Me, from the least of them to the greatest.”"
30,12,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 30:12:1","For if it were in heaven, etc. Rashi is answering the question: The beginning of the verse and the end of the verse apparently contradict each other. At the beginning it is written, It is not in heaven, [for you] to say, ‘Who will go up to heaven for us, etc.’ This implies: [that it is not in heaven], but near enough to send a messenger for it. It [also] implies that it is not that close that you do not [even] need to send a messenger for it. But afterwards it is written, For the matter is extremely close to you, etc., implying that one does not even need a messenger. Therefore Rashi explains, 'It is not in heaven,' (For if it were in heaven, you would be required to ascend in quest of it). But if it were in heaven it would be impossible to send a messenger after it and if you wanted to study it, you yourself would have to go up for it. Therefore there is no [longer] a problem when it is written [afterwards], For the matter is extremely close to you, [because the beginning of the verse too, is talking about the person himself and now it is saying that, on the contrary, it is close to the person himself]. And when the verse says “[Who will go up to heaven for us], and acquire it for us, [which implies that we are dealing with a messenger], it is adding even more, that [you might mistakenly think that] not only could you certainly never travel or go up to study it there, but you would never find any person to go up or travel [over the sea] in order to bring so as to study it. "
30,14,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Introduction 27","We read in Deut. 30, 11-14: ""Surely, this Instruction which I enjoin you this day is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond reach. It is not in the heavens that you should say 'who among us can go up to the heavens and get it for us and impart it to us that we may observe it?' Neither is it beyond the sea that you should say 'who among us can cross to the other side of the sea and get it for us and impart it to us, that we may observe it?' No, the thing is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart to observe it.' The verses above reveal all that I have written concerning observance as well as vicarious observance of the Torah laws, i.e. that everyone is obligated to fulfill all the 613 commandments. When there are some מצות that he is unable to fulfill in practice, there are ways in which he can acquire the merit of having practiced them."
30,12,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Introduction 28","There are four causes that may prevent a person from observing the commandments. One cause is that the specific commandment in question is applicable only to certain groups of people, such as the priests, i.e. people of superior parentage. Concerning such commandments, the Torah says: לא נפלאת היא, ""you should not say that it is only for people of superior status."" The second reason for not performing commandments is that they are of the kind that most people never have an opportunity to perform, such as remarrying one's divorced wife. Concerning such commandments the Torah says: ""Do not say it is beyond reach,"" i.e. too unlikely. The third reason for not fulfilling some commandments, though the opportunity presents itself not infrequently, is one where the cause that triggers the applicability is absent, i.e. affixing a מזוזה to a door-frame, something that requires one to live in a house. Another example would be the law requiring that four-cornered garments be provided with ציצית. One cannot fulfill that commandment unless one owns a four cornered garment. Concerning such commandments the Torah says: ""Do not say that this commandment is in the heavens,"" i.e. unattainable for you. Finally, the fourth reason for not observing certain commandments is that they are applicable only in ארץ ישראל, and you are unable to go there, seeing it is beyond the sea. Concerning this too, the Torah says: ""Do not say that it is beyond the sea."" All these obstacles are not really a hindrance to acquiring the merit of having fulfilled that commandment and thereby helping to achieve one's personal level of perfection, since the properly oriented study of these commandments affords one an opportunity to be as good as the people who actually live in ארץ ישראל Concerning all these four apparent obstacles to מצוה fulfillment, the Torah says: ""For the matter is very close to you (to observe it) in your mouth and in your heart."" In those four verses in Deuteronomy, the Torah alludes to exactly what I have been writing about in this chapter. "
30,12,Talmud,Temurah 16a:3,"The Gemara returns to the matter itself. Rav Yehuda says that Shmuel says: Three thousand halakhot were forgotten during the days of mourning for Moses. The Jewish people said to Joshua: Ask for guidance from Heaven so that you can reacquire the forgotten halakhot. Joshua said to them: “It is not in heaven” (Deuteronomy 30:12). Once the Torah was given on Sinai, the Sages of each generation must determine the halakha. No new halakhot may be added or subtracted by heavenly instruction or through prophecy."
30,12,Talmud,Temurah 16a:5,"At the time of Moses’ death, the people said to Pinehas: Ask for halakhic guidance from Heaven so that you can relearn the forgotten halakhot. Pinehas said to them: “It is not in heaven” (Deuteronomy 30:12). The people said to Elazar: Ask for halakhic guidance from God. He said to them that the verse states: “These are the commandments,” to teach that a prophet is not permitted to introduce any new element from now on."
30,12,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part II 7:10","According to what I have written, this clearly explains what we indicate in the text of the blessing, “In His goodness, He constantly renews the work of creation every day.” The term “He renews,” means exactly what it says: for there is no day comparable to another in [the realm] of the Most-High Source. This is written in the book Nefesh ha-Hayyim, Sha’ar 2:13 pertaining to Tikkunei Tefillah. (I found this statement of Nefesh ha-Hayyim in Sha’ar 1, chapter 2, where R’ Hayyim Volozhiner states, “If He, may He be blessed, were to remove His influence from them [His creations] for even a single moment, they would become utter nothingness. This [concept] is similar to what the Men of the Great Assembly instituted in the liturgy: ‘In His goodness He renews daily, perpetually, the work of creation.’ The word ‘perpetually’ is to be taken literally as every single instant. Proof of this is explicitly written in Psalms (136:7), ‘To Him Who makes great luminaries’; [the verse] does not state [Who] made, but ‘[Who] makes.’” In Sha’ar 2, chapter 13, R. Chayyim Volozhiner discusses the way in which prayer influences the creations in the Heavenly realm. He writes, “Every time we pray, it causes new formations in the arrangement of the [Heavenly] worlds and forces…. From the time that the prayers were set in order [by the Men of the Great Assembly] until the arrival of our Redeemer, may he come speedily in our days, there never was, nor will ever be, one prayer like another prayer… [similarly, a person’s own prayers] differ each day from what he [ever prayed before] or whatever he will pray in the future.” That is, the creations in the Heavenly realm above change daily, due in part to the prayers of man, and are constantly renewed.)  Even though in [the realm] under the sun there is nothing new within the nature of creation, nevertheless [in the realm] above the sun, there is a certain degree of change and renewal. This renewal is achieved through the variations in the combining of His Names, blessed be He, which is the origin of new laws before the Holy One blessed be He. This [concept] is brought by our sages in Bereshis Rabbah 49: “There is not a single day that the Holy One, blessed be He, does not originate a new law in the Heavenly Court, as it states, ‘Hear attentively the fury in His voice, and the sound that emanates from His mouth.’” (Job 37:2.)  God does not, Heaven forbid, change any of the Torah laws that He has given us to teach and practice, for decisions about Halachah is “not in [the hands] of Heaven.” (Deut. 30:12. See Tractate Bava Metzia 59b, describing how R. Eliezer, through the use of miracles and a heavenly voice, attempted to convince R. Yehoshua and the sages that the halachah was in accordance with his view. His opinion was not accepted; as R. Yehoshua stated, “[The Torah] is not in Heaven.”)  [The interpretation of this Midrash] is that before God, may He be blessed, [i.e., in His Heavenly Realm, He] changes the combinations [of His holy names] and the nature of creation in whichever manner."
30,12,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part III 2:13","So did Hillel endanger himself for the words of Torah, as stated at the end of the third chapter of Tractate Yoma. (35b. “Every day Hillel would work and earn one tropaik. Half would go for his food and family, while the other half he would give to the guard at the beis ha-midrash. One day, he earned no money and the guard at the beis ha-midrash would not permit him to enter. Hillel climbed up on the roof and listened through the skylight so that he could hear the words of the living God from the mouths of Shemayah and Avtalion. It was Shabbos eve in the middle of winter, and snow began to fall. When the dawn rose, Shemayah said, ‘Brother Avtalion, every day this house is light and today it is dark. Is it a cloudy day?’ They looked up and saw the figure of a man on the skylight. They went up and found Hillel covered with three cubits of snow. They took him down, bathed him, and placed him in front of the fire. They said, ‘This man deserves to have us violate Shabbos on his behalf.’"")  It was [that quality of sacrifice] that stood him in good stead to ascend as the leader of all of the Sages of Israel. Similarly, Rabbi Eliezer the Great, (This is R. Eliezer ben Horkenus.)  as it is taught in Avos de-Rabbi Nassan (Chapter 6, os 3.)  and in the beginning of Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, that he did not eat for many days and endangered himself for the sake of the words of the Torah. Also in Tractate Kesubos at the end of the chapter entitled Ha-moder, (77b.)  [it relates] that R. Yehoshua ben Levi would mingle with those who were stricken with [the contagious disease] ra’asan (A contagious type of skin disease that carries a symptom of great weakness.)  and study Torah with them, as he relied on the merit of the Torah to protect him. He was spared from harm. This is just the opposite of the way we explained, “Do not be overly righteous,” and what we had proven from Bava Kamma 61a–b [pertaining to how the three mighty men of King David acted wrongly to endanger their lives for the Torah]. We also learn this concept from Tractate Eruvin 54, (I found it at 55a.)  [that states:] “‘It is not in Heaven,’ (Deut. 30:12.)  for if it were in Heaven, you should have gone up after it.” We explained in [Ha’amek She’elah] 19:4, that this statement is not to be understood literally, rather as: if it is “above” [beyond the capability] of your intellect, and it is difficult to achieve, as [if it were] something that is placed in the heavens, you are required to toil thereby becoming wise [enough] by bringing it “down” [i.e., within your grasp of understanding]. (Verses 12–14 state: “It is not in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will go up to heaven and acquire it for us, and inform us of it so that we may fulfill it?’ Nor is it across the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will travel across the sea and acquire it for us, and inform us of it so that we may fulfill it?’ The matter is very close to you; in your mouth and in your mind to fulfill it.” The Netziv explains that there is a difference between what is expressed by the parable of it not being in heaven versus traveling overseas. Traveling overseas, as explained in the Talmud, refers to traveling as far as necessary to find the proper rabbi from whom to learn. The parable of ascending into the heavens cannot possibly refer to traveling a great distance, as it is impossible to ascend to the heavens. Rather it is referring to one being discouraged from acquiring a deep understanding of the Torah due to its difficulty to comprehend and its great holiness. God therefore states that it is within our grasp, for if you apply great toil in study in order to acquire various forms of knowledge and skills in analysis, you will achieve it.) "
30,14,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part III 10:25","Therefore, the correct interpretation [of la’asoso”] is [“to create it,”] which refers to the deep [analysis] of the halachah that is incumbent upon you to infer, [even though] it is distant from you. As explained in the above-mentioned reference, (The verses in Deut. 30:11–14 are elaborated further in Eruvin 54b–55a: “R. Eliezer said: [The verse] ‘You shall call understanding modah [a relative]’ [Prov. 7:14] teaches one to make signs for the Torah. Rava said: ‘[This teaches one] to set moadim [times] for Torah study.’ And this is what was stated by Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa, What is the meaning of what Scripture states: ‘It is not in the heavens… nor is it across the sea’? [The words], ‘It is not in the heavens’] implies that if it were in the heavens, you would be required to go up in pursuit of it; and if it were across the sea, you would have to cross the sea in pursuit of it.” The She’iltos explains that Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa is saying that if a Talmud scholar has a teacher who lives overseas, he is required to travel overseas in order to study from him. The Netziv writes that the She’iltos understands that we infer from the verse in Proverbs that since one achieves understanding mainly by studying daily with a rabbi, it is important to set times for Torah study – that is, to organize classes. Since the Talmud connects the inference from Proverbs to Deuteronomy, the She’iltos understands Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa to be stating that Deuteronomy is exhorting one to study from his rabbi even if it means that he must travel to his rabbi who lives overseas. The Netziv explains that the verses in Deuteronomy state further that if “it is in the heavens” – if the Torah seems to be too holy and difficult to grasp – we must discuss it aloud with others and apply deep analysis. As stated in Proverbs according to R. Eliezer: “Make signs for the Torah” – in other words, devise and pursue whatever strategy is necessary to understand and grasp the Torah.)  you may think that it is in the heavens or overseas. In other words, it may appear to you [to be impossible] to produce laws from deep analysis [by yourselves], and thus it is as if [these laws] were in the heavens. Or [you may think] that you will have to travel overseas [to find] a rabbi who has already learned these laws. Therefore, Scripture states that this is not so. Rather, it is within the ability of your mouth and heart to produce these matters of halachah. The interpretation of la’asos is similar to the way we previously explained [in chapter 8], “good understanding to all oseihem (who perform them),’ (Psalms 111:10.)  where [oseihem should be translated as “make them”], i.e., to produce the halachah. (Therefore, the verse is to be translated as, “It is with your mouth and your heart to produce it.”)  Thus, one can explain that the words “and your heart” is tied to “and your mouth”; the speech [of Torah study] should be with the toil of the flesh, influencing the heart [understanding], and this is how one brings the halachah to light. This is the interpretation of the Midrash which infers [from: “For by the mouth of these words’ (Ex. 34:27. Usually translated as, “for according to these words.”) ] that one must toil [in the Torah with one’s mouth]."
30,12,Talmud,Tractate Kallah Rabbati 8:16,"‘This is the way [conducive to] the study of the Torah: a morsel of bread with salt thou shalt eat.’ (Cf. Sanh. 111a (Sonc. ed., p. 762).)  [Rab] saw [R. Kahana] indulging himself (He was dressing his hair instead of attending to his studies.)  and asked him, ‘Do you not know of the verse, (Or, do you not accept the teaching?)  Neither is it found in the land of the living (Job 28, 13.)  [which means that] the Torah will not be found in one who attends to his needs [instead of studying it constantly]?’ He replied, ‘It refers to [abstention from pleasant things] which enter the body, but does it refer also to such matters?’ (As dressing one’s hair.)  [Rab] said to him, ‘Has it not been taught: (Ber. 57b (Sonc. ed., p. 356).)  Three things enter the body without its deriving any benefit therefrom, viz. melilot, (A kind of clover.)  date-berries and unripe dates; three things do not enter the body but it derives benefit therefrom, viz. washing, anointing and regular motions?’ He asked him, ‘Does, then, the study of the Torah entail affliction?’ He replied, ‘Yes, for it is written, It is good for me that I have been afficted, in order that I might learn Thy statutes. (Ps. 119, 71.)  Furthermore, is [Torah] found [in all others] except those [who attend to their wants]? But has it not been taught: (‘Erub. 55a (Sonc. ed., p. 384).)  It is not in heaven (Deut. 30, 12.)  [which means that] Torah will not be found with those who exalt their knowledge, Neither is it beyond the sea [which means that] it will not be found among merchants, traders and sailors. With these Torah is not found but craftiness is found. And whence do you know that beyond [‘eber] the sea refers to merchants? For it is written, And there passed by [wayya‘abru], Midianites, merchantmen’. (Gen. 37, 28. The root of the verb passed is the same as of ‘eber, ‘beyond’, and the inference is drawn that the Midianites were merchants who came from beyond the sea.)  ‘Do not seek greatness for yourself’: so that you should not say, ‘Behold, I study the Torah and what a great man I am!’ Should you do so, the consequence will be that you will occupy yourself with the Torah not for its own sake."

30,12,Kabbalah,"Reshit Chokhmah, Gate of Holiness 17:72","In the Tikkunei Zohar (22nd Tikkun, verse 84) it explains about the importance of one who guards his Brit, which about him is said “And the nations of the world will all see that the name of God [YKVK] is called upon you” (Deuteronomy 28:10), because the name YKVK is imprinted on the Brit, as it says “Mi Yaale Lanu Hashamayma” (who will go upwards to heaven for us; 30:12) which is the acronym of “Milah” (circumcision) and the backronym of YKVK, and all of the prosecutors are afraid of him. It also says: 84. Therefore, one who observes the covenant of circumcision, which is the seal OF THE HOLY ONE, BLESSED BE HE, AS THE NAME SHADAI, death moves away from him, which is the Satan, AND IS the Evil Inclination, AND IS CALLED evil, defiled, northern, the Angel of Death. It will not come close to such a one, and he will not die at his hand."
30,12,Kabbalah,"Reshit Chokhmah, Gate of Holiness 17:73","85. But he who is false to the covenant of circumcision, THAT IS YESOD, is false to the King’s seal, WHO IS ZEIR ANPIN, because on it, YESOD, Shadai is marked on the outside, and Yud Hei Vav Hei on the inside. How do we know? It is evident from this passage AS WRITTEN, “Who shall go up for us to heaven” (Devarim 30:12). The initial letters spell milah (circumcision) and the end letters ARE Yud Hei Vav Hei. 86. And certainly one who is false to the covenant of circumcision, THE LIGHT OF THE NAMES Yud Hei Vav Hei and Shadai is gone from him, and the Satan dwells upon him, that is another El. AND HE IS the serpent that dwells where THE NAME Yud Hei Vav Hei is on the inside, while deadly poison is where THE NAME Shadai is on the outside. This is what the passage says, “Because he defiled the sanctuary of Hashem” (Bemidbar 19:20). 87. Unless he repents and suffers many afflictions to remove that serpent from there, FROM THE PLACE OF YESOD, and TO REMOVE his deadly poison, which is malignant leprosy with many illnesses and plagues, until there is no more flesh on him. 88. And the secret of the matter is THAT WHICH IS WRITTEN, “And he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house” (Vayikra 14:42). MEANING, HE IS REINCARNATED ANEW AND TAKES ANOTHER BODY FROM OTHER DUST. THE BODY IS CALLED HOUSE. Since “dust shall be the serpent’s food” (Yeshayah 65:25), and until he is sustained by that flesh, THAT IS, BY THE BODY OF THE DECEASED WHO WAS PLAGUED BY THE SERPENT, he will not leave it. LATER, “AND HE SHALL TAKE OTHER MORTAR (DUST), AND SHALL PLASTER THE HOUSE,” MEANING THAT HE BUILDS HIM BONES AND VEINS AND IS RENEWED LIKE AN OLD HOUSE THAT IS MADE INTO A NEW ONE. 89. ‘And a poor man is like dead,’ MEANING SOMETIMES A PERSON IS PUNISHED WITH POVERY. Just like a dead person’s face is altered, so is a poor man’s face altered. As OUR SAGES OF BLESSED MEMORY have interpreted THE VERSE, “when vileness is exalted (Heb. krum zulut) among the children of men” (Tehilim 12:9). What is THE EXPLANATION OF krum zulut – it is one who is dependent upon others, MEANING A POOR MAN, whose face turns green (Aramaic krum). And many kinds of bites of affliction does that serpent bite him. 90. Moreover, a pauper is like a leper. Just as BY a leper IT IS WRITTEN, “And the hair of his head shall grow long…” (Vayikra 13:45) so IT IS WITH the pauper. Just as BY the leper IS WRITTEN, “outside the camp shall his habitation be” (Ibid. 46), so the pauper is naked and barefoot. And poverty is to Yisrael in place of leprosy. 91. And there are four images IN THE KLIPAH OF THE SERPENT CORRESPONDING TO CHOCHMAH, BINAH, TIFERET AND MALCHUT, like the four colors of leprosy. They are white leprosy, CORRESPONDING TO CHOCHMAH, red, CORRESPONDING TO Binah, green, CORRESPONDING TO ZEIR ANPIN, a black bright spot, CORRESPONDING TO MALCHUT, altogether four. And they all have specific places on A PERSON’S body. And from them many illnesses afflict people. White and red ARE LOCATED IN THE BODY in the impure fat THAT IS WHITE and in the liver THAT IS RED. THE COLOR green IS LOCATED in the gall THAT IS GREEN. Black bright spots ARE LOCATED IN the spleen THAT IS BLACK BLOOD. And they are the sources of four kinds of gall: white gall, red gall, green gall and black gall THAT ARE DEMONS, ANGELS OF DESTRUCTION IN THE WORLD."
30,12,Talmud,Jerusalem Talmud Moed Katan 3:1:7,"(Babli Bava meṣia` 59b.)  They wanted to excommunicate Rebbi Eliezer. They said, who will go and inform him? Rebbi Aqiba said, I shall go and inform him. He went to him and said to him, my teacher, my teacher (Nobody else wanted to go since they knew that R. Eliezer’s rage would be deadly. R. Aqiba declared himself R. Eliezer’s student, insulating himself from the leaders of the preceding generation who pronounced the excommunication.) , your colleagues are excommunicating you. He took him outside, saying: Carob tree, carob tree, if practice has to follow their words, be uprooted. It was not uprooted. If practice has to follow my words, be uprooted. It was uprooted. If practice has to follow their words, turn back. It did not turn back. If practice has to follow my words, turn back. It turned back. All these extraordinary happenings and practice do not follow Rebbi Eliezer. Rebbi Ḥanina said, when it was given, it also was given to follow the majority opinion (Ex. 23:2. This declares rabbinic consensus to be superior to prophetic inspiration. This claim of rabbinic authority to override the will of Heaven is the mirror image of Jesus’s claim (Matth. 12:8) that the prophet (Son of Man) is master over biblical laws.) . [Did Rebbi Eliezer not know that practice has to follow the majority opinion?] (Addition by the Venice editor, justified by G where one reads ולית ר׳ ליעז….. רבים להטות.)  He was offended only because they burned his food prepared in purity in his presence (This follows the story in the Babli that R. Eliezer was excommunicated in his presence.) . There we have stated (Mishnah Kelim 5:10.) : “If it was cut into strips and sand was placed between any two strips, Rebbi Eliezer declares pure (In Mishnah Kelim, “pure” always means “impervious to impurity”; “impure” means “susceptible to impurity”. Since every strip of pottery is not a vessel and the connections between the strips are not permanent, the entire oven is not an implement and therefore pure. The Sages argue that since the oven is usable as described it is an implement and impure.)  but the Sages declare impure. This is the Ḥakhinai oven.” Rebbi Jeremiah said, a big itching was happening on that day: Everything on which Rebbi Eliezer gazed was burned (This describes the antique theory of vision, that the image in the eye is formed by rays emanated from the eye and scanning the objects.) . Not only that, but a grain of wheat might have been half burned and half not burned, and the walls of the house of assembly were weakened. Rebbi Joshua said to them, if colleagues are fighting, what does this concern you? There came an unembodied voice and said, practice follows My son Eliezer. Rebbi Joshua said, it is not in Heaven (Deut. 30:12.) . Rebbi Crispus, Rebbi Joḥanan in the name of Rebbi: If a person would say to me, that is how Rebbi Eliezer stated, I am stating following his words since the Tannaïm switch (If a statement consistent with our practice is ascribed to R. Eliezer it need not be rejected since one may assume that it was ascribed to him in error.) . Once he was walking in public and he saw a woman when sweeping her house throwing it out, it fell on his head. He said, it seems that today my colleagues are befriending me, for it is written: He lifts the downtrodden from the dung heap (Ps.113:7. The Babli holds that R. Eliezer’s excommunication was lifted only at his death.) ."
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,12,Kabbalah,"Reshit Chokhmah, Gate of Holiness 17:24","The reason why he would need a complete Teshuva to wipe his misdeeds is because the attribute of Tzadik is called Kol (all), since all the attributes are included in it, as is explained in the Tikkunei Zohar. Thus, the one who damages the Brit damages all the letters of Yud-Kei-Vav-Kei, as is explained in the Tikkunei Zohar that “Mi Ya’ale Lanu Hashamayma” (who will ascend to heaven for us; Deuteronomy 30:12) is the acronym of ‘Milah’ (circumcision) and the backronym of Yud-Kei-Vav-Kei. It turns out that the one who damaged the Brit damaged all of the attributes that are included in the attribute of Tzadik and the Tetragrammaton, and it is as if he damaged the entire stature. This is why he would need a complete Teshuva that is enough to wipe his misdeeds, since even if he would damage all his limbs he would need to correct all his limbs, as we will explain. Now we will answer it in a different way, that every Teshuva needs Teshuva in the limb that sinned, but the sin of the Brit does not only depend on the Teshuva of the Brit alone, like marrying a woman, rather one needs a strong Teshuva as if he damaged all his limbs, and we will expand on this later on."
30,12,Kabbalah,"Reshit Chokhmah, Gate of Holiness 17:153","And the reason is, as we already explained above, because the Yud-Kei-Vav-Kei is inscribed in the Brit, as is explained in the Tikkunei Zohar that “Mi Ya’ale Lanu Hashamayma” (who will ascend to heaven for us; Deuteronomy 30:12) is the acronym of ‘Milah’ (circumcision) and the backronym of Yud-Kei-Vav-Kei. Just like the name Yud-Kei-Vav-Kei is the root of all the other names, as is known, so too the Brit is the main sustainer of the body, and one who damages it seemingly damages the Yud-Kei-Vav-Kei, which includes all the attributes. Therefore, Teshuva is needed “enough to wipe their misdeeds”, which means it is as if he damaged all his body parts and all his actions, and with this Teshuva he can correct everything. "

What does “it is not in Heaven” mean? Rabbi Yirmiya said: “That the Torah was already given on Mount Sinai, and we do not pay attention to a heavenly voice, because long ago at Mount Sinai You wrote in Your Torah at Mount Sinai, ‘After the majority must one incline’ (Exodus 23:2).” Rabbi Nathan met [the prophet] Elijah and asked him, “What did the Holy One do at that moment?” Elijah: “He laughed [with joy], saying, ‘My children have defeated Me, My children have defeated Me.’ ” (Babylonian Talmud, Baba Metzia 59b)"

30,12,Guides,"Introductions to the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot, Introduction to Berakhot 5","The choice in favor of practical manifestation of a concept, despite the rigidity of this form of expression, is multifaceted. The fundamental outlook of Judaism is that the essence of the Torah and the objective of creation are the actualization of the Torah as a living Torah. “It is not in the heavens”; (Deuteronomy 30:12.)  rather, it was given to man and for man. The closer Torah is to man, the more concrete and practical it is, the closer it is to fulfilling its objective."

30,12,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Introduction of the Author 37","Afterwards, the Torah reduced all [religious] service to the service of the heart and tongue in saying ""For this commandment which I command you today is not hidden from you, neither is it far off; It is not in Heaven...But the matter is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it"" (Deut.30:11).

30,12,Jewish Thought,"Netivot Olam, Netiv Haanava 8:1","The trait of humility is what causes one to merit Torah. It is as we say in the first chapter of Taanit (7a): Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi said, ""Why are matters of Torah likened to water, as it is written (Isaiah 55:1), 'Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water.' [Because] just as water leaves a high place and flows to a low place, so too, Torah matters are retained only by one whose spirit is lowly, etc.,"" as was explained above in the Path (Netiv) of Torah. And we have already said above that humility has the most simplicity (as opposed to being compound and constructed from several elements). And hence this trait is fit for Torah, which is the simple intellect. And haughtiness is the opposite of this, as it is a material trait. And all of this is since a haughty person is the opposite of simplicity, since anything simple will not be distinct nor limited, whereas one who has pride in his character and his thought is separate from other people; so he is excessively distant from simplicity. And this thing is clear. And the Sages hinted to this in several places: In Tractate Shabbat (89a) in the chapter [entitled] Rabbi Akiva in a homelitical passage. As there they said [about Moshe], ""Since you belittled yourself, the Torah will be called by your name."" So behold they explained that humility is something intrinsic to the Torah. For they said, ""Because of this, the Torah will be called by your name,"" because of the excessive humility that Moshe had, as Scripture testifies about him (Numbers 12:3), ""And the man, Moshe, was very humble."" Since he was unique in humility, he was unique in Torah. And that is since this trait, humility, is simplicity, and the intellect is simple. But a proud person, who deviates from simplicity, tends towards the material. Therefore they said in the first chapter of Eruvin (13b), ""'It is not in heaven' (Deuteronomy 30:12) - it is not to be found in the haughty,"" as we explained this thing in very many places."
30,12,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 30:12,"It is not in the heavens, which might lead the people to say: Who will ascend for us to the heavens and take it for us, and communicate it to us, that we will perform it? Although we desire to observe the Torah, it is too lofty and abstract for us. If someone would bring it down to us, we would observe it. To counter that claim, Moses explains that he has already brought the Torah down from the heavens, and it is now within their reach."
30,14,Jewish Thought,"The Jonathan Sacks Haggadah; Essays, The Story of Stories 32","Often, we are too little aware of the majesty and uniqueness of the Jewish heritage. Moses once said, in words of great wisdom, “It is not up in heaven…. Nor is it beyond the sea…. The word is very close to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, waiting to be done” (Deut. 30:12–14). One of Judaism’s great insights is that religious truth is not exotic. It does not need to be sought far away in an ashram in India, or in a private ecstasy of the soul. No faith has worshipped a more transcendental God, but no faith has brought God so close. The Shekhina, the Divine Presence, lives in the very texture of everyday acts and relationships if we train ourselves to hear their music and open our eyes to their radiance. It is there in the beauty of the Jewish home, the resonance of our rituals, the drama and sweep of Jewish history, the sheer persistence of our people, and the determination of generation after generation of Jews to live their faith and hand it on to their children when they might so easily have done otherwise. And it began on Pesaḥ, when a much-afflicted people began its long journey across space and time in response to a divine call."

We do not find God in a realm beyond life – in heaven or after death, in mystic disengagement from the world or in philosophical contemplation. We find God in life. We find God in love and joy (the keywords of Deuteronomy). To find God, he says in Parashat Nitzavim, you do not have to climb to heaven or cross the sea (Deut. 30:12–13). God is here. God is now.

Another matter, “for [this] mitzva…it is not in the heavens” – Moses said to them: ‘So you will not say: Another Moses will stand and bring us another Torah from Heaven, I am already informing you: “It is not in the heavens,” as nothing of it remained in Heaven.’  Another matter, Rabbi Ḥanina said: It and all the tools of its craft were given; its humility, its righteousness, its uprightness, and the giving of its reward.  Another matter, what is “it is not in the heavens”? Shmuel said: The Torah cannot be found among the astrologers, whose craft is in the heavens. They said to Shmuel: ‘But you are an astrologer and a Torah giant.’ He said to them: ‘I would look into astrology only when I was unoccupied in Torah. When? It is when I would enter the bathhouse.’ (One is not allowed to study Torah in the bathhouse.)  “And it is not across the sea, to say: Who will cross for us to the other side of the sea and take it for us, and communicate it to us that we will perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:13).  “Rather the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:14).  Another matter, “it is not in the heavens” – they said: ‘Our master, Moses, you are saying: “It is not in the heavens” and “it is not across the sea.” Where is it?’ He said to them: ‘It is is a place that is near: “in your mouth and in your heart to perform it.” It is not distant from you, it is near to you.’  Another matter, “in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” – the Rabbis said: Solomon said seven matters regarding the idler, but what Moses said was greater than all of them. How so? They said to the idler: ‘Your teacher is in the city, go and learn Torah from him.’ He answers them and says to them: ‘I am afraid of the lion on the way.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The idler says: There is a lion on the way” (Proverbs 26:13). They said to him: ‘Your teacher is in the neighborhood, get up and go to him.’ He says to them: ‘I am afraid that there might be a lion outside,’ as it is stated: “A lion in the streets” (Proverbs 26:13). They said to him: ‘He is residing next to your house.’ He said to them: ‘But the lion is outside,’ as it is stated: “The idler says: There is a lion in the street” (Proverbs 22:13). They said to him: ‘Inside the house.’ He said to them: ‘But if I go and find the door [of his room] locked, I will need to come back.’ They said to him: ‘It is open.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The door turns on its hinges, and the idler is on his bed” (Proverbs 26:14). Ultimately, he did not know what to answer. He said to them: ‘Whether the door is open or locked, I wish to sleep a bit longer.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “How long will you lie down, idler? [When will you arise from your sleep?]” (Proverbs 6:9). He awakened from his sleep in the morning, they placed before him to eat. He was too lazy to put it in his mouth. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The idler inserts his hand into the dish; he is too weary to return it to his mouth” (Proverbs 26:15). Which is the seventh? “From the winter, the idler will not plow; he will ask at harvest, and there is nothing” (Proverbs 20:4). What is, “from the winter, the idler will not plow”? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: This is one who does not study Torah in his youth and seeks to study in his old age, but is unable to do so. That is, “he will ask at harvest, and there is nothing.” But what Moses said was greater than all of them. From where is it derived? “Rather, the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” – take the matter out of your mouth."

As Rashi explains, if it were up in Heaven, we would need to go and get it. For such a person, the Torah is indeed close. Everything depends on the person's effort. When one toils to seek out the Torah, they realize it was never far from them. However, without effort, it will always seem distant."

Since their judgment inclined to ""unclean,"" though they knew that their consensus was at variance with the truth, they did not wish to pronounce it clean.

30,12,Jewish Thought,Derashot HaRan 3:25,"The understanding is as follows: All of the Torah — both the written and the oral — was given to Moses on Sinai, as our sages have stated (Megillah 19b): ""R. Chiyya b. Avin said in the name of R. Yochanan: 'From the verse (Deuteronomy 9:13) ""…and upon them according to all the words…"" we infer that the Holy One Blessed be He showed Moses all of the Torah's deductions and all of the scribes' deductions and what the scribes were destined to originate, namely, the reading of the Megillah.'"" ""The scribes' deductions are the disputes and differences of view among the Torah scholars — and all of them were taught to Moses our teacher, may peace be upon him, by the Omnipotent One with the provision that the decision be according to the consensus of the sages of the respective generations. And this underlies the episode of R. Eliezer Hagadol and his dispute, concerning which we are told (Bava Metzia 59b) that R. Yehoshua arose and declared (Deuteronomy 30:12): ""It is not in the heavens!"" What is the intent of ""It is not in the heavens""? It has already been given to Moses on Mount Sinai, and in it is written (Exodus 23:2): ""After the multitude to incline [judgment]."" Now it was clear to all that R.

30,12,Jewish Thought,Derashot HaRan 11:21,"And this is the intent of (Chagigah 3b): ""Lest you would say: 'If these say ""unclean"" and these say ""clean,"" how can I learn Torah from now on?' — the verse (Ecclesiastes 12:11) tells us: 'They [words of Torah] were all given by one shepherd' — one leader stated them at the behest of the L-rd of all creation, as it is written (Exodus 20:1): 'And the L-rd spoke all of these words.'"" It is hereby affirmed that the words of those who rule ""unclean"" and those who rule ""clean,"" those who rule ""unfit"" and those who rule ""fit"" were all stated by Moses at G-d's behest. Now this is impossible unless understood as we have explained it. For, in view of the fact that the words of those who rule ""unclean"" and those who rule ""clean"" are mutually contradictory, how can it be that both accord with the truth, and how can it be that both were received by Moses from the L-rd? ""Can there be a doubt in the mind of G-d?"" (Berachoth 3b). The idea, however, is as we have explained. The L-rd has relegated all of these decisions to the sages of the generations and has commanded us to abide by them, so that their ruling on anything represents G-d's command to Moses. And it is our conviction that if they rule against the truth — even if we know this to be the case through a heavenly voice [bath kol] or through a prophet — we are not to deviate from the ruling of the sages. This is exemplified in the episode of R. Eliezer Hagadol and the sages (Bava Metzia 59b). Although R. Eliezer gave great, formidable signs that the truth lay with him, and a bath kol came forth from heaven and said: ""What business have you with R. Eliezer, with whom the halachah universally accords?"" — in spite of this, they refused to concur with him and excommunicated him in convocation [for refusing to recant]. For the Blessed One did not relegate the resolution of halachic doubts to a prophet or to a heavenly voice but to the sages of the generation. This is the import of R. Yehoshua's arising and proclaiming (Deuteronomy 30:12): ""It is not in the heavens!"""
30,12,Jewish Thought,Derashot HaRan 12:34,"The answer: there is no prophet who can be believed to a greater extent than Moses was before the revelation at Mount Sinai — through the giving of signs alone! For even before that time Moses had been believed in respect to certain details of Pesach, and a prophet is not to be believed to institute a mitzvah for all time, as our sages have stated (Temurah 16a): ""'These are the mitzvoth' — a prophet may not institute anything after this."" He is not even believed to rule upon any matters in the Torah unresolved by the sages, as is indicated in the Gemara (Ibid): ""R. Yehudah said in the name of Rav: 'When Moses our teacher was about to enter Gan Eden, he said to Joshua: ""Ask of me any doubts that you have."" Joshua replied: ""My master, did I leave you for even one moment? Is it not written in the Torah (Exodus 33:11): 'And his servant, Joshua the son of Nun, did not depart from the midst of the tent'!"" Immediately, Joshua's powers weakened, he forgot three hundred halachoth, three hundred doubts arose in his mind, and all of Israel rose against him to kill him. At this the Holy One Blessed be He said to him: ""To tell you is impossible; go and busy them with war [to turn their attention away from you], as it is written: (Joshua 1:1): 'And it was after the death of Moses the servant of the L-rd that the L-rd said to Joshua… (11) …prepare food for yourselves…'""'"" And it is stated further (Temurah, Ibid): ""R. Yehudah said in the name of Shmuel: 'Three thousand halachoth were forgotten in the period of mourning for Moses our teacher. The Jews said to Joshua: ""Ask [that they be revealed to you]."" Joshua responded: (Deuteronomy 30:12): ""It [Torah] is not in the heavens."" They said to Shmuel: ""Ask."" He responded: ""'These are the mitzvoth' — a prophet may not institute anything after this.""'"" A prophet can not be believed, then, either to institute a mitzvah or to explicate it, but only to give temporary commands alone, and Moses was believed in this respect on the basis of signs alone."
30,12,Talmud,Bava Metzia 59b:5,"Rabbi Yehoshua stood on his feet and said: It is written: “It is not in heaven” (Deuteronomy 30:12). The Gemara asks: What is the relevance of the phrase “It is not in heaven” in this context? Rabbi Yirmeya says: Since the Torah was already given at Mount Sinai, we do not regard a Divine Voice, as You already wrote at Mount Sinai, in the Torah: “After a majority to incline” (Exodus 23:2). Since the majority of Rabbis disagreed with Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, the halakha is not ruled in accordance with his opinion. The Gemara relates: Years after, Rabbi Natan encountered Elijah the prophet and said to him: What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do at that time, when Rabbi Yehoshua issued his declaration? Elijah said to him: The Holy One, Blessed be He, smiled and said: My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me."
30,12,Talmud,Bava Metzia 59b:1,"And this is known as the oven of akhnai. The Gemara asks: What is the relevance of akhnai, a snake, in this context? Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said: It is characterized in that manner due to the fact that the Rabbis surrounded it with their statements like this snake, which often forms a coil when at rest, and deemed it impure. The Sages taught: On that day, when they discussed this matter, Rabbi Eliezer answered all possible answers in the world to support his opinion, but the Rabbis did not accept his explanations from him."
30,12,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol I, Introduction, The Methodology of Halakhah 4","Although the Torah itself is immutable, the Sages teach that the interpretation of its many laws and regulations is entirely within the province of human intellect. Torah is divine but ""lo ba-shamayim hi—it is not in the heavens"" (Deut. 30:12); it is to be interpreted and applied by man. A remarkable corollary to the principle of the immutability of the Torah is the principle that, following the revelation at Sinai, no further heavenly clarification of doubt or resolution of ambiguity is possible. Clarification and elucidation are themselves forms of change. Since there can be no new revelation, a prophet who claims the ability to resolve disputed legal points by virtue of his prophetic power stands convicted by his own mouth of being a false prophet."
30,12,Halakhah,"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol VI, Chapter 5 Medical Malpractice and Jewish Law 35","That consideration, however, is relevant only from the divine perspective; insofar as the obligations of a man to his fellow man are concerned, ""[the Torah] is not in Heaven"" (Deuteronomy 30:12). Hence the dayyan may be required to compensate the victim of his mistake if, in terms of terrestrial considerations, the dayyan has committed a culpable error. But, since in the eyes of Heaven he is entirely guiltless and a person who is unaware of any harm that he may have caused cannot compensate the victim, Heaven must hold him guiltless in every sense unless he becomes aware of his error. Thus assured, the dayyan has no reason to shirk the duties of his office. The dayyan is dedicated to his sacred calling and, if competent, dare not be dissuaded by fear of potential financial loss. (Regarding the obligation of a qualified scholar not to demur when requested to serve as a dayyan see R. Moses Sofer, Teshuvot Ḥatam Sofer, Ḥoshen Mishpat, no. 169 and this writer’s elucidation of that obligation in Be-Netivot ha-Halakhah, IV (New York, 5771), 180-181.)  If the dayyan errs, he will dutifully make restitution. His real fear is the fear of inadvertent sin and on that score the biblical verse serves to put his mind at ease."
30,12,Halakhah,"Care of the Critically Ill, Responsa of Rav Moshe Feinstein, Preface to Iggeros Moshe, Volume I 5","However, in my humble opinion, [the scholars of earlier generations,] despite their inferiority when compared to the Torah scholars of [still] earlier generations, and, therefore, their concern lest they rule in error—an error known to Hashem—did not refrain from assuming the obligation to do so. The Torah instructs us, ""It is not in heaven"" [Deuteronomy 30:12]. Each posek must rule as he sees fit, after meticulous study and analysis of all the relevant texts and prior rulings, to the best of his ability, fully cognizant of the heavy responsibility he has assumed in applying Hashem's Torah to the life of the Jew. If, after all his efforts, his ruling does not concur with that known to Hashem, he may take comfort in the statement of our sages: ""Both these and those are the words of our Living Lord"" [Eruvin 13a]. If he makes his decision with due diligence, he will be rewarded for his efforts even though he has not divined the real truth."
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 16:1:6,"Though man's original equipment is supplied by G-d, and though his eventual accomplishments are subject to G-d’s benevolent guidance or otherwise, the fact that he was created ""in the image of G-d,"" i.e. was given free choice, has made him the master of his own destiny. This means that he can achieve whatever he is capable of achieving since the means to do so have been placed at his disposal to use at his discretion. Once man begins to travel the path towards what his natural talents enable him to achieve, he can count on the active assistance of His Maker to facilitate his progress along that route. ""He who comes to purify, is extended help"" (Shabbat 104). This is what Moses meant when he said (Deut.30,11-14), ""This commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you....in fact it is quite close to you."" If one applies oneself properly to the truth of G-d’s revealed word, i.e the Torah, then appreciating it becomes a simple matter. From that point onwards there are no real impediments or difficulties in achieving one's aim. In this respect, the fortitude of Abraham surpassed that of anyone before him, since during the preceding generations people had become progressively more corrupt until they endangered the survival of their species. Even the few whose conduct at the time of their respective deaths merited a suspended sentence had failed to look toward heaven for inspiration to recognise their Creator. They were content merely not to question the tradition that G-d had indeed created the universe. Noach was such a person. His righteousness was tamim, whole, meaning he continued to believe what Lemech his father had believed and what both his father and his grandfather Methuselah had taught him. He made no intellectual effort to understand the basis for this belief or to develop it so that it would influence his personality development. ""IN HIS GENERATIONS,"" i.e. through successive generations his righteousness remained static, did not become dynamic. His heart was pure, but his intellect was not involved. In Deut. 18,14, we are told, ""Be whole with the Lord your G-d,"" that we are to accept the truths taught by our prophets. This means in particular that the request of the Jewish people at Mount Sinai to have Moses talk to them and be the intermediary between G-d and them would result in a perfect and enduring faith. The belief resulting from the experience of revelation is called emunah of a temimut quality. There are two ways of acquiring this absolute faith. The easy way is study of the Torah, a method granted to the Jewish people. The other way is via intellectual analysis, the only method available to man prior to the revelation at Mount Sinai. This method does not only require the determination of the truth seeker, but active help from G-d Himself. Those who in their search for understanding of this truth also employ all their intellectual faculties, arrive at a far deeper and lasting understanding. This is why David told his son Solomon, ""Now my son Solomon, know the G-d of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart, a willing soul"" (Chronicles I 28,9). Abraham's tremendous achievement was that though he did not have the tradition of a Noach since both his father and grandfather had been pagans (Joshua 24,2), he began to develop this faith through an intellectual approach. At first, he concentrated on demonstrating the complete bankruptcy of the belief held by his contemporaries. Afterwards, having travelled as far as it is possible to travel by means of one's intellect alone, with the help of G-d’s Personal Providence, he arrived at that level of faith in his Creator which the Torah describes as ""He believed in the Lord, and the Latter gave him credit for this"" (Genesis 15,6). Later, at the time of his cirumcision, Abraham would be asked, ""Walk in front of Me,"" to demonstrate a degree of faith that surpasses what his intellect can comprehend. In this way, he would outclass Noach who had only ""walked with G-d,"" his faith only keeping step with his intellectual faculties, never exceeding them. "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 60:1:3,"In defining the relative merit of ""good,” it can be said that the greatest ""good"" is that which confers the greatest number of benefits on the greatest number of people, without at the same time restricting the rights of the individual. Sunlight and warmth which embraces all people in equal measure, is a greater ""good"" than candlelight for instance. The latter provides light for only a limited number of people, the candle is not available for everyone, but has to be paid for by someone. Compared to the bounty of government, whose wealth and ability is very limited when measured against the wealth of the Almighty, only G'd has the ability to provide for everyone from an inexhaustible reservoir. ""The Lord is good to All” (Psalms 145,9) This point is made by king Saul in Samuel I 22,7-8. He says that even if David had the best of intentions, he could not possibly grant everyone what they desire. Also, since the universe is constructed in a manner which makes each of its constituent parts indispensable to the proper functioning of the whole, the whole cannot merely be a multiplicity of components which each perform the identical function, and therefore are all of the same rank. To view the fact that some creatures appear more distinguished than others as proof of injustice, or to view the fact that parts of the body seem more precious than others, as proof of discrimination, is foolish. To arrive at the conclusion that these distinctions are the result of accident or lack of ability on the part of the Creator, is equally erroneous. ""And His mercy extends to all His creatures,"" (Psalms 145,9) Each part in creation is equipped to perform its allotted task in the grand scheme of the Creator. In spite of all the foregoing, G'd has bestowed special loving care on His people Israel. The yovel year legislation etc prevents permanent loss of a family's inheritance, i.e. landed wealth. Jews must not be given menial tasks to perform. He who sells himself, is punishable; the Torah takes a dim view of such action. In short, Torah legislation is aimed at preserving the lofty status of the Jewish nation at the time when that nation accepted Torah as its national constitution. Vayikra Rabbah 13, mentions that the food and drink legislation also aims at the purification of man, just as Torah legislation as such, aims at purifying and refining man by limiting his indiscrimate indulgence in pleasurable activities meant only to gratify his body. Yalkut Shimoni Bereshit 31, points out that ""he who wants to live, will die; he who is prepared to die, will live."" Whatever man denies himself in this world, will ensure his life in the eternal world. The more he indulges himself in this life, however, the more likely is he to forfeit his share of eternal life. The aggadah in Baba Batra 74, portraying G'd as castrating the male leviathan, and killing the female, salting away its flesh for consumption by the righteous in the world to come, may express a similar idea. The separate creation of the males and females may symbolise the defusion of the physical and the spiritual. If the most powerful union of body and spirit in this universe, (Leviathan) would be allowed to roam completely unfettered, they could destroy the entire civilisation, G'd forbid. If human intelligence were to be used exclusively to advance his materialistic aspirations, the results could be disastrous. Alternately, if the body would be used exclusively to advance the interests of the spirit, this would also be contrary to G'ds plan for His universe. Therefore, G'd insured the survival of both as separate entities. As such, both are able to make their respective contributions to G'ds overall design for the world, without being able to completely upset such design. Pursuing the same subject matter, Pessachim 119, relates a strange story. In the world of the future, G'd will prepare a meal for the righteous. After having eaten and drunk, the cup is offered to Abraham to lead the other guests in reciting grace. Abraham declines the honour, saying that since he had sired Ishmael, he did not think he deserved this honour. Using similar reasoning, also Isaac declines, seeing he had fathered Esau. Jacob too declines, citing the fact that he had married two sisters while they were both alive. (something that would be forbidden once the Torah had been revealed) Moses declines the honour, saying that he had not been found fit to enter the holy land. Joshua declines, saying that he had not been found worthy to have a son. When the cup was offered to David, he accepted. He proclaimed ""I shall raise the cup of salvation and call out in the name of the Lord."" What we learn from here is that self control is valued so highly, that David was considered worthy to recite grace more than his illustrious ancestors including prophets. He alone of all those present, had possessed an active yetzer hara, sensual urges. Even though he might have sinned, compared to the many temptations he had been exposed to throughout his life, his sins were insignificant. All the others present must be viewed as tzaddikim gemurim, saintly by nature. (compare our commentary on chapter 41) Esther, who had been the only one among all the contestants for Ahasverus' favour, who had not availed herself of every means to enhance her physical charms, was rewarded by becoming queen. This was precisely because she did not make demands on life. External circumstances play an important part in shaping one's character. ""The air of the land of Israel, makes wise."" (Baba Balra 158 ) Exposure to certain climates advances one's ability to absorb knowledge. Inhabitants of parts of the globe subject to extremes of heat or cold, reflect this in their general behaviour. Since the land of Israel was considered as possessing a superior climate, being called eretz hatzvee, the choicest of countries, its climate can bestow benefits on its inhabitants. Rabbi Tanchum in Vayikra Rabba 13, says that a doctor who had two patients only one of whom he diagnosed as capable of making a recovery, imposed a rigorous diet on the patient he thought had a chance to recover. He did not place any restrictions on the other patient. Similarly, Israel and the gentiles. Israel, which has its after life at stake, must ensure that its food habits are such that that this after life is not jeopardised. The gentiles, who have not qualified for such after life, do not need to impose any restrictions on their food intake, therefore. On no account is the legislation of forbidden foods to be seen in the context of contributing to or detracting from physical well being, bodily health. Chapter fourteen in Deuteronomy begins by listing the otherness of the Jewish people. ""You are children to the Lord your G'd; do not make incisions on your body when mourning the dead, neither make bald spots, because you are a holy nation...Do not eat anything which is an abomination."" With this preamble, the Torah introduces the legislation about forbidden foods. If this legislation had hygiene, sanitary considerations, as its objective, it would reduce Torah to being a medical textbook, and a very abbreviated one at that. This thought is intolerable, if only for the fact that many of the health hazards in certain foods could be neutralized by the use of spices and other preservatives. Since we observe many nations who do eat foods that we consider abominations, enjoy good health, it is clear that the legislation is not aimed at our physical health, but rather at our mental health. Such foods as are listed as forbidden, might drive out the holy spirit that dwells within each Jew. David asks the Lord in Psalm 51,13, ""do not take away Your holy spirit from me!"" Since our sages suggest that the names of certain forbidden animals symbolise characteristics of different nations, and since many of these nations did not exist at the time the legislation was formulated, it is clear that they felt that consuming certain foods would eventually leave its mark on the character of such people. Examples are gamal for the Babylonians; arnevet for the Creeks; shafan for the Medes. The fact that these names seem repeated unaccountably in scripture, gave rise to these interpretations. Since G'd had said to Moses concerning achievements of our individual goals in life ""it lies within your mouth and within your heart to accomplish,"" (Deut 30,11-14) it is no more than reasonable to include our food intake in that advice, i.e. ""within your mouth."" "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 65:1:12,"When perusing our Parshah, we are confronted with a number of difficulties. 1) In order to convince someone to work on perfecting himself, one would expect the demands to be made on such a person to increase gradually, not to shock the student by listing all the demands that are made upon him all at once. That this is sound psychology, is attested to by the Torah itself, where we read (Deuteronomy 30, 11-14)) ""for this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you, neither is it far away; it is not in Heaven so that you could say ""who shall go up to the Heavens for us and bring it to us? For it is very close at hand, in your mouth and in your heart to perform."" On the other hand, what can frighten someone off more than a command such as ""be holy for I am holy?"" 2) Why do the commandments in our Parshah that parallel the ten commandments appear in a different order? (""Honour your parents,"" is listed as the first instead of the fifth commandment; ""keep the Sabbath,"" is listed as number two instead of as number four. ""Do not worship idols,"" is listed in third position instead of in second place) 3) After the Torah has completed the list, and concluded by saying ""sanctify yourselves,"" (20,7) why begin once more with such commandments as ""not to curse parents, not to commit adultery etc?"" 4) Why is the matter of attaining holiness mentioned three times? "
30,13,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 92:1:10,"The ""fear"" described in our Parshah is not only permissible, but leads to ""love."" To illustrate the meaning of G'ds request, let us employ a parable. A person was asked to scale a skyscraper whose doors were all locked at the bottom, and which appeared impossible to enter. When the person reacted with resignation, throwing up his hands in despair, it was pointed out to him that the request had not been accompanied by a time limit, nor had it specified the means of entry to be used or the manner in which the skyscraper had to be climbed. By using an extension ladder, the task could be accomplished one section at a time, without undue hardship for the climber. This is exactly what the Torah means (Deut 30,12-13) ""She is not in Heaven, not too difficult for you to achieve, but close by, attainable."" It can be accomplished gradually, step by step. If G'd had asked us for angel like, immediate and total achievement, it would indeed have been difficult; but as it is, we are not asked to perform any task that we are not equipped to handle. The ladder that the Torah provides for climbing the skyscraper has several rungs. The ""fear,"" without which no further ascent is possible. Even if one performs the mitzvot only because of fear of punishment, one is no worse than small children learning obedience. However, even this has ethical merit since it will lead to performance based on loftier motivations. Horiot 10, teaches ""doing the right thing for the wrong reason, will eventually lead to doing the right thing for the right reason."" "
30,12,Jewish Thought,"Conversion ""According to Halakhah""; What Is It 2:5","We conclude with the discussion of one of the most striking examples of halakhic boldness and independence found in the Talmud. We have in mind the great debate about the tanur shel Akhnai, the oven of Akhnai. The subject matter of the debate itself is irrelevant to our discussion. The dispute over the law in this case raged between Rabbi Eliezer the son of Horkenos and the other masters. Since his colleagues did not accept his arguments, the mighty Rabbi Eliezer wrought a number of miracles to prove that he was right. The miracles were disregarded. Finally, a voice from heaven came to the support of Rabbi Eliezer declaring: “What do you want from Rabbi Eliezer? The halakhah is always as he teaches it!” What was there for the rabbis to do? The Talmud continues the story: Rabbi Joshua then stood up and said (quoting from the Bible somewhat out of context): “It is not in heaven!” (Deut. 30:12). And this explanation is given: Said Rabbi Jeremiah: “What does it mean, ‘It is not in heaven’? The Torah has already been given to us on the mountain. We pay no attention, not even to a heavenly voice. Because You (i.e., God) have already written in the Torah at the mountain: ‘Decide according to the majority’“ (Exodus, 23:2. This, of course, is itself a “halakhic” re-interpretation of the literary meaning of the text.) Needless to say, the second part of the story is no longer about the oven of Akhnai. It is about the confrontation between the divine voice, which the rabbis clearly received, and their own conscience as to what was the right decision in the case of the oven. How did they resolve the confrontation? They beat the divine voice with God’s own words, as they understood those words. However, their own personal share in the decision is obvious. For one could have easily argued with Rabbi Joshua: It is true that one should rule in accordance with the majority opinion, but only when the discussion is among men. However, in a debate with God Himself, how dare you rule against God? How, indeed, dare you enter into a debate with Him? Yet, the rabbis did rule against a voice from heaven. Once again, there was a conflict between two demands of the Torah: to obey the heavenly voice or to administer the law in a given case as they were able to understand it. Once again, the conflict was resolved on the basis of a more comprehensive principle which, in the rabbis’ own estimation, deserved priority. The story itself finds its charming conclusion as follows: Rabbi Natan met the prophet Elijah (who, in Jewish lore, occasionally walks among the people and reveals himself to them) and asked him, “What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do in that hour (of the great debate)?” Said Elijah: “He laughed and exclaimed, ‘My children have defeated me, my children have defeated me’!” (T.B. Baba Mezia, 59b). The postscript to the story is decisive. To His own joy, God is overruled. A specific word of God is controlled by a more comprehensive divine command. Therein lies the secret of the creative vitality of the halakhah. We might now formulate it more generally. When, in a given situation, a specific law is in conflict with another law, principle, or concern of the Torah, the specific law may be limited in its application, re-interpreted, adapted, suspended or changed in this one situation but not abolished, by the overruling concern of the total Torah."
30,12,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, Nitzavim, Why Be Jewish? 3","In the first of the following essays, I look at the phrase in which Moses says that he is making the covenant not only with the Israelites of his day but with all future generations of Jews. How can a covenant be binding on people not yet born? The second essay focuses on teshuva, “repentance” or “return.” Nahmanides derives the concept from Parashat Nitzavim, while Maimonides gives it a different source and understands it differently. I show how the two approaches came together in the post-biblical era. The third and fourth essays are about Moses’ statement that the Torah is “not in heaven” (Deut. 30:12) nor is it “across the sea” (30:13). The former gave rise to a radical rabbinic reading about the authority given to the sages of each generation to interpret the Torah. The latter, I argue, is a warning against the recurring Jewish temptation to seek salvation outside Judaism. The final essay is about choice itself, which turns out to be the fourteenth principle of Jewish faith."

30,14,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part III 10:25","Therefore, the correct interpretation [of la’asoso”] is [“to create it,”] which refers to the deep [analysis] of the halachah that is incumbent upon you to infer, [even though] it is distant from you. As explained in the above-mentioned reference, (The verses in Deut. 30:11–14 are elaborated further in Eruvin 54b–55a: “R. Eliezer said: [The verse] ‘You shall call understanding modah [a relative]’ [Prov. 7:14] teaches one to make signs for the Torah. Rava said: ‘[This teaches one] to set moadim [times] for Torah study.’ And this is what was stated by Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa, What is the meaning of what Scripture states: ‘It is not in the heavens… nor is it across the sea’? [The words], ‘It is not in the heavens’] implies that if it were in the heavens, you would be required to go up in pursuit of it; and if it were across the sea, you would have to cross the sea in pursuit of it.” The She’iltos explains that Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa is saying that if a Talmud scholar has a teacher who lives overseas, he is required to travel overseas in order to study from him. The Netziv writes that the She’iltos understands that we infer from the verse in Proverbs that since one achieves understanding mainly by studying daily with a rabbi, it is important to set times for Torah study – that is, to organize classes. Since the Talmud connects the inference from Proverbs to Deuteronomy, the She’iltos understands Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa to be stating that Deuteronomy is exhorting one to study from his rabbi even if it means that he must travel to his rabbi who lives overseas. The Netziv explains that the verses in Deuteronomy state further that if “it is in the heavens” – if the Torah seems to be too holy and difficult to grasp – we must discuss it aloud with others and apply deep analysis. As stated in Proverbs according to R. Eliezer: “Make signs for the Torah” – in other words, devise and pursue whatever strategy is necessary to understand and grasp the Torah.)  you may think that it is in the heavens or overseas. In other words, it may appear to you [to be impossible] to produce laws from deep analysis [by yourselves], and thus it is as if [these laws] were in the heavens. Or [you may think] that you will have to travel overseas [to find] a rabbi who has already learned these laws. Therefore, Scripture states that this is not so. Rather, it is within the ability of your mouth and heart to produce these matters of halachah. The interpretation of la’asos is similar to the way we previously explained [in chapter 8], “good understanding to all oseihem (who perform them),’ (Psalms 111:10.)  where [oseihem should be translated as “make them”], i.e., to produce the halachah. (Therefore, the verse is to be translated as, “It is with your mouth and your heart to produce it.”)  Thus, one can explain that the words “and your heart” is tied to “and your mouth”; the speech [of Torah study] should be with the toil of the flesh, influencing the heart [understanding], and this is how one brings the halachah to light. This is the interpretation of the Midrash which infers [from: “For by the mouth of these words’ (Ex. 34:27. Usually translated as, “for according to these words.”) ] that one must toil [in the Torah with one’s mouth]."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

It does not need to be sought far away in an ashram in India, or in a private ecstasy of the soul. No faith has worshipped a more transcendental God, but no faith has brought God so close. The Shekhina, the Divine Presence, lives in the very texture of everyday acts and relationships if we train ourselves to hear their music and open our eyes to their radiance. It is there in the beauty of the Jewish home, the resonance of our rituals, the drama and sweep of Jewish history, the sheer persistence of our people, and the determination of generation after generation of Jews to live their faith and hand it on to their children when they might so easily have done otherwise. And it began on Pesaḥ, when a much-afflicted people began its long journey across space and time in response to a divine call."

Another matter, what is “it is not in the heavens”? Shmuel said: The Torah cannot be found among the astrologers, whose craft is in the heavens. They said to Shmuel: ‘But you are an astrologer and a Torah giant.’ He said to them: ‘I would look into astrology only when I was unoccupied in Torah. When? It is when I would enter the bathhouse.’ (One is not allowed to study Torah in the bathhouse.)  “And it is not across the sea, to say: Who will cross for us to the other side of the sea and take it for us, and communicate it to us that we will perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:13).  “Rather the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:14).  Another matter, “it is not in the heavens” – they said: ‘Our master, Moses, you are saying: “It is not in the heavens” and “it is not across the sea.” Where is it?’ He said to them: ‘It is is a place that is near: “in your mouth and in your heart to perform it.” It is not distant from you, it is near to you.’  Another matter, “in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” – the Rabbis said: Solomon said seven matters regarding the idler, but what Moses said was greater than all of them. How so? They said to the idler: ‘Your teacher is in the city, go and learn Torah from him.’ He answers them and says to them: ‘I am afraid of the lion on the way.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The idler says: There is a lion on the way” (Proverbs 26:13). They said to him: ‘Your teacher is in the neighborhood, get up and go to him.’ He says to them: ‘I am afraid that there might be a lion outside,’ as it is stated: “A lion in the streets” (Proverbs 26:13). They said to him: ‘He is residing next to your house.’ He said to them: ‘But the lion is outside,’ as it is stated: “The idler says: There is a lion in the street” (Proverbs 22:13). They said to him: ‘Inside the house.’ He said to them: ‘But if I go and find the door [of his room] locked, I will need to come back.’ They said to him: ‘It is open.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The door turns on its hinges, and the idler is on his bed” (Proverbs 26:14). Ultimately, he did not know what to answer. He said to them: ‘Whether the door is open or locked, I wish to sleep a bit longer.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “How long will you lie down, idler? [When will you arise from your sleep?]” (Proverbs 6:9). He awakened from his sleep in the morning, they placed before him to eat. He was too lazy to put it in his mouth. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The idler inserts his hand into the dish; he is too weary to return it to his mouth” (Proverbs 26:15). Which is the seventh? “From the winter, the idler will not plow; he will ask at harvest, and there is nothing” (Proverbs 20:4). What is, “from the winter, the idler will not plow”? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: This is one who does not study Torah in his youth and seeks to study in his old age, but is unable to do so. That is, “he will ask at harvest, and there is nothing.” But what Moses said was greater than all of them.

30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 16:1:6,"Though man's original equipment is supplied by G-d, and though his eventual accomplishments are subject to G-d’s benevolent guidance or otherwise, the fact that he was created ""in the image of G-d,"" i.e. was given free choice, has made him the master of his own destiny. This means that he can achieve whatever he is capable of achieving since the means to do so have been placed at his disposal to use at his discretion. Once man begins to travel the path towards what his natural talents enable him to achieve, he can count on the active assistance of His Maker to facilitate his progress along that route. ""He who comes to purify, is extended help"" (Shabbat 104). This is what Moses meant when he said (Deut.30,11-14), ""This commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you....in fact it is quite close to you."" If one applies oneself properly to the truth of G-d’s revealed word, i.e the Torah, then appreciating it becomes a simple matter. From that point onwards there are no real impediments or difficulties in achieving one's aim. In this respect, the fortitude of Abraham surpassed that of anyone before him, since during the preceding generations people had become progressively more corrupt until they endangered the survival of their species. Even the few whose conduct at the time of their respective deaths merited a suspended sentence had failed to look toward heaven for inspiration to recognise their Creator. They were content merely not to question the tradition that G-d had indeed created the universe. Noach was such a person. His righteousness was tamim, whole, meaning he continued to believe what Lemech his father had believed and what both his father and his grandfather Methuselah had taught him. He made no intellectual effort to understand the basis for this belief or to develop it so that it would influence his personality development. ""IN HIS GENERATIONS,"" i.e. through successive generations his righteousness remained static, did not become dynamic. His heart was pure, but his intellect was not involved. In Deut. 18,14, we are told, ""Be whole with the Lord your G-d,"" that we are to accept the truths taught by our prophets. This means in particular that the request of the Jewish people at Mount Sinai to have Moses talk to them and be the intermediary between G-d and them would result in a perfect and enduring faith. The belief resulting from the experience of revelation is called emunah of a temimut quality. There are two ways of acquiring this absolute faith. The easy way is study of the Torah, a method granted to the Jewish people. The other way is via intellectual analysis, the only method available to man prior to the revelation at Mount Sinai. This method does not only require the determination of the truth seeker, but active help from G-d Himself. Those who in their search for understanding of this truth also employ all their intellectual faculties, arrive at a far deeper and lasting understanding. This is why David told his son Solomon, ""Now my son Solomon, know the G-d of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart, a willing soul"" (Chronicles I 28,9). Abraham's tremendous achievement was that though he did not have the tradition of a Noach since both his father and grandfather had been pagans (Joshua 24,2), he began to develop this faith through an intellectual approach. At first, he concentrated on demonstrating the complete bankruptcy of the belief held by his contemporaries. Afterwards, having travelled as far as it is possible to travel by means of one's intellect alone, with the help of G-d’s Personal Providence, he arrived at that level of faith in his Creator which the Torah describes as ""He believed in the Lord, and the Latter gave him credit for this"" (Genesis 15,6). Later, at the time of his cirumcision, Abraham would be asked, ""Walk in front of Me,"" to demonstrate a degree of faith that surpasses what his intellect can comprehend. In this way, he would outclass Noach who had only ""walked with G-d,"" his faith only keeping step with his intellectual faculties, never exceeding them. "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 60:1:3,"In defining the relative merit of ""good,” it can be said that the greatest ""good"" is that which confers the greatest number of benefits on the greatest number of people, without at the same time restricting the rights of the individual. Sunlight and warmth which embraces all people in equal measure, is a greater ""good"" than candlelight for instance. The latter provides light for only a limited number of people, the candle is not available for everyone, but has to be paid for by someone. Compared to the bounty of government, whose wealth and ability is very limited when measured against the wealth of the Almighty, only G'd has the ability to provide for everyone from an inexhaustible reservoir. ""The Lord is good to All” (Psalms 145,9) This point is made by king Saul in Samuel I 22,7-8. He says that even if David had the best of intentions, he could not possibly grant everyone what they desire. Also, since the universe is constructed in a manner which makes each of its constituent parts indispensable to the proper functioning of the whole, the whole cannot merely be a multiplicity of components which each perform the identical function, and therefore are all of the same rank. To view the fact that some creatures appear more distinguished than others as proof of injustice, or to view the fact that parts of the body seem more precious than others, as proof of discrimination, is foolish. To arrive at the conclusion that these distinctions are the result of accident or lack of ability on the part of the Creator, is equally erroneous. ""And His mercy extends to all His creatures,"" (Psalms 145,9) Each part in creation is equipped to perform its allotted task in the grand scheme of the Creator. In spite of all the foregoing, G'd has bestowed special loving care on His people Israel. The yovel year legislation etc prevents permanent loss of a family's inheritance, i.e. landed wealth. Jews must not be given menial tasks to perform. He who sells himself, is punishable; the Torah takes a dim view of such action. In short, Torah legislation is aimed at preserving the lofty status of the Jewish nation at the time when that nation accepted Torah as its national constitution. Vayikra Rabbah 13, mentions that the food and drink legislation also aims at the purification of man, just as Torah legislation as such, aims at purifying and refining man by limiting his indiscrimate indulgence in pleasurable activities meant only to gratify his body. Yalkut Shimoni Bereshit 31, points out that ""he who wants to live, will die; he who is prepared to die, will live."" Whatever man denies himself in this world, will ensure his life in the eternal world. The more he indulges himself in this life, however, the more likely is he to forfeit his share of eternal life. The aggadah in Baba Batra 74, portraying G'd as castrating the male leviathan, and killing the female, salting away its flesh for consumption by the righteous in the world to come, may express a similar idea. The separate creation of the males and females may symbolise the defusion of the physical and the spiritual. If the most powerful union of body and spirit in this universe, (Leviathan) would be allowed to roam completely unfettered, they could destroy the entire civilisation, G'd forbid. If human intelligence were to be used exclusively to advance his materialistic aspirations, the results could be disastrous. Alternately, if the body would be used exclusively to advance the interests of the spirit, this would also be contrary to G'ds plan for His universe. Therefore, G'd insured the survival of both as separate entities. As such, both are able to make their respective contributions to G'ds overall design for the world, without being able to completely upset such design. Pursuing the same subject matter, Pessachim 119, relates a strange story. In the world of the future, G'd will prepare a meal for the righteous. After having eaten and drunk, the cup is offered to Abraham to lead the other guests in reciting grace. Abraham declines the honour, saying that since he had sired Ishmael, he did not think he deserved this honour. Using similar reasoning, also Isaac declines, seeing he had fathered Esau. Jacob too declines, citing the fact that he had married two sisters while they were both alive. (something that would be forbidden once the Torah had been revealed) Moses declines the honour, saying that he had not been found fit to enter the holy land. Joshua declines, saying that he had not been found worthy to have a son. When the cup was offered to David, he accepted. He proclaimed ""I shall raise the cup of salvation and call out in the name of the Lord."" What we learn from here is that self control is valued so highly, that David was considered worthy to recite grace more than his illustrious ancestors including prophets. He alone of all those present, had possessed an active yetzer hara, sensual urges. Even though he might have sinned, compared to the many temptations he had been exposed to throughout his life, his sins were insignificant. All the others present must be viewed as tzaddikim gemurim, saintly by nature. (compare our commentary on chapter 41) Esther, who had been the only one among all the contestants for Ahasverus' favour, who had not availed herself of every means to enhance her physical charms, was rewarded by becoming queen. This was precisely because she did not make demands on life. External circumstances play an important part in shaping one's character. ""The air of the land of Israel, makes wise."" (Baba Balra 158 ) Exposure to certain climates advances one's ability to absorb knowledge. Inhabitants of parts of the globe subject to extremes of heat or cold, reflect this in their general behaviour. Since the land of Israel was considered as possessing a superior climate, being called eretz hatzvee, the choicest of countries, its climate can bestow benefits on its inhabitants. Rabbi Tanchum in Vayikra Rabba 13, says that a doctor who had two patients only one of whom he diagnosed as capable of making a recovery, imposed a rigorous diet on the patient he thought had a chance to recover. He did not place any restrictions on the other patient. Similarly, Israel and the gentiles. Israel, which has its after life at stake, must ensure that its food habits are such that that this after life is not jeopardised. The gentiles, who have not qualified for such after life, do not need to impose any restrictions on their food intake, therefore. On no account is the legislation of forbidden foods to be seen in the context of contributing to or detracting from physical well being, bodily health. Chapter fourteen in Deuteronomy begins by listing the otherness of the Jewish people. ""You are children to the Lord your G'd; do not make incisions on your body when mourning the dead, neither make bald spots, because you are a holy nation...Do not eat anything which is an abomination."" With this preamble, the Torah introduces the legislation about forbidden foods. If this legislation had hygiene, sanitary considerations, as its objective, it would reduce Torah to being a medical textbook, and a very abbreviated one at that. This thought is intolerable, if only for the fact that many of the health hazards in certain foods could be neutralized by the use of spices and other preservatives. Since we observe many nations who do eat foods that we consider abominations, enjoy good health, it is clear that the legislation is not aimed at our physical health, but rather at our mental health. Such foods as are listed as forbidden, might drive out the holy spirit that dwells within each Jew. David asks the Lord in Psalm 51,13, ""do not take away Your holy spirit from me!"" Since our sages suggest that the names of certain forbidden animals symbolise characteristics of different nations, and since many of these nations did not exist at the time the legislation was formulated, it is clear that they felt that consuming certain foods would eventually leave its mark on the character of such people. Examples are gamal for the Babylonians; arnevet for the Creeks; shafan for the Medes. The fact that these names seem repeated unaccountably in scripture, gave rise to these interpretations. Since G'd had said to Moses concerning achievements of our individual goals in life ""it lies within your mouth and within your heart to accomplish,"" (Deut 30,11-14) it is no more than reasonable to include our food intake in that advice, i.e. ""within your mouth."" "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 65:1:12,"When perusing our Parshah, we are confronted with a number of difficulties. 1) In order to convince someone to work on perfecting himself, one would expect the demands to be made on such a person to increase gradually, not to shock the student by listing all the demands that are made upon him all at once. That this is sound psychology, is attested to by the Torah itself, where we read (Deuteronomy 30, 11-14)) ""for this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you, neither is it far away; it is not in Heaven so that you could say ""who shall go up to the Heavens for us and bring it to us? For it is very close at hand, in your mouth and in your heart to perform."" On the other hand, what can frighten someone off more than a command such as ""be holy for I am holy?"" 2) Why do the commandments in our Parshah that parallel the ten commandments appear in a different order? (""Honour your parents,"" is listed as the first instead of the fifth commandment; ""keep the Sabbath,"" is listed as number two instead of as number four. ""Do not worship idols,"" is listed in third position instead of in second place) 3) After the Torah has completed the list, and concluded by saying ""sanctify yourselves,"" (20,7) why begin once more with such commandments as ""not to curse parents, not to commit adultery etc?"" 4) Why is the matter of attaining holiness mentioned three times? "
30,13,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 92:1:10,"The ""fear"" described in our Parshah is not only permissible, but leads to ""love."" To illustrate the meaning of G'ds request, let us employ a parable. A person was asked to scale a skyscraper whose doors were all locked at the bottom, and which appeared impossible to enter. When the person reacted with resignation, throwing up his hands in despair, it was pointed out to him that the request had not been accompanied by a time limit, nor had it specified the means of entry to be used or the manner in which the skyscraper had to be climbed. By using an extension ladder, the task could be accomplished one section at a time, without undue hardship for the climber. This is exactly what the Torah means (Deut 30,12-13) ""She is not in Heaven, not too difficult for you to achieve, but close by, attainable."" It can be accomplished gradually, step by step. If G'd had asked us for angel like, immediate and total achievement, it would indeed have been difficult; but as it is, we are not asked to perform any task that we are not equipped to handle. The ladder that the Torah provides for climbing the skyscraper has several rungs. The ""fear,"" without which no further ascent is possible. Even if one performs the mitzvot only because of fear of punishment, one is no worse than small children learning obedience. However, even this has ethical merit since it will lead to performance based on loftier motivations. Horiot 10, teaches ""doing the right thing for the wrong reason, will eventually lead to doing the right thing for the right reason."" "

The king had a certain friend who would enter to the king all the time, and the king’s daughter was standing before him. The king said to him: ‘See how beloved you are to me, as there is no creature who knows my daughter, and she stands before you.’ So, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘See how beloved you are to me, as there is no creature in my palace who knows the Torah, and I gave it to you,’ as it is stated: “It is vanished from the eyes of all living” (Job 28:21) . But you, “it is not hidden from you,” (Deuteronomy 30:11), but rather, “the matter is very near to you” (Deuteronomy 30:14). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘My children, if the matters of Torah are near to you, I call you near as well, as so it is written: “For the children of Israel, the people who are near to Him. Halleluya”’ (Psalms 148:14)."

(The commandments that pertain to the heart are the most important ones. Among the latter are the commandments to believe in God, to love God, etc.)  Some commandments require the uttering of statements which serve to reinforce the heart. (We thus recite the shema to reinforce our belief.)  Others consist of deeds (Such as donning tefilin.)  so that a person will utter the required statements. (So that a person will remember to recall verbally the commandment tied to the ritual. However, not all commandments observed by deeds have this as their purpose. See I.E. on Ex. 31:18 (Vol. 2, p. 410) where he divides the positive commandments into three categories: those to be observed by the heart, those to be observed by speech, and those to be observed by action.)

30,14,Quoting Commentary,Rabbeinu Yonah on Pirkei Avot 1:15:2,"""say little and do much"": When you promise your friend to do something for him, tell him a little and do much for him, and that is in the way of ethics and piety.

And our rabbis, may their memory be blessed, learned it from the blessed Holy One, blessed be He, who only promised with two letters, as it is stated (Genesis 15:14), ""I will judge (dan, a word which is written with only two letters); and delivered them with twenty seven words, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:14), ""Or has any god ventured to go and take for himself one nation from the midst of another, etc."" And about this Rabbi Saadia Gaon, my his memory be blessed, said, ""If in promising our fathers with two letters, he did for them many miracles and wonders; [with] the salvation in the future to come about which have been written many pages and many manuscripts and many books of promises and many consolations in Jeremiah in the Prophets, how much the more so will it be that His actions will be more wondrous than that which He promised - 'our soul knows this well.'

Likewise it says: “In your mouth and in your heart to perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:14). What is “I established a covenant with you and with Israel”? Had you not accepted My Torah, I would have restored the world to emptiness and disorder, as it is stated: “If not for My covenant day and night, [I would not have set the statutes of heaven and earth]” (Jeremiah 33:25). Why? Because it was with the Torah that I created heaven and earth, as it is stated: “The Lord founded the earth with wisdom” (Proverbs 3:19), “with His knowledge the depths were breached” (Proverbs 3:20). If you void the covenant, you cause Me to restore the upper and lower worlds to emptiness and disorder. Therefore, “as according to these matters.”"

Another matter, “for [this] mitzva…it is not in the heavens” – Moses said to them: ‘So you will not say: Another Moses will stand and bring us another Torah from Heaven, I am already informing you: “It is not in the heavens,” as nothing of it remained in Heaven.’  Another matter, Rabbi Ḥanina said: It and all the tools of its craft were given; its humility, its righteousness, its uprightness, and the giving of its reward.  Another matter, what is “it is not in the heavens”? Shmuel said: The Torah cannot be found among the astrologers, whose craft is in the heavens. They said to Shmuel: ‘But you are an astrologer and a Torah giant.’ He said to them: ‘I would look into astrology only when I was unoccupied in Torah. When? It is when I would enter the bathhouse.’ (One is not allowed to study Torah in the bathhouse.)  “And it is not across the sea, to say: Who will cross for us to the other side of the sea and take it for us, and communicate it to us that we will perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:13).  “Rather the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” (Deuteronomy 30:14).  Another matter, “it is not in the heavens” – they said: ‘Our master, Moses, you are saying: “It is not in the heavens” and “it is not across the sea.” Where is it?’ He said to them: ‘It is is a place that is near: “in your mouth and in your heart to perform it.” It is not distant from you, it is near to you.’  Another matter, “in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” – the Rabbis said: Solomon said seven matters regarding the idler, but what Moses said was greater than all of them. How so? They said to the idler: ‘Your teacher is in the city, go and learn Torah from him.’ He answers them and says to them: ‘I am afraid of the lion on the way.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The idler says: There is a lion on the way” (Proverbs 26:13). They said to him: ‘Your teacher is in the neighborhood, get up and go to him.’ He says to them: ‘I am afraid that there might be a lion outside,’ as it is stated: “A lion in the streets” (Proverbs 26:13). They said to him: ‘He is residing next to your house.’ He said to them: ‘But the lion is outside,’ as it is stated: “The idler says: There is a lion in the street” (Proverbs 22:13). They said to him: ‘Inside the house.’ He said to them: ‘But if I go and find the door [of his room] locked, I will need to come back.’ They said to him: ‘It is open.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The door turns on its hinges, and the idler is on his bed” (Proverbs 26:14). Ultimately, he did not know what to answer. He said to them: ‘Whether the door is open or locked, I wish to sleep a bit longer.’ From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “How long will you lie down, idler? [When will you arise from your sleep?]” (Proverbs 6:9). He awakened from his sleep in the morning, they placed before him to eat. He was too lazy to put it in his mouth. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “The idler inserts his hand into the dish; he is too weary to return it to his mouth” (Proverbs 26:15). Which is the seventh? “From the winter, the idler will not plow; he will ask at harvest, and there is nothing” (Proverbs 20:4). What is, “from the winter, the idler will not plow”? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: This is one who does not study Torah in his youth and seeks to study in his old age, but is unable to do so. That is, “he will ask at harvest, and there is nothing.” But what Moses said was greater than all of them. From where is it derived? “Rather, the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart to perform it” – take the matter out of your mouth."
30,14,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Vayeilech 2:1","These words: This is what the verse stated, ""Have I not written you thirds with counsels (moatsot) and knowledge"" (Proverbs 22:20). The numerical equivalent of counsels is six hundred and six. [That,] and the seven commandments that the Sons of Noach were commanded, is six hundred and thirteen. And so [too,] does it state (Isaiah 5:1), ""my beloved had a vineyard in a fertile corner"": ""A vineyard"" - that is Israel, as it is stated (Isaiah 27:2), ""a vineyard of wine, sing to it."" ""And he separated it"" (Isaiah 5:2) - with Avraham, that he cast away the residue from him, such as Yishmael. ""And he cleared it of stones"" - with Yitschak, that he took Esav away from him. ""And he planted it with choice vines"" - that is Yaakov, as all of the plantings that came out from him were good and desirable, like this choice vine which is completely good. And this is [the meaning of] ""all of it was true seed"" (Jeremiah 2:21). Choice vine (sorek) has a numerical equivalent of six hundred and six, [together with] the seven commandments of the Children of Noach - behold, that is six hundred and thirteen. It is written (Proverbs 3:19), ""The Lord established the earth with wisdom"" - and there is no wisdom besides Torah. And what is its name? Confidant (Amon), as it is written (Proverbs 8:30), ""And I was a confidant with Him."" And it was not called Torah until it was given at Sinai. The numerical equivalent of Torah comes to six hundred and eleven. And the two that are subtracted from six hundred and thirteen are the two that were given by the mouth of the Almighty. And this is what is stated by the verse, ""God spoke one, I heard two"" (Psalms 62:12). This is [the meaning of] ""Moshe commanded us the Torah"" (Deuteronomy 33:4) - Moshe commanded us [commandments] according to the numerical equivalent of Torah. And the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded us the [remaining] two, as I explained in Parshat Vayishma Yitro. And it is an inheritance for Yaakov, and not for the [other] nations of the world, as it is stated (Psalms 147:19), ""He tells His words to Yaakov, His statutes and His judgments to Israel, He did not do this with any nation."" And it is written about it, ""each day,"" as it is stated (Proverbs 8:30), ""And I was a confidant with Him and I was His delight each day."" And a day is not less than a thousand years, as it is stated (Psalms 90:4), ""As  a thousand years in Your eyes is like the day, yesterday."" Upon what was it written before it was given? If upon silver and gold, gold and silver had not been created. Rather it was written on the forearm of the Holy One, blessed be He. And so every man [should] understand and fathom with his mind and his intelligence to contemplate the Torah day and night - as it is written (Joshua 1:8), ""and you shall contemplate about it day and night"" - and good deeds. And it is as the Sages said: The world is half guilty and half meritorious - if one comes and commit sins such that the sins outweigh the merits, it comes out that the world becomes guilty through him; but if the transgressions are of equal weight to the merits and one comes and performs one commandment, the merits will outweigh the transgressions. Happy is he who brings merit to the world! And if he has not learned as is fitting him, let him do his actions with faithfulness. Elihayu, may his memory be blessed, said, ""I was once walking on the way and I found a man, and he was mocking me and taunting me. I said to him, 'What [can] you answer on the day of judgement, since you have not studied Torah.' He said, 'I have what to answer - it is [because of] the understanding and intelligence and heart that were not given to me from the Heavens.' I said to him, 'What is your craft?' He said to me, 'I am a trapper of birds and fish.' I said to him, 'Who gave you knowledge and heart to take flax and spin it and weave it to make traps, and to catch fish and birds with them and to sell them?' He said to me, 'It is the understanding and the knowledge that were given to me from the Heavens.' I said to him, 'To take flax and to weave and spin and catch fish and birds you were given understanding and intelligence; but to acquire the Torah, they were not given to you? Behold, it is written (Deuteronomy 30:14), ""But the thing is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart to do it.""' [So] he immediately thought in his heart and raised his voice in crying. I said to him, 'My son, Let it not be bad to you, as all those that come to the world are rebuked once they come and are pulled away from Torah, as it is stated (Isaiah 19:9), ""And embarrassed will be the workers of flax, the combers and weavers of holes.""' And it is about him and those similar to him, and those that do like his deeds. And the last word is the fear of the Lord; and those that do it with faithfulness - his craft will be counted and he is fitting for life in the world to come.'"""
30,14,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Introduction of the Author 69","Thus it became clear to me that all the roots of deeds which one intends for His Name are founded on purity of heart and mind and singleness of mind.

Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes; cease to do evil"" (Isaiah 1:16). And, ""but the matter is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it"" (Deut. 30:14), and ""give Me your heart, and let your eyes keep My ways"" (Prov. 23:26). And our wise men have said: ""if you give Me your eyes and heart, I know that you are Mine"" (Yerushalmi Berachos 1:5); and Scripture says ""you shall not wander after your hearts and after your eyes"" (Numbers 15:39), and ""with what shall I come before the L-ord and bow myself before G-d on high? Shall I come with Olah offerings?"" (Micha 6:6), and the answer given was ""He has told you, O man, what is good, and what the L-ord demands of you; but to do justice, to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your G-d"" (ibid 6:8); and ""but let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the L-ord doing kindness, justice, and righteousness"" (Jer. 9:23). The explanation is that a man who glories should glory in comprehending G-d's ways, recognizing His beneficence, reflecting on His creation, realizing His might and wisdom, as manifested in His works. All these verses which I have brought are proofs on the obligatory character of the commandments of the heart and the discipline of the soul. "
30,14,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, First Treatise on Unity, Introduction 11","And the purpose of all of this is to exhort on what He said previously: ""And these words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart"", which means that habitually having them on one's tongue always, brings to remembrance of the heart, and to never turn one's heart away from always remembering G-d, and this is similar to what King David, peace be unto him, said: ""I have set the L-ord always before me"" (Tehilim 16:8).

30,14,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Shemot 15:12:2","נחית בחסדך, “You guided in Your love, etc.” The Israelites had three merits to their credit which helped them become redeemed. 1) the merit of performing deeds of kindness to one another. 2) the merit of Torah; 3) the merit of the sacrificial offerings. The word בחסדך in our verse alludes to the deeds of loving kindness performed by one Israelite for another in return for which You G’d repaid them with kindness.” In Deut. 30,14 the Torah refers to all three of these merits when we read כי קרוב אליך הדבר מאד בפיך ובלבבך לעשותו, “for the matter is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart to observe it.” The word בפיך, “in your mouth,” refers to Torah; the word ובלבבך refers to sacrificial service of which G’d said (Deut. 11,13) “you shall serve Him with your whole heart;” the word לעשותו, “to do it,” refers to deeds of loving kindness."
30,14,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:14:1","בפיך ובלבבך לעשותו, “with your mouth and your heart to perform it.” The Torah mentions three things here; the mouth, the heart, and the performance. All the laws of the Torah are included therefore as belonging to one of these three categories. There are commandments which require to be fulfilled by use of the mouth; others can be fulfilled by means of the heart only; still others require “performance,” i.e. the involvement of other organs and parts of our bodies. This is what may have prompted our sages in Avot 1,20 to state that “the world stands on three things, on Torah, on service to the Lord, and on the performance of deeds of loving kindness.” When the sages said: “on the Torah,” they meant on our engaging our mouth in the service of the Lord; when they said: “on service to the Lord,” they meant that our hearts had to be involved in fulfilling the commandments. Commandments which require the participation of our heart rank higher than those which can be discharged by means of only our mouths. This is the reason that when someone who is engaged in studying Torah (using his mouth to serve the Lord) must interrupt his studies when it is time to perform a commandment requiring our heart, i.e. the reading of the first line of the Kriyat Shema. (compare Shabbat 11) According to Rabbi Yehudah haNassi (Berachot 13) it is only the first verse in that paragraph which requires the kind of concentration that one must interrupt regular Torah study in order to perform it properly.  Mitzvah-performance which necessitates the mouth is ranked higher than the performance of commandments which involve other parts of our body such as offering sacrifices. (Tanchuma Tzav 14) This is based on Leviticus 7,31 seeing it does not say זאת התורה , עולה וגו' but זאת התורה לעולה, למנחה, וגו', “i.e. that there are viable or even superior alternatives to the offering of sacrificial animals. Ed.] This is the reason the word ובלבבך has been written in the middle of the three categories, to emphasize its centrality, the fact that it is the most important of the three. This is why performance, i.e. with the limbs and organs of the body, has been written only at the end of the verse.  Nachmanides, at the end of verse 11 writes as follows: the words בפיך ובלבבך refer to the subject of penitence, repentance, a commandment spelled out in verse 2 of our chapter. When the Torah speaks of this repentance it draws attention to the fact that it is not so difficult to fulfill this commandment. The Torah does not demand all sorts of difficult tasks such as ascending to heaven or crossing the ocean for a person to have fulfilled this commandment. All it takes to become a true penitent is the mouth and the heart. It may be performed anywhere; you do not even have to come to Jerusalem and the Temple to have your repentance accepted by the Lord. It is the easiest thing to do, i.e. כי קרוב אליך הדבר מאד לעשותו, “the matter is right at hand for you to carry out.” All you need is to employ your mouth and your heart."
30,14,Halakhah,"Mishneh Torah, Repentance 7:5","All the prophets commanded [the people] to repent. Israel will only be redeemed through Teshuvah. The Torah has already promised that, ultimately, Israel will repent towards the end of her exile and, immediately, she will be redeemed as [Deuteronomy 30:1-3] states: ”There shall come a time when [you will experience] all these things... and you will return to God, your Lord.... God, your Lord, will bring back your [captivity].”"
30,14,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Eighth Treatise on Examining the Soul 3:164","Through this, it is proper for you, my brother, to understand that the primary intended purpose in the mitzvot which involve the body and the limbs, is to arouse our attention on the mitzvot of the heart and mind, because they are the pillars of the service and they are the roots (and foundations) of the torah, as written: ""You shall fear the L-ord, your G-d, worship Him, and cleave to Him.."" (Devarim 10:20), and ""Rather,[this] thing is very close to you; in your mouth and in your heart to do it"" (Devarim 30:14), and ""And now, O Israel, what does the L-ord, your G-d, ask of you? Only to fear the L-ord, your G-d, to walk in all His ways and to love Him, and to worship the L-ord, your G-d, with all your heart and with all your soul"" (Devarim 10:12)."
30,14,Musar,"Shemirat HaLashon, Book II 25:2","Until now we have spoken about setting to rights the faculty of speech, the first fundamental, the demarcation between ""man"" and ""animal,"" for which reason Scripture gives it precedence, viz. (Devarim 30:19): ""For the thing is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart [i.e., your thoughts] to do it."" And now we shall speak a little about the faculty of thought, which resides in a man's heart, viz.: ""and in your heart to do it."" Scripture writes (Psalms 24:3-4): ""Who shall ascend the mountain of the L-rd, etc.? …The clean of hands [i.e., one who is clean of theft] and the pure of heart."" We learn from this that a man's thoughts must be pure and not intermixed with vanity. We say every day: ""Make our hearts one, to love and to fear Your name, and let us not be ashamed, forever."" This means what it says. It is known that what resides in a Jew's heart always, is faith in the L-rd, the G-d of the heavens and His Torah, this being the essence of holiness [as intimated in Bamidbar 35:39: ""I am the L-rd who dwells in the midst of the children of Israel.""] For this reason we ask the Blessed L-rd that He make our hearts one, to love and to fear His name, and that there not be intermixed in this another love. For if in his heart, the locus of thought, there also is planted a love for the vanities of the world, in the end, he will be shamed and mortified by it forever. For it is known that all of a man's affairs — both his acts and his thoughts, all will ascend above, before the L-rd, as we say in the Rosh Hashanah prayer: ""For the remembrance of every creation comes before You, the acts of a man, etc., the thoughts of a man and his stratagems."" And all will be set forth before the man, as it is written (Psalms 54:21): ""I shall reprove you and I shall set it before your eyes,"" and the man will be greatly shamed."
30,14,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 30:14:1","The Torah was presented to you in written and oral form. Rashi is answering the question: Even when the Torah is in front of us it is difficult to understand because of the depth of the subject matter and the shortcoming of the one studying it! Regarding this he explains, The Torah was presented (to you) in written and oral form, and therefore the understanding of the written Torah is very plausible [if one studies it] in conjunction with the Oral Torah.

30,14,Musar,"Kad HaKemach, Passover 1:5","... And on this the Torah says (Exodus 13:7) ""there will not be seen and there will not be found"" - it will not be seen b'maaseh (in action) and will not be found b'machshava (in thought), rather one should anul it in his heart. The mitzvot have 3 categories: mitzvot of speech, of the heart and of action, as it is written (Deuteronomy 30:14) ""in your mouth and in your heart to do it"". Comes the Torah (instructing us) to anul it in the heart, corresponding to the mitzvot which are dependent on the heart. Comes the 'kabbalah' (instructing us) to eradicate it from the house or to burn it, corresponding to the mitzvot of action. And to say 'kol chamira', corresponding to mitzvot of speech. In this way the 3 categories of mitzvot are fulfilled through the prohibition of chametz, teaching you that the prohibition of chametz incorporates all the mitzvot... Just as the 'kabbalah' comes (instructing us) to eradicate chametz and (livdok) to check the house in nooks and in cracks, so too we are obligated to search and check the chambers of our inner being for bad (machshavas) intentions and bad (hirhurim) thoughts. Just as bedikat chametz (checking for chametz) is not valid by sunlight, nor by moonlight, nor by the light of a torch, but only by the light of a candle, so too the bedikah (checking) of the yetzer hara must be by the light of the neshama (soul) which is called 'ner' (candle), this is what is written (Proverbs 20:27) ""the candle of Hashem is the soul of man, which searches the chambers of one's inner being."
30,14,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Introduction 27","We read in Deut. 30, 11-14: ""Surely, this Instruction which I enjoin you this day is not too baffling for you, nor is it beyond reach. It is not in the heavens that you should say 'who among us can go up to the heavens and get it for us and impart it to us that we may observe it?' Neither is it beyond the sea that you should say 'who among us can cross to the other side of the sea and get it for us and impart it to us, that we may observe it?' No, the thing is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart to observe it.' The verses above reveal all that I have written concerning observance as well as vicarious observance of the Torah laws, i.e. that everyone is obligated to fulfill all the 613 commandments. When there are some מצות that he is unable to fulfill in practice, there are ways in which he can acquire the merit of having practiced them."
30,14,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Ki Teitzei, Torah Ohr 67","It is well known that in order to rehabilitate oneself spiritually one must exercise תשובה, תפלה וצדקה, repentance, prayer and the performance of charitable deeds. All of these three factors of man's rehabilitation depend on his mouth. Prayer and the reciting of G–d's praises are, of course, functions of the mouth. We know that repentance has to include verbalizing one's confession and one's resolution not to sin again. The Torah in 30,14 mentions that Torah is easy of access, i.e. בפיך ובלבבך לעשות. Rabbi Yitzchak says (Eruvin 54) that the Torah is easy to fulfill, לעשות, once one has repented both by mouth and in one's heart. Confession of one's sins with a broken heart is the principal ingredient of repentance. Charity, too, involves the mouth. Our sages (Baba Batra 9b) say that anyone who gives charity acquires six blessings; if someone also tries to make the recipient feel better by kind and encouraging words he will qualify for eleven blessings. Interestingly enough we have three words which symbolize three aspects of repentance, i.e. צום, קול, ממון, each one of which has a numerical value of 136. This suggests that all three aspects of תשובה are of equal importance. Stated differently, תשובה, צדקה, and תפלה equal קול. The very first part of our פרשה alludes to all the three ingredients of repentance. The Torah speaks about going to war, the plain meaning of which refers, of course, to actual warfare and battles with the enemy. Over and beyond this, however, the paragraph refers to the ongoing battle between man and his evil urge. Many of our commentators are at pains to point this out in their commentary on the relevant section in פרשת שופטים when they comment on the verse discussing the siege laid to a city (20,19). In actual fact, the war with his evil urge is the greatest battle man has to fight in this life. The matter is illustrated in the Talmud by the story of the elderly sage who met soldiers of the army of Alexander the Great at the time of his victorious return from a major battle. These soldiers were in a very exuberant frame of mind. The sage, while he congratulated them on their victory, pointed out that the victory they had won was minor, and that they had to get ready for the battle of their lives against the evil urge. This is what the sages meant when they described the whole paragraph of the יפת תואר as an illustration of man's ongoing battle against his baser instincts (Kidushin 21). By extending this allegory a little further we may come to understand the whole reason why a מלחמת רשות, a war which is expansionary, is allowed: We are always permitted to conduct aggressive action against our evil urges. We can be sure of G–d's ongoing support in that undertaking once we make the first move in the struggle against the evil urge. Our sages point out that we would be unable to subdue the יצר הרע without G–d's active assistance, but that we have G–d's promise: ונתנו בידו, ""He will deliver him (the evil urge) into your hand"" (21,10). It is significant that the Torah here employs the singular whereas in פרשת שופטים it speaks in the plural (20,2—20,3--20,4). This may be a reminder that the fight against the evil urge can only be fought on a person-to-person basis. We have a tradition that a nation neither succumbs to another nation nor to the Jewish people unless its protective spirit in the Celestial Regions had first suffered defeat. We have pointed out examples of this such as Israel observing ""Egypt"" instead of ""Egyptians"" ""dead on the beaches of the sea"" (Exodus 14,30). We learn from all this that our enemy (the evil urge), assumes many guises, i.e. attacks us in the plural, and this is why the Torah always describes our enemy in the plural (אויביכם, אל תערצו מפניהם). We have to battle all these manifold ""enemies"" because each transgression we commit creates a negative force in the world which comes back to haunt us. All of these negative forces created by our very selves are presided over and directed against us by Samael/Satan/Angel of Death, etc. The Torah describes victory over this multifaceted but essentially single force with the words: ונתנו ה' אלוקיך בידך ושבית שביו, ""The Lord your G–d will deliver him into your hand and you will take him captive."" Taking this enemy prisoner is possible only with the help of Torah study and מצוה observance. David describes this victory over the evil works in Psalms 68,19: He speaks about: עלית למרום שבית שבי, ""You went up to the heights, having taken captives."""
30,14,Quoting Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Exodus; Perush HaArokh 31:18:1,"AND HE GAVE. Empty heads ask, “What did Moses do on the mount for forty days and forty nights?” They do not know that if Moses spent this number and double its double in years with God, he would barely know one part of a thousand of God’s work and ways and the secret of all the precepts which God commanded him. They think that deeds are most important. (They (the empty heads) think that the mere observance of the commandments is the most important element in Judaism.)  This is not so. What is important is heart together with deed. (One must understand the reason for the commandments. According to I.E. this takes a vast amount of time. It should be noted that I.E. wrote a work called Sefer Yesod Morah Ve-Sod Torah (Treatise on the Foundation of Awe and the Secret of the Torah) on the commandments.)  Heart and tongue train a person [to observe the commandments]. (Some commandments are observed by speech. The purpose of these commandments is to train a person to observe all of God’s commandments. Here too mere verbal utterance is insufficient. One must know and understand what one is saying.)  We thus read, in thy mouth, (This refers to commandments that are observed by speech. Praying and reciting the shema are examples.)  and in thy heart, (This indicates that one must understand what one is observing.)  that thou mayest do it (This refers to the commandments that are observed by actions.)  (Deut. 30:14). Our ancients said, “God desires the heart.” (San. 6b.)  Loving God and cleaving to the Lord with all of one’s soul is the basis of the commandments. This cannot be completely accomplished if a person does not know the ways of the Lord and is not acquainted with God’s work in the upper and lower worlds. The prophet thus states, But let him that glorieth glory in this, That he understandeth and knoweth Me (Jer. 9:23). It will then become clear to a person that God exercises mercy, Justice, and righteous, in the earth (Ibid.). (Maimonides makes the same point in the Guide of the Perplexed.)  A person cannot know God if he does not know his own spirit, soul, and body. For of what use is a person’s wisdom to him if he does not know the makeup of his soul? Now Moses, who prophesied in the desert for forty years and was party to many secrets which God revealed to him on Mount Sinai, said before his death, O Lord God, Thou hast begun to show Thy servant Thy greatness (Deut. 3:24). Thus it was only then that Moses began to understand God’s greatness and that the Lord’s greatness was shown to him. This is truth, (Either Deut. 3:24 is not to be taken as hyperbole, or what I.E. has just said is true.)  for His greatness is unsearchable (Ps. 145:3)."
30,14,Jewish Thought,Yesod Mora VeSod HaTorah 7:2,"Now, behold, all the mitzvot can be categorized into three ways: firstly, through belief in the heart; secondly, through speech; and thirdly, through action. Each mitzvah is fundamentally based on one of these aspects. If a mitzvah is dependent on speech or action, it still requires belief in the heart. Without it, everything is in vain and futile. Our Sages of blessed memory said: ""The Merciful One desires the heart"" (Sanhedrin 106b), indicating that God examines the heart and investigates the kidneys. As it is written: ""But the word is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it"" (Deuteronomy 30:14). This verse encompasses the three ways: ""in your mouth"" refers to speech, and ""in your heart"" refers to belief in the heart, so that you may fulfill the commandments through action. Similarly, it is written: ""What does the Lord your God ask of you but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to love Him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul"" (Deuteronomy 10:12). King David said: ""He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood"" (Psalms 24:4). And it is also written: ""He who walks uprightly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart"" (Psalms 15:2-3)."
30,14,Chasidut,"Likutei Moharan, Part II 7:6:4","This is the meaning of “For it is something exceedingly close to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to do it” (Deuteronomy 30:14)."
30,14,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part III 10:22","It appears that this is what is stated in Shemos Rabbah, parasha 47: “[We infer from the phrase] ‘For by the mouth of these words’ (Ex. 34:27. It is usually translated as “for according to these words.”)  that you should toil in the Torah using your mouth. This [is similar] to what is stated, ‘It is in your mouth and heart to perform it.’” (Deut. 30:14. It may also be translated as “It is with your mouth and heart to perform.” The verse in full reads: “For the word is exceedingly close to you. It is in your mouth and heart to perform.”)  It is unclear how “by the mouth” implies that one should toil in the Torah. It therefore appears to be similar to what we have just explained, and is referring to studying only with others, when a person toils in order to [defend] and explain his logic. For the explanation of the phrase “‘For by the mouth of these words” is similar to [what is expressed in] the verse in Proverbs, “And adds learning to his lips,” (Prov. 16:23.)  for it is with his discussion with others that one increases the strength of analysis and thereby brings the halachah to light. The [above-mentioned] midrash brings a proof from the phrase “It is in your mouth and heart to perform it,” for the main theme of that verse pertains to the laws contained in the Oral Law that have not been received, and [their conception] requires us to analyze [the received Oral Law] deeply and [bring them to light] by inferring one matter from another. [Therefore, the verse should be translated as follows: “It is in your mouth and heart to produce it.”] This is what Scripture states: “It is not in the heavens, [so that you cannot say, ‘Who shall go up for us to the heavens and take it for us, and let us hear it that we may produce it].’” This is stated in Tractate Eruvin 54a (This gemara is explained further in the addendum in the next paragraph.)  and see [how this gemara is explained] at length in [Ha’amek She’elah], She’iltah 19. (This reference will be described in footnote 45.) "
30,14,Quoting Commentary,"Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part III 10:25","Therefore, the correct interpretation [of la’asoso”] is [“to create it,”] which refers to the deep [analysis] of the halachah that is incumbent upon you to infer, [even though] it is distant from you. As explained in the above-mentioned reference, (The verses in Deut. 30:11–14 are elaborated further in Eruvin 54b–55a: “R. Eliezer said: [The verse] ‘You shall call understanding modah [a relative]’ [Prov. 7:14] teaches one to make signs for the Torah. Rava said: ‘[This teaches one] to set moadim [times] for Torah study.’ And this is what was stated by Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa, What is the meaning of what Scripture states: ‘It is not in the heavens… nor is it across the sea’? [The words], ‘It is not in the heavens’] implies that if it were in the heavens, you would be required to go up in pursuit of it; and if it were across the sea, you would have to cross the sea in pursuit of it.” The She’iltos explains that Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa is saying that if a Talmud scholar has a teacher who lives overseas, he is required to travel overseas in order to study from him. The Netziv writes that the She’iltos understands that we infer from the verse in Proverbs that since one achieves understanding mainly by studying daily with a rabbi, it is important to set times for Torah study – that is, to organize classes. Since the Talmud connects the inference from Proverbs to Deuteronomy, the She’iltos understands Avdimi bar Homa bar Dosa to be stating that Deuteronomy is exhorting one to study from his rabbi even if it means that he must travel to his rabbi who lives overseas. The Netziv explains that the verses in Deuteronomy state further that if “it is in the heavens” – if the Torah seems to be too holy and difficult to grasp – we must discuss it aloud with others and apply deep analysis. As stated in Proverbs according to R. Eliezer: “Make signs for the Torah” – in other words, devise and pursue whatever strategy is necessary to understand and grasp the Torah.)  you may think that it is in the heavens or overseas. In other words, it may appear to you [to be impossible] to produce laws from deep analysis [by yourselves], and thus it is as if [these laws] were in the heavens. Or [you may think] that you will have to travel overseas [to find] a rabbi who has already learned these laws. Therefore, Scripture states that this is not so. Rather, it is within the ability of your mouth and heart to produce these matters of halachah. The interpretation of la’asos is similar to the way we previously explained [in chapter 8], “good understanding to all oseihem (who perform them),’ (Psalms 111:10.)  where [oseihem should be translated as “make them”], i.e., to produce the halachah. (Therefore, the verse is to be translated as, “It is with your mouth and your heart to produce it.”)  Thus, one can explain that the words “and your heart” is tied to “and your mouth”; the speech [of Torah study] should be with the toil of the flesh, influencing the heart [understanding], and this is how one brings the halachah to light. This is the interpretation of the Midrash which infers [from: “For by the mouth of these words’ (Ex. 34:27. Usually translated as, “for according to these words.”) ] that one must toil [in the Torah with one’s mouth]."

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,14,Chasidut,Mevo HaShearim 5:9,"Even the Kabbalistic matters which these sages discuss is in fact entirely focused on avodah, primarily the simple form of avodah. Through such holy avodah, the holy soul within an Israelite becomes aflame. This is the vitality and passion he experiences in avodah, as well as the pleasure of Eden which is borne out of avodah performed in this world (Beit Aharon, in the anthology of sayings from R. Shlomo of Karlin). Yet, an Israelite should not pray for such passion, for his focus should be on the avodah itself. Let one enter into such states through prayer and avodah, and the passion will emerge on its own (see ibid, comments on Pentecost). As it says, “For the matter is very close to you, in your mouth and heart, to do it-” (Deuteronomy 30:14.)  first it is in your mouth, and then your heart; one should not wait for the heart’s arousal. Rather, if one finds that he can only pray with his mouth, then he should begin with that, and through such prayer his heart will awaken and become aroused. Even if he feels no vitality, but rather feels like an ox with a yoke or a donkey with a saddle, let him experience pleasure from this as well, and through this he will come to feel the ‘taste’ of avodah (ibid, Shabbat Shuvah (The ‘Sabbath of Repentance,’ i.e. the Sabbath preceding the Day of Atonement.) ). This path’s instruction to come to awakening through simple avodah extends to the beginning of one’s avodah, that is, turning away from negative traits, which also must be done through proactive avodah."

Or “wholly fruits.” In this digression induced by a favourite text, Deut. 30:14, and the favourite interpretation of mouth, heart, hands by words, thoughts, actions, we have something more akin to the Philo of the Commentary than we find anywhere else in this treatise. The meaning is that while in the natural garden the fruit only comes in the final stage, in the spiritual life all is fruit. As a matter of fact ὁλοκαρπώματα occurs only three times in our text of the Pentateuch and then only as a variant for ὁλοκαυτώματα. But the form ὁλοκάρπωσις is more frequent, occurring three times in Gen. 22 in the story of the sacrifice of Isaac, and also in Gen. 8:20, where Noah took of every clean beast and every clean fowl and offered them for a ὁλοκάρπωσις. On this passage, where perhaps he read ὁλοκάρπωμα for ὁλοκάρπωσις, Philo has a special meditation in Quaest. in Gen. ii. 52. The point of this is that the pure beasts are “sapientis sensus” and the pure fowls “intellectus cum cogitationibus in mente agitatis” and that they must be offered as “integer fructus.” The thought is perhaps much the same as in the stanzas of Rabbi Ben Ezra beginning “Not on the vulgar mass.”"

It does not need to be sought far away in an ashram in India, or in a private ecstasy of the soul. No faith has worshipped a more transcendental God, but no faith has brought God so close. The Shekhina, the Divine Presence, lives in the very texture of everyday acts and relationships if we train ourselves to hear their music and open our eyes to their radiance. It is there in the beauty of the Jewish home, the resonance of our rituals, the drama and sweep of Jewish history, the sheer persistence of our people, and the determination of generation after generation of Jews to live their faith and hand it on to their children when they might so easily have done otherwise. And it began on Pesaḥ, when a much-afflicted people began its long journey across space and time in response to a divine call."

30,14,Quoting Commentary,"Chizkuni, Genesis 6:5:1","כי רבה רעת האדם, “for man’s wickedness had become very great;” it is futile to ask that seeing that G-d has foreknowledge of all that man will do, creating him had been an exercise in futility to start with; why had G-d bothered? The answer is that everything is under the control of heaven except man’s decision to live in awe of the Creator or to defy Him. Seeing that G-d had decided to create a creature equipped with free will, He had simultaneously abrogated His right to interfere as long as man’s use of his freedom did not threaten to undo His universe. The reader is reminded of Deuteronomy 10,12, where Moses tells the people that G-d “asks” the people to revere Him; he did not say that G-d had “commanded” the people to revere Him. He also quoted G-d as expressing the wish that the people could maintain their moral high, as expressed after the revelation at Mount Sinai. In other words, He Himself had restricted His freedom in matters of religious belief of His creature. (Deuteronomy 5,26) “May they always be of such mind, to revere Me, etc.”A third verse spelling out the choice before all of us is found in Deut.30,14: “see I have given before you this day, life and goodness, or death and evil.”"

This means that he can achieve whatever he is capable of achieving since the means to do so have been placed at his disposal to use at his discretion. Once man begins to travel the path towards what his natural talents enable him to achieve, he can count on the active assistance of His Maker to facilitate his progress along that route.

This is what Moses meant when he said (Deut.30,11-14), ""This commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you....in fact it is quite close to you."" If one applies oneself properly to the truth of G-d’s revealed word, i.e the Torah, then appreciating it becomes a simple matter. From that point onwards there are no real impediments or difficulties in achieving one's aim. In this respect, the fortitude of Abraham surpassed that of anyone before him, since during the preceding generations people had become progressively more corrupt until they endangered the survival of their species. Even the few whose conduct at the time of their respective deaths merited a suspended sentence had failed to look toward heaven for inspiration to recognise their Creator. They were content merely not to question the tradition that G-d had indeed created the universe. Noach was such a person. His righteousness was tamim, whole, meaning he continued to believe what Lemech his father had believed and what both his father and his grandfather Methuselah had taught him. He made no intellectual effort to understand the basis for this belief or to develop it so that it would influence his personality development. ""IN HIS GENERATIONS,"" i.e. through successive generations his righteousness remained static, did not become dynamic. His heart was pure, but his intellect was not involved. In Deut. 18,14, we are told, ""Be whole with the Lord your G-d,"" that we are to accept the truths taught by our prophets. This means in particular that the request of the Jewish people at Mount Sinai to have Moses talk to them and be the intermediary between G-d and them would result in a perfect and enduring faith. The belief resulting from the experience of revelation is called emunah of a temimut quality. There are two ways of acquiring this absolute faith. The easy way is study of the Torah, a method granted to the Jewish people. The other way is via intellectual analysis, the only method available to man prior to the revelation at Mount Sinai. This method does not only require the determination of the truth seeker, but active help from G-d Himself. Those who in their search for understanding of this truth also employ all their intellectual faculties, arrive at a far deeper and lasting understanding. This is why David told his son Solomon, ""Now my son Solomon, know the G-d of your father, and serve Him with a whole heart, a willing soul"" (Chronicles I 28,9). Abraham's tremendous achievement was that though he did not have the tradition of a Noach since both his father and grandfather had been pagans (Joshua 24,2), he began to develop this faith through an intellectual approach. At first, he concentrated on demonstrating the complete bankruptcy of the belief held by his contemporaries. Afterwards, having travelled as far as it is possible to travel by means of one's intellect alone, with the help of G-d’s Personal Providence, he arrived at that level of faith in his Creator which the Torah describes as ""He believed in the Lord, and the Latter gave him credit for this"" (Genesis 15,6). Later, at the time of his cirumcision, Abraham would be asked, ""Walk in front of Me,"" to demonstrate a degree of faith that surpasses what his intellect can comprehend. In this way, he would outclass Noach who had only ""walked with G-d,"" his faith only keeping step with his intellectual faculties, never exceeding them. "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 25:2:5,"Midrash Rabbah Deuteronomy 25, describes seven kinds of indolence, laziness. The worst of the seven categories described is called that ""of Moses."" The meaning is that nothing is worse than failure to study the Torah, seeing that it is written concerning Torah, ""for she is close to your heart and mouth to do"" (Deut 30,14). If the Torah were in heaven or otherwise difficult of access, excuses for not studying it might be acceptable. But the very accessibility of Torah is such that it is practically being spoonfed to us and yet we are too lazy to swallow it. "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 60:1:3,"In defining the relative merit of ""good,” it can be said that the greatest ""good"" is that which confers the greatest number of benefits on the greatest number of people, without at the same time restricting the rights of the individual. Sunlight and warmth which embraces all people in equal measure, is a greater ""good"" than candlelight for instance. The latter provides light for only a limited number of people, the candle is not available for everyone, but has to be paid for by someone. Compared to the bounty of government, whose wealth and ability is very limited when measured against the wealth of the Almighty, only G'd has the ability to provide for everyone from an inexhaustible reservoir. ""The Lord is good to All” (Psalms 145,9) This point is made by king Saul in Samuel I 22,7-8. He says that even if David had the best of intentions, he could not possibly grant everyone what they desire. Also, since the universe is constructed in a manner which makes each of its constituent parts indispensable to the proper functioning of the whole, the whole cannot merely be a multiplicity of components which each perform the identical function, and therefore are all of the same rank. To view the fact that some creatures appear more distinguished than others as proof of injustice, or to view the fact that parts of the body seem more precious than others, as proof of discrimination, is foolish. To arrive at the conclusion that these distinctions are the result of accident or lack of ability on the part of the Creator, is equally erroneous. ""And His mercy extends to all His creatures,"" (Psalms 145,9) Each part in creation is equipped to perform its allotted task in the grand scheme of the Creator. In spite of all the foregoing, G'd has bestowed special loving care on His people Israel. The yovel year legislation etc prevents permanent loss of a family's inheritance, i.e. landed wealth. Jews must not be given menial tasks to perform. He who sells himself, is punishable; the Torah takes a dim view of such action. In short, Torah legislation is aimed at preserving the lofty status of the Jewish nation at the time when that nation accepted Torah as its national constitution. Vayikra Rabbah 13, mentions that the food and drink legislation also aims at the purification of man, just as Torah legislation as such, aims at purifying and refining man by limiting his indiscrimate indulgence in pleasurable activities meant only to gratify his body. Yalkut Shimoni Bereshit 31, points out that ""he who wants to live, will die; he who is prepared to die, will live."" Whatever man denies himself in this world, will ensure his life in the eternal world. The more he indulges himself in this life, however, the more likely is he to forfeit his share of eternal life. The aggadah in Baba Batra 74, portraying G'd as castrating the male leviathan, and killing the female, salting away its flesh for consumption by the righteous in the world to come, may express a similar idea. The separate creation of the males and females may symbolise the defusion of the physical and the spiritual. If the most powerful union of body and spirit in this universe, (Leviathan) would be allowed to roam completely unfettered, they could destroy the entire civilisation, G'd forbid. If human intelligence were to be used exclusively to advance his materialistic aspirations, the results could be disastrous. Alternately, if the body would be used exclusively to advance the interests of the spirit, this would also be contrary to G'ds plan for His universe. Therefore, G'd insured the survival of both as separate entities. As such, both are able to make their respective contributions to G'ds overall design for the world, without being able to completely upset such design. Pursuing the same subject matter, Pessachim 119, relates a strange story. In the world of the future, G'd will prepare a meal for the righteous. After having eaten and drunk, the cup is offered to Abraham to lead the other guests in reciting grace. Abraham declines the honour, saying that since he had sired Ishmael, he did not think he deserved this honour. Using similar reasoning, also Isaac declines, seeing he had fathered Esau. Jacob too declines, citing the fact that he had married two sisters while they were both alive. (something that would be forbidden once the Torah had been revealed) Moses declines the honour, saying that he had not been found fit to enter the holy land. Joshua declines, saying that he had not been found worthy to have a son. When the cup was offered to David, he accepted. He proclaimed ""I shall raise the cup of salvation and call out in the name of the Lord."" What we learn from here is that self control is valued so highly, that David was considered worthy to recite grace more than his illustrious ancestors including prophets. He alone of all those present, had possessed an active yetzer hara, sensual urges. Even though he might have sinned, compared to the many temptations he had been exposed to throughout his life, his sins were insignificant. All the others present must be viewed as tzaddikim gemurim, saintly by nature. (compare our commentary on chapter 41) Esther, who had been the only one among all the contestants for Ahasverus' favour, who had not availed herself of every means to enhance her physical charms, was rewarded by becoming queen. This was precisely because she did not make demands on life. External circumstances play an important part in shaping one's character. ""The air of the land of Israel, makes wise."" (Baba Balra 158 ) Exposure to certain climates advances one's ability to absorb knowledge. Inhabitants of parts of the globe subject to extremes of heat or cold, reflect this in their general behaviour. Since the land of Israel was considered as possessing a superior climate, being called eretz hatzvee, the choicest of countries, its climate can bestow benefits on its inhabitants. Rabbi Tanchum in Vayikra Rabba 13, says that a doctor who had two patients only one of whom he diagnosed as capable of making a recovery, imposed a rigorous diet on the patient he thought had a chance to recover. He did not place any restrictions on the other patient. Similarly, Israel and the gentiles. Israel, which has its after life at stake, must ensure that its food habits are such that that this after life is not jeopardised. The gentiles, who have not qualified for such after life, do not need to impose any restrictions on their food intake, therefore. On no account is the legislation of forbidden foods to be seen in the context of contributing to or detracting from physical well being, bodily health. Chapter fourteen in Deuteronomy begins by listing the otherness of the Jewish people. ""You are children to the Lord your G'd; do not make incisions on your body when mourning the dead, neither make bald spots, because you are a holy nation...Do not eat anything which is an abomination."" With this preamble, the Torah introduces the legislation about forbidden foods. If this legislation had hygiene, sanitary considerations, as its objective, it would reduce Torah to being a medical textbook, and a very abbreviated one at that. This thought is intolerable, if only for the fact that many of the health hazards in certain foods could be neutralized by the use of spices and other preservatives. Since we observe many nations who do eat foods that we consider abominations, enjoy good health, it is clear that the legislation is not aimed at our physical health, but rather at our mental health. Such foods as are listed as forbidden, might drive out the holy spirit that dwells within each Jew. David asks the Lord in Psalm 51,13, ""do not take away Your holy spirit from me!"" Since our sages suggest that the names of certain forbidden animals symbolise characteristics of different nations, and since many of these nations did not exist at the time the legislation was formulated, it is clear that they felt that consuming certain foods would eventually leave its mark on the character of such people. Examples are gamal for the Babylonians; arnevet for the Creeks; shafan for the Medes. The fact that these names seem repeated unaccountably in scripture, gave rise to these interpretations. Since G'd had said to Moses concerning achievements of our individual goals in life ""it lies within your mouth and within your heart to accomplish,"" (Deut 30,11-14) it is no more than reasonable to include our food intake in that advice, i.e. ""within your mouth."" "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 65:1:12,"When perusing our Parshah, we are confronted with a number of difficulties. 1) In order to convince someone to work on perfecting himself, one would expect the demands to be made on such a person to increase gradually, not to shock the student by listing all the demands that are made upon him all at once. That this is sound psychology, is attested to by the Torah itself, where we read (Deuteronomy 30, 11-14)) ""for this commandment which I command you this day is not too hard for you, neither is it far away; it is not in Heaven so that you could say ""who shall go up to the Heavens for us and bring it to us? For it is very close at hand, in your mouth and in your heart to perform."" On the other hand, what can frighten someone off more than a command such as ""be holy for I am holy?"" 2) Why do the commandments in our Parshah that parallel the ten commandments appear in a different order? (""Honour your parents,"" is listed as the first instead of the fifth commandment; ""keep the Sabbath,"" is listed as number two instead of as number four. ""Do not worship idols,"" is listed in third position instead of in second place) 3) After the Torah has completed the list, and concluded by saying ""sanctify yourselves,"" (20,7) why begin once more with such commandments as ""not to curse parents, not to commit adultery etc?"" 4) Why is the matter of attaining holiness mentioned three times? "
30,14,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 62:1:13,"The sacrifices that the metzora has to offer upon being cured, consist of birds. Their incessant chirping comes to an end only when they die. This procedure is symbolic of the person who needs to atone for having abused the gift of speech. The reason that two birds have to be offered is because speech is basically welcome only for two purposes: a) to study and teach Torah, b) to earn one's livelihood. Also the commandment to use an earthen vessel has symbolic meaning. The letters (chet-resh-shin) are the same as in the word for ""deaf/mute,"" i.e. ""silent."" The need for spring water contrasts with the silent, the deaf. The bubbling of the water is the opposite, conceptually speaking, of the inert clay vessel. "

30,19,Jewish Thought,Eight Chapters 8:5,"In reality, the undoubted truth of the matter is that man has full sway over all his actions. If he wishes to do a thing, he does it; if he does not wish to do it, he need not, without any external compulsion controlling him. Therefore, God very properly commanded man, saying, ""See I have set before thee this day life and the good, death and evil .... therefore choose thou life"", (Deut. XXX, 15. 19. Cf. H. Teshubah, V, 3.)  giving us, as regards these, freedom of choice. Consequently, punishment is inflicted upon those who disobey, and reward granted to the obedient, as it is said, ""If thou wilt hearken"", and ""If thou wilt not hearken"". (Deut. XI, 27. 28.)  Learning and teaching are also necessary, according to the commands, ""Ye shall teach them to your children"", (Ibid., XI, 19.)

30,15,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Exodus 19:7:1,"AND MOSES CAME AND CALLED FOR THE ELDERS OF THE PEOPLE, AND SET BEFORE THEM ALL THESE WORDS. This means that he said to them: “Behold, I have presented before you the words [of G-d]. Choose you this day (Joshua 24:15.)  if you will do so.” Therefore, they answered him, All that the Eternal hath spoken we will do. (Verse 8.)  This is similar in meaning to the verse: See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil, (Deuteronomy 30:15.)  and also: And these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them, (Further, 21:1.)  meaning that they are to say if they choose to observe them and accept [them] upon themselves. It is for this reason that it says there, And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Eternal, and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the Eternal hath spoken will we do. (Ibid., 24:3.)  Similarly, And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel (Deuteronomy 4:44.)  means that Moses asked the generation that was to come into the Land whether they would accept the Torah upon themselves, for he was about to make a covenant with them in the plains of Moab, just as he had done with their fathers in Horeb. (Ibid., 28:69.)  And the Gaon Rav Saadia (Mentioned here in Ibn Ezra. On Rav Saadia Gaon, see Seder Va’eira, Note 229.)  said that the expression, and he set before them, is similar in meaning to the expression, put it in their mouth, (Deuteronomy 31:19.)  [this being a reference to the Oral Law, which is the commentary to the Written Law]. But the correct interpretation is only as I have explained. And all the people answered together. (Verse 8.)  This also means that Moses called together the elders of the people, who are their wise men and their judges, for theirs is [the power of] choice. And he set before them all these words in the presence of the whole congregation, since it was with reference to all the people that G-d had commanded, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel. (Above, Verse 3.)  But they did not wait for the counsel and decision [of the elders, but readily], all the people answered together — both small and great (II Kings 23:2.)  — and said, All that the Eternal hath spoken will we do. (Verse 8.)  And so it says again, and all the people answered with one voice, and said: All the words which the Eternal hath spoken will we do. (Further, 24:3.) "
30,15,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Genesis 2:17:2,"מות תמות, mortality will be decreed for you as something occurring far sooner than would have been the case otherwise. Our sages (Bereshit Rabbah 19,8) explain that the word ביום does not refer to a day of our lives, i.e. a period of 24 hours, but refers to a “day” in G’d’s calendar, i.e. 1000 years in terms of our lives. Man was henceforth not to reach the age of 1000 years. Adam, who had been slated to live for 1000 years, actually lived only 930 years, having bequeathed the other 70 years to his descendants. They base this on Psalms 90,10 ימי שנותנו בהם שבעים שנה, “the number of years of our lives is 70.” [according to Rabbi David Luriah the words לבניו in this Midrash refer specifically to David. Ed.] According to the above we must conclude that the sages of the Midrash consider death per se as a curse, based on Deuteronomy 30,15 כי הרע הוא המות והטוב הוא החיים, “for life is good and death is evil.”  As to “knowledge of good and evil,” there are a number of explanations of these words. (Ibn Ezra) It may refer to the intimacy experienced between man and his wife when engaging in marital intercourse. The fruit of that tree created the mating instinct in man. The word טוב refers to copulation that is permitted and the word רע would refer to copulation which is forbidden. Adam was full of knowledge, and it is preposterous to assume that he had no concept of what is good and what is evil before he ate from that tree. However, he had lacked the biological urge to engage in marital intercourse. This is proved by the fact that after both he and his wife had eaten from the tree of knowledge they are quoted as saying that “their eyes were opened and they realised that they were naked,” in the sense that they lacked something which they had not been aware of needing. (Genesis 3,7). The meaning of the words והייתם כאלוקים, (3,5) is “you will be like the angels.” The common denominator between Adam and the angels at that stage was that both the angels and man had no inkling of the mating instinct. It is true that merely by observing the animals’ behaviour they realised that the males and females engaged in such activities, however they had no understanding of how such a process of creating progeny applied to themselves.  Alternatively, we may understand the serpent as not having the slightest idea of what the concepts טוב ורע, “good and evil” represented. Even though Chavah is not quoted in the text of having used these words, it is quite impossible to assume that the entire dialogue between the serpent and Chavah has been recorded here. Unless there had been some discussion between them before the words recorded in the text, whence did the serpent know that G’d had forbidden the fruit of the trees, as it had claimed to know? She must have learned such details from the words of the woman. Furthermore, the very opening remark of the serpent, אף, suggests that this is a continuation of the preceding parts of the dialogue which the Torah did not consider worth reporting. Nowhere else is the word אף used as the opening remark in a dialogue. (Ibn Ezra)

30,15,Quoting Commentary,Radak on Genesis 4:7:5,"ואתה תמשול בו, he will have control over you only if you do not actively remove him (it) from your presence. If you want to, you can control it, govern it, resulting in your humbling it before you. By saying these words G’d demonstrated to Kayin the immense power inherent in his possessing free choice. Moses repeated this thought at the end of his life when in his parting speech he said to the Jewish people (Deut. 30,15) ראה נתתי לפניך היום את החיים ואת הטוב ואת המות ואת הרע. “See here, I have placed before you this day life, and the good, or death and the evil.” Moses added the admonition: ”choose the life!”

30,15,Jewish Thought,"Guide for the Perplexed, Part 1 42:4","The term ḥai has also been employed in reference to the acquisition of wisdom.

Such instances are numerous. In accordance with this metaphor, true principles are called life, and corrupt principles death. Thus the Almighty says, “See, I have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil” (Deut. 30:15), showing that “life” and “good,” “death” and “evil,” are identical, and then He explains these terms. In the same way I understand His words, “That ye may live” (ib. 5:33), in accordance with the traditional interpretation of “That it may be well with thee” [scil. in the life to come] (ib. 22:7). In consequence of the frequent use of this figure in our language our Sages said, “The righteous even in death are called living, while the wicked even in life are called dead.” (Talm. B. Berakkoth, p. 78). Note this well."

And not by force will a man do the good or the bad, but rather from the will of his [own] heart. And God, may He be blessed, knows at the beginning that which will be his will - and even those things that are weighed out and it is possible that they will be and possible that they will not be. He knows everything at the beginning of the deed, and it is a wonder."
30,15,Musar,Sefer HaYashar 6:45,"I have already called to your attention that the evil inclination is constantly at war with the intellect, and therefore in every one of the affairs of man, if there should arise a war between the two of them, and you see a man going about his affairs in a righteous way, know that the intellect has conquered the evil inclination and subdued it. Therefore, it devolves upon us in every occupation to help the intellect in its war, for the intellect and the evil inclination are two mighty forces at war with each other. But because of the cruelty and the hardness of the evil inclination and because of the pleasantness of the intellect and the refinement of its nature, the evil inclination is mightier than the intellect. At times, they are equal in strength, and if a man helps one of them, he renders the opponent weak and easily driven out. Therefore, we must help the intellect, since both are equal in strength, and on this subject it is said (Deuteronomy 30:15), “See, I have set before thee life and good”— That is the intellect—“… and death and evil”—That is the evil inclination. Thus Scripture has informed us that the strength of one is like the strength of the other. Therefore, it commands us to help the intellect, as it is said (ibid., 30-19), “Therefore choose life.” That is why our Sages, of blessed memory, said (Berakhot 33b), “Everything is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven.” Because in the war between the intellect and the evil inclination their strength is equal. The Creator, blessed be He, has given man the power to be drawn after whichever side of the two he desires. But if a man finds favor in the eyes of the Creator, and he nevertheless wishes to be drawn after the evil inclination and help it, then restraints, obstacles, and troublesome things will occur, and the Creator will not let him help the evil inclination. The Creator will act thus to a man because of the pious deeds of his fathers, or because he sees in his heart that he is faithful, or because he discerns that in the end, this man will become a completely pious person, and will be among those who merit seeing the face of the Creator, and will be among those who are near to Him. Since the Creator recognizes what the future of this man will be, he desires that he should be pure and holy at the time that he repents of this evil conduct, and, therefore, we say in our prayer, “Cause us to return, O our Father to Thy Torah,” for in this way we pray that no adversary may chance to restrain us. As for those who do not find favor in the eyes of God by their intention to do good, the Creator allows them to go on in the stubbornness or hardness of their heart. On this subject, it is said (1 Kings 18:37), “For Thou didst turn their heart backward.” Therefore, when one of these should desire to repent of his wickedness and the Creator recognizes that he will not repent with a complete heart, things happen to him which restrain him and trouble him, as it is said (Isaiah 1:12), “When ye come to appear before Me, who hath required this at your hand to trample my courts?” This is the meaning of, “Thou didst turn their heart backward”: when the wicked desire to do away with transgression, nothing occurs to restrain them so that the wickedness which is in their heart should go forth into a deed, as it is said (Ezekiel 14:5), “… that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart.” Therefore, the prophet, of blessed memory, said (Isaiah 63:17), “O Lord, why dost Thou make us to err from Thy ways?” What he means is: “Do not cause us to err in our hearts, lest the happenings occur which will restrain us from serving thee.”"
30,15,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Pekudei 3:5","The Holy One, blessed be He, says to her: Know that on this night a person will be formed from the semen of a certain individual known to you. Guard this drop of semen, take it into the palm of your hand, and sow it on the threshing floor, in three hundred and sixty-five parts. And she would do so. She took it into her hand and brought it at once to Him who had said It hath been already (Eccles. 1:10) and said to Him: “I have done all that You have commanded. Here is the drop, what have You decreed concerning it?” The Holy One, blessed be He, forthwith decreed concerning the semen what its end would be, whether male or female, weak or strong, poor or rich, short or tall, ugly or handsome, heavy or thin, humble or haughty. He decreed concerning everything that would happen to it except whether it would be righteous or wicked. (Ketubbot 30a.)  That choice alone he left to the individual, as it is said: See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil (Deut. 30:15)."
30,15,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Third Treatise on Service of God 8:5","We find, however, in the book of the Torah a contrary view, namely, that a human being's visible acts are in his own power. He can choose then as he pleases. They are effected by his choice and free will and he is accordingly liable to reward or punishment for service and transgression respectively, as it is said, ""See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil"" (Deut. 30:15). "". . . therefore choose life"" (Deut. 30:19). ""Through your hands this has come"" (Malachi 1:9). ""For according to a man's act, He requites him"" (Job 34:11). ""A man's folly perverts his way"" (Prov. 19:3). Everything in our religious literature, whether it be instruction, precept or moral exhortation, demonstrates this view. And whatever is there set forth concerning reward for service, and punishment for transgression, indicates that a human being's acts are left to himself and that the Divine glory does not interfere in his prosperity or in his ill-fortune, in his righteous deeds or in his perversities. "
30,15,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 11:26:2","Solomon has made it a point in the Book of Proverbs to explain the value of all the good character traits in order that we learn how to avoid the negative virtues. One of the positive virtues is זריזות, diligence, and eagerness to carry out one’s duties. Laziness, by contrast, is a negative virtue, one to be avoided. In fact, laziness is at the root of many of the problems one experiences in one’s life. There are different kinds of laziness. Some people’s laziness becomes manifest in the manner in which they neglect their homes, other people’s laziness we can recognize by the way they neglect their bodies. A third form of laziness is the way one relates to the requirements of one’s soul; a fourth kind of laziness involves one’s attitude to Torah study and performance of the Torah’s commandments. An example of laziness or slovenliness in one’s house is failure to repair a leaky roof during the summer. Not only will immediate steps taken to make the repairs presumably save one greater expense the longer one waits, but one will save oneself discomfort when it starts to rain. Concerning people who put off the inevitable such as the need to repair their roof, Solomon says in Kohelet 10,18: “through slothfulness the ceiling sags, through lazy hands the house caves in.”  Concerning laziness, i.e. neglect of one’s body’s needs it is well to remember that if one attends to the need to assure oneself with a livelihood and is satisfied if one attains an average standard of living without trying to attain what one does not need, one is liable to achieve what one sets out to do. This is the secret of “enjoying one’s share.” If one neglects one’s basic needs relying on miracles to happen instead, one is liable to die from hunger. Concerning people who are too lazy to fend for themselves and prefer to wait for miracles, Solomon writes in Proverbs 13,4: “a lazy man craves but has nothing; the diligent shall feast on rich fare.”  There are people whose laziness is manifest in the neglect of the requirements of their soul. Such people, though aware of shortcomings in their character, make no effort to correct these shortcomings. They forget that the soul has much in common with the earth; some earth is easy to work and it does not take too much time to make things grow from such earth. Other parts of the earth are by nature hard, difficult to work; nonetheless the farmer must not abandon it in despair; he must invest extra time and will find that eventually even such earth will yield its produce. Concerning such “earth,” i.e. soul, Solomon says in Proverbs 18,9: “one who is slack in his work is a brother to a vandal.”. Some people (their souls) respond to minimal encouragement and discipline. Others require a great deal more. However, if the latter person makes an effort to respond to rebukes, teachings and exhortations he will find that eventually he will rehabilitate himself completely so that positive characteristics will become second nature for him. Concerning such a person (before rehabilitation) Solomon says in Proverbs 24,30: “I passed by the field of a lazy man, by the vineyard of a man lacking sense; it was all overgrown with thorns, its surface was covered with weeds.” In this simile Solomon compared greed and lust to a field seeing it is a derivative of raw material [I believe that by “raw material” the author means something physical, not divine such as the soul. Ed.]. If one does not treat raw material in the manner it is intended to be treated and used and allows one’s urges free reign one will wind up destroying both one’s body and one’s soul. When Solomon goes on in verse 31 to describe that he saw a stone fence lying in ruins, this describes the result of what happens to people who neglect body and soul.  There are also people to whom the negative virtue of laziness can be applied as they neglect Torah study and the performance of good deeds. If someone is guilty of this in this world how will he attain eternal bliss in the world to come? This is the person whom Solomon had in mind in our opening verse, “he who does not plough in the winter will surely have nothing to show in summer.” Solomon’s definition of laziness is not just failure to do one’s duties, but failure to do the requisite duty on time. There are times which are meant for certain activities. If one wastes these times by not performing the requisite activities such as plowing in winter, such failure will backfire. Solomon uses the farmer as his model par excellence for describing the results of laziness. He compares our life on earth to “winter” and the hereafter to “summer,” the time for reaping what one has sown. The winter is perceived as under the relatively weak domain of the moon whereas the summer is under the far more powerful domain of the sun. Everyone knows that in a comparison between moon and sun as luminaries, the sun is primary whereas the moon is secondary. Compare what Solomon wrote in Song of Songs 2,11: “here the winter has passed, etc.” Our sages in Avodah Zarah 3 phrased it thus: “the present world is comparable to Sabbath eve whereas the world to come is comparable to the Sabbath itself.” They therefore ask: what is he going to eat on the Sabbath who has not toiled on the Sabbath eve?”  Amongst other things the sages explained to us by means of their simile that whereas the present world is one of מעשה, deeds, the world to come is one of מנוחה, “rest and compensation.” It is not a world in which activities which are meant to store for the future are performed. Searching for work in the world to come is a non-starter, אין, one will find nothing (if one had not amassed it previously).   Why does Solomon write: מחורף when speaking about the winter, instead of בחורף, as he does when speaking about בקציר, “at harvest time?” The word מחורף must be understood as מפחד החורף, “because of the fear of winter.” It is typical of lazy people to look for any excuse (including weather) to justify their putting off essential tasks which they ought to perform. An example of this is found in Proverbs 26,13: “the lazy man says: ‘there is a lion on the path, a fierce lion in the streets.” He excuses his failure to sow in winter by his fear of the inhospitable climate at that time. The reason that Solomon harps so many times on the subject of laziness is in order to thoroughly delegitimize such laziness in the eyes of people. He wants people to shun this negative virtue and to copy the ways of the ant instead. This is why he writes in connection with the ant: “go to the ant, you lazybones; study its ways and wise up!” (Proverbs 6,6) He means that although the ant is a most insignificant appearing little creature, even brainy man can learn a lesson from such a creature when he observes how the ant stores up food to be consumed at a time when it will not be found lying around ready to pick up. Not only this; the ant has sense enough not to collect its food immediately it has been made wet by the rain but it waits until the wind has dried it so that when it is stored it does not rot. When Solomon adds in 6,7 “which though having no ruler, captain, or overseer,” he means that the ant has no intelligence of its own which dictates its behaviour but is simply prompted by its instincts. It follows that creatures equipped with intelligence would do well to consider the ant as their model. The three words: קצין, שוטר, מושל, “captain, overseer, and ruler,” which Solomon says the ants do not have, correspond to three aspects of human intelligence, שכל, known as חכמה, תבונה, דעת, “wisdom, insight, knowledge.” All of these three attributes are only found in man. They are basically sub-categories of the same attribute. This is why Solomon uses three terms each of which represents different degrees of authority, in describing them.  By acquiring and nurturing the attribute of זריזות, diligence, man can assure for himself eternal life, whereas by indulging his laziness he is sure to forfeit such eternal life. The former characteristic prompts him to fulfill G’d’s commandments whereas the latter keeps him from doing so. After all, man has been given free choice and our salvation or otherwise lies in our own hands. We are to make the choice between good and evil and only by making the right choice do we qualify for the eventual reward promised by the Lord.. ראה אנכי נותן לפניכם היום ברכה וקללה, “See, I place before you this day blessing and curse.” The reason Moses commences with the singular ראה, followed by the plural form לפניכם is that he addresses everybody, both the individual and the community (Ibn Ezra), and because blessings and curses respectively are influenced and channeled from two different attributes Justice and Mercy, both of which were active in creating the universe and both of which are capable of being appreciated only by a select few individuals. When addressing these select few, Moses says ראה, a reference to “seeing” with one’s mental eye. The word corresponds to Kohelet 1,16 ולבי ראה הרבה חכמה ודעת, “I have seen (acquired) great wisdom and knowledge.”  Seeing that the promise of a blessing and the threat of a curse are an important factor in encouraging observance of the commandments of the Torah by the people at large, Moses used the plural form when addressing the nation, i.e. לפניכם. We find that the Torah used this combination of singular and plural also in Deut. 4,5: ראה למדתי אתכם חקים ומשפטים, “See I have taught you statutes and social laws.” The singular form ראה was addressed to the individuals who have some appreciation of the statutes, whereas the plural form was used when speaking of the social laws whose merit can be appreciated by the whole nation. The word אתכם in the plural emphasizes that the entire Torah, all of its commandments were given to the masses, not to select individuals.  Our verse here makes plain that the right to choose has been given to man. If he wants to conduct himself in a manner acceptable to G’d he is free to do so; if he chooses to contravene G’d’s commandments he cannot be coerced by G’d. We have already referred to this in connection with Deut. 5,26: “who would give, etc.” We pointed out there that If G’d had not granted freedom of choice, He would not have to “wish” for the people to remain on a spiritual high but could legislate it. The whole premise of this freedom of choice is understood easily by the fact that G’d bothers again and again to command us what to do and what not to do. If we were not free to chart our own course, it would not make sense for G’d to have to give us all these commandments. All He would have to do is to program us according to His wishes. Seeing the principle of man’s freedom to choose is so fundamental, the Torah mentions it already at the beginning such as in Genesis 3,27 where G’d explains the need to expel Adam from Gan Eden by referring to his freedom to help himself to the fruit of the tree of life so that “he would live forever.” Had G’d been able to physically prevent Adam from reaching for the tree He would not have to had to place the tree out of reach for him. In the verse just quoted, G’d makes plain that as a result of having eaten from the tree of knowledge both good and evil have become viable options for man. The words הן האדם in Genesis 3,27 are G’d’s way of saying that man as a species is unique in the universe in that he possesses this freedom of choice. There is no other species like man in either heaven or on earth. The celestial beings have all been programmed by G’d to do His bidding with a minimum of delay and opposition. The reason that man is basically different is that he is the only species composed of both matter and spirit. The celestial beings are totally disembodied, whereas all other creatures on earth are earth-bound, equipped with a minimal “spiritual” equipment, one that merely strives to keep its body physically alive, i.e. the נפש of an animal.  At the end of the Torah too the theme of man’s freedom of choice is dealt with once more when Moses says: “see I place before you this day life and goodness or death and evil.” (Deut. 30,15.) Our verse here basically reflects a similar message. Concerning this whole subject of what G’d is able to do and how He has voluntarily limited His options, Maimonides in chapter 5,4 of Hilchot Teshuvah has this to say: “Do not be amazed that we read in Psalms 135 6: “G’d does all He wants to do in heaven or on earth, in the oceans and in the deep.” There is no question that everything He does, He does as a result of His will. This is so in spite of the fact that what we do is subject to our own volition. How do we illustrate that this apparent contradiction is in fact no contradiction at all? Just as G’d wants that fire and wind rise upwards whereas water and earth are programmed through the forces of gravity to always strive downwards [the four basic raw materials the universe is made of], and the planets orbit in space around the globe, so all other phenomena in the universe behave in accordance with the way G’d has programmed them. Man’s freedom of choice is part of G’d’s expressed desire, i.e. this is part of how He decreed in His own free will that the universe should function. As a result of this system man is judged in accordance with his deeds. If he chooses the right way he will be rewarded, if not he will be punished. This is what the prophet meant when he said in Isaiah 50,11: מידי היתה זאת לכם, “Do you think this was decreed for you by ME?” The same theme occurs in Isaiah 66,3 גם המה בחרו בדרכיהם, “they have also chosen their own paths” Concerning the above Solomon said in Kohelet 11,9: “Rejoice young man in your childhood let your heart cheer you in your youth; but remember that for all these things G’d will call you to account.” Solomon warns that though it is within your power to do what you fancy and to lead a life of frivolity, remember that the day of accounting is not far off. Thus far the comment of Maimonides in Hilchot Teshuvah."

Our verse here basically reflects a similar message. Concerning this whole subject of what G’d is able to do and how He has voluntarily limited His options."
30,15,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 29:18:3","Should someone ask: “how can the Torah decree penalties for thoughts which have never been carried out? How can the Torah expect a person to be so perfect that the temptation and intention to commit a sin never occurs to him?” Let me explain the essence of the subject. We know that man is in charge (has the choice) of the actions he carries out. This is what the Torah alluded to in Deut. 30, 15-19: “see I have today given into your hand (control) over life and goodness, over death and evil;......you shall choose life.“ Just as man can control his actions, he can also control his thoughts. True, the latter require some preparation, education. We are commanded to entertain constructive thoughts and to avoid thinking potentially destructive, sinful thoughts. G’d gives credit for our entertaining positive constructive thoughts, whereas He punishes us for thinking sinful thoughts.  If, on occasion, one does entertain unworthy thoughts, thoughts which creep up on a person uninvited, such thoughts reflect the fact that the individual in question has not trained himself sufficiently not to entertain unworthy, potentially sinful thoughts. The only cure for this is to concentrate on G’d and what He expects us to do and how He expects us to relate to His universe and our environment. One must relate to such unworthy thoughts with anger at oneself for such thoughts to have occurred to one at all. If one does so, one may rely on the saying of our sages that הבא לטהר מסיין אותו, “when a person makes a genuine effort to purify (himself or others) he receives a divine assist.” (Yuma 38) There are numerous verses in the Bible testifying to the principle that there are divine assists for people trying to do the right thing. One such verse is found In Chronicles I 28,9: ”for the Lord searches all minds and discerns the design of every thought, if you seek Him, He will be available to you.” Another verse in a similar vein is found in Proverbs 21,2: ”G’d probes the (content) of one’s hearts.” Solomon means that when man entertains positive thoughts, G’d will help translate them into reality. Other verses from Scripture which convey similar messages are found in Psalms 10,17, as well as in Chronicles I 29,18."
30,15,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 32:39:1","ראו עתה כי אני אני הוא, “see now, that I, I am He.” The word אני, as well as the words אתה or הוא, describe a presence, an existence of the subject. They are both nouns [as opposed to pronouns. Ed.] just as in Sukkah 48: אני והו הושיעה נא. I have already explained that verse in Exodus 15,2 when discussing the words זה א-לי ואנוהו.  Moses is at the point where he sums up what he has been saying in this song. The function of these nouns (names) here is to express love and foretell that those who have been scattered will once again be gathered in and united [describing Himself in the first person as well as in the third person is G’d’s way of hinting at the fact that what had been scattered can be fused together again. Ed.]   Subsequently, G’d continues with: “I kill, but I also revive.” This is an allusion to the resurrection which will follow the redemption after a relatively brief interval. He then continues, quoting the Lord, with: “I am the One Who lives forever.” (verse 40). This is an allusion to the world of the future which will follow the era of the life of the resurrected bodies. This is in accordance with the view expressed in Sanhedrin 90 that the dead who will be resurrected at the time of the resurrection will not die again. (See lengthy treatment of the subject on Deut. 30,15). These people will be transferred to a celestial region with body and soul intact, where they will continue a life which knows no death. Concerning this life, our sages always say that “people destined for it have been ‘invited’ to the world of the future.” This is the ultimate purpose of the whole system of reward and punishment, and concerning this experience even the prophet Isaiah 64,3 already said that it is beyond the powers of any prophet to describe, as none has been privileged to have been shown a vision of it. It is something reserved exclusively for G’d to show to the people so honored.  To give us an even stronger hint of the concealed nature of what life in that region will be like, the word לעלם, “forever,” has been spelled without the letter ו. Our sages compare this to the first vision of G’d Moses experienced in Exodus 3,15 where G’d also used this word when He said זה שמי לעלם, “this is My Name forever.” There too our sages point to he absence of the letter ו, i.e. at the concealed elements of such a future. Whereas up until now, Moses had been speaking, at this juncture, G’d resumes speaking. Hearing the promise of a redemption from G’d directly is more reassuring than hearing it through the words of an intermediary. It convinces the listeners that the ingathering will be orchestrated by G’d Himself, not through one of His agents. If and when this occurs, all the nations will sing the praises of His people (verse 43)."
30,15,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:15:1-5","ראה נתתי לפניך היום את החיים ואת הטוב, “see here, I have placed before you today life and the good.” This verse shows that man has been given the choice to do either good or evil; for, if he did not have a free will, how could the system of reward and punishment be relevant? The way we have to understand the verse is that if you do good you will reap life, if you do evil your “reward” will be death.  An alternative explanation of this verse: the words “life and the good, death and the evil,” are a reference to the Torah itself. Torah can be the elixir of life for the righteous; at the same time it could be the source of death for the wicked. Our verse would be similar in meaning to Ezekiel 20,25: “and I also have given to them statutes which are not good and social laws that they cannot live by.” [the words “to them” in the verse refer to the wicked, Sabbath-profaning Jews]. Being in exile due to their sins, and forbidden by their hosts in exile to keep the Torah, makes the continued violation of the Torah a source of the people’s death for non-observance, or for death by their masters for violating local laws and insisting on observing Torah law instead. The Jewish people’s failure to keep Torah while on their own land, ultimately places them in a no-win situation in the land to which they have been exiled. It is also possible to explain the words: “see I have given you life and the good,” to mean that this passage was written as a follow-up of the previous paragraph which dealt with the promise of redemption. Seeing that the time for the resurrection of the dead is understood to be close to that of the redemption i.e. 206 years later, it is appropriate that this verse commences with the word ראה which is an allusion to that time. In view of all this Solomon said in Song of Songs 8,12: האלף לך שלמה ומאתים לנוטרים את פריו, “I have my own vineyard; the thousand silver pieces are yours Shlomoh, and two hundred more to the ones who guarded its fruit.” [I translated the whole verse, using the conventional translation. Ed.] The word ומאתים is understood as if it had been written ו-מאתים, i.e. “plus 206,” the letter ו meaning the digit 6. Solomon would reveal in this verse that the time when the resurrection occurs is 206 years after the 1,000 years [the traditional interval after the first 6,000 years of our universe have been concluded and a period of complete metamorphosis of the universe has begun. Ed.] ]The arrival of Shlomoh, described as someone granted 1000 (years?) is a reference to the coming of the Messiah, also known as Shlomoh, which would occur at the end of the 6,000 years we have mentioned. (The source of this whole exegesis is Nachmanides כתבי הרמב'ן חלק ב עמוד תקטו, Mossad Harav Kook edition, commentary on Song of Songs, edited by Rabbi Chavell) The Messiah, of course, is a descendant of Solomon just as much as he is a descendant of David. The reason why the passage above (verse 14) concluded with the word לעשותו, the same word we find at the conclusion of the Torah’s report of the story of creation (Genesis, 2,3), is that the Torah wants to establish a conceptual linkage to the beginning of conventional time and to the end of conventional time, i.e. the arrival of the Messiah. The Torah wants you to know that from the point of view of natural laws, both points in time are no different from one another. The universe will continue to function normally, according to the rules G’d established at the time of creation also after the arrival of the Messiah. The Talmud in Shabbat 63 stated so explicitly, the wording being: אין בין העולם הזה לימות המשיח אלא שעבוד גליות, “the only difference between this present world and the epoch of the Messiah will be that Israel will no longer be subservient to other nations politically.” The addition of the letter ו at the end of the word לעשתו, instead of לעשות as in Genesis 2,3 is meant to symbolise the number 6, i.e. that the 6th millennium will be no different from the first millennium as far as the conventional laws of nature are concerned. The words ראה נתתי לך היום, are intended to convey that immediately after the 6,000 years the period of the Messiah will commence. During that life the people of Israel will experience all the good that it is possible to experience. The word החיים is synonymous with the life in the world to come, i.e. the life after death and resurrection concerning which we read in Psalms 31,20: “how abundant is the good that You have in store for those who fear You.” the word הרע refers to a category of sinner for whom resurrection will actually spell disaster. They are the ones referred to repeatedly in both Isaiah 66,24 and Daniel (Daniel 12,2) of whom the prophet and Daniel say: “many are those that sleep in the dust of the earth who will awake, some to eternal life, others to reproaches, to everlasting abhorrence.” The view of Maimonides, in his treatise about the resurrection, is that the people resurrected will lead normal lives, will eat and drink and produce children. These functions with which G’d has equipped them will certainly not cease. They will lead exceptionally long lives, after which they will die a physical death and continue a life of the spirit in what we are fond of terming עולם הבא, “the world to come, the hereafter.” This is what is always meant when the sages speak of someone who has been invited to the hereafter, i.e. עולם הבא. Concerning this world the sages wrote (Berachot 17): “in the hereafter there is no eating, no drinking, there are only disembodied spirits, etc.” If these people had been equipped with the organs enabling them to eat and drink and procreate, these organs would be redundant, and G’d does not create anything which does not fulfill its assigned purpose. If you were to query this by saying that Moses and Elijah went without eating and drinking for long periods although they did have a body equipped for eating and drinking, and that therefore what Moses and Elijah were able to do in this world, people could do in the world to come in spite of having bodies, this is not a viable argument. The normal bodily functions of Moses and Elijah were made redundant for a limited period and a specific purpose, so that they were never really redundant seeing they were in use both before and after the period when they were temporarily out of use. The people (souls) who are transferred to the עולם הבא will never have any use for the organs in question. Hence it would not make sense for G’d to equip them with such useless organs. This is why every intelligent person has to believe that in the region we call עולם הבא there are no bodies at all, only souls. This is the view of Maimonides which clearly emerges from his words. However, the sages of the Talmud are of a different opinion. (Nachmanides elaborates on this at the end of the treatise שער הגמול). The experts in Kabbalah believe that there will be no more death after the resurrection of the dead. They base this primarily on Isaiah 25,8 בלע המות לנצח, “He will destroy death forever.” They also refer to Sanhedrin 92 where the Talmud says that “the dead who will return to life will not again turn into dust.” Concerning the world (life) after death, the sages in Berachot 17 say that that a very precious statement made by Rav was that “in the world to come there will not be eating, drinking, no jealousy or competition, but the righteous will sit with their crowns on their heads and enjoy the brilliance emanated from the Shechinah.” This latter statement makes it obvious that the author does hold that there will be bodies in the world to come. This is why the fact that there will not be eating and drinking, etc., had to be mentioned, seeing that if there were not presumed to be bodies this would be obvious to all. Therefore, it is proper for us to believe that there will indeed be bodies in the עולם הבא but that many bodily functions as we know them will cease to operate, just as they ceased functioning for a period in the lives of Moses and Elijah. What all this means is simply that in that world the spiritual powers of the soul will triumph over the body and what are perceived in our world as its needs.  If you were to ask why the organs of the body which are not being used should exist, the fact is that they are not really redundant at all. On the contrary, these organs receive the reward for all the effort they put in while on earth in fulfilling G’d’s commandments. Seeing that G’d does not withhold reward from anyone entitled to it, or even shortchanges such a creature (compare Baba Kama 38), He does not want the body to be in a position to complain; therefore He transfers the body to the regions called עולם הבא to enable it to also enjoy these outpourings of the brilliance of the Shechinah. Support for this view comes from Psalms 17,15: ”when one day I awaken, I shall be satisfied with seeing a picture of You.” This means that the people in the world to come will experience satisfaction from beholding the brilliance of the Shechinah while their body is intact.” (Just as the disembodied soul functioned in this terrestrial life, there is no reason to believe that the body cannot function in the celestial life). This is the view of Nachmanides, and he cites proof from a Midrash in Sifri Nitzavim, according to which Moses (his body) was hidden in the regions of the עולם הבא. This does not mean that his body is there at this point in time and that he enjoys a physical existence there now. [The text refers to the body of Aaron, Ed.]  The sages made a similar comment about the manner of Rabbi Akiva’s death when they said: “hail to you Rabbi Akiva; your soul exited with the pronouncement of the word אחד (first line of Kriyat Shema), you are ready for immediate entry to life in the עולם הבא.” In Berachot 58 the Talmud, in dealing with benedictions to be recited when one witnesses different events, states that when seeing the tombs of the Jewish people one is to recite: “blessed be the One who let you die in accordance with true judgment and Who will bring you back to life in the world of the future.” Bereshit Rabbah understands the words: “G’d blessed the seventh day and sanctified it” (Genesis 2,3) to mean that G’d blessed the עולם הבא which commences with the seventh millennium. The words: “He sanctified it,” refer to the fact that He allotted it to the Jewish people. This is the meaning of the words מזומן לעולם הבא, “ready for entry into the world to come.”"
30,15,Musar,"Shemirat HaLashon, Book I, The Gate of Remembering 1:2","It is written (Psalms 34:13): ""Who is the man who wants life, who loves days to see good? Guard your tongue from evil."" The commentators have explained that ""who wants life"" refers to eternal life in the world to come, and ""who loves days to see good"" refers to this world, which is only ""days"" relative to eternal life. Now, on the face of it, this is cause for wonder. Why does Scripture single out this sin in particular for ""guarding against""? Has the Torah not prescribed for us 248 positive commandments and 365 negative commandments, about all of which the Blessed L-rd has told us (Devarim 30:15): ""See, I have set before you this day, the life and the good … which I command you this day, to love the L-rd your G-d, to walk in His ways, and to keep His mitzvoth, and His statutes, and His judgments, etc.""?"
30,15,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 30:15:1","If you act with goodness, then you have life, etc. Rashi is answering the question: The verse should have mentioned each thing and its opposite, life and death, and good and bad, as it does below (v. 19). Furthermore, See, I have placed before you, etc. implies that man's acts of goodness are in Hashem's hand, but this is not so because they say (Megilla 25a), Everything is in the hand of Heaven except for fear of Heaven. Therefore Rashi explains, “One hinges on the other — If you act, etc. meaning that if on your account do good, etc., I will give you life, but if on your own you do bad, I will give you death. Because it in your hands to choose of the good or of the bad, and you choose from whichever you want.
"
30,15,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Lamentations 3:38:1,"From the Almighty, etc. And if you attempt to say that this evil did not come to me from His hand, that it is coincidence that has befallen me; this is not so. For both bad occurrences and good occurrences, who has commanded and they came to pass, unless God ordained? And He commands neither bad nor good [to come]. But what should a living man bemoan? “A man for his sins.” Every man should bemoan his sins, because they are what bring the evil upon him. (“They did not emanate from the Almighty,” Rabbi Yochonon said, “From the day that the Holy One, Blessed Is He, said, ‘See, I have placed before you today the life and the good, etc.,’ (Devarim 30:15. )  neither evil nor good has come from His command.” Rather the evil comes by itself to the one who commits evil, and the good to the one who does good.) Therefore, what should one bemoan? Why should a man be angry, if not about his sins? "
30,15,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Ecclesiastes 1:13:1,"And I applied my heart to search. In the Torah, which is wisdom, and to ponder over it concerning all the evil deeds mentioned above, which are committed under the sun, and I pondered over it that it is a sore task that the Holy One, Blessed Is He, set before mankind. “The life and the good, and the death and the evil.” (Devarim 30:15.)  "
30,15,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Bereshit, Torah Ohr 47","The third premise is that G–d's Torah is essentially the Torah of אדם, instructing man to shun evil and to do good, teaching man the principle of reward and punishment. It is called ""man's teaching,"" תורת האדם, since man possesses free choice. We know this from Deut. 30,15: ""Behold! I set before you this day life and prosperity, death and adversity….. Choose life!"" We have discussed these concepts at length in the treatise תולדות האדם, section בית ישראל. "
30,15,Chasidut,"Me'or Einayim, Bo 2","And through this we can explain the commentators’ question mentioned above. For the essence of Choice is what was stated in the verse, See, I have set before you today life and good… therefore choose life (Deut. 30:15, 19). And how should a person choose good from evil, if not through Awareness? When a person has the Awareness to distinguish between good and evil, then he can choose good and despise evil. Now, in the Egyptian exile the Awareness was in exile, as we have stated, and then they did not have the full choice, with full awareness. For this is the essence of the Exodus from Egypt, that the Awareness should come out of exile and there can be Choice with Awareness – which is not the case in exile, when Awareness was with [Pharaoh] in Egypt. Then, even Choice could not be; in which case Choice was not taken from Pharaoh at all, since Choice [itself] did not yet exist, as we have explained. For it came into being afterward, in their Exodus from Egypt, when the Awareness came out of exile – then Choice had something on which to take effect, as we have stated."
30,15,Jewish Thought,Yesod Mora VeSod HaTorah 7:3,"Now, pay attention, for there is no difficulty in refraining from negative commandments for those who have understanding, as God has implanted in the intellect the ability for a person to guard against any harm. The analogy can be drawn to a doctor who advises a person who is unaware of the foods that can harm them based on their constitution: ""Do not eat anything that I warn you against, for if you eat them, you will fall ill and die."" A person of knowledge does not desire to eat something that would harm them; rather, they would find it repulsive and abhorrent, even though they may have heard that it is a delicious food. Instead, they prioritize the essential foods for sustaining life and do not seek after life merely through eating, for this is the way of animals who lack a soul that continues to exist after separation from the body. Is it not written in the Torah: ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures"" (Genesis 1:24)? Water brings forth living creatures, but this does not apply to humans alone. Rather, humans are made in the likeness of angels. If an angel lives forever, then one who is in their likeness should also be immortal. Therefore, one of the wise individuals stated that the punishment for transgressing negative commandments is executed through one of the four types of death imposed by the court, such as stoning or death by the hands of Heaven. However, the reward for fulfilling positive commandments is granted. Our sages brought a proof that there is a reward for refraining from negative commandments, as it is written: ""You shall not eat it, so that it will be good for you"" (Deuteronomy 13:19). And some say that the reward will return to the one mentioned at the end of the verse: ""For you shall do what is right"" (Deuteronomy 12:25). Others say that the verse ""You shall not eat it"" (Deuteronomy 12:16-17) refers to refraining from negative commandments. The verse above it (Deuteronomy 12:16-17), ""You shall pour it out on the ground like water, so that you will not eat it,"" means that one should not consume blood, for blood is the soul, and this is known from the wisdom of tradition. It is also true that the fear of God, which is a positive commandment, encompasses all positive and negative commandments, as Moses mentioned in another place (Deuteronomy 10) ""to fear the Lord your God, to keep all His commandments and statutes which I command you today for your good."" They include both positive and negative commandments, for one who refrains from transgressing out of fear of God, it is good for them. The phrase ""for your good"" encompasses the good of this world and the world to come, and the reward for fulfilling positive commandments, as they involve effort. The analogy is like someone who exhausts themselves under the guidance of a doctor to prepare a meal that will be beneficial for them to eat. In return, they receive their reward, and their action is presented before them. It is good for you to receive reward and escape punishment. The true goodness lies in a person who observes the commandments of the Divine Physician, as the physician neither benefits nor harms them, as Eliphaz said (Job 35:6): ""If you are righteous, what do you give Him? Or what does He receive from your hand? Your wickedness affects a man like yourself."" Now I will reveal to you a precious secret that we have found written: ""Why do you afflict yourselves, Lord, departing from Your ways?"" (Isaiah 33:17) and ""You are the one who troubled their hearts"" (1 Kings 18:37). And Moses said (Deuteronomy 30:15), ""See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and evil,"" and furthermore (Lamentations 3:38), ""Do not both good and ill proceed from the mouth of the Most High?"" And our sages said (Niddah 30b), ""Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for the fear of Heaven."" Know that the cultivated vegetation of the earth is superior to the uncultivated vegetation, and there are those that are fat and those that are lean. In a true analogy, I will explain that there are three forces in the living beings. If you wish, you can call them by three names: Neshamah (soul), Ruach (spirit), and Nefesh (life force). The Nefesh is the vegetative force that resides in the liver, and every living being and plant partake of this force. This Nefesh is the body's inclination and desire for food and sensual pleasures. The Ruach resides in the heart and is the source of a person's vitality. It encompasses both humans and animals, and it is also a physical force. When this Ruach departs, resembling the air leaving the body, the person dies, and this departing Ruach becomes intensified and becomes the source of anger. And the soul is the highest and its power is in the brain, and the characteristics of human beings and their inclinations vary. Some possess them in great strength, while others are weakened, and there are those who have them in a balanced measure. There is no need to elaborate, for the soul seeks what benefits it from the actions of God, for He is the source of its life. And the soul seeks the pleasures of the body for its own well-being. Now, the spirit is intermediate, and because there is a need for the brain to connect to the liver and the heart, both of them are connected to the brain. The general principle is that each aspect complements the other. Therefore, the Hebrews have referred to them as the soul, spirit, and life force. And all of them are interconnected with the body. If a person consumes foods that warm the blood, their anger will increase. And behold, the actions of the body are influenced by the spirit. If the body is in good condition, and another person angers them with their words or actions, the power of the spirit will intensify in the heart, generating heat in the body. Thus, the body undergoes changes due to the influence of the spirit. And every intelligent person should guide their body according to the needs of their soul, while the soul remains unchanged amidst the body's changes. This is the great elevation that God has granted to Israel, for if they observe the commandments of God, there is no need for physicians, with the help of God, as Asa did. Thus, the verse is captured, and there is no contradiction in the phrase (Exodus 21:19), ""And he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed,"" for it is not an easy matter, but rather, it is like (1 Kings 1:12) ""And he shall heal the altar of the Lord."" It is not like (Deuteronomy 32:39) ""I wound, and I heal,"" and in the case of Job (Job 5:18), ""He woundeth, and his hands make whole."" And thus, the army of heaven is divided by the Lord among all the nations. This is the interpretation of the verse (Isaiah 24): ""The Lord of hosts will reign over the host of the heights."" And this corresponds to the one who accepts the wisdom of astrology and relies on fate. But the name (of God) was given to Israel as an inheritance and to remove them from the dominion of the constellations, as long as they are under His dominion and fulfill what is commanded in His Torah. Therefore, the ancients said (Shabbat 129a): ""There is no mazal (constellation) for Israel."" And for this reason, it is written (Exodus 33:16), ""Then we shall be distinguished, I and Your people."" And one cannot argue how the laws of heaven can be changed. Here is the proof: The goodness in its entirety is intended for all good, and for a little evil, it is not in the path of wisdom to prevent what is mostly good. Therefore, there is power in the discerning individual to choose between good and evil, for decrees are made based on the recipient. Thus, it is written (Deuteronomy 15:4), ""Except that there shall be no needy among you,"" implying that everything or the majority is good. Similarly, it is written (Deuteronomy 15:4), ""Only if you carefully listen."" And the individual can benefit his soul in the future."
30,15,Midrash,Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 15:1,"THE TWO WAYS  RABBI ELIEZER said: I heard with my ear the Lord of hosts speaking. What did He speak? He said: ""See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil"" (Deut. 30:15). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Behold, these two ways have I given to Israel, one is good, the other is evil. The one which is good, is of life; and the one which is evil, is of death. The good way has two byways, one of righteousness and the other of love, and Elijah, be he remembered for good, is placed exactly between these two ways. When a man comes to enter (one of these ways), Elijah, be he remembered for good, cries aloud concerning him, saying, ""Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth truth may enter in"" (Isa. 26:2). And there cometh Samuel the prophet, and he places himself between these two byways. He says: On which of these (two byways) shall I go? If I go on the way of righteousness, then (the path) of || love is better than the former; if I go on the way of love, (the way) of righteousness is better: but I call heaven and earth to be my witnesses that I will not give up either of them."
30,15,Midrash,Eikhah Rabbah 3:13,"“Who is it who said and it occurred, if the Lord did not command it?” (Lamentations 3:37). “Who is it who said and it occurred, if the Lord did not command it?” – who did command? Haman commanded, but the Holy One blessed be He did not command. Haman commanded “to destroy, to kill, and to eliminate” (Esther 3:13). But the Holy One blessed be He did not command it, but rather, “the plot [that he devised]…return [upon his head]” (Esther 9:25). “Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that evil and good emerge?” (Lamentations 3:38). “Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that evil and good emerge?” – Rabbi Elazar said: From the moment that the Holy One blessed be He said: “See, I have placed before you today: life and good, and death and evil” (Deuteronomy 30:15), no good has emerged for a performer of evil nor evil for a performer of good, but rather good for a performer of good and evil for a performer of evil, just as it says: “The Lord will reward the performer of evil in accordance with his wickedness” (II Samuel 3:39). “Of what shall a living man complain, each man for his sins?” (Lamentations 3:39). “Of what shall a living man complain?” – it is sufficient for him that he is alive. Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One blessed be He said: Your life is in My hands, yet you complain? Rabbi Huna said: Let him stand like a mighty one, confess his sins, and not complain. Rabbi Berekhya said: Of what shall he complain about the One who gives life to the worlds? If he seeks to complain, it should be each man for his sins. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] says: Descendants of bearers of grievance; Adam, the first man, after all the good that I bestowed upon him, he expresses a grievance before Me and says: “The woman whom You gave to be with me, [she gave me from the tree, and I ate]” (Genesis 3:12). Jacob, too, did so. I am engaged in crowning his son king in Egypt, and he expresses a grievance before Me: “[Why do you say, Jacob…] my way is hidden from the Lord” (Isaiah 40:27). His children, too, I am engaged in providing them with easily digestible bread so that no one among them will be afflicted with indigestion or diarrhea, and they express a grievance before Me: “Our soul loathes this insubstantial bread” (Numbers 21:5). Zion, too, is similar: “Zion said: The Lord has forsaken Me and the Lord has forgotten Me” (Isaiah 49:14)."

But if your heart turns away and you give no heed, and are lured into the worship and service of other gods, I declare to you this day that you shall certainly perish; you shall not long endure on the soil that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. (Devarim 30:15-18) God wants us to choose life, as we read: I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day: I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life – if you and your offspring would live – by loving the Lord your God, heeding His commands, and holding fast to Him. For thereby you shall have life and shall long endure upon the soil that the Lord your God swore to your ancestors, Avraham, Yitzḥak, and Yaakov, to give to them. (Ibid. 19-20)"
30,19,Jewish Thought,"With God in Hell, 7 To Live or to Survive 21","Whereas Des Pres’ insights are born out by the nature and history of Western civilization, they have no meaning within the context of Judaism. Some of the key passages of the Torah affirm the ultimate value of life. For instance: “See I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil…I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed.” (Deuteronomy 30:15–19.)  Or, in another passage: “Ye, shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them…” (Leviticus 18:5.)  The rabbis in the Talmud interpret the last words to mean that one must live by God’s commandments, and not die because of them. (T.B. Sanhedrin 74a.) "
30,15,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on II Chronicles 21:20:1,"and he departed joyless The meaning is: all his life he was in distress and in illnesses, and with him was fulfilled (Deut. 30:15): “See, I have set before you today life, etc.” and (Job 14:1) “short of days and full of fear.”"
30,15,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Deuteronomy 11:29:1,"AND THOU SHALT PUT ‘ETH HABRACHAH’ UPON MOUNT GERIZIM. “This is to be understood as the Targum [Onkelos] rendered it: yath m’vorchaya — ‘the blessers’ [i.e., those who will pronounce the blessings]. Upon Mount Gerizim — toward Mount Gerizim.” (The Levites who were to pronounce the blessings (further, 28:14) were only to face Mount Gerizim, but not to be on the mountain.)  This is Rashi’s language, but it is not correct according to the plain meaning of Scripture, for he has not yet instructed concerning [the identity of] those who were to pronounce the blessing [which is only mentioned further on, in Chapter 27:11-14; hence the verse here could not refer to them with the definite article — habrachah which implies that their identity was already known]. Rather, the meaning of the verses is as follows: “I have set ‘before you’ a way [to attain] blessing and a way [to attain] curse. (Verse 26.)  And the expression before you signifies that you are to choose for yourselves what you desire, and I inform you that the blessing will be yours when you perform the commandments, and the curse if you do not fulfill them.” This is similar to what he further said. See, I have set before thee this day the life and the good, the death and the evil etc. (Further, 30:15.)  [This verse clearly does not pertain to the setting at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, thus disproving Rashi’s interpretation that the blessing refers to “those who will pronounce the blessings.”] Then he stated here [in the verse before us], that they were to bestow this blessing of which he speaks, upon them [i.e., the tribes] on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal, this [“bestowal”] being by word of mouth [rather than by some physical act of placing the blessers there, as Rashi rendered it]. In a similar way is the interpretation of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, on this verse, and he shall ‘put’ them upon the head of the goat (Leviticus 16:21. Here too, no physical object is placed on the head of the goat. “Putting” refers to the confession of sins. This coincides with the interpretation of Ramban that the “bestowal” does not refer to the blessers, but to the recitation of the blessing.)  [meaning that the High Priest, by confessing the sins of the people, “puts” them upon the head of the goat that was to be sent to Azazel]. Thus he is saying here by way of admonition that they are to “put” [or pronounce] the blessing on Mount Gerizim, blessing the people if they will hearken to the commandments of G-d; and the curse on Mount Ebal, saying, “Cursed be he that will not hearken to the commandments and will turn aside from the way which G-d has commanded.” Now it would have been possible [in accordance with the plain meaning of this verse] that all the tribes utter the blessing and all of them [utter] the curse, or that the Levites pronounce them all, or that one individual proclaim them all. Hence he later reverted to explain there, These shall stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people, (Further, 27:12.)  And these shall stand for the curse, (Ibid., Verse 13.)  and he further declared, And the Levites shall speak, (Ibid., Verse 14.)  and he explained the whole subject. (Ibid., Verses 15-26.)  For here, because of his admonition which he stated, Behold, I set before you etc., (Verse 26.)  he mentioned part of the commandment and then he reverted to explain it [fully] in its proper place. It is possible that Mount Gerizim is to the south which is “the right” [side of a person who turns eastward facing the sunrise, in which case his right hand is to the south], (See Vol. II, p. 467.)  and Mount Ebal is to the north, as it is said, Out of the north the evil shall break forth. (Jeremiah 1:14. It is important to note that Ramban’s conjecture [“It is possible that … “] is indeed correct, for Mount Gerizim is south of Shechem, while Mount Ebal is north of it (see Biblical Encyclopedias on these places).) "
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

So man was created with both, as it is written: ""See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil"" (Devarim 30:15). They asked him: why all this?

30,15,Jewish Thought,Eight Chapters 8:5,"In reality, the undoubted truth of the matter is that man has full sway over all his actions. If he wishes to do a thing, he does it; if he does not wish to do it, he need not, without any external compulsion controlling him. Therefore, God very properly commanded man, saying, ""See I have set before thee this day life and the good, death and evil .... therefore choose thou life"", (Deut. XXX, 15. 19. Cf. H. Teshubah, V, 3.)  giving us, as regards these, freedom of choice. Consequently, punishment is inflicted upon those who disobey, and reward granted to the obedient, as it is said, ""If thou wilt hearken"", and ""If thou wilt not hearken"". (Deut. XI, 27. 28.)  Learning and teaching are also necessary, according to the commands, ""Ye shall teach them to your children"", (Ibid., XI, 19.)  ""and ye shall do them and observe to do them"", (Ibid., V, 1.)  and, similarly, all the other passages referring to the study of the commandments. It is also necessary to take all the precautionary measures laid down in the Law, such as, ""Thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof; that thou bring not blood upon thy house"", (Ibid., XXII, 8.)  ""lest he die in the battle"", (Ibid XX, 5 or 7.)  ""wherein shall he sleep?"" (Ex. XXII, 26.)  , and ""no man shall take to pledge the nether or the upper millstone"", (Deut.

30,15,Second Temple,On the Unchangeableness of God 10:6,"[50] And therefore we have an oracle of this kind recorded in Deuteronomy. “Behold, I have set before thy face life and death, good and evil; choose life” (Deut. 30:15, 19). So then in this way He puts before us both truths; first that men have been made with a knowledge both of good and evil, its opposite; secondly, that it is their duty to choose the better rather than the worse, because they have, as it were, within them an incorruptible judge in the reasoning faculty, which will accept all that right reason suggests and reject the promptings of its opposite."
30,15,Second Temple,On Flight and Finding 11:3,"[58] Another oracle by which she verified her statement was this: “Behold, I have given before thy face life and death, good and evil” (Deut. 30:15). Accordingly, thou wisest of teachers, goodness and virtue is life, evil and wickedness is death. Again, elsewhere: “This is thy life and length of days, to love the Lord thy God” (Deut. 30:20). This is a most noble definition of deathless life, to be possessed by a love of God and a friendship for God with which flesh and body have no concern."
30,15,Chasidut,Tzava'at HaRivash 130:1,"Several times, in the Torah account of creation, it states, “It was good,” and concludes with, (Genesis 1:31)  “Behold, it was very good.” However, the book of Deuteronomy states, (Deuteronomy 30:15)  “See I have placed before you today life and good, and death and bad.” The question is, in the act of creation the Torah only mentions good. Where did the bad come from?"

Rather, it is in the covenant of circumcision-Brit-ברית that he sinned. (Talmud Bavli, Sanhedrin 38b, 44b; Tikkunei Zohar 112b)  Thus, this quality that avenges breaches of the covenant-Nokemet Nekam Brit-נוקמת נקם ברית,” exacts retribution from all those who transgress any of the sexual prohibitions written in the Torah, as we have yet to awaken you to, with the help of HaShem-יהו״ה, blessed is He."

30,15,Kabbalah,"Sha'arei Orah, Tenth Gate, First Sefirah 59","Included in these principles is the Sefirah of the moon-Levanah-לבנה (Kingship-Malcut). Whoever knows the secret that is hidden and sealed in the White Head-Rosh HaLavan-ראש הלבן, will contemplate the secret of the moon-Levanah-לבנה – beginning-Rosh-ראש and end-Sof-סוף. Now, the primordial snake-Nachash HaKadmonee, that is drawn from the power of Lavan-לבן the Aramean, instilled blemish in the moon-Levanah-לבנה, through Adam, the first man, who could not wait a mere hour for the prohibition of Orlah to pass. (Midrash Bereishit Rabba 21:7; Vayikra Rabba 25:2 and elsewhere. Had he waited one hour until Shabbat, the fruit of the tree would have been permitted to him.)  As a result, he ate from the tree while it still was mingled with good and evil, and did not wait until the evil took its portion in the place called the foreskin-Orlah-ערלה. The tree would then have been called good-Tov-טוב and not evil-Ra-רע, and he would have been permitted to eat from it to his heart’s content, and he would eat and live forever. This is the secret of the Tree of Life-Etz HaChayim-עץ החיים which adheres to the Tree of Knowledge-Etz HaDa’at-עץ הדעת, but is only good-Tov-טוב. The sign for this is the verse, (Deuteronomy 30:15)  “See – I have placed before you today life-Chayim-חיים and good-Tov-טוב and death-Mavet-מות and evil-Ra-רע.” The whole matter is clearly explained by the verse, (Proverbs 31:12)  “She bestows goodness-Tov-טוב upon him, never evil-Ra-רע, all the days of her life,” for this is certainly so. If only Adam, the first man, would have waited to cut of the foreskin-Orlah-ערלה, it would no longer be the Tree of the Knowledge of good and evil, but would only be good. However, when he ate of it, it still was mingled with good and evil."

But why must a prophet be wealthy and tall?"
30,15,Jewish Thought,Derashot HaRan 5:16,"And though Lavan, the father of Rachel and Leah, was an idol-worshipper, Isaac preferred that Jacob choose a bride from Lavan's family rather than from the daughters of Canaan. The reason for all this is as follows: A man has free will and can choose whichever way he wishes, as it is written (Deuteronomy 30:15): ""See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and evil — and choose life."" If one denies this, it is as if he denies the entire Torah. And not only does he undermine the foundations of Torah, but he also denies the manifest nature of reality. For it is apparent that nature contains three categories: necessary, possible, and impossible, and that those things which are possible are as hidden to nature as they are to us. If it were not so, one would know what his neighbor would do momentarily or he would be just as ignorant of such deeds of his own as he was of his neighbor's. But the nature of reality plainly demonstrates otherwise — that a man's deeds are in his own hands, that he is not compelled or restrained."

30,15,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 34:1:5,"The kind of tolerance G-d displays depends on who He needs to relate to. In the first instance there are the spiritual, completely disembodied beings inhabiting the ""upper"" world, who are closest to Him. Since these beings by their very nature are close to perfection, tolerating them does not require a major effort on G-d’s part. Also the bodies in outer space whose regular and constant orbit represent service of G-d on a non-stop basis, do not require a great deal of tolerance on the part of G-d. These heavenly bodies, which provide the four basic raw materials for our physical universe, in a sense support this earth. At the time of the garden of Eden being at man's disposal, G-d had a home in the material universe because His spirit was present within man. This was the connection between the worlds above the rakiyah, firmament, and the world ""below."" Both harbored the Divine spirit. The commandment, ""Do not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil,"" meant ""do not become engrossed in the material world except to the extent of doing good. Engrossing yourself in evil will make you part of this finite world, make you mortal."" Since we have defined mavet, death, as being equal to ra, evil, and chayim, life, as being equal to tov, good, it is quite clear that contact with ra is contact with death (Deut. 30,15, compare our Chapter 7). Breaking this commandment, then, had to result in the Shechinah, G-d’s Presence withdrawing. Shechinah cannot associate with death; since there did not remain any immortal human beings on earth, there was no alternative but to withdraw to a level further removed from earth. At this point, the author describes successive withdrawals of G-d from different planets in outer space as being connected with the individual functions of these planets in our world. Abraham made up for the commandment that Adam had transgressed, by taking upon himself to command his offspring to observe the commandments of the Lord. G-d acknowledged this when He said, ""As a result of Abraham having listened to My voice etc."" (Genesis 26,5). Isaac repaired the damage done by Cain who had committed murder, when he voluntarily submitted to the command of His Creator, in contrast to Cain who had acted as if there were no judge or judgment in the world. His deed was acknowledged when the angel instructed Abraham, ""Do not lay a hand on the lad, do not touch him"" (Genesis 22,12). Jacob, who had been able to prevail on all his children to remain loyal to G-d and to proclaim His Unity when they said, ""Hear O Israel, the Lord our G-d is One,"" enabled G-d to return His Presence still closer to earth. Jacob had thus repaired the damage done by Enosh who had been the first to introduce the concept of G-d not being One. When Levi appeared, risking his life to avenge the shame of the rape of his sister Dinah, he repaired the damage done by the generation of the deluge, who had practiced immorality, incest etc. Kehot was the leader of the Jewish people when the latter were forced to commence performing slave labor for the Egyptians. The Jews who had been singled out for this cruel treatment, because they had failed to assimilate to the Egyptians, maintained a profile of being different by keeping their Hebrew names, language, and religion in spite of persecution suffered. This fact enabled G-d to move still closer to earth, as the damage done by the collective insubordination of the generation that built the tower of Babel had now been repaired. Amram in turn repaired the damage done by the people of Sodom, who through lack of concern for their fellow man, had driven the Shechinah still further away. Amram demonstrated his concern for the future of his nation when he responded to the admonition of his daughter not to stop having children, even at the risk of a baby boy being drowned by the Egyptians. When Moses finally made his appearance, and instead of persecuting the just, stood up against terror, injustice, and ""might is right,"" he repaired what Nimrad/Amrafel had destroyed when he made war against the weak who had not provoked him. G-d was thus able to feel at home again on earth since the counterweight to everything the serpent had helped ruin had appeared on earth, and had made its impact. The Talmud Yevamot 112 says that when Israel stood at Mount Sinai, their ""filth"" departed from them. What is meant is that they reverted to the state of innocence that existed when Adam had just been created. The book of Exodus deserves to be called the book of redemption, since it tells of the redemption of the Jewish people from a cruel and barbaric fate at the hands of a cruel and barbaric nation. Apart from the physical redemption from slavery, the promise of being given the land of Israel with all its abundant natural wealth, would enable the Jewish people to live a life of ease and to be tested if they would indeed prove obedient to G-d, so that He could allow His Presence to dwell amongst them. Moses’ss accomplishment in restoring G-d’s Presence to earth, made him the intermediary between G-d and His people. To be a good intermediary requires that the intermediary himself feels in harmony with the objectives and methods of the one who has made him intermediary. Such rapport can exist either naturally, or in spite of one's natural inclinations. When Moses was shown a kind of wood that sweetens the waters at Marah (Ex. 15,25), our sages are in two minds about the nature of this wood. Some say that it was sweet wood, and that the resultant sweetening of the waters was a natural process. Others maintain that the wood itself was bitter, in which case the transformation of the waters was miraculous (Mechilta Beshalach). We find that G-d employs both kinds of agents as leaders of the Jewish people at different times. Gideon, who abandoned his preoccupation with salvaging his harvest, and who challenged the angel about G-ds apparent abandonment of His people, demonstrated selflessness and lack of concern with his private business to such an extent that the angel could say to him ""go forth with this strength of yours and save the Jewish people."" (Judges 6,14) He succeeded because he possessed the major ingredient needed for leadership. The reverse may be the case when the emissary of G-d is motivated by a feeling of obedience to G-d, but lacks the characteristics that put him in harmony with the purpose of his Sender. When attacking Amalek, Saul allowed considerations of economic gain to persuade him not to kill the best of the herds; he also displayed pity just when G-d had forbidden pity. This led to tragic results for his dynasty (Samuel I Chapter 15). His downfall can be traced not to lack of basic obedience, but to internal conflict between his own aims and methods, and G-ds aims and methods. Therefore, G-d looked for another man, David, who would be in tune with His objectives heart and soul, and who is held up as a model human being whose inner strivings coincide with G-d’s. When Jerobam is chastised by Achyah (Kings I 14,8-9), the point emphasized is that he failed to be with G-d ""like My servant David, who observed My commandments, who followed Me with his whole heart to do only what is right in My eyes."" This same David describes his own world outlook in Psalms 139,20 in the following words, ""Those who hate You O G-d, I hate, and those who rebel against You, I quarrel with."" When the Messiah is described, three characteristics are described as essential (Psalms 72,12-14). ""For he will deliver the defenseless man who cries, and the poor who has no helper; he will care for those who have been brought low."" ""He will redeem their souls from malice and violence, and their blood will be precious to him."" Our Parshah tells us that Moses possessed the qualities enumerated in Psalms and that therefore he was the ideal intermediary and saviour for Israel. When Moses, on his first outing to his brethren, saw an Egyptian torture a Jew, he could not stand this and he slew the Egytian. This corresponds to the line, ""He will deliver the defenseless man who cries out."" On the second day, when he observed injustice being perpetrated among his Jewish brethren, he stood up for the victim, the defenseless, as he did when he helped the daughters of Yitro at the well. In each case he risked his life or safety. Despite his disappointing experiences, he continued to involve himself in other peoples' problems. It is clear then that with the advent of Moses, G-d had found the person who was likely to lead the Jewish people successfully. "
30,15,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 67:6:5,"Our intelligence dictates that human behaviour does not escape the attention of the Creator, that reward and punishment will occur sooner or later. If this were not so, there would be no advantage in being human rather than a beast, and one's self confidence and self respect would decline to nil. For this reason the concept of reward and punishment by supernatural forces has always been widely accepted amongst mankind. To remove the sense of futility man might feel, Solomon has these words of comfort at the end of Kohelet 11, 9-10. ""Rejoice young man in your youth, and let your heart cheer you in the days of youth; walk in the ways of your heart and in the sight of your eyes."" The reference made here to ""ways of our heart,"" indicates that more than one objective is to be pursued. The first objective is attention to your physical needs in life; the second is the pursuit of eternal life, referred to as ""the life and goodness"" in Deut. 30,15. When these are being pursued, then in the words of Kohelet 11,9, ""remove vexation from your heart, put away evil from your flesh, know that concerning all these G'd would bring you to your judgment."" This philosophy of Heavenly judgment is so widespread, that in all countries where human justice fails, people pin their hopes on obtaining justice from on high. Even the concept that earthly justice is predicated on Heavenly judgments, is more or less universally accepted, (in the author's time) The term ""truth"" is applied to human judgments that are in accord with Divine principles of justice. Divine justice is termed tzedek, righteousness. The psalmist who proclaims ""truth grows on earth, and righteousness looks down from the heavens,"" has this in mind. (Psalms 85,12) The difference in terminology is to indicate that what originates in Heaven does not require anyone's confirmation in order for it to be considered true and objective. The Jewish contribution to this awareness is threefold. 1) We were the first to tell the world of the one Creator, His power and His interest. (in human affairs) This information subsequently began to circulate amongst mankind. 2) The knowledge that the day of judgment was the first day in Tishrey, more so than any other day of the year, as well as the purpose of this judgment. This is the meaning of ""it is a day of sounding teruah for you."" It is a statute for Israel, a social legislation of the G'd of Jacob."" (Psalms 81,5) 3) We alone determine when this day occurs. In this manner, Israel controls the effective dates of all ""holy convocations,"" as explained earlier. "
30,15,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 91:1:4,"As mentioned elsewhere, man having a spiritual side as well as a physical side, can be viewed as having two wives. One wife is beautiful, diligent, keeps house in an exemplary fashion, but, alas she has no children. The other wife, while lacking the many virtues of the first wife, bears numerous children for her husband, is of good character and intelligent. Because of the relative merits of the two wives, their husband strives constantly to maintain a degree of tolerance and peace between them. After all, they are both indispensable to him, each in her own way. He tries to please both of them, and take care of their respective needs. In fact it is incumbent upon him not to show preference to either one of them, just as in the case of the father who must not show preference for the son of the wife he loves better, if the one he loves less is the mother of his first born son. (Deut. chapter 21) When the Torah states (Deut. 30,15) ""I hereby offer you this day life and goodness, or death and evil,"" the reference is to two different lifestyles, as will be explained in chapter one hundred and one. We have also discussed this problem in chapter forty one, in connection with the manna, and in chapter seventy seven and sixty seven. The reason Moses touches on this problem at this juncture, when a totally new lifestyle for the people is imminent, is perfectly logical. A parable may illustrate the husband's dilemma. A man has two wives, one beautiful, the apple of his eye, the other plain looking but the mother of his children. One day the beautiful wife is abducted while her husband was away on business. Thereupon wife number two appeals to the king for assistance in locating and freeing the wife who has been abducted. The king is impressed with the plain looking wife who is so concerned about her better looking competition. Since he is of a kindly disposition, he not only promised to help locate the abducted wife, but assures the family of his financial support until the whole family would be reunited, the husband had returned and the captive wife freed. After a while, news of the whereabouts of the abducted wife is received, and the king sets out to free her and succeeds. He then calls in the husband, being aware that the latter had always displayed a preference for the wife who had been abducted. He warns the husband not to neglect or maltreat his other wife since it was she who had been instrumental in the family surviving and being reunited. The king threatens punitive action should the husband fail to treat the second wife fairly. "
30,15,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 3:9:4,"Man is assured that he can overcome mortality of the body if he allows the body to be governed by his ruach his spirit. On the other hand, his immortal soul is in jeopardy if he allows his ruach at the service of his body. Because of the unique nature of man, and because G'd was involved in his creation to the exclusion of ""mother earth,"" he rates a paragraph all to himself. The introduction of man's creation by G'd saying ""let Us create,"" also points to the distinctive character of this creation, regardless of which one of our commentators' views one accepts as to whom G'd consulted with."
30,15,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 7:1:16,"There are three levels of knowledge of good and evil. 1) Complete comprehension; 2) Completely erroneous conclusions; 3) A mixture of the previous two. Anyone who falls into category two is like a beast, not knowing left from right. Such people are pere, wild, unbridled, not Adam. Compare Deut. 1,39, ""And your children who do not know this day either good or evil."" Category One is he who knows correctly he is nolad betzelem, born in G-d’s image, as G-d Himself has testified, ""Here man has become like one of Us"" (Genesis 3,22). Category Three, i.e. those who have only partial understanding, confused knowledge, are the people who delve into the source of knowledge, making research an end in itself, as did the builders of the tower of Babel. This category comprises most of the human species. The tree of knowledge, though adjacent to the tree of life, was also close to all the other trees. The observer of the scene in the garden of Eden had three choices then. He could ignore the tree completely, and be termed sub-human. Or, he could notice it and all its attractive features, gain valuable insights through smelling it, touching it, and maybe even tasting it, though not eating its fruit. The result would be G-d like appreciation of good and evil. However, the exclusive preoccupation with it called ""eating,"" consuming it while being consumed by its charm, was forbidden and would result in mortality, abandoning oneself to the material, physical. We find in halachah, Jewish law, that whenever ""eating"" is forbidden, tasting may be permissible, since the principle is that tasting is not something of substance (Berachot 14). The deep involvement in eating from that tree produces as a corollary the result that such a person is no longer receptive to the purely spiritual/ intellectual such as represented by the tree of life. Thus one loses one's anchor in the ""higher"" world (called by our sages chut shel chessed). What happened to Adam when he abused the tree of knowledge is similar to what happened to King Saul after his failure to kill Agag king of Amalek, when hashgachah peratit, G-d’s Personal Providence, was withdrawn, and His kingdom was no longer considered G-d’s kingdom. When Isaac had said to Esau, ""Whenever he (Jacob) will reject the yoke of the Torah, you (Esau) will break the bond"" (Genesis 27,40), he also referred to the fact that G-d would then withdraw His hashgachah peratit from the people of Israel. Israel's descent to Egypt, a result of what the brothers had done to Joseph, or the survivors of the generation of spies in the desert, are all examples of the results of failures similar to what had occurred in the garden of Eden. “Mot-Tamut,"" you will surely die. The tragedy, according to Bereshit Rabbah 16, was that the mortality incurred by Adam was automatically conferred upon his entire offspring, i.e. upon the entire human species. This is the reason the word mot tamut is repeated. All the other trees, the tree of life excepted, contained life's necessities, therefore eating from those trees was permitted. "
30,15,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 51:1:6,"This problem is solved when the Torah instructs remembrances together with things which we had to learn. The Talmud (Berachot 20) says ""everything which is subject to observance,becomes subject to remembrance."" This means that every act such as Sabbath observance, triggers memory cells which reminds the one performing the commandment of the purpose of the Sabbath legislation and the process of creation by G-d. ""Observe the month of spring, for during it you came out of Egypt"" (Exodus 13,4) This means that the Passover observances will trigger memories related to the Exodus. Or, regarding the observance of Purim ""these days will be remembered through their observance."" (Esther 9,28) Remembering Amalek is especially underlined, since no specific act triggers the memory. This is why the commandment ends with the words ""do not forget!"" In the absence of a mitzvah act, the danger of forgetting is much greater. Reading the portion of the attack of Amalek substitutes for an act. In all the foregoing situations, the Torah provides the antidote to forgetting. In view of these memory aids provided, not remembering a commandment which mentions remembrance becomes culpable. People who fail to make notations of important events in their calendar can be faulted for not remembering them. This is why the chief of Pharaoh's cupbearers, of whom the Torah says that ""he did not remember Joseph but forgot him,"" refers to this a a sin. (Genesis 41,9) One of the sins of the cupbearer referred to, was not remembering Joseph's request to be mentioned to Pharaoh as deserving release from prison. When David says in Psalms 119,45, ""I swore I will keep Your words,"" he did so to remind himself of commandments he might otherwise have overlooked. The Talmud Baba Metzia 5, states that though a man's honesty may be suspect, his oath is believed. David swore to himself that if he were to be remiss, he would bear the additional burden of a false oath, a severe enough sin to jog his memory not to forget to observe the mitzvot in question. When Solomon says in Proverbs 10,5, ""he who accumulates in summer is a wise person,"" he would apply this same kind of reasoning to him who reinforces his memory by vowing not to forget to keep the mitzvah. He who feels bothered by the fact that a certain mitzvah is incumbent upon him, has already reason to rejoice over taking the oath, just as a person taking a laxative realises joyfully that the medicine is about to help as soon as his stomach starts convulsing. "
30,15,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 7:1:6,"No doubt, as stated by Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, G-d had planted the garden prior to man's creation (meaning of the word mikedem, ""since before"") at the hub of the earth, a place where all the positive influences converge and enable the successful growth of all the finest fruit. The concentration of all this excellent fruit would prove to Adam that the whole earth could support such bounty of nature. ""Eden” expresses the totality of the earth since ancient times. G-d placed man in the garden, i.e. a miniature of the globe, to make him aware of the nature of the earth, his place and task on it. Since this universe was created for the sake of man, he needed to become aware how he could preserve it. Man's physical parts are really two, as explained in chapter six. (1) G-d created man dust from the earth; (2) He blew a breath of life into his nostrils, completing the process of creating his body. Only then could man become a living creature. Given the matter supplied by G-d, as distinct from the animal kingdom which had been produced by earth, i.e. nature, the life force supplied by mother earth differs materially from the life force supplied by G-d directly. The trees whose function it was to supply man's need for nourishment, were part of the equipment of the garden. All the things necessary for man are mentioned under the heading ""pleasant to look at, good to eat,"" i.e. good as food. G-d made them grow out of the earth since they represented the needs of that part of man that had been fashioned from the dust of the earth. Of the other two trees (tree of life and tree of knowledge), no mention is made as to how they came into existence. They corresponded to man's intellectual and spiritual needs. The tree of life in particular had been designed to assure man's immortality by feeding his intellect so that it could attain independent and enduring existence. Its position in the center of the garden emphasizes that man's entire existence should revolve around what this tree symbolizes. Since matan Torah, the revelation at Mount Sinai, its place has been taken by Torah. Torah is described frequently as our source of life. Next to it was the tree of knowledge, representing practical rather than speculative reason, appealing to expediency, immediate gratification etc. The tree of knowledge was to practical reason what the tree of life was to speculative reason. Its position near the tree of life was to point out that everything it stood for should be placed in the service of the tree of life. "
30,15,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 10:1:5,"The difference between angel and man lies in the freedom of will possessed by man and the absence of such freedom of choice in angels. Man is able to rise or fall morally, ethically; angels remain forever on the same plateau. Rashi and Onkelos say what they say in addition to the peshat, the plain meaning of the verse. They do so to forestall the impression that G-d is described as talking to Himself or to any of His non existent partners. We find many instances when Onkelos translates elokim as ""angels of G-d,"" such as Jacob saying ""I have seen elokim face to face"" (Genesis 32,31). In the case of the serpent using this term, seeing the serpent does not have encounters with angels, the term refers simply to elokim as the Creator and His power. Even the she-ass of Bileam did not see the angel as an angel (Numbers 22). It only saw him as a threatening obstruction. Had this not been so, she would not have said to Bileam, ""Do I usually act in this fashion?"" She would have said, ""The angel of the Lord has prevented me."" "

Every human being may become righteous like Moses our teacher, or wicked like Jeroboam; wise or foolish, merciful or cruel, niggardly or generous, and so with all other qualities.... This doctrine is an important principle, the pillar of the law and the commandments, as it is said, “See I have set before you today life and good, death and evil” (Deut. 30:15), and again it is written, “See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse” (Deut. 11:26). This means that the power is in your hands, and whatever a man desires to do among the things that human beings do, he can do, whether they are good or evil.... If God had decreed that a person should be either righteous or wicked, or if there were some force inherent in his nature which irresistibly drew him to a particular course…what room would there be for the whole of the Torah?

30,19,Jewish Thought,Eight Chapters 8:5,"In reality, the undoubted truth of the matter is that man has full sway over all his actions. If he wishes to do a thing, he does it; if he does not wish to do it, he need not, without any external compulsion controlling him. Therefore, God very properly commanded man, saying, ""See I have set before thee this day life and the good, death and evil .... therefore choose thou life"", (Deut. XXX, 15. 19. Cf. H. Teshubah, V, 3.)  giving us, as regards these, freedom of choice. Consequently, punishment is inflicted upon those who disobey, and reward granted to the obedient, as it is said, ""If thou wilt hearken"", and ""If thou wilt not hearken"". (Deut. XI, 27. 28.)  Learning and teaching are also necessary, according to the commands, ""Ye shall teach them to your children"", (Ibid., XI, 19.)  ""and ye shall do them and observe to do them"", (Ibid., V, 1.)  and, similarly, all the other passages referring to the study of the commandments. It is also necessary to take all the precautionary measures laid down in the Law, such as, ""Thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof; that thou bring not blood upon thy house"", (Ibid., XXII, 8.)  ""lest he die in the battle"", (Ibid XX, 5 or 7.)  ""wherein shall he sleep?"" (Ex. XXII, 26.)  , and ""no man shall take to pledge the nether or the upper millstone"", (Deut.

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

When you choose to follow this path, you will live and you will multiply, and the Lord your God will bless you in the land that you are coming there to take possession of it. You will thereby choose life and the good."
30,16,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 56:1:4,"Since we have established that events in this world can be due to natural law or G-d’s direct intervention, and that the latter is reserved for the Jewish people, it is proper to show how construction of the tabernacle fits into the second category. When events are the result of natural law, the fate of the righteous and the fate of the sinner are alike, since natural law does not distinguish between good and evil, rich and poor etc. This is not so when events are due to Divine intervention. Then the guilty gets his just deserts and the innocent, i.e. the righteous reaps the reward due him. It is crucial therefore, to have chosen the right way of life. He who chooses the lifestyle of a sinner, is in effect choosing death. This fact is spelled out in the Torah on several occasions, such as Deut.30, 16, et al. We have discussed G-d’s Personal Providence in chapters 15 and 31. Since we have explained in chapter 48, that the tabernacle was a microcosm of the universe, we will explain how Israel is taught a lesson by G-d exercising His Personal Providence in connection with the tabernacle and its parts, about His macrocosm. When one speaks about how the world is being run, this ""running"" can be subdivided into three aspects. 1) Availability of food and shelter. Both are available in equal measure for the righteous as well as for the sinner, as stated in Deut. 4, 19, ""sun, moon and stars have been allocated to all nations."" 2) The availability of free choice within the framework of natural law. (compare chapter 3) This is necessary in order not to make good conduct something that is merely functional. If bad conduct were to be followed automatically and immediately by punishment, good behaviour could not qualify for reward since it would be due merely to fear and other functional considerations. 3) Sometimes, matters that had been preordained in accordance with natural law, are synchronised to occur at a time when they demonstrate G-d’s pleasure or displeasure with the conduct of man. If Nebuchdnezzar's star rose at the time of Yehoyakim so that he became the world's ruler, Israel, by reason of its wicked conduct was not excluded (saved) by special Divine intervention. Normally, when prophets make predictions they have in mind those preordained events. They announce their knowledge of these events and the time they would occur. Should the people repent, the preordained event will be cancelled, i.e. Divine intervention in Israel's fate will become manifest. False prophets base their predictions on their knowledge of natural law, not being privy to these preordained happenings that are timed to coincide with certain actions, resp. inactions of the Jewish people. Thus they deny Divine Personal intervention. Chapter twenty seven in Jeremiah is a case in point. Personal Providence does not apply to Nebuchadnezzar, but it would apply to Israel if they would follow the urgings of the prophet. Proof that the chapter discusses events due to natural law, is the prophecy concerning Nebuchadnezzar's son and grandson who had as yet not proven themselves, and whose dominion, if preordained, had nothing to do with Divine intervention. In such circumstances, intervention by hashgachah peratit, Personal Divine Providence, cannot be expected. Also, by means of natural law, the seventy years of Babylonian exile were to have the psychological effect of bringing about repentance by those who had to live in Babylonia as strangers. King Cyrus responded to their seventy year exile when he granted permission to re-establish the Jewish state, (province within the Persian empire) When king Solomon states in Kohelet 8,5, ""he who obeys the commandments will know no evil, and a wise mind will know time and justice, for everything has its time and justice for man's evil overwhelms him..l have taken this to heart,"" this passage does not mean that all fates are determined exclusively by natural law. It merely means that there is such a thing as natural law, but that G-d works according to His timetable. Those who believe that there is only natural law err. Therefore, all attempts to calculate the coming of the Messiah in advance are doomed to failure. When G-d has said in Isaiah 63,4, ""the day of vengeance is in My heart,"" He means that He will not reveal the timing, but it remains in His heart. Sanhedrin 97, curses those who calculate the timing of the Messiah's arrival beforehand. Such calculations actually delay his arrival. If someone had calculated that the Messiah would not arrive until the year seven thousand, using astronomic and astrological data, we would resign ourselves to a lengthy exile and slacken our efforts to hasten his arrival through the performance of good deeds. We must believe that a) ""My redemption is close at hand,"" (Isaiah 56, 1) and that when least thought about, it may arrive. (Sanhedrin 94) Experience has taught us that G-d may hasten the end, (Haggadah of Passover) when He shortened our exile in Egypt."" I the Lord, at its time, I will hasten it"" (Isaiah 60,22). G-d reserves the right to accelerate His timetable, if warranted. At this point we learn that ""natural law"" can be supplanted by hashgachah perartit. When Jeremiah expresses the hope that the prediction of the false prophet Chananyah ben Azzur who had predicted the return of the captured holy vessels within two years, would come true, (Jeremiah 28, 6) he did so because the principle of hashgachah peratit can override the dictates of natural law. G-d’s prerogative to employ this method has certainly not been abrogated. When Jeremiah expressed doubt however, that this would happen, and predicted the false prophet's imminent death, he merely indicated that the conditions to bring about G-d’s personal intervention on behalf of the Jewish people did not exist at that time. The people simply did not merit it. The acid test of whether a prophet speaks the truth is when he predicts something ""good"" and it does not come true exactly as promised. Prediction of disaster merely serves to arouse feelings of fear and, hopefully, remorse. The reverse is achieved when the false prophet predicts something ""good,"" lulling his listeners into a false sense of security, an impediment to arousing feelings of remorse and repentance. This is what was the case in Jeremiah chapters 27 and 28. In Jeremiah 27, 18, Jeremiah exhorts those prophets that if they were indeed prophets of the Lord, they would pray to G-d not to lose the remaining holy vessels of the temple, and for their king not to be taken into captivity. At least, if they did that, they would attempt to ward off a decree already in the process of being executed. The reason the ""good"" prophecy has to come true is that hashgachah peratit supersedes natural law, and a good prophecy is always based on hashgachah peratit being employed. The reverse is not true, since prophesies of doom are based on G-d’s intervention having been forfeited. Hence there is a chance of doom. When no doom occurs, it proves that Divine intervention did take place on our behalf and superseded the natural law which would have proved fatal to us had it been allowed to run its course. (more on this in chapter 96) When two prophets prophesy simultaneously about the same people however, the true prophet threatening doom in order to arouse feelings of repentance, and the false prophet assuring the same people that regardless of their conduct the good will come true since their merit suffices, then only by the ""good"" coming true can we have proof positive of who was the true prophet and who was not.

30,19,Jewish Thought,Eight Chapters 8:5,"In reality, the undoubted truth of the matter is that man has full sway over all his actions. If he wishes to do a thing, he does it; if he does not wish to do it, he need not, without any external compulsion controlling him. Therefore, God very properly commanded man, saying, ""See I have set before thee this day life and the good, death and evil .... therefore choose thou life"", (Deut. XXX, 15. 19. Cf. H. Teshubah, V, 3.)  giving us, as regards these, freedom of choice. Consequently, punishment is inflicted upon those who disobey, and reward granted to the obedient, as it is said, ""If thou wilt hearken"", and ""If thou wilt not hearken"". (Deut. XI, 27. 28.)  Learning and teaching are also necessary, according to the commands, ""Ye shall teach them to your children"", (Ibid., XI, 19.)  ""and ye shall do them and observe to do them"", (Ibid., V, 1.)  and, similarly, all the other passages referring to the study of the commandments. It is also necessary to take all the precautionary measures laid down in the Law, such as, ""Thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof; that thou bring not blood upon thy house"", (Ibid., XXII, 8.)  ""lest he die in the battle"", (Ibid XX, 5 or 7.)  ""wherein shall he sleep?"" (Ex. XXII, 26.)  , and ""no man shall take to pledge the nether or the upper millstone"", (Deut. XXIV, 6.)  and many other passages in regard to precautions found in the Law and the Prophets. (See H. Teshubah, V, 4, and Moreh, III, 20; cf. Ibn Baud, Emunah Ramah, II, 6, 2, p. 96.)  "
30,17,Quoting Commentary,Ramban on Leviticus 19:4:1,"He states, ‘Al tiphnu’ (Turn ye not) unto the idols, (Verse 4.)  the term tiphnu (turn ye) being of the expressions: and if thy heart ‘yiphneh’ (turn away); (Deuteronomy 30:17.)  whose heart ‘poneh’ (turneth away) this day. (Ibid., 29:17.)  The verse [here] is thus stating that one’s heart should not turn away to the idols, to believe that there is some benefit in [worshipping] them, or that the events that they foretell will really transpire; rather, they and all their activities should appear to him as things of nought, and vanity, (Isaiah 40:17.)  and future events occur only by decree of the Most High. And so also have our Rabbis said: (Shabbath 149 a.)  “It is forbidden to look at the statues [of the idols] themselves, because it says, ‘Turn ye not’ unto the idols.” Thus the Rabbis included within this prohibition even looking at the statues, so that one should not allow one’s thoughts to dwell on their matters at all. He states, nor make to yourselves molten gods, (Verse 4.)  thus prohibiting them from the very moment that they are made. Admonitions against idolatry are stated in the Torah in many places. In the Midrash of Vayikra Rabbah the Rabbis mentioned concerning this section [of the Torah the following text]: (Vayikra Rabbah 24:5.)  “Rabbi Levi says: Because the Ten Commandments are included in this section [therefore it was proclaimed to the full assembly]. I am the Eternal thy G-d, (Exodus 20:2.)  and here it is written, I am the Eternal your G-d. Thou shalt have no other gods, (Exodus 20:3.)  and here it is written, nor make to yourselves molten gods. (Verse 4.)  Thou shalt not take the Name of the Eternal thy G-d in vain, (Ibid., Verse 7.)  and here it is written, And ye shall not swear by My Name falsely. (Further, Verse 12.)  Remember the Sabbath day, (Ibid., Verse 8 (Vol. II, pp. 306-311).)  and here it is written, and ye shall keep My Sabbaths. (Verse 3.)  Honor thy father and thy mother, (Exodus 20:12.)  and here it is written, Ye shall fear every man his mother and his father. (Verse 3.)  Thou shalt not murder, (Exodus 20:13.)  and here it is written, Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor. (Further, Verse 16.)  Thou shalt not commit adultery, (Exodus 20:13.)  and here it is written, Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot. (Ibid., Verse 29.)  Thou shalt not steal, (Exodus 20:13.)  and here it is written, Ye shall not steal. (Ibid., Verse 11.)  Thou shalt not bear false witness, (Exodus 20:13.)  and here it is written, Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people. (Further, Verse 16.)  Thou shalt not covet, (Exodus 20:14.)  and here it is written, and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” (Further, Verse 18. For if you love him as yourself you will not covet that which is his, since that which is hateful to yourself, you should not do to others (Etz Yoseiph in the name of Rabbi David Luria).)  Thus far is the text of the Midrash."
30,17,Talmud,Sukkah 46b:1,"holds that which is placed within it, while a full vessel does not hold it. However, the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is: If God adds to someone who is a full vessel in terms of knowledge or good attributes, he holds it; a person who is an empty vessel will not hold it. This is alluded to by the verse where it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, if you will hearken diligently [shamoa tishma] unto the voice of the Lord your God, to observe to do all his commandments” (Deuteronomy 28:1). This verse is interpreted homiletically: If you hearken [shamoa] in the present, you will hearken [tishma] in the future as well; and if not, you will not hearken. Alternatively: If you hearkened to the old, i.e., if you review what you already learned, you will hearken to the new as well. “But if your heart turns away” (Deuteronomy 30:17), you will no longer be able to hearken."
30,17,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Vayikra 19:2:3","קדושים תהיו כי קדוש אני ה' אלו-היכם, “You shall be holy for I am holy, Hashem, your G’d.” According to the plain meaning of the text the word קדוש, means isolating oneself, being apart. This is an exhortation to the entire Jewish people to be chaste, to practices noble character traits and to impress one’s children with the importance of these virtues. Children then will look up to their parents as if the parents truly were G’d’s representatives on earth. In turn they will testify thereby that the Creator Himself is their supreme authority, the original “patriarch” who has called this world into existence. In order to make this point, our paragraph immediately commences by telling us that we must revere mother and father and observe G’d’s Sabbaths. (verse 3). The linkage of these two commandments is that the Sabbath is testimony to the fact that G’d created the universe (Exodus 20,11).  The reason the Torah writes the commandment to revere mother and father, letting the mother precede the father in importance (as opposed to a similar commandment in the decalogue where the Torah writes: “honour your father and your mother”), is that it is natural for children to love the mother more than the father and to fear the authority of the father more than that of the mother. The Torah wants to ensure that we do not make such distinctions in our relationship with our respective father and mother. If both parents were to agree that the child is to violate the Sabbath, the Torah adds immediately: “and you shall observe My Sabbath days,” meaning that this commandment overrides even a joint command by father and mother to the contrary. The addition of the words: “I am the Lord your G’d” at the end of verse three means that G’d is the supreme authority for both the child and his parents and thus has overriding authority when there is a conflict involving the loyalties of the child. Both the parents and the child are obligated to carry out His instructions.  The Torah appends the commandment not to serve any other deities nor to make molten images for oneself to make the point that even if one recognises the Lord as the supreme authority but denies that He created the world out of no pre-existing raw material one is considered an heretic, guilty of idolatry.  One must not turn to idols as this implies that one considers that they are a substantive force. The words אל תפנו, “do not turn,” are not so much an instruction not to face the idols but that in one’s heart one must not believe that there is anything to them and to what they purport to represent. We must consider idols as something devoid of any theological meaning, totally powerless to exert influence of any kind on anybody. The use of the root פנה here is similar in meaning to Deut. 29,17: “whose heart turns away today from the Lord, etc.,” or Deut. 30,17 “if you will turn away and not listen.”  The Torah adds that “you must not construct molten images for yourselves,” i.e. even though you are aware that such images are totally meaningless in theological terms, have no power or value. The reason the Torah appends the words: “I am the Lord your G’d,” means that ‘I can be trusted to pay you your reward, i.e. Hashem, (attribute of Mercy) but eloheychem, (attribute of Justice) in the event you do something for which you will deserve punishment.’"
30,18,Halakhah,"Peninei Halakhah, Days of Awe 1:2:3","Thus we read: See, I set before you this day life and prosperity, death and adversity. For I command you this day to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His laws, and His rules, that you may thrive and increase, and that the Lord your God may bless you in the land that you are about to enter and possess. But if your heart turns away and you give no heed, and are lured into the worship and service of other gods, I declare to you this day that you shall certainly perish; you shall not long endure on the soil that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. (Devarim 30:15-18) God wants us to choose life, as we read: I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day: I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life – if you and your offspring would live – by loving the Lord your God, heeding His commands, and holding fast to Him. For thereby you shall have life and shall long endure upon the soil that the Lord your God swore to your ancestors, Avraham, Yitzḥak, and Yaakov, to give to them. (Ibid. 19-20)"
30,19,Jewish Thought,"With God in Hell, 7 To Live or to Survive 21","Whereas Des Pres’ insights are born out by the nature and history of Western civilization, they have no meaning within the context of Judaism. Some of the key passages of the Torah affirm the ultimate value of life. For instance: “See I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil…I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed.” (Deuteronomy 30:15–19.)  Or, in another passage: “Ye, shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them…” (Leviticus 18:5.)  The rabbis in the Talmud interpret the last words to mean that one must live by God’s commandments, and not die because of them. (T.B. Sanhedrin 74a.) "
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,19,Jewish Thought,Eight Chapters 8:5,"In reality, the undoubted truth of the matter is that man has full sway over all his actions. If he wishes to do a thing, he does it; if he does not wish to do it, he need not, without any external compulsion controlling him. Therefore, God very properly commanded man, saying, ""See I have set before thee this day life and the good, death and evil .... therefore choose thou life"", (Deut. XXX, 15. 19. Cf. H. Teshubah, V, 3.)  giving us, as regards these, freedom of choice. Consequently, punishment is inflicted upon those who disobey, and reward granted to the obedient, as it is said, ""If thou wilt hearken"", and ""If thou wilt not hearken"". (Deut. XI, 27. 28.)  Learning and teaching are also necessary, according to the commands, ""Ye shall teach them to your children"", (Ibid., XI, 19.)  ""and ye shall do them and observe to do them"", (Ibid., V, 1.)  and, similarly, all the other passages referring to the study of the commandments. It is also necessary to take all the precautionary measures laid down in the Law, such as, ""Thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof; that thou bring not blood upon thy house"", (Ibid., XXII, 8.)  ""lest he die in the battle"", (Ibid XX, 5 or 7.)  ""wherein shall he sleep?"" (Ex. XXII, 26.)  , and ""no man shall take to pledge the nether or the upper millstone"", (Deut. XXIV, 6.)  and many other passages in regard to precautions found in the Law and the Prophets. (See H. Teshubah, V, 4, and Moreh, III, 20; cf. Ibn Baud, Emunah Ramah, II, 6, 2, p. 96.)  "

But if your heart turns away and you give no heed, and are lured into the worship and service of other gods, I declare to you this day that you shall certainly perish; you shall not long endure on the soil that you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. (Devarim 30:15-18) God wants us to choose life, as we read: I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day: I have put before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life – if you and your offspring would live – by loving the Lord your God, heeding His commands, and holding fast to Him. For thereby you shall have life and shall long endure upon the soil that the Lord your God swore to your ancestors, Avraham, Yitzḥak, and Yaakov, to give to them. (Ibid. 19-20)"
30,19,Jewish Thought,"With God in Hell, 7 To Live or to Survive 21","Whereas Des Pres’ insights are born out by the nature and history of Western civilization, they have no meaning within the context of Judaism. Some of the key passages of the Torah affirm the ultimate value of life. For instance: “See I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil…I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed.” (Deuteronomy 30:15–19.)  Or, in another passage: “Ye, shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them…” (Leviticus 18:5.)  The rabbis in the Talmud interpret the last words to mean that one must live by God’s commandments, and not die because of them. (T.B. Sanhedrin 74a.) "
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency.

The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,18,Commentary,Steinsaltz on Deuteronomy 30:18,"I am telling you today that you will be annihilated from the world. Your lives are not mere random occurrences, as you are not alive merely to exist and multiply. Rather, your lives have a purpose. If you turn your backs on your destiny, you will not extend your days upon the land that you are crossing the Jordan to go there to take possession of it, but you will be exiled."
30,19,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 30:19:1,"העדתי בכם היום את השמים ואת הארץ I CALL AS WITNESSES AGAINST YOU THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH, which exist for ever, and when evil will befall you they will be witnesses that I have warned you regarding all this (cf. Targum Jonathan on). Another explanation of העדתי בכם את השמים וגו׳ I CALL THE HEAVEN [AND THE EARTH] AS WITNESSES AGAINST YOU: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, “Look at the heavens which I have created to be at your service; have they perhaps ever changed their character? Has the orb of the sun perhaps ever failed to rise in the East and to give light to the whole world, just as is stated, (Ecclesiastes 1:4—5) “And the sun riseth, and the sun goeth down [and hasteth to its place where it arises]”?! Look at the earth which I have created to be at your service! Has it perhaps ever changed its character? Have you perhaps sown it and it did not bring forth, or have you sown wheat and it brought forth barley?! Now how is it with these that have been made neither with the end in view that they should receive a reward nor that they should suffer a loss — for if they act meritoriously (if they follow the natural laws by which they are governed) they receive no reward and if they were to fail they would receive no punishment? They have never changed their character! You, who if you act meritoriously do receive a reward and if you sin do receive punishment, how much the more so should you obey the commands of your Maker! (Sifrei Devarim 306:1)."
30,19,Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 30:19:2,"ובחרת בחיים THEREFORE CHOOSE THE LIFE — I show you these (“I set life and death before thee) in order that you may choose the portion of life. It is like a man who says to his son, “Choose for yourself a good portion of my real estate”, and sets him in the best portion saying to him, “Choose  this!” And concerning this it states, (Psalms 16:5) “The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and my cup, אתה תומיך גורלי”, i.e. “You place my hand on the good lot, saying, ‘Choose this!'”"

30,19,Commentary,Ibn Ezra on Deuteronomy 30:19:2,"LIFE AND DEATH. The reference is to the blessing and the curse. (The blessing and the curse is not an addition to what precedes it but is synonymous with it.)  Observe, it is incumbent upon you to choose life. (I.E.’s interpretation of therefore choose life.) "

30,19,Jewish Thought,Eight Chapters 8:5,"In reality, the undoubted truth of the matter is that man has full sway over all his actions. If he wishes to do a thing, he does it; if he does not wish to do it, he need not, without any external compulsion controlling him. Therefore, God very properly commanded man, saying, ""See I have set before thee this day life and the good, death and evil .... therefore choose thou life"", (Deut. XXX, 15. 19. Cf. H. Teshubah, V, 3.)  giving us, as regards these, freedom of choice. Consequently, punishment is inflicted upon those who disobey, and reward granted to the obedient, as it is said, ""If thou wilt hearken"", and ""If thou wilt not hearken"". (Deut. XI, 27. 28.)  Learning and teaching are also necessary, according to the commands, ""Ye shall teach them to your children"", (Ibid., XI, 19.)  ""and ye shall do them and observe to do them"", (Ibid., V, 1.)  and, similarly, all the other passages referring to the study of the commandments. It is also necessary to take all the precautionary measures laid down in the Law, such as, ""Thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof; that thou bring not blood upon thy house"", (Ibid., XXII, 8.)  ""lest he die in the battle"", (Ibid XX, 5 or 7.)  ""wherein shall he sleep?"" (Ex. XXII, 26.)  , and ""no man shall take to pledge the nether or the upper millstone"", (Deut. XXIV, 6.)  and many other passages in regard to precautions found in the Law and the Prophets. (See H. Teshubah, V, 4, and Moreh, III, 20; cf. Ibn Baud, Emunah Ramah, II, 6, 2, p. 96.)  "

30,19,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:19:1,"העירותי בכם היום את השמים ואת האריץ, ""I call as witness against you today both the heaven and the earth, etc."" This whole verse appears superfluous in light of verse 15 where Moses asked the people to choose life rather than death. Why did he have to repeat it? Besides why did Mose change the sequence and choice here? In verse 15 the choice was between life and goodness on the one hand and death and evil on the other. Here the Israelites are given choices between life and death and blessing and curse. What did Moses mean when he rephrased what he said in verse 15? Besides, why did Moses not simply exhort the people to ""choose life?"""
30,19,Quoting Commentary,Rashbam on Deuteronomy 3:24:1,"החלות, as mentioned earlier in 2,25 היום הזה אחל תת פחדך, “from this day on I begin to place the fear of you, etc.” The letter ח in the word החלות is the reason why the letter ה preceding it has the vowel patach underneath it. Similar vowel patterns are observed when the letter ה precedes the letter ע, as in Isaiah 41,25 העיירתי מצפון, “I have roused him from the north.” We have the same pattern in Deuteronomy 30,19 when Moses says העידותי בכם היום, “I call as witness against you this day, etc.” Isaiah 9,3 is another example of this anomaly. When the letter following the letter ה does not belong to the group known as אחה""ע we would generally find a chataf patach under the letter ה.

30,19,Commentary,Sforno on Deuteronomy 30:19:2,"למען תחיה אתה וזרעך, so that both you and your offspring will experience this life לאהבה את ה' אלוקיך, when I said to choose “life,” I did not mean that you should keep the laws for the sake of the reward in store for you, but that you should make this choice for the sake of true “life.” This alone is sufficient reason to choose this option. Whatever satisfaction you experience during life on earth should be with a view to the kind of life in store for you after your body has died."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,Sforno on Genesis 2:17:1,"ומעץ הדעת, the tree in the middle of the garden, in close proximity to the tree of life mentioned previously (verse 9) The meaning of חיים in connection with that tree is equivalent to the meaning of the words in Deuteronomy 30:19 החיים והמות נתתי לפניך, “I have placed life and death (to choose) before you.” [we may understand this to mean that the tree of life, if its fruit were eaten, would result in life of infinite duration, whereas eating from the tree next to it would result in life being shortened. Ed.]"
30,19,Midrash,Midrash Tehillim 1:15,"...Another thing, unless it is in the Torah of the Lord, they desire it. For anyone who engages in Torah, the Holy One, blessed be He, fulfills his desires. Rabbi Eliezer says, ""The people of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He, Master of the Universe, we want to engage in Torah day and night, but we have no free time."" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, ""Perform the mitzvah of tefillin, and I will consider it as if you were engaged in Torah day and night."" Rabbi Yochanan said, ""From this verse: 'And it shall be for a sign upon your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes' (Exodus 13:9), we learn that whoever wears tefillin fulfills the commandment of Torah day and night."" Rabbi Yehoshua said, ""What Rabbi Eliezer meant was only for the nights when the mitzvah of tefillin is not fulfilled, except during the day, as it is said, 'And you shall observe this statute at its appointed time from days to days' (Exodus 13:10)."" Rabbi Eliezer asked him, ""And what do you fulfill, while you engage in his Torah day and night?"" Rabbi Yehoshua said to him, ""This refers to the recitation of the Shema. If a person recites it both morning and evening, the Holy One, blessed be He, considers it as if he engaged in Torah day and night."" Bar Kapara said, ""Whoever recites two chapters of the Shema in the morning and two in the evening fulfills the commandment of Torah day and night."" Rabbi Berechiah said, ""Even the patriarchs established the Mishnah that they would sit during the day for the portion that is taken from the night and during the night for the portion that is taken from the day."" They asked Rabbi Yehoshua what a person should study in Greek wisdom. He said to them, ""Go and see which hour is neither of the day nor of the night, and you may study then, as it is said, 'And you shall meditate therein day and night' (Joshua 1:8)."" He then returned and said to them, ""A person should not teach his son Greek wisdom, nor even a craft that would cause him to neglect the study of Torah, even for an hour, as it is said, 'Therefore choose life' (Deuteronomy 30:19)."" We learned that in the morning, one recites two blessings before and one after the Shema, and in the evening, two before and two after. This is so that the recitation of the Shema day and night will be equal, as it is said, 'And you shall meditate therein day and night' (Joshua 1:8)."" Rabbi Yossi said, ""Based on the verse, 'Seven times a day I praise you because of your righteous ordinances' (Psalms 119:164), one should recite the Shema at least seven times a day."""
30,19,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Deuteronomy 31:28:2,"ואעידה בם את השמים ואת הארץ I WILL CALL THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH AS WITNESSES AGAINST THEM — But if you ask, “Behold he has already above (Deuteronomy 30:19) called heaven and earth as witnesses: “I call [the heaven and the earth] as witnesses this day against you etc.”?! Then I reply: There he said this to the Israelites (he told them that He would do this), but now he intends to say (Deuteronomy 32:1) “Give ear, O ye heavens, [and I will speak; and hear earth] etc.”, thus calling them as witnesses."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,Rabbeinu Yonah on Pirkei Avot 4:2:3,"since the reward for a commandment is another commandment: This is a reason other than nature. And so he wants to say that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not give good or evil into the hand of a person; rather only choice, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:19), ""and you shall choose life."" And since he has chosen a path, if he is going in the good, God is with him. And [so] if he does one commandment, it helps him to do another commandment - as on his own, he doesn't even have the ability to do good. And about this it says, ""since the reward for a commandment is another commandment, and the reward for a sin is another sin."" And not, God forbid, that this is his reward. As if so, what reward does he [actually] have? And the thing is not like this, as his reward exists for the world to come. But rather he wants to say that the fruit of [doing] a commandment is [doing another] commandment; and he eats its fruits in this world, which is that it helps him to do other commandments. And it comes out that the principle expands and it exists in the world to come. And this is what is stated (Isaiah 3:10), ""Hail the just man, for he is good; they shall eat the fruit of their works."" "
30,19,Commentary,"Tur HaArokh, Deuteronomy 30:19:1","העידותי בכם היום את השמים ואת הארץ, “I call upon heaven and earth this day to bear witness against you;” although Moses had called on heaven and earth as witnesses against the people already once before, here he adds “life” and “death” as an additional dimension to encourage the people to make the right choice when they have to make a decision. “Life” and “Death” are only different words for the concepts of “Blessing” and “Curse.” Moses urges the people to choose wisely, i.e. to choose Life.

30,19,Midrash,Vayikra Rabbah 36:4,"Another matter, “I will remember My covenant with Jacob” – that is what is written: “Now, so said the Lord, your Creator, Jacob, and your Fashioner, Israel” (Isaiah 43:1). Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Reuven: The Holy One blessed be He said to His world: ‘My world, My world, I will tell you who created you and who fashioned you. Jacob created you and Jacob fashioned you,’ as it is written: “Your Creator, Jacob, and your Fashioner, Israel.”  Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Behemoth (A huge animal that will be served at the feast of the righteous in the World to Come. See Vayikra Rabba 13:3. )  was created only due to the merit of Jacob. That is what is written: “Behold now the behemoth that I made with you” (Job 40:15).  Rabbi Yehoshua ben Rabbi Neḥemya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Rabbi Yitzḥak: Heavens and earth were created only due to the merit of Jacob, as it is written: “He set a testimony in Jacob” (Psalms 78:5), and the testimony that is stated here is nothing other than heavens and earth, just as it says: “I call today to the heavens and the earth to bear witness to you” (Deuteronomy 30:19). Rabbi Berekhya said: Heavens and earth were created only due to the merit of Israel, as it is written: “In the beginning [bereshit], the Lord created [the heavens and the earth]” (Genesis 1:1), and reshit is nothing other than Israel, as it is stated: “Israel is sacred to the Lord, the first [reshit] of His crop” (Jeremiah 2:3).  Rabbi Aḥa said: Heavens and earth were created only due to the merit of Moses, as it is stated: “He saw the first [reshit] for himself [as there the lawgiver’s portion is hidden]” (Deuteronomy 33:21).  Rabbi Abbahu said: Everything was created only due to the merit of Jacob. That is what is written: “Not like these is the Portion of Jacob; for He is the fashioner of everything” (Jeremiah 10:16); for the sake of Jacob, He fashioned everything.  Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Abraham was rescued from the fiery furnace only due to the merit of Jacob. This is analogous to one who was standing in judgment before the ruler and he was sentenced by the ruler to be burned. The ruler gazed by means of astrology, and saw that he was destined to beget a daughter who would marry the king. He said: ‘He is worthy to be spared due to the merit of the daughter that he is destined to beget.’ So, Abraham was sentenced by Nimrod to be burned. The Holy One blessed be He foresaw that Jacob was destined to emerge from him. He said: ‘He is worthy to be spared due to the merit of Jacob.’ That is what is written: “Therefore, so says the Lord to the house of Jacob, who redeemed Abraham” (Isaiah 29:22).  The Rabbis say: Abraham himself was created only due to the merit of Jacob. That is what is written: “For I know him, so that he shall command his children and his household after him, and they will observe the way of the Lord, to perform righteousness and justice” (Genesis 18:19), and there is no “righteousness and justice” other than from Jacob, as it is stated: “You wrought justice and righteousness in Jacob” (Psalms 99:4). (Among the descendants of Abraham, only those from Jacob perform justice and righteousness, through the fulfillment of the Torah. ) "
30,19,Midrash,Devarim Rabbah 4:3,"Another matter, “see I” – Rabbi Elazar said: When the Holy One blessed be He said this matter at Sinai, from that time: “From the mouth of the Most High, evil and good do not emerge” (Lamentations 3:38). Rather, on its own, evil befalls those who perform evil, and good occurs to those who perform good. Alternatively, Rabbi Ḥagai said: [God said:] ‘Not only did I give you two paths; I went beyond the letter of the law, and said to you: “You shall choose life”’ (Deuteronomy 30:19)."
30,19,Musar,Sefer HaYashar 5:24,"The eleventh—We find in the Scripture (Deuteronomy 30:19), “Therefore choose life that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed.” And it says (Ibid., 5:30), “That ye may live.” And it says (Ibid., 8:1), “We will live and multiply.” And it says (Ibid., 5:16), “That thy days may be long.” We see that the wicked seem to live like the righteous, and, in many cases, they enjoy the goodness of the world. Therefore, the life of which the Scripture speaks must be the life that comes after death."
30,19,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Pekudei 2:3","R. Jacob the son of Issi asked: Why does it say; I love the habitation of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth? Because the Tabernacle is equal to the creation of the world itself. How is that so? Concerning the first day, it is written: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth (Gen. 1:1), and it is written elsewhere: Who stretched out the heavens like a curtain (Ps. 104:2), and concerning the Tabernacle it is written: And thou shalt make curtains of goats’ hair (Exod. 26:7). About the second day of creation it states: Let there be a firmament and divide between them, and let it divide the waters from the waters (Gen. 1:6). About the Tabernacle it is written: And the veil shall divide between you (Exod. 26:33). With regard to the third day it states: Let the waters under the heavens be gathered (Gen. 1:9). With reference to the Tabernacle it is written: Thou shalt also make a laver of brass … and thou shalt put water therein (Exod. 30:18). On the fourth day he created light, as is stated: Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven (Gen. 1:14), and concerning the Tabernacle it is said: And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold (Exod. 25:31). On the fifth day He created birds, as it is said: Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let the fowl fly above the earth (Gen. 1:20), and with reference to the Tabernacle. He directed them to offer sacrifices of lambs and birds, and it says as well: And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high (Exod. 25:20). On the sixth day he created man, as it is said: And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him (Gen. 1:27), and about the Tabernacle it is written: A man who is a high priest who has been anointed to serve and to minister before God. (You write that this is not a direct quote from the Bible.)  On the seventh day The heaven and the earth were finished (Gen. 2:1), and with regard to the Tabernacle it is written: Thus was completed all the work of the Tabernacle (Exod. 39:32). Concerning the creation of the world it is written: And God blessed (Gen. 2:3), and of the Tabernacle it is said: And Moses blessed them (Exod. 39:43); with regard to the creation it is said: And God finished (Gen. 2:2), and of the Tabernacle it is written: On that day Moses made an end (Num. 7:1); of creation it says: And hallowed it (Gen. 2:2), and of the Tabernacle: And had anointed it and sanctified it (Num. 7:1). Why is the Tabernacle equal to heaven and earth? Because even as heaven and earth bear witness concerning Israel, as it is written: I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day (Deut. 30:19), so the Tabernacle bears witness in behalf of Israel, as is said: These are the accounts of the Tabernacle, even the Tabernacle of the testimony (Exod. 38:21). Hence it is said: Lord, I love the habitation of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth (Ps. 26:8)."
30,19,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Nasso 4:1","(Numb. 5:17), “Then the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and some of the dust.” And, why does he take water and dust and test her? Because he was created from the dust, and she was formed from the water. (Cf. Gen. R. 14:7.)  Therefore she was tested by water and by dust as to whether she was as pure as when she was created or not. Another interpretation: Why is she tested with water and with dust? Because they are her witnesses. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 30:19), “I have called the heavens and the earth to witness against you today.” Another interpretation: Why is she tested with water [and with dust]? Because a person who sows some seeds in the dust does not know what they are, until the water comes down upon them and makes known whether they belong to the owner of the field, or [whether they are] what others have sown. [(Numb. 5:12), “If anyone has his wife go astray.”] This text is related (to Job 24:15), “The eye of an adulterer watches for twilight, saying, ‘No eye shall see me.’” And so the adulterer says, “No human being knows about me”; but the Holy One, blessed be He, has His eyes ranging over all the earth. (Numb. R. 9:1.)  So it says (in Jer. 23:24), “’If someone hides in secret places, shall I not see him; do I not fill heaven and earth,’ says the Lord.” Such is the way of those who commit transgression. They wait for a time of darkness, so that no one will see them. It is therefore stated (in Job 24:15), “The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight.” So also thieves watch for an hour of darkness, as stated (in vs. 16), “He breaks into houses in the dark.” And so it says (in Is. 29:15), “Woe to those who delve deeply to hide a plan from the Lord, for their works are in darkness; [so they say, ‘Who sees us and who knows about us?’]” The thief and the adulterer are obdurate, because they remove the Divine Presence. The Holy One, blessed be He, as it were, fills the realms above and the realms below, as stated (in Jer. 23:24), “’do I not fill heaven and earth,’ says the Lord.” Also in regard to the place where the adulterer comes to commit adultery, the Holy One, blessed be He, is there in His glory. It is so stated (in Is. 6:3), “the whole earth is full of His glory.” Now the adulterer says to the Holy One, blessed be He, “Remove Yourself, and give way to me for a while.” The matter is exceedingly difficult, as it were. Since He is slow to anger, He gives way to him; for (according to Job 11:11) “He knows those who are worthless; so when He sees iniquity, [does He not discern it?]” It also says (in Job 24:15, cont.), “He (i.e., the Holy One, blessed be He) turns a secret into a face.” (This rendering fits the context of what follows in the midrash. A more traditional rendering, which fits the context of Job, would read, “AND HE (i.e., the adulterer) PUTS A VEIL ON HIS FACE.)  Ergo (in Job 24:15), “When the eye of an adulterer watches for twilight, saying, ‘No eye shall see me.’” So what does the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He turns a secret into a face. He puts the face of [the] adulterer on that fetus. (Lev. R. 23:12.)  While the adulterer and the adulteress do not want her to become pregnant but only to satisfy their sexual desire, the Holy One, blessed be He, proclaims (Gk.: parresiazesthai.)  them to the world. Ergo, “He turns a secret into a face,” so that the people may know [about him] and say, “Surely this one's face resembles the face of [the] adulterer”; for [the Holy One, blessed be He,] has formed the image of the fetus in the likeness of the adulterer. Ergo (ibid.), “He turns a secret into a face.” It is therefore called whoredom (zimmah); for they both deny and say, “We do not know what this is (zeh mah).” (Literally: “This is what?” The Hebrew uses the unusual word order to make the parallel with “whoredom” (zimmah).)  R. Isaac said, “The power of the adulterer is strong, because it weakens the power of the Divine Presence. How? When the fetus is conceived from the husband, the Holy One, blessed be He, forms its image in forty days. For thus have our masters taught, ‘In forty days the image of the fetus is recognizable.’ After forty days, when the adulterer comes into her, the Holy One, blessed be He, stands wondering and says, ‘After whom shall I form [the fetus]? The image (rt.: tswr) of the husband or the image of the adulterer?’ (According to Deut. 32:18,) As it were, ‘You were unmindful of (tshy) the Rock (tswr) that bore you.’ (I.e., the adulterer forgot that the Holy One would expose him.)  The yod (= y) is [here written] small. [Thus, you] weaken (tsh, without the yod) the hands (yad in the dual) of the Creator (tsayyar).” R. Abbahu said, “To what is the matter comparable? To a sculptor (tsayyar, rt.: tsyr), who was fashioning (rt.: tsyr) an image (Gk.: eikonion.)  of a king. When he came to finish the face, (Gk.: prosopon.)  they said to him, “The king is dead, and another king has arisen.” When the sculptor heard that, his hands failed. He began to say, “What shall I do with these colors (In the ancient world statues were painted.)  which I have? Shall I fashion [them] in the form of the former king or in the form of the second king?” He began to be bewildered. Now similarly, when the husband has marital relations with his wife, the Holy One, blessed be He, forms the fetus in the likeness of its father. [Then] in turn the adulterer comes into her. Ergo, the colors are mingled. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 4:2), “Swearing, lying, murdering, stealing, committing adultery break out; bloodshed follows bloodshed.” What does the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He returns, as it were, and changes the face into the likeness of the adulterer. Ergo (in Job 24:15) “He turns a secret into a face.”"
30,19,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Ha'Azinu 2:1","(Deut. 32:1:) “Give ear, O heavens, and let me speak; let the earth hear the words of my mouth.” This text is related (to Prov. 16:26), “The soul of a laborer labors for him, because his mouth (i.e., hunger) urges him on.” Why did Moses call to the heavens and the earth at the time of his passing away? [It was] simply to teach you that he called them to charge them concerning himself. He said to them, “Behold, the Holy One, blessed be He, has decreed over me that I am to die. Set your mind on how you will receive me in glory, so that you look at me as if I were alive and speaking words of Torah for the world.” (Deut. 32:1:) “Give ear, O heavens,” as I have already told you (in Deut. 4:26), “I have called heaven and earth to witness against you today.” See to it that you do not accuse (Rt.: QTRG, from the Greek verb kategorein.)  Israel after my death, (See III Enoch 26:12 = Sefer Enoch: Seder Ruhot, in A. Jellinek, Beth ha-Midrasch (Leipzig: C. W. Vollfath, 1853–57), vol. 5, pp. 179–180.)  but be mindful, as if I were alive, standing up to ask mercy for [Israel]. Isaiah said (in Is. 1:2), “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth.” What was the reason for Isaiah saying, “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth?” [It was] simply to teach you that all the words of the prophets are equivalent. Moses said, “Give ear, O heavens,” and Isaiah said, “Hear, O heavens.” R. Aqiva said, “[This] teaches that when Moses uttered the Torah, he was in the heavens, and that he was speaking with the heavens like one who is speaking with his friend, since he said, ‘Give ear, O heavens.’ But when he saw that the earth was far from him, he said, ‘Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.’ In the case of Isaiah, however, because he was on earth, he said, ‘Hear, O heavens,’ [since they were] far from him. After that he said, ‘And give ear, O earth, because it was near to him. (Is. 1:2, cont.:) “For the Lord has spoken.” They said to him, “Isaiah our teacher, if the Holy One, blessed be He, had spoken, would not the earth have quaked? Has it not already been stated (in Ps. 68:9), ‘The earth quaked, and the heavens [poured], because of the God of Sinai, [because of God, the God of Israel].’ The waters also trembled, as stated (in Ps. 93:4), ‘Than the roarings of many waters....’ When? [When] (in Exod. 20:1) ‘God spoke all these words, saying.’ If he had spoken with you, would you have lived?” It is comparable to a governor who entered a city. A prefect (Gk.: strategos.)  of that city came. When the governor came to speak with them, they became bewildered. In a few days, a certain bumpkin came. He said to them, “This is my friend, and I am accustomed to speak with him.” They said to him, “We cannot speak with him, but if he is your friend, speak with him on our behalf, and then [speak] with us [and let us know what he says].” [Similarly,] Israel said to Isaiah, “In our case he has called us his children, as stated (in Exod. 4:22), ‘Israel is My first-born son.’ It is also written (in Is. 46:3), ‘[Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob …,] the ones who have been borne by Me from birth, [carried from the womb].’ When He spoke with us at Sinai, our soul departed with His word. Should He speak with us [again], we shall die. But you are our master; draw near and listen, just as Moses our master did.” And what was this crown (status) that Isaiah had? What is stated (in Is. 49:5), “And now the Lord has spoken, the One who formed me in the womb to be His servant […].” Therefore is it stated (in Is. 32:1:) “Hear, O heavens….”"
30,19,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Fourth Treatise on Trust 4:78","[Of these three factors,] two are not beyond our control, namely, (1) the choice of service or sin and (2) intent and resolve to carry out the choice. For these, trusting in G-d would be a mistake and a foolishness, because the Creator left free choice in our hands whether to serve Him or rebel against Him, as written ""...[life and death I have set before you] and you shall choose life"" (Devarim 30:19). "
30,19,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Third Treatise on Service of God 8:5","We find, however, in the book of the Torah a contrary view, namely, that a human being's visible acts are in his own power. He can choose then as he pleases. They are effected by his choice and free will and he is accordingly liable to reward or punishment for service and transgression respectively, as it is said, ""See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil"" (Deut. 30:15). "". . . therefore choose life"" (Deut. 30:19). ""Through your hands this has come"" (Malachi 1:9). ""For according to a man's act, He requites him"" (Job 34:11). ""A man's folly perverts his way"" (Prov. 19:3). Everything in our religious literature, whether it be instruction, precept or moral exhortation, demonstrates this view. And whatever is there set forth concerning reward for service, and punishment for transgression, indicates that a human being's acts are left to himself and that the Divine glory does not interfere in his prosperity or in his ill-fortune, in his righteous deeds or in his perversities. "
30,19,Midrash,Kohelet Rabbah 9:9:1,"“Enjoy life with a woman whom you love all the days of your life of vanity which He has given you under the sun, all the days of your vanity, as that is your portion in life, and in your toil that you toil under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 9:9). “Enjoy life with a woman whom you love.” Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said in the name of the holy congregation: Acquire for yourself a craft with Torah. What is the reason? “Enjoy life [with a woman]…” (The midrash is interpreting the world “life” to refer to Torah, and the term “woman” to refer to a craft. One should have a craft with which to earn a livelihood, in addition to studying Torah.)  Why does he call them the holy congregation? It is because Rabbi Yosei ben Meshulam and Rabbi Shimon ben Menaseya, who would divide the day into three, one-third for Torah, one-third for prayer, and one-third for labor, were there. Some say: They would engage in Torah study during the days of winter, and in labor during the days of summer. Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Elazar would call Rabbi Yehoshua son of Rabbi Timi and Rabbi Burki the holy congregation, because they would divide the day into three, one-third for Torah, one-third for prayer, and one-third for labor. It is taught: It is prohibited for a mourner to marry a woman until thirty days [pass]. Rabbi Yehuda says: Until three consecutive pilgrimage festivals pass, corresponding to the three times that it is written: Life, life, life. In what case is this said? In a case when he has sons; however, if he has no sons, or if he has minor sons, it is permitted due to diminution of procreation and to see to their needs. (The mourner can marry a woman even within thirty days in order to fulfill the mitzva of procreation, or so that his new wife can take care of his young children.)  There was an incident and the wife of Rabbi Tarfon died, and when the grave was covered, he said to her sister amidst the mourning: ‘Enter my house (Marry me.)  and raise your sister’s children.’ Even though he married her, he did not engage in conjugal relations until after thirty days. It is taught: It is prohibited for a mourner to go to a house of feasting until thirty days [have passed]. It was taught: The mitzvot incumbent upon a father regarding his son are to circumcise him and to redeem him, and also to teach him Torah, to teach him a trade, and to marry him to a woman. Some say: Also to teach him to swim in a river. To circumcise him, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “He that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male” (Genesis 17:12). To redeem him, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “And all the first-born of man among your sons you shall redeem” (Exodus 13:13). To teach him Torah, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “You shall teach them” (Deuteronomy 11:19). To marry a woman, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “Take women and beget sons and daughters and take women for your sons” (Jeremiah 29:6). To teach him to swim in a river, from where [is it derived]? As it is stated: “You shall choose life” (Deuteronomy 30:19). Anyone who does not have a wife is without goodness, without a helper, without joy, without blessing, without atonement. Without good, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “It is not good for man to be alone” (Genesis 2:18). Without help, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “I will make him a helper alongside him” (Genesis 2:18). Without joy, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “You shall rejoice, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 14:26). Without blessing, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “To place a blessing upon your house” (Ezekiel 44:30). Without atonement, from where [is it derived]? [From the verse:] “And he shall atone for himself and for his household” (Leviticus 16:11). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Without life as well, as it is stated: “Enjoy life with a woman whom you love.” Without peace, as it is stated: “You are peace and your house is peace” (I Samuel 25:6). Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said: He is not even a complete person, as it is stated: “He blessed them and He called their name Adam” (The word adam, which is the name of the first man, simply means “person.”)  (Genesis 5:2) – when the two of them are not as one they are not called Adam. Some say it diminishes the Divine Image, as it is stated: “Because He created man in the image of God” (Genesis 9:6)."
30,19,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Nasso 5:1","(Numb. 5:15:) THEN HE SHALL BRING THE OFFERING FOR HER, ONE-TENTH AN EPHAH OF BARLEY MEAL. Why does she bring barley meal? (Tanh., Numb. 2:3; Sot. 2:1; cf. Sifre, to Numb. 5:15 (8).)  Because she behaved in the manner of a beast with him, she therefore brings the food of a beast as her offering. [(Ibid. cont.:) HE SHALL POUR NO OIL UPON IT.: Why does he not pour oil upon it? (Numb. R. 9:13.)  Because the oil is a light but is  called yitshar (a word which can mean ""it will shine""); while this woman loves the darkness. Therefore (in Numb. 5:15): HE SHALL POUR NO OIL UPON IT. [(Ibid., cont.:) NOR SHALL HE PUT FRANKINCENSE UPON IT.] Why does he not put frankincense upon it? Because the frankincense is a remembrance of the matriarchs, [as stated] (in Cant. 4:6): I WILL GO UNTO THE MOUNTAIN OF MYRRH AND UNTO THE MOUND OF FRANKINCENSE, while this woman has withdrawn from their ways. She would therefore be a reminder of iniquity and not a reminder of merit. (Numb. 5:17): THEN THE PRIEST SHALL TAKE HOLY WATER IN AN EARTHEN VESSEL AND SOME OF THE DUST WHICH IS ON THE FLOOR OF THE TABERNACLE. (Tanh., Numb. 2:4.)  He was created from the dust, and she was formed from the water. (Cf. Gen. R. 14:7.)  For that reason she was tested by water and by dust as to whether she was as pure as when she was created or not. And again, why is she tested with water and with dust? Because they are her witnesses. Thus it is stated (in Deut. 30:19): I HAVE CALLED THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH TO WITNESS AGAINST YOU TODAY."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Shemot 38:21:11","In Pirke d'Rabbi Eliezer chapter 3 we find the rhetorical question: “why was G’d called אל שדי? The answer given is that He was the One who said to the heavens רי, “enough,” thus preventing heaven from proliferating further by drawing on G’d’s mantle of light.  Just as heaven and earth would be used by G’d as witnesses in the event the Israelites were to violate the covenant and transgress the Torah -as we know from Deut. 30,19 “I have called as witnesses against you this day heaven and earth, etc., so the Tabernacle was called משכן העדות, the “Tabernacle of Testimony.” Just as the name Elohim occurs thirty two times during the story of creation, so the name of G’d also appears thirty two times in connection with the construction of the Tabernacle. Just as there were seven days which together formed the period known as מעשה בראשית, “the creation of the universe,” so there were seven days which served as מלואים, days which were considered as preparatory to the functioning of the Tabernacle. No doubt one can find other similarities between the Tabernacle and its construction and the universe and its construction in addition to those which I have already listed. I myself am aware of a number of such additional examples."
30,19,Commentary,"Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 30:19:1-3","העדותי בכם היום את השמים ואת הארץ, “I call as witness against you this day both heaven and earth.” I have already explained in connection with Deut.4,26 that the reason Moses chose heaven and earth as witnesses was because they endure forever and can always be called upon to testify. Human witnesses, due to their limited life span may no longer be alive when their testimony is required. Another reason for the choice of heaven and earth as witnesses is that they are perceived as signatories to Moses’ words. It is also possible to interpret the choice of heaven and earth as witnesses as due to the fact that they would survive destruction of the Temples seeing that in the seventh millennium (as the author described the meaning of the words היום השביע in Genesis 2,3) only heaven and earth survive the metamorphosis occurring at the end of the 6th millennium. It makes sense therefore that after Moses had spoken of the redemption that he should continue with an allusion to the subject of the resurrection. This then is the meaning of: “see I have given before you this day “the life.” Close upon the heels of the resurrection follows the era known as עולם הבא which Moses alludes to as הטוב, the good.”  It became necessary to invite witnesses who are of an enduring nature, remain in the universe forever, as we know from Isaiah 2,11: “none but the Lord shall be exalted in that day,” just as on the first day of creation when there was only heaven and earth. At the time we described nothing but the bare essentials of heaven and earth will remain functional. A Midrashic approach based on Sifri Haazinu: G’d told the people that He had created earth to serve their needs. He asks the people if, perchance the earth became disloyal and produced barley in response to the Jewish farmer sowing wheat? Or, did the heaven which He had similarly created in order to provide the Israelites with light and useful navigational information, etc., ever changed its path so that the expectations of the people were disappointed? Does not the Bible testify of the sun that “the sun rises, shines and sets at the appointed time” (Kohelet 1,8)? G’d reasons that if these planets which do not receive a reward for being loyal and carrying out their appointed tasks do not deviate therefrom, how much more so must the Jewish people who do receive a reward for keeping the Torah, and who do have to fear punishment for failure to keep these laws, be concerned with not deviating from the path of Torah? Keeping these thoughts in mind, Moses suggests to them: ‘better choose for yourself life.” This is the way Rashi explains our verse. This is what David had in mind when he said in Psalms 16,5: “the Lord is my allotted portion and my share; You control my fate.” It is as if David had said to G’d: “place my hand on the fate which spells ‘good.’” G’d Himself is called “Good,” as we know from Psalms 145,9: “טוב ה' לכל, “ or טוב וישר ה', (Psalms 25,8). Both verses equate G’d with “good.” G’d also gave the Jewish people the Torah, which is also known as “good,” as we know from Proverbs 4,2 כי לקח טוב נתתי לכם, “for I have given you a good acquisition.” The reason why the Torah is referred to as a “good acquisition,” is because the Jewish people can hang on to it both in this world and in the world to come. The sages cite our verse as proof for the fact that Torah will be with us in both worlds. This is the meaning of the words in Deut. 5,16: ‘in order that your days on earth will be long.” The Torah refers to a life which is long, infinite, i.e. the world to come. The last words in that verse, i.e. למען ייטב לך, “in order that He will be good for you,” also refer to a world which is totally good, the world to come. Solomon pursues the same approach when he said (Proverbs 24,25) “but those who rebuke the wicked will experience delight, blessings of good (things) will come upon them.”  The sages cite our verse as proof of the fact that Torah will be with us in both worlds. This is the meaning of the words in Deut. 5,16: “in order that your days on earth will be long.” The Torah refers to a life which is long, infinite, i.e. the world to come. The last words in that verse, i.e. למען ייטב לך, “in order that He will be good to you,” also refer to a world which is totally good, the world to come. Solomon pursues the same approach when he said (Proverbs 24,25) “but those who rebuke the wicked will experience delight, blessings of good (things) will come upon them."
30,19,Musar,"Shemirat HaLashon, Book I, The Gate of Torah 9:13","And when he reflects constantly and weighs the smallness of the reward of transgression in this world against its eternal loss, the father will certainly not pay heed to the voice of the ""whisperers"" and will choose life, to strengthen his son in the Torah of the L-rd, which is the true life, as it is written (Mishlei 3:18): ""It is a tree of life to those who hold fast to it."" And if he eats of its fruits, he lives forever, as Chazal have formulated for us in the blessing ""And eternal life did He plant in our midst."" And then he will merit eternal life, he and his seed, as it is written: ""And he will give pleasure to your soul,"" and, as it is written in the Torah (Devarim 30:19): ""And choose life, so that you live, you and your seed."""
30,19,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Genesis 43:3:1,"העד העד [THE MAN] DID SOLEMNLY PROTEST UNTO US — The Hebrew is an expression signifying warning and it is derived from the root עוד to bear witness, because a warning is, as a rule, given in the presence of witnesses. Other examples are (Jeremiah 11:7) “I earnestly forewarned (העדותי) your fathers”, and (Exodus 19:21) “Go, warn (העד) the people."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 32:1:1","That I admonish the Israelites. Rashi is answering the question: How could Moshe command the heavens? Does he rule over heaven? And a further question: Why did he take testimony against Yisroel for they had not yet sinned? Therefore he explains that “I admonish [i.e., warn] the Israelites,” as it is written above, “I invoke as witnesses (העדתי) against you this day, heaven and earth” (Devarim 30:19). This is an expression of admonishing [i.e., warning], similar to, “The man warned us repeatedly (העד העיד)” (Bereishis 43:3). For [Moshe] had not yet said anything to heaven or earth, and it is only now that he speaks to them. "
30,19,Quoting Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 32:1:4","Moshe said, “I am only mortal and tomorrow I may die, etc. If you ask: Why does Rashi in parshas Nitzovim (Devarim 30:19) offer a different reason for the verse, “I invoke, as witnesses against you this day, heaven and earth”? One can answer that above, regarding the warning, the witnesses are required to admonish the person who wants to commit the sin, in order that he will [listen to them and] not sin. If so, it is difficult [to understand], how can heaven and earth give warning? They are unable to speak! One cannot explain that Moshe warned Yisroel before heaven and earth in order that they should not sin, because at that time [when Moshe warned them] they were not intending to sin. It would have been considered a doubtful warning, which is not considered an adequate warning. Therefore Rashi explains [there] “Gaze at the heavens, etc. This type of gazing is considered as if [heaven and earth] were delivering a verbal warning. However, here in this song, [Moshe] is speaking of the punishments for Yisroel, if they transgress Hashem’s mitzvos and worship idols. And regarding punishment it is written, (Devarim 17:7) “Let the hand of the witnesses against him be first” [to punish the sinners]. Therefore [Rashi] gives a different explanation here. "
30,19,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 30:19:1","So that when evil befalls you, etc. Rashi wants to answer: They had not yet done anything [bad], so for what could they be invoked as witnesses? He explains, So that when evil befalls you, etc. I.e., they serve as witnesses to Hashem's warning. "
30,19,Commentary,"Siftei Chakhamim, Deuteronomy 30:19:2","Another interpretation of “I invoke as witnesses, etc. The Holy One, may He be blessed, said,” etc. Because according to first interpretation you might ask that it should have said, I warn you before heaven and earth, because they are to serve as witnesses to the warning. Therefore he says, Another interpretation, etc. And according to the other interpretation you might ask why the verse says העדותי which is an expression that denotes testimony or warning. Therefore he also says the first interpretation.

30,19,Musar,"Shemirat HaLashon, Book II 25:2","Until now we have spoken about setting to rights the faculty of speech, the first fundamental, the demarcation between ""man"" and ""animal,"" for which reason Scripture gives it precedence, viz. (Devarim 30:19): ""For the thing is very near to you, in your mouth and in your heart [i.e., your thoughts] to do it."" And now we shall speak a little about the faculty of thought, which resides in a man's heart, viz.: ""and in your heart to do it."" Scripture writes (Psalms 24:3-4): ""Who shall ascend the mountain of the L-rd, etc.? …The clean of hands [i.e., one who is clean of theft] and the pure of heart."" We learn from this that a man's thoughts must be pure and not intermixed with vanity. We say every day: ""Make our hearts one, to love and to fear Your name, and let us not be ashamed, forever."" This means what it says. It is known that what resides in a Jew's heart always, is faith in the L-rd, the G-d of the heavens and His Torah, this being the essence of holiness [as intimated in Bamidbar 35:39: ""I am the L-rd who dwells in the midst of the children of Israel.""] For this reason we ask the Blessed L-rd that He make our hearts one, to love and to fear His name, and that there not be intermixed in this another love. For if in his heart, the locus of thought, there also is planted a love for the vanities of the world, in the end, he will be shamed and mortified by it forever. For it is known that all of a man's affairs — both his acts and his thoughts, all will ascend above, before the L-rd, as we say in the Rosh Hashanah prayer: ""For the remembrance of every creation comes before You, the acts of a man, etc., the thoughts of a man and his stratagems."" And all will be set forth before the man, as it is written (Psalms 54:21): ""I shall reprove you and I shall set it before your eyes,"" and the man will be greatly shamed."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,Or HaChaim on Leviticus 16:1:16,"This is the meaning of the extra letter ו in בקרבתם לפני ה׳ ו־ימותו. The Torah alludes to the fact that though these righteous people felt that they were approaching an area which would result in this ""kiss of death"" they did not flinch and kept getting closer. They attained a state of religious intoxication. The desire of their souls to fuse with the divine was so overpowering that they no longer made decisions in which their powers of conscious perception were involved. If we were to evaluate part of the emotional process these people underwent, perhaps the following may help. There are times when certain people feel such an overpowering hatred for someone that they will abandon all restraining influences in the desire to exercise their revenge even while they are subconsciously aware that they are forfeiting their very lives by the act of revenge. This may be the mystical dimension of what appears as licentious behaviour by prophets in Samuel I 19. There is a mystifying verse in Samuel I 19,24 which tells of Saul's pursuit of David and the religious experiences first experienced by the messengers despatched to capture David who at that time was in the proximity of the prophet Samuel and other prophets. All the messengers are reported as being overcome by an aura of religious experiences of these prophets. Eventually, the same happened to Saul himself. He is described as having divested himself of his clothing and remained naked [symbol of the desire to abandon the restrictions imposed on man by his body, Ed.] for a whole day in the presence of the prophet Samuel. Perhaps that verse affords us an inkling of the result of overpowering emotions of hatred. When we think of the other extreme of man's emotional range, his love for his source, i.e. his Creator, and the overpowering desire to be united with that source, we may have an inkling of what possessed Nadav and Avihu at the time. Basically speaking, we are dealing with the natural abhorrence each soul has for the need to be imprisoned inside a mere body. It is always the soul's desire to escape this body. Nadav and Avihu's souls experienced such an urge in an unusual manner. [At this point the author describes how a person may arrive at progressively purer insights due to his mind's ability to triumph over the impeding element of self, ego. Eventually, such a person will view ""life"" itself in an entirely new light such as hinted at by Moses in Deut. 30 19 when he exhorts the Jewish people to ""choose life."" The letter ב at the beginning of the word ב־חיים, is understood to refer to a life devoid of what he calls הרגש הכללי, emotions felt by all normal human beings. The author blesses the Lord for having granted selected individuals the ability to rise to such spiritual heights. Ed.]"
30,19,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:19:3,"We must understand terms such as ""good"" and ""evil"" to refer to life in this world. It makes sense therefore that Moses told the people: ""I place before you life and death,"" i.e. reward and punishment in this world. If the Israelites would be good they would live, if they would sin they would die. These are the two choices we have in this world."
30,19,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:19:4,"However, there are two more choices which pertain to the hereafter. Moses calls them ברכה and קללה, respectively, i.e. ""blessing or curse."" These are not immediate choices, or better, the results of such choices will not become known immediately. The whole approach is similar to what we have in Deut. 28,6: ""You are blessed at your arrival (in this world) and you are blessed at your departure (from this world)."" As you enter this world without sin so you will leave it without sin (compare Baba Metzia 107). Moses had to separate these two paragraphs from one another in order for us to appreciate that he talks about different domains in each paragraph."
30,19,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:19:5,"When he continues ""and you shall choose life,"" this is the purpose of our existence in this world. Moses means that we should concentrate on immediate problems such as making sure that G'd will grant the necessary rainfall as a result of our observing the commandments."
30,19,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:19:6,"Although earlier (verse 15) Moses mentioned חיים וטוב together, i.e. a reference to choices covering both our terrestrial life and preparing for our hereafter, in our verse here the emphasis is on the here and now."
30,19,Musar,"Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Terumah, Torah Ohr 15","Why was it important for the Tabernacle to be equal in significance to heaven and earth? Just as heaven and earth have been cited as witnesses against Israel when the latter did not observe Torah (Deut.30,19), so the Tabernacle acts as witness on behalf of Israel as per the first verse in Parshat Pekudey ""These are the ""pledges"" of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of Testimony"" (Exodus 38,21). This is the reason Psalms 26,8 speaks of ""I love Your temple abode, the dwelling- place of Your glory."""
30,19,Musar,Sha'arei Teshuvah 3:17,"And know that there are sublime virtues given over in the positive commandments such as: The virtues of free choice, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:19), “and choose life”; and the virtues of Torah study, as it is stated  (Deuteronomy 6:7), “and you shall speak about them;” and the virtues of walking in the ways of the Lord, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 28:9), “and you shall walk in His ways;” and the virtues of contemplation of the greatness of the Lord, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 4:39), “Know therefore this day and keep in mind that the Lord alone is God in heaven above and on earth below; there is no other,” and David said (Psalms 14:2), “The Lord looks down from heaven on mankind to find a man of understanding, a man who seeks God”; and the virtues of remembrance of His kindnesses,” as it is stated (Deuteronomy 8:2), “Remember the whole way,” and it is [also] stated (Deuteronomy 8:6), “And you shall know that the Lord your God disciplines you just as a man disciplines his son,” and David said (Psalms 107:43), “he will contemplate the kindnesses of the Lord,” and said (Psalms 26:3), “For Your kindness is across from my eyes”; and the virtues of holiness, as it is stated (Leviticus 11:44), “and you shall sanctify yourselves and you shall be holy”; and the virtues of worship, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 10:20), “and He shall you worship;” and the virtues of fear, as it is stated  (Deuteronomy 10:20), “And you shall fear the Lord”; and the virtues of love, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 6:5), “And you shall love the Lord, your God;” and the virtues of clinging, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 10:20), ”to Him shall you cling.” There are several levels to each of these, as will be explained, with God’s help. And man was created for the sake of these virtues, as it is stated (Isaiah 43:7), “All who are linked to My name, whom I have created for My glory.” And what is the hope of a creation if it does not make the things for which it was created, the toil of his soul and his main occupation?

Afterwards Israel is destined to say: But You have already written (Jeremiah 3:1) ""If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man, can he return to her again?"" He: Did I not write ""a man""? And have I not already told you (Hoshea 11:9) ""for I am G-d, and not a man!"" And have I divorced you, house of Israel? Is it not already written (Isaiah 50:1) ""Where is your mother's bill of divorce by which I sent her away, or to which of My creditors have I sold you!"""

30,19,Midrash,Sifrei Devarim 53:1,"(Devarim 11:26) ""Behold, I set before you this day blessing and curse"": Because it is written (Ibid. 30:19) ""The life and the death have I set before you, the blessing and the curse,"" lest Israel say: Since the Holy One Blessed be He has set before us two ways, the way of life and the way of death, we can choose whichever we wish; it is, therefore, written (Ibid.) ""and you shall choose the life, you and your seed."" An analogy: A man is sitting at the crossroads, with two paths stretching before him, one, whose beginning is level and whose end is thorns, and one whose beginning is thorns and whose end is level. He apprises the passersby: This path whose beginning you see to be level — for two or three steps you will walk on level ground, and, in the end, on thorns. And this path whose beginning you see to be thorny — for two or three steps you will walk in thorns, and in the end you will walk on level ground. Thus did Moses speak to Israel: You see the wicked prospering — For two or three days they will prosper in this world, and in the end, they will be cast away, as it is written (Proverbs 24:20) ""For there is no (good) end for the wicked one,"" and (Koheleth 4:1) ""Behold, the tears of the oppressed (in Gehinnom).""

30,19,Jewish Thought,"With God in Hell, 7 To Live or to Survive 21","Whereas Des Pres’ insights are born out by the nature and history of Western civilization, they have no meaning within the context of Judaism. Some of the key passages of the Torah affirm the ultimate value of life. For instance: “See I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil…I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed.” (Deuteronomy 30:15–19.)  Or, in another passage: “Ye, shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them…” (Leviticus 18:5.)  The rabbis in the Talmud interpret the last words to mean that one must live by God’s commandments, and not die because of them. (T.B. Sanhedrin 74a.) "
30,19,Jewish Thought,"With God in Hell, 9 Now We Know 72","The prototype of the hero in Western civilization is Ajax. According to Homer in the Iliad, when the advance of the Greeks was halted by mist and darkness, Ajax prayed alone to Zeus that he send light for the battle to continue, even if light should bring defeat and death. Centuries later, Longimus in his On the Sublime commented: “That is the true attitude of an Ajax. He does not pray for life for such a petition would have ill beseemed a hero.” (This reference to Longimus we owe to Des Pres, The Survivor, p. 164.)  The hero does not pray for life, nor does he fear death, because the battle itself is the cause; it comprehends all the glory of a man. Bravery here is paralleled by degradation of the value of life. Heroism in Western civilization found its expression mainly in war and bloodshed, and has its ultimate hidden roots in contempt for life. Another manifestation of this, perhaps, subconscious contempt for life may be seen in the duel that until recently was the only means by which a “gentleman” was able to retrieve his honor following an insult. The Jew who finds his values in Judaism is not impressed by Ajax, nor by the host of heroes who have followed in his footsteps. He prays to God unashamedly for life. From his point of view, duelling because of an insult is sheer barbarism. Halakhically, the victorious partner in a duel is a murderer, but not even the loser is free from the guilt of having placed his life in jeopardy, not to mention the fact that he, too, was attempting to kill another human being. As we saw earlier, the very purpose of the Torah is that man should live by God’s commandments and not die by them. The Bible commands the Jew “and thou shalt choose life.” (Deuteronomy 30:19.)  Not only is he forbidden to commit suicide or even to mutilate or violate his body, he may not even curse himself. (T.B. Bava Kama 90b; Shevu’ot 36a.)  Life is precious as God’s creation. Though man has been entrusted with it, it is not his private property. Man does not own life; but he is responsible for it, even for the life of an adversary."
30,20,Jewish Thought,"Major Themes in Modern Philosophies of Judaism, CHAPTER 2; Franz Rosenzweig's Philosophy of Judaism 2:8","One of the keys to Rosenzweig’s inability to recognize the historical reality of Israel can be found in a short sentence to which we had occasion to refer earlier in our presentation of his ideas: “As life becomes sanctified it is no longer alive.” (Ibid., p. 55 [ibid., p. 303].)  We can hardly think of a statement less characteristic of Judaism than these words of Rosenzweig. According to him the sanctification is effected by the eternal law. A number of statements are made about the law in the third part of Der Stern, but only one aspect of the law is actually discussed and interpreted: its ritual aspect in the limited sense in which it found expression in the holy days of the Jewish year and in its liturgical formulation. But it is not in this extremely narrow sense that one can grasp the essential nature of the law. In fact, there is no safer way of missing the essential quality and purpose of the law than by trying to explain them within such a very limited and artificial frame. The law is all-embracing. It comprehends every aspect of the life of the individual as well as that of the entire Jewish people. It regulates all interhuman relationships; it lays down the principles of an economic and social order; it provides the constitution of a state—its judicial system, its civil and criminal laws. Its significance lies in the fact that it deals with the temporal life of the Jew and of the Jewish people. Its whole purpose is to give meaning and direction to the daily life of the Jew. It aims at life, this life, in time and history. Can one doubt it, for instance, in the light of the words in Deuteronomy? (Deuteronomy, 30, 19–20.)  “I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed; to love the Lord thy God, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave unto Him; for that is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.” The emphasis is forever on life on this earth in the world’s time. “Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep to walk therein: I am the Lord your God. Ye shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them….” (Leviticus, 18: 4–5.)  The rabbis comment on it: “… that he shall live by them and not that he shall die by them.” (Talmud Babli, Yoma, 87/B.) "
30,19,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Isaiah 1:2:1,"Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth And Moses said, “Give ear, O heavens,...and may the earth hear” (Deut. 32:1). Why did Isaiah change the wording? Our masters taught concerning this matter, [and] many midrashim [are] in the section entitled “Ha’azinu” in Sifrei, but the Sages disagreed with them and said: A matter is not so unless witnesses come and testify. If their words coincide, their testimony is fulfilled; if not, their testimony is not fulfilled. Had Isaiah not addressed the heavens with giving ear and the earth with hearing, the heavens would testify and say, ‘When we were called to this testimony in Moses’ time, when he said, (Deut. 30:19) “I call heaven and earth to witness against you,” we heard with an expression of giving ear,’ and the earth would testify, ‘I was called with an expression of hearing,’ hence their testimony would not coincide. [Therefore,] Isaiah came and reversed the matter. Consequently, both are found to testify with an expression of giving ear and with an expression of hearing."

He returns to exhort them yet again, to tell them that there are two courses in their hands and it is in their power to walk in whichever they desire, and there is no power below or above that will withhold them or stop them. And he calls heaven and earth to bear witness against them a second time, (Further, Verse 19.)  after he had said,I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish, (Above, 4:26.)  for now he said, I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death (Further, Verse 19.)  which are the blessing and the curse, and that I have counselled you that you should choose life, that hou mayest live, thou and thy seed.

Rebbi Aqiba says, also to teach him to swim in water.” To circumcise him, “on the eighth day, he shall circumcise the flesh of his foreskin. (Lev. 12:3. The masculine form of the verb implies that the father, who otherwise is not mentioned in the paragraph, is obligated to circumcise his son.) ” “To redeem him,” as is written: “Any firstborn human among your sons you shall redeem. (Ex. 13:13.) ” To teach him Torah, “you shall teach them to your sons. (Deut. 11:19. Cf. Berakhot 2:3. Note 110, where the verse is quoted to show that daughters do not have to be instructed in Torah (Babli 29b).) ” To teach him a trade, Rebbi Ismael stated: “Choose life (Deut. 30:19.) ,” that is a trade. To marry him to a wife, “make it known to your children and grandchildren (Deut. 4:9.) .” When do you have children and grandchildren: if you marry off your sons when young. Rebbi Aqiba says, also to swim in water. “That you shall live together with your descendants (Deut. 30:19.) .” How is this? Is it a commandment (A meritorious deed.)  or is it obligatory? Let us hear from the following: Bar Tarima came to Rebbi Immi and said to him, talk to my father that he should marry me to a woman. He talked to [the father], but the latter refused. That means it is a commandment, for if it were obligatory, he should have forced him. From where that if his father did not do these things for him, he is required to do them himself? The verse says a human you shall redeem (Ex. 13:13.) ”, “you shall circumcise” them (Gen. 17:11.) , “you shall study them (Deut. 4:9; reading וְלָמַדְתֶּם instead of וְלִמַּדְתֶּם.) ”, “you shall know (Deut. 4:9.) ” yourself, “that you shall live (Deut. 30:19.) .” (The Babli, 29a–30a, in most cases quotes different verses to the same effects.)

34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,19,Chasidut,Shivchei HaRan 25:4,"Reading these accounts, a person with any intelligence will realize that even the Rebbe faced such frustrations and difficulties. But he went through everything and was able to surmount all. The Rebbe truly desired to be a servant of God. He truly chose life (cf. Deuteronomy 30:19), and in this way, was worthy of his great attainments."
30,19,Halakhah,Sefer Chasidim 31:1,"At all times you should love your Creator with all your heart and all your soul and take counsel with your heart and a lesson from man who is but worms; if a person gives you ten gold pieces or more, how deeply engraved would his love be in your heart. And if he provides your support and the support of your children and of your household you would certainly think, “This man which I have never seen and who has extended to me such kindness I would not be able to repay for all the goodness he has shown me should I live a thousand years. I would love him with all my heart and with all my soul; he could not command me to do anything that I would not do for him, because both my wealth and my being are his.” As with the love of man so with the love of the Holy One, blessed be He, raised and exalted be His fame. It is He who gives sustenance to all, how much better that we should cleave to the love of the Creator, fear Him, nor transgress His commands whether great or small. For we do not know the reward of each commandment, (Aboth 2:1.)  and the punishment for transgressions though they appear light in our eyes, as it is written, “When the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about” (Ps. 49:6). The transgressions to which a man becomes habituated in this world will encompass him on the Day of Judgement. (Abodah Zarah 18a.)  If he is deserving his good deeds will bear witness for him. (Ibid., 2a.)  True and firm it is that we are not to transgress the commandments of our Creator even one of the small ones for a house full of gold and silver. If an individual says, “I will transgress a commandment and with the gold and silver they give me I will fulfill the difficult commandments. With this I will support the poor, invite wayfarers, I will do very many favors.” These are all futile thoughts, for perhaps soon after the transgression he will die and not succeed to the gift. Moreover, if he should not die the money would soon be dissipated so that he dies in his sin. Come and see how much you should love your Creator who does wonderful kindnesses with you, He creates you from a decayed drop, He gives you a soul, draws you forth from the belly, then gives you a mouth with which to speak, a heart to understand, ears to hear the pure words of His mouth, which are refined as silver and pure gold. It is He who leads you on the face of earth, who gives sustenance to all, who causes death and gives life to all. In His hand are the souls of all the living. It is He who distributes your share of bread. What is there to say? for the mouth is unable to speak, the ear unable to hear, for to Him all praise is as silence, there is no end to the length of His days, His years will have no end, He is the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be His name and His fame. It is He who has created the heavens and earth, sea, and all that is therein. He is the provider of all, for His eyes are open upon all men’s paths recompensing each according to his ways and the fruit of his deeds, whether good or bad. Behold it is He who sets forth before men two paths, the path of life and the path of death and says to you, “Choose life” (Deut. 30:19). In spite of all this, we who are filled with worms do not think and do not set our hearts but to fill our appetites freely. We do not think that man’s days are numbered, (Job 7:1.)  today he is here, tomorrow in the grave, (Berakoth 28b.)  that suddenly he dies. For no man rules over his spirit (This refers to the breath of life, actual breathing.)  retaining it (forever). Therefore it is good for man to remove himself from all appetites and direct his heart to love and fear the Lord with all his heart at all times and to revile the life of vanity. For we will not be able to humble ourselves and subdue our passion which thrusts us from the land of the living, except through subduing our heart and returning to our Maker in complete repentance, to serve Him and to do His will with a whole heart. Our sages have said, “Bread and salt shalt thou eat and water in measurement shall you drink  (Aboth 6:4.)  and beware of gazing at women which drives a person from the world. (Ibid., 4:28.)  Love humans (Ibid., 1:12.)  and judge all people in the scale of merit.” (Ibid., 1:6.)  And this is what the Torah has said, “ But in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor” (Lev. 19:15). Be humble before all, busy yourself with Torah, which is whole, pure and upright and do not praise yourself for it, because for this were you created. (Ibid., 2:9.) "
30,19,Halakhah,"From Sinai to Ethiopia, Shulhan haOrit; The Halakhah of Ethiopian Jewry, Then and Now, 3 Shabbat 11:7","Humans are responsible for life. Individuals must preserve their own lives and guard them from any danger, and also guard the lives of others from danger, protect them and save them from any harm. “For the blood of the murdered is not the property of the blood redeemer – it is the property of God.” (Rambam, Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot Rotzeah 1:4.)  “Our Sages forbade many matters because they involve a threat to life. Whenever a person transgresses these guidelines, saying: ‘I will risk my life, what does this matter to others,’ or ‘I am not careful about these things,’ he should be punished by whipping for rebelliousness.” (Ibid., 11:5.)  This concept is clearly emphasized in the Torah itself: “I call heaven and earth to witness [that I have warned] you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your offspring” (Deuteronomy 30:19); and “You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them. I am the Lord” (Leviticus 18:5). The Sages explained, “The mitzvot were given so that we would live by them, as it says, ‘which if a man do, he shall live by them’ – this means we should not die because of them.” (Tosefta, Shabbat 15:17.)  The laws of saving a life were determined according to the Jewish principle “Saving a life takes precedence over the entire Torah.” The Jerusalem Talmud states, “A person who [administers treatment] quickly is praiseworthy, and one who raises questions is considered as if he shed blood.” (Jerusalem Talmud, Yoma 8:5.)  The Rambam, who usually writes succinctly, chose to comment at length on this source:"

And so too with Yehudah, even though he separated himself and worked in the West which is [called] Night, the rest of the travels of his tents were turned to the East, which is [called] Day.

He said to them, he may teach him at an hour that is neither day nor night as it is written (Jos. 1:8): “You shall meditate about it day and night.” If it is so, a man would be forbidden to teach a profession to his son since it is written: “You shall meditate about it day and night.” But Rebbi Ismael stated (Deut. 30:19): “Choose life!” That refers to a profession (Since only a profession will sustain a person; otherwise he will be forced to become a robber and commit capital crimes.) .

And the Holy One Blessed be He made this (Ha'azinu) song a witness, viz. (Devarim 31:19) ""so that this song be for Me a witness in the children of Israel."" He said: The sun will be witness for them below, and I, above. And whence is it derived that G-d is called ""a swift witness""? From (Malachi 3:5) ""And I will draw near to you in judgment, and I will be a swift witness,"" and (Jeremiah 29:23) ""and I am the one who knows and bears witness,"" and (Michah 1:2) ""and the L-rd G-d will be a witness against you."""

I ask that you shall choose life, so that you and your descendants will live. Life, goodness, and a blessing are all one option, in contrast to death, evil, and a curse. I present you with both paths, but I want you to choose the positive option."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,"The Jonathan Sacks Haggadah, Nirtzah, Chad Gadya 1:1","ONE LITTLE GOAT That we end one of Judaism’s most sacred rituals with a children’s song tells us much about what sustained Judaism as a faith for longer, under more arduous circumstances, than any other heritage in the West. The Jewish love of children means that Jews look forward to the future even more than we look back to the past. Just as we began the seder with the questions of a child, so we conclude it with a nursery rhyme, reminding ourselves that what sustains a faith is not strength or power, but its ability to inspire successive generations of children to add their voices to their people’s song. The song itself, disarming in its simplicity, teaches the great truth of Jewish hope: that though many nations (symbolized by the cat, the dog, and so on) attacked Israel (the “goat”), each in turn has vanished into oblivion. At the end of days God will vanquish the angel of death and inaugurate a world of life and peace, the two great Jewish loves. Perhaps, too, there is deeper symbolism. The kid eaten by the cat reminds us of the story of Joseph, sold into slavery. His brothers then slaughtered a kid, dipped Joseph’s coat in its blood, and showed it to their father to persuade him that Joseph had been killed by a wild animal. Outwardly, Jacob accepted their story. However, the Torah says that “he refused to be comforted” (Gen. 37:35). Jewish law states that there is a limit to the period of mourning. Why, then, did Jacob say he would never be comforted? A profound rabbinic commentary explains that there is a time limit to mourning only when one is sure someone has died. Jacob, however, never gave up believing there was a chance, however slim, that Joseph was still alive. His refusal to be comforted was a refusal to give up hope, and in the end it was justified. Joseph was still alive, and he and his father were eventually reunited. Ḥad Gadya expresses the Jewish refusal to give up hope. Though history is full of man’s inhumanity to man – dog bites cat, stick hits dog – that is not the final verse. The Haggada ends with the death of death in eternal life, a fitting end for the story of a people dedicated to Moses’ great command, “Choose life” (Deut. 30:19)."
30,19,Jewish Thought,"The Jonathan Sacks Haggadah; Essays, One Little Goat 33","So, having earlier expressed the Jewish hope, “Next year in Jerusalem rebuilt,” we end the seder night with the universal hope that the angel of death will one day be defeated by the long-overdue realization that God is life; that worshipping God means sanctifying life; that God’s greatest command is “Choose life” (Deut. 30:19); that we bring God into the world by reciting a blessing over life."

Published in Britain as Radical Then, Radical Now: The Legacy of the World’s Oldest Religion (London: HarperCollins, 2001).)  But I also believe a large part of the answer lies in what Moses himself said at the end of his address: “I call heaven and earth as witnesses that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore, choose life, that you and your children may live” (Deut. 30:19)."
30,19,Chasidut,"Sefat Emet, Deuteronomy, Nitzavim 1:3","“I call on the Heavens and earth to testify” (Devarim 30:19). Rashi explains that just as the Heavens and earth consistently follow their natural order, we are commanded to behave properly. This comparison seems challenging since the Heavens and earth lack free choice, unlike humans influenced by their evil inclination. However, the natural order is to follow Hashem and His commandments. Man, with the additional challenge of a negative inclination, can still naturally be drawn to the good if he overcomes this drive, just like the rest of creation. This concept clarifies Tehillim 62:13, “To you Hashem is kindness for you repay man according to his deeds.” The Gemara (Rosh HaShana 17b) questions if this implies kindness or judgment. The answer is that when a person does good, it is due to Hashem. By choosing to avoid the evil inclination, a person awakens the inner goodness implanted by Hashem. Therefore, all good deeds are ultimately the kindness of Hashem."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,Da'at Zekenim on Deuteronomy 32:1:1,"האזינו השמים ואדברה, “hearken o heavens and I will speak;” Moses, when addressing heaven and earth mentioned the word האזינו, addressing the ears of heavens first, whereas Isaiah when doing so in Isaiah 1,2 mentioned the word שמיעה, hearing first. The reason is that Moses’ primary field of activity was with heaven, he was close to it and did not need to worry about the ability of the heavens to hear him, but needed their attention to his words. Isaiah being closer to earth than to heaven had to proceed in the reverse order, first making sure that witnesses’ ears were open, before worrying about gaining their undivided attention. When someone is close to the one who addresses him, all he needs to do to get the message is turn his ears in the source of the sound’s direction. A person who is far from the speaker needs to insure first that he is heard, before worrying that what he says will be heard and understood. According to Rashi, (in his commentary on Isaiah) the reason for the opposite approaches taken between Moses and Isaiah is that both heaven and earth are witnesses, (compare Deut. 30,19) seeing they will be around as long as any Israelites exist, they had to be addressed as such in similar terms, i.e. both as hearing and hearkening, (paying attention to what they hear) otherwise each could claim that they were only witnesses to part of what had been demanded of them. Rav Hunna, quoting Rav Acha, claims that from the wording it is clear that there are more witnesses in heaven than on earth, seeing that Moses addresses heaven in the plural mode, האזינו, whereas he addresses earth in the singular mode, ותשמע. Isaiah followed the same pattern he had read about in the Torah, i.e. plural mode for heaven, and singular mode for earth."
30,19,Commentary,"Chizkuni, Deuteronomy 30:19:1","העידותי בכם היום את השמים ואת הארץ, “I call as witness against you this day both heaven and earth;” witness in the positive as well as in the negative sense of the word. If you will perform the commandments in the Torah heaven and earth will testify on your behalf; if not, they will testify at the heavenly tribunal against you. They will do this by heaven denying the essential rain to make your crops ripen. (Deut. 11,17)"
30,19,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 93:1:7,"Our Parshah addresses itself to this very problem. The way to salvation is the straight and narrow, whereas the alternative is threefold. ""The blessing, that you listen to the commandments of the Lord your G'd."" (11,26) However, the curse ""you do not listen, you depart from the path- to follow other deities whom you have not known."" (11,28) At Sinai we were given three imperatives. "" anochi, I am the Lord; lo yihyeh, have no other deities; zachor et yom hashabbat lekadsho, remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. It is these three commandments that remind us that there is a hashgachah peratit, personal Divine Providence that guides our lives here on earth. Ever since Eve had sinned, true freedom has been denied man since the yetzer hara, evil temptation has gained entry into man through her to all subsequent generations, leaving us with less than a fifty-fifty chance to totally defeat the temptation to do evil. But now, after Sinai, that chance had been restored. This is the meaning of Rabbi Eleazar who said that from now on we are the architects of our own evil if we choose the wrong path. Between the time of Eve and Sinai, men were fatalists to whom doing good made no sense, since they were convinced that history was decreed and the future unalterable. As long as the belief existed that all had been pre-ordained, all good and evil emanated from Heaven. Only when the Jewish people were disabused of the idea that all had been pre-ordained, did good and evil, reward and punishment truly become man's choice. The reversal in man's fatalistic outlook on life began with Abraham, of course. In our Parshah, G'd not only offers the choice, but almost makes sure that we make the right choice by telling us to choose life. (chapter 30) All of mankind may be viewed as guests at G'ds table. Because of the special relationship that exists between Israel and G'd, the former is offered a choice portion by having its attention directed towards it without depriving Israel of the ultimate decision of what to opt for. ""You shall choose!"" (Deut.30,19) The public declaration at Mount Gerizim and Mount Eyvol immediately following the conquest of the land, point to the urgency of assimilating this lesson especially in the land of Israel, which, since it is under the unceasing surveillance of G'd will not long tolerate non observance of the mitzvot. This is in contrast to Egypt, where pursuit of a hedonistic way of life went unpunished for long periods of time. The first task is destruction of all vestiges of idol worship remaining. Therefore, (12,2) ""destroy utterly all the places that served as centres of idol worship."" Next comes the need to establish a central place of worship, to minimise the opportunities for any deviationist movements within Judaism. At any rate the message is that it is not man who chooses where he wants to worship, but G'd determines where and when He can be successfully prayed to. After that, the Torah limits sacrificial service to the central site of worship, and states that only certain types of animals will be acceptable as potential sacrifices. In this way, many abominations practiced by the pagans were eliminated as a form of worship, foremost among them child sacrifice. Since a great part of the animal offerings were concentrated on the various holy days that involved pilgrimage to the temple by all males, the Torah stresses that on such joyous occasions the less fortunate must not be forgotten, and must be made to share in these expressions of joy. For that reason, the Levite, the stranger, (convert to Judaism), the widow and the orphan are especially mentioned. Since the true measure of acknowledging G'd lies in one's appreciation of G'ds tremendous generosity to man, man can reflect this pious feeling only by extending his own generosity towards the less fortunate in his society. In order to underscore the serious nature of the sin of idol worship, the Torah reminds us once more that the former inhabitants of Canaan were dispossessed and destroyed because they indulged in these abominable practices. Not only was their philosophy faulty, even their deeds were corrupt, involving sacrificing their own children. We are asked not even to investigate their actions or to enquire into the reasons underlying their philosophy. A second danger the Jewish people may be faced with in their new home, is the call of the false prophet to deviate from the path of tradition. Coming as it does from someone who may have acquired the reputation of being a prophet, such danger is very real indeed. The Torah warns that the surfacing of such people advocating practices inimical to normative Judaism is a test of our faith in G'd, our loyalty, and must be reacted to a such. The third danger, and by far the most difficult to combat, is seduction by one's intimate friends and relatives. (13,7) ""When your brother, son or daughter tries to seduce you, privately, saying let us worship other deities that you have not known."" We are warned to ignore sentiments of protectiveness for the welfare of family in such cases, and to bring such people to justice. We must not corrupt our sense of pity by applying it to the undeserving. Only when we do not abuse feelings of mercy, pity etc. can we in turn expect the Almighty to employ His sense of pity, mercy etc. when we are in need of it. When G'd sees that we deal with cities in which idol worship has become rampant, according to Torah law, then His wrath that such things have been allowed to happen can be assuaged. Actually, display of sympathy for the corrupt few is equivalent to subjecting the majority to their evil machinations. Cruelty,- if such it be- must be reserved for use against unrepentant sinners. G'ds purpose in educating us, is to eliminate negative character traits and elevate us to a level of banim attem tashem elokeychem, you are true children of the Lord your G'd. We would almost cease to be beney adam, ""sons of man,"" and become ""sons of G'd"" instead. The fact that the Jewish people or G'd are referred to as children, daughter, mother and sister in their reciprocal relationship in various places in the Bible, indicates that the intimacy of such relationship undergoes changes. Psalms 45,11, speaks of ""hearken daughter and see!."" Song of Songs 3,11, speaks of ""the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding."" Song of Songs 4,12 speaks of ""My sister is like a fenced in garden."" The relationship between Israel and its G'd is one that should become progressively more intimate. For these reasons, ""do not make incisions on yourselves,"" is to remind us that the loss of human relatives notwithstanding, the continued presence of G'd, who represents to us all the above listed human relationships, must help us put any personal grief over the loss of dear ones into its proper perspective, and not to ""cut ourselves up"" over such loss. When members of one's family die,- seeing that theirs was the same relationship with G'd as ours-, He has suffered a loss similar to ours, and it is not fitting therefore for us to disfigure ourselves as a sign of mourning. ""Do not make a bald spot on your forehead."" (14, 1)This is the true meaning of the verse ""for you are a holy nation to the Lord your G'd."" (14,2) See our commentary in Parshat Emor. The reason this legislation follows that of the ir hanidachat, the city of idol worshippers that has to be destroyed, is to remind us that inflicting wounds upon one's body in mourning, for people who died as a result of punishment for such sins as idol worship, is just as wrong as treating such people with less than the full force of the law. Finally, to reinforce the holy character of the Jewish people, and to insure their continued adherence to Torah standards, the legislation concerning forbidden foods is appended. "
30,19,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 62:1:13,"The sacrifices that the metzora has to offer upon being cured, consist of birds. Their incessant chirping comes to an end only when they die. This procedure is symbolic of the person who needs to atone for having abused the gift of speech. The reason that two birds have to be offered is because speech is basically welcome only for two purposes: a) to study and teach Torah, b) to earn one's livelihood. Also the commandment to use an earthen vessel has symbolic meaning. The letters (chet-resh-shin) are the same as in the word for ""deaf/mute,"" i.e. ""silent."" The need for spring water contrasts with the silent, the deaf. The bubbling of the water is the opposite, conceptually speaking, of the inert clay vessel. "
30,19,Chasidut,Chovat HaTalmidim 8:7,"And behold that the entire ability of the Jew to expel the evil from inside himself, to change himself from bad to good and to rejuvenate himself comes from the free will that God has given to us. The beasts and animals are compelled in their deeds, their thoughts and in everything that pertains to them. God gave free will to man, so that he can choose the path of life or, God forbid, the opposite. And like a merciful Father, He requests from each of us to ""choose life, in order that you should live"" (Deuteronomy 30:19). But a person who wants to [truly] choose one of two paths must be above and beyond them. The Midrash (Bereishit Rabbah 22:6) says, ""Fortunate is the man who is above his transgressions. Woe to the man whose transgressions are above him."" Can a drunkard decide to choose the good, and make up his mind to no longer get drunk, when he is still drunk? The mind of the one choosing is confounded with the wine; and his spirit is confused by it. With what will a man overcome to choose the holy path, if his essence is that of the animal spirit that sinks downwards, if his intellect is full of the biases of his evil impulse and if he understands the bad to be good, and the good to be bad? Hence a person is required to - at least occasionally - be above his transgressions, his evil impulse, his biases and the whole world. And at the moment of such elevation and purity, he will see and feel in himself that he is a Jew that is close to God; and that his childish deeds, his silliness, his evil impulse and its inclinations are a snake and a viper. So on his own, he will be embarrassed and afraid and will say, ""Oy, how contemptible and disgusting I am with all of these [bad] character traits and this lowly silliness that is with me! Oy, how can can I cut off myself - and the root of my ancestors, the Jewish soul within me - from the Source of Life and Holiness, and fling myself into a nest of snake and vipers, a place of rot and death, God forbid?"" His entire being will [then] shake and his entire being will tremble. He will redouble his efforts with all of his strength and shake off his spirit and body from the slime and snakes that are wrapped around him. He will overcome and choose a life of purity and Godly holiness from now on. And do you, Jewish young man, not also feel this on the day that you study with consistency and pray with concentration - according to your ability - and at times when you approach holiness a little: You are embarrassed about your silliness and it seems polluted to you; and then it becomes easier to control yourself and to straighten your entire being. And this is what we said to you, that raising yourself up is not [an optional matter] that is only for the great tzaddikim. Rather everyone - according to his situation - is required to elevate his entire being, at least periodically from time to time."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, Ki Tavo, The Greatest Challenge 12","It is not so – so Moses pleads with all the eloquence at his disposal. This faith I have communicated to you from heaven, he says, is not a religion of tragedy, a melody scored in the minor key, a story written in tears, a lament. It is a celebration of life. Time and again he emphasises: “These are the commands you shall do and live by them” (Lev. 18:5); “All of you who hold fast to God are alive today” (Deut. 4:4); “I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life” (Deut. 30:19)."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, Nitzavim, Why Be Jewish? 2","In dramatic fashion, Moses assembles the people, all the people – leaders, tribes, elders, officials, children, wives, and strangers in the camp, from woodcutter to water-drawer – to renew the covenant prior to their entry into the land. He warns them solemnly that their future depends on their faithfulness to it. If they break it, they will suffer defeat, devastation, and exile. Yet even then, the covenant and its promise would remain. Even in the midst of dispersion and dislocation, if the people return to God He will return to them and cause them to return to their land. The choice will always be theirs. Therefore, “Choose life, that you and your children may live” (Deut. 30:19)."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Deuteronomy; Renewal of the Sinai Covenant, Nitzavim, The Fourteenth Principle of Faith 56","The prooftext for the fourteenth principle comes from Parashat Nitzavim. It appears at the climax of Moses’ great challenge to the next generation: “This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. Therefore choose life, that you and your children may live” (Deut. 30:19)."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Genesis; The Book of the Beginnings, Lech Lecha, The Long Walk to Freedom 20","Fundamental to the Torah are two freedoms: the freedom of God and the freedom of human beings. God is not, in Judaism, an impersonal force. He acts, whether in creation, revelation or redemption, not on the basis of necessity but of choice. In choosing to make mankind in His own image, He endowed us too, with choice. There is no such thing as fate or predestination. “I call heaven and earth to witness,” said Moses, “that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life” (Deuteronomy 30:19)."
30,19,Quoting Commentary,"Covenant and Conversation; Leviticus; The Book of Holiness, Bechukotai, The Politics of Responsibility 22","This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses.

30,19,Tanakh,"Covenant and Conversation Family Edition, Nitzavim, In a Nutshell 1","IN A NUTSHELL In Nitzavim, Moshe brings the entire people together – leaders, tribes, elders, officials, children, women, and strangers – to renew their commitment to the covenant before they enter the land of Israel. He also warns them that their future depends on whether they keep the covenant. If they break it, they will suffer defeat, destruction, and exile. But even then, Hashem will still keep His promises. Even during exile, if the people find their way back to God, He will return to them and bring them back to their land. The choice will always be ours. Therefore, “Choose life, that you and your children may live” (Devarim 30:19)."

I believe that the reference is to God, (Literally, ki hu chayyyekha, which reads, for he is your life. Hence this interpretation.)  as the poet says, (We should not be surprised that the Torah refers to God by the term life. For Scripture terms God my sword, my shield, my mercy, my salvation.)  the Lord is my salvation; (Compare Ps. 18:47: The God of my salvation.)  The God of my mercy (Ps. 59:11); My shield (Ps. 18:3); and my sword. (Compare, Deut. 33:29: The Lord is the sword of thy excellency.) "

30,20,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:20:1,"לאהבה את ה׳ אלוקיך, ""to love the Lord your G'd, etc."" This passage is a continuation of the thoughts in verse 19 ""in order that you may live, you and your offspring."" The purpose of this desire for life on this earth must be to learn to love G'd and to obey His commandments. When Moses concludes: ""for He is your life, etc."" Moses merely reflects that there cannot be a meaningful purpose in life on earth other than to cleave to G'd to the best of our abilities. This makes our life in this world a fitting prelude to our life in the celestial spheres., i.e. ארך ימים."

30,20,Commentary,Haamek Davar on Deuteronomy 30:20:2,"To cling to Him: One who is unable to learn Torah should at least try to attain the love of Hashem through clinging to Him. This is explained in the Gemara (Kesuvos 111) as referring to one who marries his daughter to a Torah scholar, and helps a Torah scholar financially. The Torah considers this as if he is clinging to the Divine Presence. Through joining with, and helping a Torah scholar, he attains a small part of the love of Hashem."
30,20,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Berakhot 9:2","R. Juda said further: ""Three things may cause to shorten a man's days and years: Refusing to read the Torah when offered to him; refusing to recite the [customary] grace over a cup [of wine], and leading a dominating life. Refusing to read the Torah, as it is written (Deu. 30, 20.) For he (the Torah) is thy life and the length of thy days. Refusing to recite the benediction over a cup of wine, as it is written (Gen. 12, 3.) And I will bless them that will bless thee. And he who leads a dominating life, as R. Chama b. Chanina said: ""Joseph died before his brethren because he dominated them."" "
30,20,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Berakhot 9:13","(Fol. 60b) R. Huna said in the name of Rab, who spoke in the name of R. Meier, and it is so taught also in a Baraitha in the name of R. Akiba: A man shall always be accustomed to say, ""All that God doth is done well""; as it once happened to R. Akiba who was traveling over the country and had with him an ass, a rooster and a lamp. At nightfall he reached a village where he sought lodging for the night, and it was refused. ""All that God doth is done well,"" said he. He proceeded toward the forest where he resolved to spend the night. A lion came and ate up his ass; a cat came and devoured the rooster, and the wind extinguished the lamp. ""All that God doth is done well,"" he said. That same night a ravaging army came and captured the village, and then R. Akiba said joyfully: ""Is not what I said true? All that is done by Heaven is done well'"" [for the enemy passed through the forest where R. Akiba slept that night, and if the ass had brayed, if the rooster had crowed or if the soldiers had seen the light, he would surely have met his death]."" (Fol. 61b) And thou shalt love thy Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul and with all thy might (Deu. 6, 4). We are taught that R. Eliezer the great says: ""Since it is said With all thy soul, why then is it necessary to say With all thy might, and since it is said With all thy might, why then is it necessary to say With all thy soul. To teach that if there is a man to whom the soul is considered dearer than money, to him is said With all thy soul; while for him who values money more than his life, to him is said And with all thy might."" But R. Akiba said. With all thy soul means. ""Even when thy life is taken away from thee."" Our Rabbis taught that the [Roman] Government once issued a decree forbidding Israel to study the Torah. What did R. Akiba do? He installed many congregations in public places and sat and lectured to them. Whereupon Papus b. Juda found him and said to him: ""Akiba! art thou not afraid of this nation?"" R. Akiba replied: ""Art thou Papus, called the wise? Listen, and I will relate a parable to thee. A fox, walking by the river side, noticed the fishes therein swimming to and fro., so he said to them, 'Why are ye running?' 'Because we fear the nets that are placed for us,' they replied. 'Come to shore then,' said the fox to them, 'and live with us just as my ancestors lived with your ancestors.' The fishes exclaimed, 'Art thou called the wisest of the beasts? Thou art not wise but very foolish. If we are in danger in the element in which we live (in the water), how much greater would we be in danger in the element in which we die (on shore).' So is it with us; if at the time we study the Torah, of which it is written (Deu. 30, 20.) It is thy life and the prolongation of thy days, we are in such fear of danger, how much greater would be the danger if we cease studying the Torah?"" It is related that not many days elapsed when R. Akiba was arrested and imprisoned; Papus also was arrested and placed in the same prison. ""Papus, what brought thee here?"" asked R. Akiba; Papus replied: ""Happy art thou R. Akiba, that thou art arrested for studying the Torah! Woe to me, Papus, that I was arrested because of vanity!"" When R. Akiba was led forth to execution, it was just at the time of the morning Sh'm'a. As they tore his flesh with iron curry-combs, he was devotedly taking upon himself the yoke of the Heavenly Kingdom with love. His disciples asked of him:' ""Rabbi, how long [wilt thou continue your prayers]?"" ""O,"" answered he, ""all my life I worried as to how I could fulfill the ordinance. [Love thy God] with all thy soul, which means 'even if thy soul be taken from you'; I asked myself when would such an opportunity come to hand that I might fulfill it? And now when it finally came to hand shall I not fulfill it?"" With a long-drawn out voice he was saying the word Echad (One) [from Hear O Israel, the Lord our God is One]. when his soul departed. A Heavenly voice went forth and said ""Happy ought thou be, R. Akiba, that thy soul departed with the word Echad."" The ministering angels then pleaded before the Holy One, praised be He! saying: ""Sovereign of the universe, is this the Torah's reward? Is it not said (Ps. 17, 14.) Let me die through Thine own hand (a natural death) O Lord, of those who die of age."" ""Their share shall be in life,"" was God's answer. Thereupon a Heavenly voice went forth and said, ""Happy art thou, Akiba, that thou art chosen for the bliss of futurity."" "
30,20,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Shabbat 1:14","(Fol. 13a) At the academy of Elijah it was taught: ""Once it happened that a scholar who read (the Scripture) to a great extent and studied a great part (of the Talmud) and devoted much of his time in attendance upon the scholars, died very young, and his wife took his Tephilin and went around with them to every place of worship and study saying to the audience: 'Behold it is written in the Torah (Deu. 30, 20.) For He is thy life, and the length of thy days. My husband studied and read so much and (Fol. 13b) gave so much of his time to attendance upon the scholars; why did he die so young?' And there was none who could give her answer. I happened once to stop at her house and she told me everything that had happened to her. I said to her: 'My daughter, how did he conduct himself during the days in which you were a Niddah?' She answered: 'God forbid! He refrained even from touching my little finger.' 'And during the days when you were a Lebuna, how was his conduct towards thee?' I asked her again. Whereupon she answered: 'He ate with me, drank with me, and did not refrain from touching me.' I then said to her: 'Praised be the Holy One, who spared him not for the sake of scholarship, for the Torah says (Lev. 18, 19.) And a woman in the separation of her uncleanliness shalt thou not approach.' "" When K. Dimi came he said: ""They were together in one bed [while in her Lebuna""]."" In Palestine it was said, in the name of R. Isaac b. Joseph, that she wore breech cloth [while with him in one bed]. "
30,20,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Nedarim 8:2","We are taught in a Baraitha (Deut. 30, 20) To love the Lord, thy God, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave unto Him. This means that a man should not say, ""I will study the Scripture so that I may be called a wise man; I will study the Misnah that I may become a senior scholar occupying a seat in the college:"" [This is not the proper way.] But one should study because of the love of literature and honor will come in due time, as it is said (Pr. 7, 3) Bind them round thy fingers, write them upon the table of thy heart; and it is also written (Ib., 6, 21) Bind them upon thy heart continually, tie them about thy throat; and again (Ib., 3, 17) Her way is a way of pleasantness, etc. And again, A tree of life is she to those that lay hold on her, and everyone that firmly graspeth her will be made happy. Elazar b. Zadok says: ""Do things in the name of their Maker and converse in it (the Torah) for their own sake. Do not make them as a crown with which to exalt, neither shalt thou make them a spade to dig with."" This can be inferred by applying a fortiori reasoning. If Belsazzar, who only made use of the sacred vessels (of the Temple) that afterwards became secular and was nevertheless punished by being uprooted from the world, how much more so will it occur with one who makes use of the crown of the Torah! Raba said: ""It is permissible for a man to introduce himself with his title in a place where he is unknown, as it is said (I Kings 18, 12) But I thy servant have feared the Lord from my mouth."" If so, then how will you explain the incident of R. Tarphon? [Why did he feel sorry for having informed him that he was a scholar?] It was because he was a very rich man and he should have appeased him with something. "
30,20,Midrash,"Ein Yaakov (Glick Edition), Kiddushin 1:30","(Fol. 40) Raba raised the following objection before R. Nachman: ""We are taught in a Mishnah, these are the things of which a man enjoys the interest for his reward in this world, while the principal remaineth for him in the world to come. They are: honoring his father and mother, the practice of loving kindness, hospitality, making peace between man and his associates, and above all the study of the Torah. Concerning honoring father and mother, it is written (Deut. 5. 16) In order ihat thy days may be prolonged, and in order that it may go well with thee; concerning loving kindness it is written (Pr. 21, 21) He that pursueth righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness and honor; and concerning bringing peace, it is written (Ps. 34, 15) Seek peace and pursue it. And R. Abahu explained that we infer this from the similar words R'dipha R'dipha (pursue); it is written here, seek peace and pursue it, (rod-phrhu); and again it is written (Pr. 21, 21) He that pursueth (rodeph) righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness and honor; [Hence both hare the same merits]. Concerning studying the Torah, it is written (Deut. 30, 20) For it (the Torah) is thy life, and the length of thy days. If so, tlien concerning the sending away of the bird, it is also written (Ib. 22, 7) in order that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live many days. Then why did not the Mishnah count this also? ""The Tanna left it out,"" [was R. Nachman's reply]. Is this then possible, since our Tannah states: ""These are the things."" How can you say he left something unmentioned?"" Therefore said Raba: ""R. Idi explained this to me [with the following verse]: (Is. 3, 10) Say it to the righteous, that he has done well; for the fruit of their deeds shall they eat. Is there then a righteous man that is good and a righteous man that is not good? We must therefore say that a righteous man who is good towards heaven and also towards man is a righteous that is good; who is good towards heaven but conducts himself badly towards man is a righteous man that is not good. Similar to this case (Ib., ib. 11) Woe unto the wicked who doth evil; for the recompense of his hands shall be bestowed on him. Are there then wicked who do evil and wicked who do not evil? We must therefore say that the wicked who act wickedly towards heaven and towards man, this is a wicked man who does evil; but a wicked man who acts wickedly towards heaven and not towards man, this is a wicked who doeth not evil."" [Hence wherever the passage does not state for the fruit … shall they eat, it yields no fruit in this world]. Meritorious rewards have a capital and also the fruit bearing on the principal, as it is said Say it to the righteous that he hath done well; for the fruit, etc; while iniquities have merely principal but no fruit yielding, as it is said Woe unto the wicked who does evil, etc. If so, then how will the following passage (Pr. 1, 31) Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices, be explained? This means that a crime which bears fruit [if it is carried out] it will also yield fruit [in the punishment], but a crime which bears no fruit [is not carried out] it will yield no fruit in the punishment. The merit of a good intention does the Holy One, praised be He! [in rewarding] add to that of a good deed, as it is said (Mal. 3, 16) Then conversed those that fear the Lord; one with another, and the Lord listened and heard it; and there was written a book of remembrance before Him, over those that feared the Lord and for those who respected His name. Said R. Assi: What does and for those who respected His name, mean? ""Even when one intended to observe a commandment, but was incidentally prevented from doing so. Scripture credits him as if he had actually observed it."" Bad intentions, the Holy One, praised be He, however, does not add to deeds, as it is said (Ps. 66, 18) If I had looked on wickedness with my heart, the Lord would not have heard. But how will the following passage (Jer. 6, 19) Behold, I will bring evil upon these people, the fruit of their thoughts, be explained? This means that an evil intention which bears fruit (is carried out), the Holy One, praised be He! adds to deeds; but such evil thoughts which bear no fruit, the Holy One, praised be He! does not add to deeds, but is there not a passage (Ez. 14, 5) In order that I may grasp the house of Israel by their heart? Said R. Acha b. Jacob: ""The last passage refers to idolatry, for the master said elsewhere: The crime of idolatry is so severe that whoever denies it is as he admits the truthfulness of the entire Torah."" Ulla said: ""The last passage means as R. Huna explained it, for R. Huna said: 'As soon as a man commits a crime once, and twice, it becomes to him a privileged thing.' How can one think that it is a privilege? We must therefore say that it appears to him like a privileged thing."" R. Abahu, in the name of R. Chanina, said: ""It is preferable for a man to commit a transgression secretly, but not to profane Heaven's name,"" etc. [Fully explained in Volume 3, page 29]. "
30,20,Midrash,Midrash Tehillim 119:26,"""Luli toratecha she'asui v'goh..."". Israel said: ""If not for Your Torah that was with me and was my delight, then I would have been lost in my affliction."" Similarly, Moses says in Psalm 94: ""In the multitude of my anxieties within me, Your comforts delight my soul."" And Pharaoh says in Exodus 5: ""Let the work be heavier on the men."" They had books and would amuse themselves with them from Sabbath to Sabbath. Therefore it is said: ""Your Torah is my delight forever; I will not forget Your precepts."" They are life to Israel; if not for them, there would be no life. As it is written in Deuteronomy 30:20: ""For He is your life and the length of your days."" And it is written in Proverbs 8:35: ""For whoever finds me finds life."" And it is written in Proverbs 9:11: ""For by me your days will be multiplied, and years of life will be added to you."" Israel said to God: ""It is possible for a heifer to plow in two furrows. Why then did You say: 'For they are My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt'?"" To which God responds: ""I will save you from the oppressor."" As it is written in Psalm 116: ""Redeem me from the oppression of man."" Therefore it is said: ""Save me, and I will be saved."""
30,20,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Numbers 32:17:2,"לפני בני ישראל BEFORE THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL - i.e. at the head of the troops, because they were mighty men; for thus is it said of Gad, (Deuteronomy 30:20): “He teareth the arm, with the crown of the head”. Moses distinctly stated this to them in Sedrah אלה הדברים (Deuteronomy 3:18): “And I commanded you at that time … Ye shall pass over armed before the children of Israel, all ye men of valour”. And regarding the siege of Jericho it is written, (Joshua 6:13): “And the armed men (החלוץ) went before them”— this refers to the tribes of Reuben and Gad who thus fulfilled the conditions they had laid down."
30,20,Talmud,Shabbat 13a:11,"The Sage in the school of Eliyahu taught a baraita that deals with this halakha: There was an incident involving one student who studied much Mishna and read much Bible, and served Torah scholars extensively, studying Torah from them, and, nevertheless, died at half his days, half his life expectancy. His wife in her bitterness would take his phylacteries and go around with them to synagogues and study halls, and she said to the Sages: It is written in the Torah: “For it is your life and the length of your days” (Deuteronomy 30:20). If so, my husband who studied much Mishna, and read much Bible,"
30,20,Talmud,Pesachim 49b:5,"Rabbi Elazar said: It is prohibited to accompany an ignoramus while traveling on the road due to concern that the ignoramus might try to harm his traveling partner, as it is stated with regard to Torah: “For it is your life and the length of your days” (Deuteronomy 30:20). An ignoramus has not studied any Torah, indicating that he is not concerned about his own life; with regard to another’s life, all the more so."
30,20,Talmud,Ketubot 111b:8,"On a similar note, you say: The verse states: “To love the Lord your God, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave to Him” (Deuteronomy 30:20). But is it possible for a person to cleave to the Divine Presence? Rather, anyone who marries his daughter to a Torah scholar, and one who conducts business on behalf of Torah scholars, and one who utilizes his wealth to benefit Torah scholars with his property, the verse ascribes him credit as though he is cleaving to the Divine Presence."
30,20,Talmud,Kiddushin 40a:6,"And with regard to bringing peace it is written: “Seek peace and pursue it” (Psalms 34:15). And Rabbi Abbahu says: This is derived through a verbal analogy between the term pursuing written with regard to pursuing peace and the term pursuing written in another verse. It is written here: “Seek peace and pursue it,” and it is written there, with regard to acts of kindness: “Pursues righteousness and kindness.” This teaches that one who pursues peace will also merit life, prosperity, and honor. With regard to Torah study it is written: “For that is your life and the length of your days” (Deuteronomy 30:20)."
30,20,Talmud,Nedarim 62a:7,"Apropos the story of Rabbi Tarfon’s regret for gaining personal benefit from his status as a Torah scholar, the Gemara cites similar teachings. It is taught in a baraita: The verse states: “To love the Lord your God, to listen to His voice, and to cleave to Him” (Deuteronomy 30:20). This verse indicates that a person should not say: I will read the written Torah so that they will call me a Sage; I will study Mishna so that they will call me Rabbi; I will review my studies so that I will be an Elder and will sit in the academy."
30,20,Musar,Mesillat Yesharim 19:97,"The Torah exhorts us many times on the clinging [to G-d]: ""to love the L-rd your G-d.. and to cling to Him"" (Devarim 30:20), ""to Him shall you cling"" (Devarim 10:20, 13:5). And David said: ""my soul clings to You"" (Tehilim 63:9). All these verses speak of one matter, namely, the clinging with which a man clings to G-d, blessed be He, to such an extent that he is unable to part or move from Him."
30,20,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Ki Tisa 15:4","Ben Azzai said: Observe the humility of the Holy One, blessed be He. When a mortal king issues a proclamation in his dominion announcing that so-and-so is to be magistrate, another a prefect, and still another a general, he mentions his own name first and then his selections. However, the Holy One, blessed be He, mentioned his deeds first and then His name, as in the verse: In the beginning created God. Is there any humility greater than this? Ordinarily, a king will set aside supplies and precious gifts for the legionaries who are loyal to him, and he will divide the plunder with them. If they should rebel, however, he no longer feels any obligation to them. Though the Israelites fashioned a golden calf, the Holy One, blessed be He, was concerned with saving their lives, as it is said: For that is thy life and the length of thy days (Deut. 30:20)."
30,20,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Tzav 14:1","Another interpretation: ""Command Aharon [...]"" (Leviticus 6:2) This is what is written (Psalms 51:20), ""With Your will, do good to Zion,"" and afterwards (Psalms 51:21), ""Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt-offering and a whole-offering.""  That is to say, if Israel does not offer a burnt-offering before the Holy One, blessed be He, Zion and Jerusalem will not be built. As they are only built through the merit of the burnt-offering which Israel would offer before the Holy One, blessed be He. And why is the burnt-offering different, [so that it is] better than all of the other offerings? Because it is called ""sacrifices of righteousness,"" as it is stated, ""Then You will desire sacrifices of righteousness, a burnt-offering and a whole-offering."" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, ""On account of this,  the burnt-offering is so beloved to Me. Hence, 'Command Aharon and his sons,' that they be careful with it, to offer it before Me."" Why does it state, ""This is the law (Torah) of the burnt-offering?"" It means to say, the reading of the Torah. See how beloved the reading of the Torah is in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. As there is an obligation upon a man to give all of his money to teach Torah to himself and his sons, as it is stated, ""Command Aharon and his sons, saying"" - meaning, that they should say it to the Children of Israel, such that they occupy themselves with the reading of the burnt-offering. As even though they [actually] offer a burnt-offering, they would [also] be occupied with its reading, so that they would get merit in the sacrifice and in its reading. And so did Rav Shmuel bar Abba say, ""The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, 'Even though the Temple is destined to be destroyed in the future and the sacrifices to be nullified, do not [allow] yourselves to forget the order of the sacrifices; but rather be careful to read about them and review them. And if you occupy yourselves with them, I will count it for you as if you were occupied with the sacrifices [themselves].'"" And if you want to know [that this is so], come and see that when the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Yechezkel the form of the [Temple], what did He say? ""Describe the [Temple] to the House of Israel; let them be ashamed of their iniquities, and measure the plan"" (Ezekiel 43:10). Yehezkel [responded] to the Holy One, blessed be He, ""Until now, we are put into exile in the land of our enemies; and You say to me to go and inform Israel [about] the form of the [Temple], and 'write [it] in their eyes, and they should preserve its form and all of its statutes [and do them]' (Ezekiel 43:11). And are they able to do [them]? Leave them until they emerge from the exile, and afterwards, I will go and tell them."" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Yechezkel, ""And because My children are in exile, the building of My [Temple] should be idle?"" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ""Its reading in the Torah is as great as its building. Go and say it to them, and they will occupy themselves to read the form of the [Temple] in the Torah. And in reward for its reading, that they occupy themselves to read about it, I count it for them as if they were occupied with the building of the [Temple]."" And fortunate is the man who involves himself in Torah and gives his money to teach Torah to his son. As on account of the money that he gives to teach, he merits life in the world to come, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:20), ""as it is your life and the length of your days"" - your life, in the world to come; and length of your days, in the world that is long. And know that it is so. Rabbi Assia said, ""Why do the infants of the master's schoolhouse begin by studying the book of Leviticus? Rather it is because all the sacrifices are written in it; and because [the infants] are pure until now and do not know what is the taste of sin and iniquity. Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'Let them begin first with the order of the sacrifices - let  the pure ones come and occupy themselves with the acts of purification. Hence I count it for them as if they were standing and offering sacrifices in front of Me.' And He is informing you that even though the Temple is destroyed and sacrifices are not practiced, were it not for the infants that read the order of the sacrifices, the world would not stand."" Hence, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, ""My children, even thought the Temple is destroyed and the sacrifices are annulled and the sacrifice of the burnt-offering is not practiced, if you occupy yourselves and read the section of the burnt-offering and study the section about sacrifices, I count it for you as if you are offering a sacrifice of a burnt-offering in front of Me, as it is stated, 'This is the Torah of a burnt-offering'"" - meaning to say, one who occupies himself with the Torah of the burnt-offering merits life in the world to come. What is written above? ""A soul that sins and violates a violation of the Lord, and denies against his kinsman, etc."" (Leviticus 5:21); and afterwards, ""This is the law of the burnt-offering."" Isaiah said (Isaiah 61:8), ""Since I the Lord love justice, hate theft in a burnt-offering."" The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ""Do not say, 'I will steal and extort, and [then I will] bring a burnt-offering and it will atone for me.' As I hate theft, even with a burnt-offering made for the theft. And if the world wants that I should accept a burnt-offering, return the theft to its master; and afterwards, if he bring up a burnt-offering for it, I will accept it, as it is stated, 'Since I the Lord [...] hate theft in a burnt-offering' - hate the burnt-offering when the theft is still in his hand."" And one who reads the Torah of the burnt-offering is as if he brings up and offers a burnt-offering in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. And therefore, fortunate is the one teaches himself Torah and gives his money to teach himself and his sons, as it is stated (Leviticus 7:11), ""This is the law of the sacrifice of the peace-offerings"" (here read as ""This is the Torah of the sacrifice of payments""). Israel said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, ""Master of the world, behold You command us that we bring all of these sacrifices. When the Temple was still in existence, a man that sins brings a sacrifice and it is atoned for him. And so [too], he brings a meal-offering and it is accepted for him. But now that the Temple was destroyed, what can we do about our sins and about our guilt?"" [So] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, ""If you want that they should be atoned for you, keep My laws, and I will count it for you as if you did a sacrifice in front of Me."" And from where [do we know this]? ""This is the law (Torah) for the burnt-offering, for the meal-offering, for the sin-offering, for the guilt-offering, for the induction-offerings and for the sacrifice of the peace-offerings"" (Leviticus 7:37) - do not read it so, but rather, ""This is the Torah; not for the burnt-offering, not for the meal-offering, not for the sin-offering, not for the guilt-offering, not for the induction-offerings and not for the sacrifice of the peace-offerings."" Rather, occupy yourselves with Torah, and it will be considered in front of Me, as if you offered all of the sacrifices in front of Me.  Hence, David stated (Psalms 119:97), ""How much have I loved Your Torah, it is my speech all of the day."" Since I know that occupation with Your Torah atones for iniquities - therefore I have loved Your Torah. What is [the understanding of] ""upon its burning on the altar all of the night"" (Leviticus 6:2)? This is that they would burn the fats and the limbs the whole entire night, and the prayers were instituted corresponding to the sacrifices. Now that we do not have burnt-offerings, nor sacrifices, nor meal-offerings, nor guilt offerings, they instituted them as prayers. And the evening prayer can be brought the whole night, just as we bring limbs and fats the whole entire night. But the forefathers instituted the prayers, and this means to say, its burning is on the altar all of the night. And why was the burning on the altar and not in another place? Rather the verse states (Exodus 20:21), ""Make an altar of earth (adamah) for Me"" - why of earth? Because man (Adam) was created from the earth, and his name was called Adam, because he was taken from the adamah. And we bring up burnt-offerings and sacrifices on that altar which is made of earth to atone for the body that is taken from the earth. And from where [do we know] that it atones for the soul? As it is written (Leviticus 17:14), ""As the soul of all flesh, its blood is in its soul."" And it also states (Leviticus 17:11), ""as the blood atones for the soul."" ""And they shall throw the blood on the altar"" (Leviticus 1:5) - meaning to say, they shall throw the blood - which is the soul - upon the altar - which is from earth like the body - and it shall atone for the soul. ""A permanent fire shall burn upon the altar; you shall not extinguish"" (Leviticus 6:6); but it [also] states (Isaiah 66:24), ""They shall go out and gaze on the corpses of the men who rebelled against Me, their worms shall not die, nor their fire be extinguished, etc."" [That is referring to] those that deny the Omnipresent. But the fire that is permanently burning on the altar atones for the sins of Israel. And what is [the understanding of] ""altar"" (mizbeach)? [It is an acronym:] Mem is mechilah (pardon), as it pardons their sins; zayin is zechut (merit), as it gives them merit for the world to come; bet is berakha (blessing), as the Holy One, blessed be He, gives them blessing [through it] in the deeds of their hands; chet is chaim (life), as they merit [through it] to life in the world to come. One who leaves all of these - pardon, merit, blessing and life - and goes and worships idolatry, is burned by His great fire, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 4:24), ""As the Lord, your God, is a consuming fire, He is a jealous God."" How is He jealous? As it is stated (Hosea 2:22), ""And I will betroth you in faith."" [Hence,] just as a husband is jealous about his wife, so too is the Holy One, blessed be He, jealous, as it is stated (Isaiah 62:5), ""and the joy of the groom towards the bride, etc."" One who leaves all these will be burnt by His great fire, as it is stated (Isaiah 66:24), ""as their worms shall not die, nor their fire be extinguished, and they will be a disgrace for all flesh."" But if he repents, the fire burning on the altar atones for him and expiates the fire of Geihinnom. Moreover, every one of Israel that is circumcised enters the Garden of Eden, since the Holy One, blessed be He, places His name on the Israelite so that he can enter the Garden of Eden. And what is the name and the seal that He places upon them? It is Shaddai (the Omnipotent): The shin He placed in the nose; the dalet in the hand; and the yod in the circumcision. And therefore at the time that an Israelite goes to his final home, there is an appointed angel in the Garden of Eden who takes every son of Israel that is circumcised and brings him to the Garden of Eden. But those that are not circumcised; even though they have two letters of the name of Shaddai - as they have the shin of the nose and the dalet of the hand - they do not have the yod of Shaddai, [and so, the letters they have form] the expression, sheid (demon), meaning to say that a demon brings him to Geihinnom. And an Israelite who is circumcised but worships idolatry [also] goes to enter the Garden of Eden, but the Holy One, blessed be He, commands the angel, such that he pulls his foreskin and makes his foreskin appear as it it were never circumcised, such that he not enter the Garden of Eden but rather Geihinnom. And circumcision is a great thing and beloved in front of the Holy One, blessed be He. And all the creatures of the world - whether people, beasts, animals or crawling things, all of them - fear an Israelite when he is circumcised. And so do you find with Yonah. As he fled from his God on the fifth day. And why did he flee? Rather the first time, [God] sent him to restore the border of Israel. The second time, He sent him to Jerusalem to destroy it; but the Holy One, blessed be He, worked up His great mercies and relented from the bad. And [so] they called him a false prophet. The third time, He sent him to Nineveh to destroy it. Yonah judged the case between him and himself - Yonah said, ""I know that the [other] nations are close to repentance. Now they will repent and the Holy One, blessed be He, will [resultantly] send His rage towards Israel. Moreover, Israel will will call me a false prophet"" (etc. in Midrash Tanchuma, Vayikra 8). ""And the men feared a great fear"" (Jonah 1:8) - [this] teaches that fear is greater than wisdom and understanding. As one who has wisdom and understanding, but does not have fear is not anything. As so did King Shlomo, peace be upon him, state (Ecclesiastes 12:13), ""At the end of the matter when all is heard; fear God and observe His commandments, as this is all of man."""
30,20,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Shmini 11:1","And to the elders of Israel: Rabbi Akiva said, ""Israel is compared to a bird - just like a bird cannot fly without wings, so [too,] Israel cannot do anything without elders. Rabbi Yose bar Chalafta said, ""Great is old age - as if they are elders, they are beloved; and if they are youths, the Holy One, blessed be He, makes old age spring upon them [early]."" Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said, ""Not [only] in one place, nor in two or three places do we find that the Omnipresent dispenses honor to the elders: In Egypt, as it is stated (Exodus 3:18), 'And they will listen to your voice and you will come, you and the elders of Israel'; at the [burning] bush, 'Go and collect the elders of Israel' (Exodus 3:16); at Sinai, 'you and Aharon, Nadav and Avihu and seventy of the elders of Isreal' (Exodus 24:10); at the tent of meeting, 'to Aharon and to his sons and to the elders of Israel. So [too,] in the future to come, the Holy One, blessed be He, dispenses honor to the elders, as it is stated (Isaiah 24:23), 'And the moon will be embarrassed and the sun ashamed, since the King, the Lord of hosts [will be] on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and across from His elders will be honor.'"" The Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, ""The Holy One, blessed be He, will in the future make an assembly of His elders. And that is what the verse states, 'since the King, the Lord of hosts [will be] on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and across from His elders will be honor.'"" And the Holy One, blessed be He, honors the righteous ones and the pious ones, but any time that a mistake comes from them, He chastises them. See that which is written about the sons of Aharon, as they were assistant priests and erred with wine, as so did they, may their memory be blessed, say - that they were inebriated with wine; and hence the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded after their death, to warn about wine, as it is stated, ""Wine and strong drink shall you not drink, you and your sons with you."" The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ""Be careful with wine. See that which Noach did, as he began to err with it, as it is stated (Genesis 9:20), 'And Noah, the man of the earth, began to plant a vineyard,' and it is written (Genesis 9:21), 'And he drank from the wine and he became drunk and he revealed himself.' What caused him to become disgraced? The wine. And it caused him to bring a curse upon his seed, as it is stated (Genesis 9:25), 'And he said, ""Cursed is Canaan.""' And hence, be warned about wine, since wine brings a person to all the sins in the world - to licentiousness, to the spilling of blood, to theft and to all the [other] sins in the world."" And does it not gladden the heart of man; and the verse praise it like one reading in the Torah? As it is stated,  (Psalms 104:15), ""And wine gladdens the heart of a man,"" and it states (Pslams 19:9), ""The precepts of the Lord, gladdening the heart."" And further, He bequeaths the Garden of Eden to those occupied with Torah and its precepts, as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:20), ""as it is your life and the length of your days""; and a drunk - when the wine is still with him - sits happily, as if he was sitting in the Garden of Eden. [The resolution is] like [the story of] that student who was a pious man, and he had a father that drank heavily. And each time he would fall in the marketplace [from drinking], people would come and hit him with stones and pebbles. And they would yell and call out behind him, ""Look at the drunkard."" And when his son the pious man saw, he was embarrassed and wished for his soul to die. And every day, he would say to [his father,] ""I will order [it] and they will bring you from every wine that they sell in the province to your house, and [just] don't go to drink in the tavern, such that you make a disgrace of yourself and of me."" And he [would] say this to him once or twice every day, until his father said that he would do this, as he said, not to go to drink in the tavern. And so did the pious man do, that he would make food and drink for him every day and every night and put him to sleep in his bed, and then leave. One time, rain was falling and that pious man went out to the marketplace and was walking to the synagogue for prayer. And he saw a drunkard laying in the marketplace and a puddle of water was falling on him. And the young men and the youths were hitting him with stones and pebbles and throwing clay in his face and into his mouth. When this pious man saw, he said in his heart, ""I will go to father and bring him to here, and I will show him this drunkard and the disgrace that the young men and youths make out of him; maybe he will prevent his mouth from drinking in the tavern and from getting drunk."" And so did he do, he brought him to there and showed [the drunkard] to him. What did his old father do? He walked over to the drunkard and asked him in which [tavern] he drank that wine from which he became drunk. His pious son said to him, ""Father, for this did I call you? Rather to see the disgrace they make out of him, as so do they do to you at the time that you drink - maybe you will prevent your mouth from drinking in the tavern?"" He said to him, ""My son, I have no enjoyment and Garden of Eden in my life besides this."" When the pious man heard, he left with a bitter spirit. But the precepts and the Torah are not [just like] the joy of wine - since when the wine leaves his body, sorrow comes into his heart, 'this one leaves and that one comes'; but the Torah and the commandments are a delight and joy in this world and in the world to come, as it is stated,  ""as it is your life and the length of your days"" - in this world and in the world to come, which is completely long. And you will find further with the sacrifices that it states about the lambs, ""two one-year old unblemished lambs"" (Numbers 28:9); about the bread, two issaron; but about the wine, [only] a quarter of a hin. So little would they offer [of the wine] to make known proper action (derekh erets). As much wine brings a person to sin, to great grief and to loss of the purse, as it is stated (Proverbs 23:31), ""Do not ogle that red wine, as it lends its color to the cup, as it flows on smoothly"" - in his home, such that there not be with what to cook, since he sells and gives everything for the sake of wine. Another [understanding]: Do not read it [as] ""to the cup (kos),"" but rather ""to the purse (kis),"" as he puts an evil eye into his purse. And so do you find with the Children of Ephraim, as it states (Hosea 7:11), ""But Ephraim was like a silly dove, with no heart."" Why? Because they drink much wine; and it states (Isaiah 28:1), ""Woe, the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim."" And we have also found with a man and a woman that the verse states to take out their son to pelt him with stones, as it is stated (Deuteronomy  21:18), ""And if a man has a son that is wild and rebellious,"" and it states (Deuteronomy 21:19), ""And his father and his mother shall grab him."" And why all of this? Because he went out to bad culture, such that he will spend his money, steal and do sins, and become liable for the death penalty. And before he becomes liable for death, ""And his father and his mother shall grab him, etc. And all of the people of his city shall pelt him, etc."" (Deuteronomy 21:19-21). And know [from this], that there is great evil in drinking much wine. And how much meat does he eat more than another man, for which he is liable for death? One litra. And another verse states, ""Do not be of those who guzzle wine, or glut themselves on meat to them"" (Proverbs 23:20). What is [the meaning of] ""to them?"" Meaning to say, to them do they do the evil - as they spend [all] their money and come to disgrace; and in the end, they become liable for death in this world and in the world to come. "
30,20,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Beha'alotcha 15:1","(Numb. 11:16:) “Gather Me seventy men.” This text is related (to Eccl. 12:11), “The words of the wise are like goads (kedarbanot) [...].” Kedarbanot [signifies] kadur shel banot (a ball for girls). Just like a ball for girls is thrown here and there, so were the words [of Torah] thrown at Sinai. Another interpretation of “like goads.” Just as a goad brings living (hayyim) [animals] to their yoke (l'wlm) so do the words of Torah bring life (hayyim) to the world (l'wlm). (See ySanh. 10:1 (28a); Numb. R. 14:4; 15:22; Eccl. R. 12:11:1; PR 3:2.)  It is so written (in Deut. 30:20), “[To love the Lord your God, heed His commands, and hold fast to Him] for that is your life and your length of days.” [Another interpretation (of Eccl. 12:11), “The words of the wise are like goads”:] Just as the goad directs the cow to plow and even out the furrows; (TSot. 7:11; Sifre to Deut. 11:13 (41); Hag. 3b; ARN A 18.)  so do the words of Torah direct those who study them to say, “Forbidden,” over what is forbidden, [to say,] “Permitted,” over what is permitted; and [the words of the wise also] show interpretations and directives from the Torah. (Eccl. 12:11:) “The words of the wise are like goads.” Three names are applied to it (i.e., to a goad), darban, mardea', malmad. (PRK 23:7; Lev. R. 29:7.)  Why is it named malmad (mlmd)? Because it teaches (mlmd) the cow to plow. Mardea'? Because it teaches knowledge (moreh de'ah) to the cow for plowing. Darban? Because it (the goad) dwells (dar) in it (bah, i.e., in the cow) as understanding (binah) for plowing. (See Targum Eccl. 12:11.)  And therefore the words of the wise are compared to goads, as it teaches knowledge and understanding to people. And if you say, “Just as the goad is removable, so are the words of Torah removable,” the text reads (ibid. cont.), “and like implanted nails (msmrwt).” (Eccl. 12:11, cont.:) “Those that are gathered in collections.” What is the meaning of “those that are gathered in collections?” When are they implanted in a man? When their masters are gathered (dead) from them. The whole time that his master is alive, [the student] asks him. [When] his teacher dies, he toils day and night to fulfill his teaching, as there is no one for him to ask. Hence it is written, “those that are gathered in collections.” (Eccl. 12:11:) “And like implanted nails (msmrwt).” R. Berekhya the Priest Berabbi said, “It is written, ‘like the watches (mshmrwt),’ but we read it ‘like nails (msmrwt).’ [This is to teach that] just as the watches (mshmrwt) of the priests number twenty-four, so also do the books [of the Bible] number twenty-four.” Another interpretation: Why is it written, “like the watches (mshmrwt),” but we read it “like implanted nails (msmrwt)?” To teach you that if you have implanted them like a nail in your heart, they will watch you. Another interpretation (of Eccl. 12:11 cont.), “and like implanted nails.” From here the sages have said, “It is forbidden to read in the profane (chitzoniot) books.” It is therefore stated (ibid.), “and like implanted nails (msmrwt).” (Ibid. cont.:) [“(The masters of) collections.”] These [masters] are the Sanhedrin. (Gk.: synedrion.)  And if you say, “This person permits what another forbids, this one declares unfit what another declares fit, this one declares unclean what another declares clean, R. Eliezer obligates while R. Joshua exempts, and Bet Shammai prohibits while Bet Hillel permits; to whom should I listen?” [That is why] the Holy One, blessed be He, said, “Nevertheless (according to Eccl. 12:11 end) ‘all of them were given from one shepherd.’” This [shepherd] was Moses, as stated about him (in Exod. 3:1), “And Moses was a shepherd.” [And] he received it from the One of the world. And they are unified words, except that this one gives one explanation, and that one gives another explanation. Hence it is stated, “all of them were given from one shepherd.”"
30,20,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma, Ki Tavo 2:1","(Deut. 27:9:) “Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to all Israel, saying, ‘Pay attention and listen.’” What is the meaning of pay attention (hasket) and listen? Be silent (has) and then break down (katet). Moses said to Israel, “Form [yourselves into] individual classes (kitot), and incline your heart to hear the words of Torah.” Another interpretation: He said to them, “Pound (katetu) your hearts and souls to hear the words of Torah.” [(Deut. 26:16:) “With all your heart.”] R. Eliezer ben Jacob says, “The text comes to warn the priests when they perform a service not to have two hearts, one in the presence of the Holy One and one for something else.” (Ibid., cont.:) “And with all your soul (nafsheka),” even though [someone] takes your life (nafshekha). On one occasion [the Romans] (Although the Tanhuma identifies the persecution with the Greek kingdom, the mention of R. Aqiva suggests the persecution under Hadrian.)  decreed a religious persecution against Israel, in which they were not to occupy themselves with the Torah. (See Ber. 61b for a fuller version of this story.)  R. Aqiva and his colleagues proceeded to [ignore it and] occupy themselves with the Torah. When Pappus ben Judah found him, he said to him, “See here, rabbi, you are endangering yourself, when you transgress against a decree of the king.” R. Aqiva said to him, “Let me illustrate for you in a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a fox. As he was walking near a river, he saw [some] fish there. (Ber. 61b explains that the fish were fleeing the nets of fishermen.)  He said to them, ‘Get yourselves to me, and I will hide you in the clefts of the rocks. Then you shall not be afraid.’ They said to him, ‘Are you the one that they say about you that you are the most clever of the animals? You are only a fool. All our lives have been [spent] only in the water. So would you tell us to walk onto the dry land? If we are afraid in the place of our life, all the more so [will we be afraid] in the place of our death!’ Similarly all the life of Israel exists only in the Torah, of which it is written (in Deut. 30:20), ‘for that is your life and your length of days’; yet you are saying, ‘You are endangering yourself?’” In a few days they arrested the both of them. Pappus said to him, “Fortunate are you, since you were arrested for the words of Torah. Woe to that Pappus, who was arrested for idle things.” [Subsequently] when they brought out R. Aqiva for execution, it was time to recite the Shema'. While they combed his flesh with combs of iron, he was calling out the recitation of the Shema'. About him David has said (in Ps. 17:14), “Of those who die by your hand, O Lord […] from the world (heled), their portion [is life].” (This interpretation of the verse is assumed by the midrash.)  R. Hanina bar Pappa said, “Do not read, ‘of those who die,’ but, ‘those who kill,’ (In Hebrew the difference between the two renderings is a matter of how one vowels the written text.)  [because they kill themselves] for the sake of the Torah, which was given [by Your hand].” When people see them, they say, “They are full of rust (hulda), they have sins on their hand; that is the reason they were killed, and so they die from the world.” But they do not know that their portion is in eternal life and that everything good is being kept in store for them. It is so stated (ibid. cont.), “may You fill their belly with what You have kept in store for them.” And not only that, but they attain merit for their children after them. (As indicated by the rest of the verse.)  And because [the Children of] Israel lay down their lives for the Torah and for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He; for that reason the Holy One, blessed be He, made them into an entity and a blessing in the world, as stated (in Deut. 26:17), “Today you have had the Lord promise….” And just as Israel makes an entity in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, so does the Holy One, blessed be He, make them an entity, as stated (in vs. 18), “The Lord has proclaimed you today [to be for Him a treasured people…].” R. Joshua ben Levi said, “Just as the pestle ('eli) crushes, so is Israel going to crush four empires under its feet.

30,20,Jewish Thought,"Duties of the Heart, Introduction of the Author 35","But when I searched in the torah, I found that it is mentioned frequently. For example (Deut. 6:5-6): ""you shall love the L-ord your G-d with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might; And these words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart"", and ""so that you may love the L-ord your G-d, and that you may hearken to His voice, and that you may cling to Him"" (Deut. 30:20), and ""to love the L-ord your G-d and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul"" (Deut. 11:13), and ""You shall walk after the L-ord your G-d and fear Him"" (Deut. 13:5), and ""you shall love your fellow as yourself"" (Levit.19:18), and ""now, Israel, what does the L-ord your G-d ask of you, but to fear the L-ord your G-d"" (Deut. 10:12), and ""Therefore love the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt"" (Deut. 10:19).

30,20,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Beha'alotcha 25:1","(Numb. 11:16:) GATHER ME . This text is related (to Eccl. 12:11): THE WORDS OF THE WISE ARE LIKE GOADS. Just as a goad brings living (hayyim)  to their yoke (L'WLM voweled as la'ullam) so do the words of Torah bring life (hayyim) to the world (L'WLM voweled as la'olam). (Tanh. Numb. 3:15; see ySanh. 10:1 (28a); Numb. R. 14:4; 15:22; Eccl. R. 12:11:1; PR 3:2.)  It is so written (in Deut. 30:20):  FOR THAT IS YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LENGTH OF DAYS. [Another interpretation (of Eccl. 12:11):  Permitted, over what is permitted; and  show texts and interpretations from the Torah. (Eccl. 12:11:) THE WORDS OF THE WISE ARE LIKE GOADS. Three names are applied to it (i.e., to a goad): Darban, mardea', malmad. (PRK 23:7; Lev. R. 29:7.)  Why is it named malmad (MLMD)? Because it teaches (MLMD) the cow to plow. Mardea'? Because it teaches knowledge (moreh de'ah) to the cow for plowing. Darban? Because it (the goad) dwells (dar) in it (bah, i.e., in the cow) as understanding (bineh). (See Targum Eccl. 12:11.)  It is therefore stated (in Eccl. 12:11): THE WORDS OF THE WISE ARE LIKE GOADS. And if you say: Just as the goad is removable, so are the words of Torah removable, the text reads (ibid. cont.): AND LIKE IMPLANTED NAILS (MSMRWT). (In the Buber text the S here is a samekh instead of the Masoretic sin to indicate that the sound is s and not Sh. In the unvoweled Masoretic Text however the letter in question could be either S or Sh.)  LIKE GUARDS (MShMRWT) is what is  written. If you have inserted them as a nail (MSMR), they are guards (MShMRWT) and will preserve you."
30,20,Midrash,"Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Ki Tavo 4:2","(Deut. 26:16:) WITH ALL YOUR HEART. R. Eliezer ben Jacob says: The text has come to warn Israel with regard to something else. (Cf. the parallel in Tanh., Deut. 7:2: “To warn the priests when they perform a service not to have two hearts, one in the presence of the Holy One and one for something else.”)  (Ibid., cont.:) AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL (nafsheka), even though  takes your life (nafsheka). On one occasion  (Although the parallel in the traditional Tanhuma identifies the persecution with the Greek kingdom, the mention of R. Aqiva suggests the persecution under Hadrian.)  decreed a religious persecution , in which they were not to occupy themselves with the Torah. (See Ber. 61b for a fuller version of this story.)  R. Aqiva proceeded to sit down and occupy himself with the Torah. When Pappus ben Judah found him, he said to him: See here, Rabbi, you are endangering yourself, when you transgress against a decree of the King. R. Aqiva said to him: Let me illustrate for you in a parable: To what is the matter comparable? To a fox. As he was walking near a river, he saw  fish there. (Ber. 61b explains that the fish were fleeing the nets of fishermen.)  He said to them: Get yourselves to me, and I will hide you in the clefts of the rocks. Then you shall not be afraid. They said to him: Are you the most clever of the animals? You are only a fool. All our lives have been  only in the water. So would you tell us to walk onto the dry land! Similarly all the life of Israel exists only in the Torah, of which it is written (in Deut. 30:20): FOR THAT IS YOUR LIFE AND YOUR LENGTH OF DAYS; yet you are saying: You are endangering yourself. In a few days they arrested the both of them. He said to him: It would have been better for you to be arrested for the words of Torah. (Cf. I Peter 3:17.)  Woe to that Pappus, who was arrested for vain words. Subsequently when they brought out R. Aqiva for execution, it was time to recite the Shema'. While they combed his flesh, (Tanh. 7:2; Ber. 61b adds: “With combs of iron.”)  he was calling out the recitation of the Shema'. About them David has said (in Ps. 17:14): OF THOSE WHO DIE BY YOUR HAND, O LORD < … THEIR PORTION IS LIFE.> (This interpretation of the verse is assumed by the midrash.)  R. Hanina bar Pappa said: Do not read: OF THOSE WHO DIE, but: ""Those who kill,"" (In Hebrew the difference between the two renderings is a matter of how one vowels the written text.)  because they kill themselves for the sake of the Torah, which was given . Therefore, when the children of Adam see them, they say to each other: They have sins on their hand; that is the reason they were killed. But they do not know that their portion is among the living in the world to come and that everything good is being kept in store for them. It is so stated (Ibid. cont.): MAY YOU FILL THEIR BELLY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE KEPT IN STORE FOR THEM. And not only that, but they attain merit for their children after them. Moreover, because  Israel lay down their lives for the Torah and for the sanctification of the name of the Holy One, for that reason the Holy One provides them with a blessing in the world, as stated (in Deut. 26:17): TODAY YOU HAVE HAD THE LORD PROMISE. Just as Israel declares [its love] for the Holy One, so does the Holy One declare [his love] for them, as stated (in vs. 18): THE LORD HAS PROCLAIMED YOU TODAY  R. Joshua ben Levi said: Just as the  upper story crushes, so is Israel going to crush four empires.

With him was Rabbi Aha, who was contemplating the Torah. Suddenly Rabbi Yossi saw a dangerous snake running after him. (Not a physical snake, but a spiritual force coming to punish him. As Rabbi Yossei possessed a high level of sanctity, God was more exacting with him for turning his mind away from the Torah. )  He said to Rabbi Aha, “Did you see that big snake that was running after me?” Rabbi Aha said, “I didn’t see it.” Rabbi Yossi bolted, the snake running after him. He fell, and when he got up blood was dripping from his nose. He heard that they were saying (Amos, 3:2), “Only you have I known among all the families of the earth, and therefore I will be exacting with you for your sins.” Rabbi Yossi said, “If I was punished in this way for because of one moment, imagine the punishment for those who give up completely!” Rabbi Yossi opened and with the verses, “For God has blessed you in all the work of your hands, He knows how you went into the great wilderness these forty years, God has been with you all the while, you have lacked nothing. (Devarim, 2:7)” “He leads you into the terrible wilderness, a place of venomous snakes and scorpions…” He explained, “Why does the verse say, ‘venomous snakes’? This was to exact punishment from Israel for any time that they separate from the Tree of Life, as it is written (Devarim, 30:20), ‘For (the Torah) is your very life and the length of your days.’ “"

The Torah teaches [Deuteronomy 11:13]: ""[If you are careful to observe My commandments...] to love God; [implying] that all that you do should only be done out of love. The Sages also said: [Psalms 112:1 instructs:] ""Desire His commandments greatly."" [Desire His commandments] and not the reward [which comes from] His commandments. In a similar manner, the great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: ""‘Do not be like servants who serve their master [for the sake of receiving a reward].’ Rather, since He is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him;"" i.e., serve [Him] out of love."

30,20,Musar,"Shemirat HaLashon, Book I, The Gate of Torah 1:14","And it is written in Chovath Halevavoth that it befits a man to reflect that if a book reached him [written by] a king of flesh and blood and he was in doubt as to its meaning because of the nature of the writing or its subtlety, or the profundity of the language, he would grieve greatly until he could understand it and he would set all of his heart and mind upon his understanding it. And if this is the case with a book of flesh and blood, who today is here and tomorrow in the grave, how much more so with the King of kings, the Holy One Blessed be He, who is his life and his salvation, as it is written (Devorim 30:20): ""For He is your life and the length of your days."""
30,20,Musar,Kav HaYashar 57:5,"One great strategy for achieving this is by clinging to the Torah, for through this one clings to the Shechinah even during one’s life. Then all the more so will one merit clinging to it after death. Thus it is related in the Zohar (Parashas Va’eschanan 268a): Rabbi Acha and Rabbi Elazar were standing together one evening after midnight engaged in study. Rabbi Elazar began a discourse: “It is written, ‘For it is your life and the length of your days that you may dwell upon the earth’ (Devarim 30:20). Come and see. The Shechinah only settles in a place where Torah is studied and in the merit of study is the world sustained. This is the meaning of the words, ‘For it is your life…that you may dwell upon the earth.’ “But if people fail to study it is said, ‘For what was the land lost? And Hashem said, ‘Because they abandoned My Torah” (Yirmeyahu 9:11-12).” Then he added: “This applies to one who is able to study and does not.” Rabbi Elazar likens this to the case of a modest and pleasant woman whose husband sets aside his conjugal duties (see Shemos 21:10) and abandons her, causing her to cry out to Heaven concerning her abandonment. "
30,20,Musar,Kav HaYashar 58:5,"The perceptive individual will note how earlier generations turned to listen to words of Torah even from the mouths of children. This was because in their great love of Torah they were eager to hear novel insights. For they knew that the Torah is our “length of days” (Devarim 30:20) and that it is a “beloved hind” (Mishlei 5:19), finding grace in the eyes of all who study it. Every Jew must love the Torah and cause it to be loved by his children and household. He must admonish them continually concerning the fulfillment of the Torah and its commandments. In particular he must admonish the women not to allow their hair to be seen, for through this sin they bring poverty upon their children, causing them to be lowly and despised. Moreover, a house in which immodesty is found is frequented by the evil Lilis, who kills the small children of the household, as has already been explained in earlier chapters (24, 56). Therefore let whoever has stumbled in the sin of wasting seed devote himself with diligence to Torah study and let him engage in four fasts of three days each. That is, he should fast for three days straight in each of the four seasons. Meanwhile let him engage in study. Then, “He will go back and heal him” (Yeshayahu 6:10), and blessings will descend upon his head and all his limbs will be clean and pure forever."
30,20,Commentary,Or HaChaim on Deuteronomy 30:20:2,"לשבת על האדמה, ""to dwell in the land, etc."" We have to read this as if the word לשבת had been prefaced with the conjunctive letter ו. Dwelling in the Holy Land is part of the attainment of completeness through performance of all parts of Torah observance. Our sages have so extolled the virtue of dwelling in the Holy Land that they said that anyone who walks in it a distance of four cubits qualifies for a share in the hereafter (Ketuvot 111)."

We are under duty to study it in order to understand and obtain a knowledge of our religion. But to study it in order to attain worldly benefits is forbidden. Our teachers said (Nedarim 62a): ""[expounding the verse:] 'to love the L-rd your G-d, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave to Him' [This means] that one should not say, 'I will read Scripture that I may be called a scholar.' I will study [mishna], that I may be called Rabbi, I will study [Talmud], to be an Elder, and sit in the assembly [of elders]; but learn out of love, and honor will come in the end."". And ""Do [good] deeds for the sake of their Maker, and speak of them [words of torah] for their own sake. Make not of them a crown wherewith to magnify yourself, nor a spade to dig with"" (ibid). And ""'Fortunate is the man that fears the L-ord, that delights greatly in His commandments' (Ps. 112:1), R. Eleazar expounds thus: 'In His commandments' but not in the reward of His commandments.

And there was an incident that the kingdom decreed in the days of Rabbi Akiva that you shall not be involved with Torah. What did Rabbi Akiva do? He took a Torah scroll and sat in the marketplace. They said to him: Our teacher, you are the greatest of Israel - do not obligate us to kill you! Have you not heard that the kingdom decreed not to be involved with Torah? He said: You fools! Regarding the Torah in which it is written ""For it is your life and the length of your days"" (Deut. 30:20), if we are involved with it, and even so they seek to kill us, if we abandoned it all the more so we would deserve destruction! And Rabbi Akiva did not listen to them and was killed. Even though they humiliate us, He sees our troubles and remembers the covenant for us, this is the meaning of ""When we were laid low, He remembered us"" - for His kindness endures forever."
30,20,Chasidut,"Likutei Moharan, Part II 78:2:1","2. Know! the Torah is the essence of life, as it is written, “for it is your life and the length of your days” (Deuteronomy 30:20). Anyone who separates from the Torah it is as if he separates from life (Zohar I, 92a). Therefore, on the face of it, the matter is puzzling and amazing. How is it possible to separate oneself from the Torah even for a short while? In fact, it is unavoidable; it is impossible to be constantly attached to the Torah, day and night, without a moment’s interruption. Every Torah devotee, including the scholar who studies Talmud and its commentators, and the like—each one commensurate with his level, according to the subject matter he studies—must absent himself from the Torah for some time during the day. The same is true also of one with deep mystical insight, and also of one who is much, much loftier. Even so, he must interrupt and set aside his perceiving for a while, because it is impossible to continuously cleave to Torah or mystical perception, without interruption. Of necessity one must stop for a while, to engage in some business or the like, because one must also care for the body’s needs."
30,20,Chasidut,"Likutei Halakhot, Orach Chaim, Laws of Phylacteries 5:5:1","So behold, the main intent of the above words, for practical application, is what I saw and heard from the mouth of Rabbeinu z""l himself, many times, that he lived new life all the time; like I heard from him many times saying, “I lived life today, such life as I had never experienced” etc. And also I heard him other times speaking a great deal about life, that the world calls everything life etc., and even regarding painful life there are many differences etc., see there in the Sichoth [CM #400], but actually the essence of life is True Longevity, which is the aspect of the Long Life of the blind one, who really lives long life, for he boasts that he is utterly old and yet utterly a suckling babe and still has not begun to live at all. For this is the essence of life: when one starts serving Hashem anew all the time, as if he has still not started serving him at all, as written (Deut. 6), “Asher anochi metzawekha hayom/Which I enjoin you today.” And our Rabbis z”l (Sifri there), commented, “Every day let them be new in your eyes;” and (ibid. 27) “Hasket ush'ma` Yisrael, hayom hazeh nihyeytha le`am laShem Eloheikha/Pay attention and listen, Yisrael: this day you are become a people to Hashem your God,” and our Rabbis z""l explained (brought in Rashi): every day let them be in your eyes as if today you have entered the covenant with him. And like I saw from Rabbeinu z""l innumerable times, that even though he had previously boasted of big and wondrous things, and revealed wondrous Torah never before heard, as he usually did — and then afterwards we saw him in great pain, and many times he laid out his pain and conversation before us from the depth of his heart, that he is extremely afflicted over how to attain being a Jew, like someone who never before smelled the spirit of serving Hashem. And whoever did not see this, it is impossible to describe it to him in writing, but a little about this is already explained in this Shevachim that are printed, and every time he would say that now he knows nothing at all, nothing nothing at all etc., even though earlier he had revealed what he revealed and boasted that he attained what he attained that is impossible to reveal; nevertheless immediately after he would say that he knows nothing at all. So the rule was that he never stood on one level, but just always quickly went from level to level in the apex of uppermost and loftiest levels, and even when he reached what he reached etc., his mind still did not grow cool to this etc. But here is not the place to prolong discussion of this, but it will be explained elsewhere. And this is truly the essence of life, when one attains always beginning anew in serving Hashem, which is truly the essence of life, as written (Deut. 30:20), “Ki hu chayeykha/It is precisely your life.” And the essence of serving Hashem is to always perform one's service anew, and to not fall into old age of the Sitra Achra; that his service not become old for him, God forbid, as Rabbeinu z""l warned us against and said it is forbidden to be old; not an old tzaddik and not an old chasid, old is not good etc., as explained in his holy Sichoth appended to Sipurei Ma`asiyoth, namely, one needs to always begin anew. And this is the essence of the long life of the holy elder who is the blind one, for he was most old and most yanik [infantile, lit. suckling], that is, the more he grew and became subsumed into holy elderliness which is the aspect of `Atik de`Atikin, the more yanik he became. For, each time he perceived that he is utterly far from Hashem Yithbarakh, for “there is no probing His greatness,” therefore the more he was subsumed into holy elderliness, the more he saw and perceived that he still has not begun living at all, until he attained the aforementioned Long Life where elderliness and infancy and united, which is totally impossible to comprehend. And this is the aspect of tefillin which are drawn from the aforementioned Elder, who is the root of the tefillin, brains, as mentioned., which are the aspect of life, as mentioned., the aspect (ibid 4), “We'atem hadeveqim baShem Eloheikhem chayim kulkhem hayom/And you that cleave to Hashem your God, all of you are live this day,” which is said of tefillin, as is known, for this is the essence of tefillin-brains, in order to attain, through the mitzwah of tefillin, living new life of holiness, to renew his days like an eagle, to begin serving Hashem Yithbarakh anew all the time, and not fall into the oldness of the Sitra Achra, to not view his devotion be as old; on the contrary, tangibly new, as if he had never ever began. For in truth, even one who is a very great tzaddiq and has labored and toiled many years in His Blessed devotion, nevertheless in accord with the Every Day Renewal of Creation, he still has not begun at all, for Hashem Yithbarakh does new things all the time, as written, “and in His goodness renews every day constantly the work of creation,” and no day is like another, and no time is like another, and each and every moment there are changes in the rising of the worlds and their order and position and conduct, in unfathomably wondrous and awesome changes. And all their vitality derives from the devotion of the man in this world, on which it all depends, from the head up to the Ein Sof. Therefore one must always serve Hashem Yithbarakh anew, in accord with the renewal of the work of creation in all the worlds needed now, and in accord with the revelation of the greatness of the Blessed Creator that needs to be revealed now. For, “Day unto day utters speech, and night unto night reveals knowledge” [Ps. 19], as every day, every night, every time and every moment, His Blessed Greatness is revealed in a new consciousness and awareness that never before existed. Therefore one needs to begin in His service new every time, in the aspect of, “Let them be like new in your eyes every day,” and this is the essence of vitality, this aforementioned aspect of long life, and as explained in Rabbeinu z""l's words, that the essence of longevity, the aspect of long life, is to see to it, every next coming day, to extend the day with additional sanctity and consciousness. For, the day, at its beginning when it comes to a man, is very narrow, and one needs to see to it to widen and lengthen it with additional sanctity all the time. And so every day one needs to see to it that each day be longer than the other, with additional sanctity and purity etc. (as explained in the Torah Pathach R' Shim`on in LM #60). And this is the essence of length of days, the aspect of long days, namely all the time beginning new in new service, with great addition. For, all the service he has performed until now, he needs to forget entirely, and now begin new, as mentioned. And by tefillin we attain this, as mentioned. And this is the essence of the mitzwah of tefillin that we lay every day, in order to attain life, the aspect of “You who cleave” as mentioned, that is, to attain the aforementioned long life, to renew is life of holiness at all times, beginning new all the time, and this is the essence of brains and life that originate are drawn from the aforementioned Most Supernal Elder, where the source of tefillin is, as mentioned, as he lives the aforementioned long life, as there, elderliness and infancy are united together, which this is the aspect of (Ps. 103), “That your youth be renewed as an eagle,” as our Rabbis z""l said (brought in Rashi there), “This eagle, the older it gets...”, that is, the older it gets, the more it renews its vitality and begins new, all the time beginning new life. And therefore he had concurrence from the Great Eagle specifically, for such vitality is the aspect of “Being renewed as an eagle” as mentioned. And the aspect of tefillin, which are the aspect of this life, is from there, as mentioned."
30,20,Talmud,Tractate Kallah Rabbati 2:14,"BARAITHA. (K 21 with variations.)  It is further related of R. Ṭarfon that he was once eating figs from his garden when his tenant found him and [not recognizing him] gave him a severe beating but [R. Ṭarfon] said nothing. When he felt that he was [almost] dying he exclaimed, ‘Woe is thee, R. Ṭarfon!’ Whereupon [the tenant] asked him, ‘Are you R. Ṭarfon?’ He replied, ‘Yes’. [The tenant] arose, tore his hair and wept. And why [did he not disclose his identity] all that [length of time]? Because he would not make use of the honour of the Torah. Hence the Rabbis declared: Whoever makes use of the crown of the Torah has no share in the World to Come. GEMARA. And R. Jonathan b. Amram learnt it from him. (i.e. he imitated R. Ṭarfon.)  For it has been taught: (B.B. 8a (Sonc. ed., pp. 33f.).)  Rabbi the Holy (i.e. R. Judah the Prince, the compiler of the Mishnah.)  ordered during the years of famine that his storehouses of wheat and foodstuffs should be thrown open. What did he do? He issued a proclamation, ‘Let all those enter who have studied the Scriptures, the Mishnah, halakoth and ’aggadoth, but let not the unlearned enter’. R. Jonathan b. Amram pushed his way through and entered. [Rabbi] asked him, ‘Have you studied the Torah at all?’ He replied, ‘No’. Whereupon [Rabbi] said to him, ‘With what can I provide you?’ He replied, ‘Master, feed me like a dog or raven’. After he had given him food, Rabbi sat grieving and repenting and exclaimed, ‘Woe is me for what I have done! I have given my bread to an ignorant person’. Thereupon R. Simeon his son said to him, ‘Perhaps he is Jonathan b. Amram, your disciple, who does not wish ever to derive material benefit from the honour of the Torah’. On investigation it was discovered that he was. [Rabbi] then issued a proclamation, ‘Let all enter’. The question was asked: Is it permissible for an ‘am ha-’areẓ to join company [on the road] with a scholar? (Cf. Pes. 49b (Sonc. ed., p. 237).)  Come and hear: [It is stated,] For that is thy life and the length of thy days. (Deut. 30, 20, referring to the Torah.)  He has no concern for his own life, (In that he neglected the Torah.)  so how can he have concern for you? Our Rabbis have taught: (Pes. 49b (Sonc. ed., p. 238) where the reading is ‘six things’.)  Five things were said of the ‘am ha-’areẓ: We do not accept evidence from him; we do not commit evidence to him; we do not join company with him on the road; we do not appoint him guardian of orphans; and we do not reveal a secret to him."
30,20,Jewish Thought,"Major Themes in Modern Philosophies of Judaism, CHAPTER 2; Franz Rosenzweig's Philosophy of Judaism 2:8","One of the keys to Rosenzweig’s inability to recognize the historical reality of Israel can be found in a short sentence to which we had occasion to refer earlier in our presentation of his ideas: “As life becomes sanctified it is no longer alive.” (Ibid., p. 55 [ibid., p. 303].)  We can hardly think of a statement less characteristic of Judaism than these words of Rosenzweig. According to him the sanctification is effected by the eternal law. A number of statements are made about the law in the third part of Der Stern, but only one aspect of the law is actually discussed and interpreted: its ritual aspect in the limited sense in which it found expression in the holy days of the Jewish year and in its liturgical formulation. But it is not in this extremely narrow sense that one can grasp the essential nature of the law. In fact, there is no safer way of missing the essential quality and purpose of the law than by trying to explain them within such a very limited and artificial frame. The law is all-embracing. It comprehends every aspect of the life of the individual as well as that of the entire Jewish people. It regulates all interhuman relationships; it lays down the principles of an economic and social order; it provides the constitution of a state—its judicial system, its civil and criminal laws. Its significance lies in the fact that it deals with the temporal life of the Jew and of the Jewish people. Its whole purpose is to give meaning and direction to the daily life of the Jew. It aims at life, this life, in time and history. Can one doubt it, for instance, in the light of the words in Deuteronomy? (Deuteronomy, 30, 19–20.)  “I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed; to love the Lord thy God, to hearken to His voice, and to cleave unto Him; for that is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.” The emphasis is forever on life on this earth in the world’s time. “Mine ordinances shall ye do, and my statutes shall ye keep to walk therein: I am the Lord your God. Ye shall therefore keep My statutes, and Mine ordinances, which if a man do, he shall live by them….” (Leviticus, 18: 4–5.)  The rabbis comment on it: “… that he shall live by them and not that he shall die by them.” (Talmud Babli, Yoma, 87/B.) "
30,20,Quoting Commentary,Rashi on Psalms 119:141:1,"I am young and despised As it is stated (I Sam. 17:14): “And David was the youngest.” I am despised to the extent that I humble myself beside those who engage in the Torah, to learn, for I have not forgotten Your precepts; [nor have I refrained] from searching and debating with them about Your righteousness that is within them [the precepts], which is righteousness and truth to eternity; and even though troubles have befallen me, they were my occupation. And forever enable me to understand their righteousness and I shall live by them (Deut. 30:20): “for it [the Torah] is your life and the length of your days.”"
34,12,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, On the Book of Deuteronomy and Its Structure 2-39","DEUTERONOMY HOLDS A UNIQUE POSITION, AND SPEAKS WITH A UNIQUE VOICE, IN THE literature of the Torah. Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry. An ancient name for Deuteronomy, mishne tora—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.” From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in (the country) across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners. The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion. Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (Ex. 4:10), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature. Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books). But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were. It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal. That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 B.C.E.) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem. It is within this setting that Chapter  22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD.” … Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded … saying: “Go, inquire of the LORD for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the LORD … because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (22:8, 10–13, New Revised Standard Version) What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. … he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the LORD. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the LORD, to follow the LORD, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (23:1–3) The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy. The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be. The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (1:5) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world. In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century B.C.E., which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in Ex. 19–24. Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and Psalm 29 are two fruitful examples of the process). Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of one God for one people in one land observing one cult” (italics his). Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines: I   Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; 1–4:43) A   Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (1–3) B   Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (4:1–40) and Addendum on Towns of Asylum (4:41–43) II  Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 4:44–11:36) Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; 12–28) A   The Laws (12–26) B   Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (27–28) IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; 29–30) Looking Ahead to Exile and Return V  Final Matters (31–34) A   Passing the Mantle (31) B   Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (32) C   Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (33) D   The End (34) A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day …,” 11:26 and 30:15). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (30:19), a good life on the land under the blessing of God. It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation 2-3","THE FIRST TWO PARTS OF DEUTERONOMY RECALLED THE PAST IN SOME DETAIL; THE third envisioned the particulars of Israel’s future life on its land—or, if we take the book in the context of Israelite monarchy, set forth a code of behavior for the present. The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity. This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,"The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox, Deuteronomy, Part IV; Concluding Exhortation, Exile and Return 2","A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches. Also noteworthy is the sevenfold use of Heb. shuv (“return / restore”)."

30,20,Chasidut,"Tanya, Part IV; Iggeret HaKodesh 4:7","Now, concerning the excision of the prepuce itself it is written: “And you shall excise the prepuce of your heart,” i.e., you, by yourselves. But the removal of the thin membrane is a difficult matter for man, and of this it was said that with the coming of the Messiah “the L–rd, your G–d, will circumcise your heart…to love the L–rd your G–d with all your heart and all your soul, for the sake of your life,” (Deuteronomy 30:6. See the commentary of Nachmanides, ad loc.)  i.e., because the L–rd alone is literally your whole life. (This unique interpretation may be better understood by quoting a passage from Kuntres Hahitpaalut, by the author’s son, R. Dov Ber of Lubavitch, where this oft-quoted principle is elucidated: “It is written (Deuteronomy 30:20): ‘to love the L–rd your G–d, for He is your life.’ (The verse uses the masculine term for ‘He’—הוא, translit.: Hu.) It is impossible to explain that ‘for Hu is your life’ refers to ‘to love the L–rd’—i.e., that this love is your life. For if so, it would have to say ‘for היא (translit.: He, the feminine gender, since the Hebrew for love—ahavah—is a feminine word)…. Why then does it say ‘for Hu…’? No doubt that the meaning of this passage is intelligible to all, that is, that ‘for Hu is your life’ is a reason given: why should you love (the L–rd)? Because ‘He is your life.’” (Beginning of Kuntres Hahitpaalut; see also Iggeret Hateshuvah, ch. 9.))  That is why this love (The love spoken of in the verse quoted, which follows after the Divine excision of the heart’s thin membrane.)  stems from the depth of the heart, from the truly innermost point, as mentioned above, and transcends the faculty of daat."

Hence: “G-d spoke all these words:”The word: וידבר here is to indicate that G-d said these words to Himself, in a preparatory manner; subsequently, the word: לאמור, refers to the final draft of this address by G-d to the people.“I am the Lord your G-d;” this is what Job meant when he said: (Job 28,2728) אז ראה ויספרה, הכינה וגם הקרה ויאמר לאדם, “then He saw and gauged it; He measured it and probed it and said to man etc.:” the Torah teaches you what are good manners, i.e. that even if you are an erudite scholar do not be arrogant enough when facing a crowd until after you have weighed carefully every word that you are going to say. You will do well to practice what you are going to say two or three times before actually addressing your words to an assembly of people. It happened once to Rabbi Akiva in a synagogue (Tanchuma item 15 on our verse) that the sages called upon him to read publicly from the Torah scroll, i.e. to accept an aliyah. He declined the honour. When his students asked him why he had declined, quoting that he had taught them a verse in Deuteronomy 30,20, according to which reading from the Torah in public is one of the highest achievements in your life, so how could he refuse such a request? He answered them that indeed this was so, but that he had declined to do so as he had not previously reviewed this particular portion and it would be an insult to the congregation to presume to read to them unprepared as he had been. He should have first gone over that text at least two or three times. He quoted our verse from the Torah as the source of his reticence. If G-d had not addressed the Jewish people before having marshaled His thoughts first, how could he permit himself to do less?"

30,20,Talmud,Berakhot 55a:8,"The Gemara details the biblical sources for these cases: One who is given the Torah scroll to read and he does not read, as it is written of the Torah: “It is your life and the length of your days” (Deuteronomy 30:20). A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you” (Genesis 12:3); one who blesses is blessed and one who does not bless does not merit a blessing. And with regard to one who conducts himself with an air of superiority, as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers, as evidenced by the order in the verse: “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation” (Exodus 1:6)? Because he conducted himself with an air of superiority, and those who did not serve in a leadership role lived on after he died."
30,20,Talmud,Berakhot 61b:7,"Rabbi Akiva answered him: I will relate a parable. To what can this be compared? It is like a fox walking along a riverbank when he sees fish gathering and fleeing from place to place.  The fox said to them: From what are you fleeing? They said to him: We are fleeing from the nets that people cast upon us. He said to them: Do you wish to come up onto dry land, and we will reside together just as my ancestors resided with your ancestors?  The fish said to him: You are the one of whom they say, he is the cleverest of animals? You are not clever; you are a fool. If we are afraid in the water, our natural habitat which gives us life, then in a habitat that causes our death, all the more so.  The moral is: So too, we Jews, now that we sit and engage in Torah study, about which it is written: “For that is your life, and the length of your days” (Deuteronomy 30:20), we fear the empire to this extent; if we proceed to sit idle from its study, as its abandonment is the habitat that causes our death, all the more so will we fear the empire."
30,20,Jewish Thought,Akeidat Yitzchak 59:1:5,"The meaning of our opening aggadah is as follows. If you refrain from contact with your wife during the seven days of the menstrual cycle, tum-ah, you will merit the blessing of the eighth day, i.e. circumcision, which symbolises ascendancy over the spirit of impurity, attainment of purity. Since ""seven days"" represent the ""creation cycle,"" the number seven always reminds man both of his duties and of his limitations on this planet. "
30,20,Talmud,Avot DeRabbi Natan 2:2,"There is a story of a man who studied much Scripture and much Mishnah, and devotedly served the great Torah scholars – and yet he died in middle age. So his wife took his tefillin and went to the synagogues and study houses, and would scream and cry and say to them: My masters! It is written in your Torah (Deuteronomy 30:20), “For it is your life, and the length of your days.” But my husband studied so much Scripture, and so much Mishnah, and served the Torah scholars so devotedly – so why did he die in middle age? No one there had anything to say in response. Then one day, Elijah the prophet visited her and said: My daughter, why are you screaming and crying? She said to him: Master, my husband studied so much Scripture, and so much Mishnah, and devotedly served the Torah scholars – and yet he died in middle age. He said to her: When you were in your period [of impurity], did he come near you during the first (three) days? She said to him, “God forbid! He never touched me with even his little finger. And he would say to me, Do not even touch the dishes, lest they bring (me) to doubt [whether or not I am impure]. [Elijah continued:] And during the latter days, did he come near you? She said to him: Master, I ate with and drank with him, and slept with him in the same bed fully clothed, and yes, his flesh would touch my flesh – but we never had any intention of doing anything else. He said to her: Blessed is the Omnipresent God who killed him! For so it is written in the Torah (Leviticus 18:19), “Do not come near a woman during her period of impurity.” It says (Leviticus 18:6), “None of you shall come near any of his own flesh.” Because of this, they said: A man should not be alone with (any) women in an inn, even with his sister or his daughter, because of what people will think. He should not chat with a woman in the marketplace, even with his own wife, let alone with another woman, because of what people will claim. A man should not follow a woman in the marketplace, not even his own wife, let alone another woman, because of what people will claim. It says here, “None of you shall come near,” and then it says further on [in the verse], “Do not come near.” Do not come near something that causes you to sin. Stay away from ugliness, and even something similar to ugliness. (Therefore) the sages said: Stay away from a minor sin, for it may bring you to a major sin. And run to [perform] a minor mitzvah (commandment), for it will bring you to [perform] a major mitzvah. It says (Song of Songs 7:3), “Your belly is like a heap of wheat, surrounded by a hedge of lilies.” “Your belly is [like] a heap of wheat” – that refers to the congregation of Israel. “Surrounded by a hedge of lilies” – that refers to the seventy elders. Another interpretation: “Your belly is a heap of wheat” – these are the minor, easy commandments. “Surrounded by a hedge of lilies” – when Israel performs mitzvot [commandments], they are taken into the life of the World to Come. How does this happen? When one’s wife is in her period [of impurity], and she is with him in his house, he wants to sleep with her – he wants to, but he does not. Will anyone see him, or will anyone know, or say anything to him? He is only afraid of the one who checks the immersion [at the mikveh]. You could say the same about [taking] challa [for the priests], and you could say that same about [giving] the first shearing [of wool to the priests]. These are minor, easy commandments – like lilies – but when Israel performs them, they are taken into the life of the World to Come."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,Derekh Chayyim 4:5:5,"However there is another reason: It is because, from the angle of itself, it is more appropriate that the Torah exist in the world than that material things exist in the world - such that their existence is not as appropriate as something spiritual. For existence is appropriate for the Torah. And that is because the Torah is good itself, as it is stated (Proverbs 4:2), ""I give you a good doctrine."" And it is appropriate that good exist, as we have written (Derekh Chayim 1:2). For that is why it is stated in all of the story of creation (Genesis 1), ""that it was good"" - to tell you that it is appropriate for the good to exist. Moreover, it is because it is most appropriate for spiritual things to exist. And we have explained this thing in several places as well: It is because absence does not cling to spiritual things. So behold, it is written in the Torah (Deuteronomy 30:20), ""for it is your life and the length of your days."" And if so, existence is appropriate for the Torah, in that it is what gives existence. It is just that from the angle of this world, which is material - so this world is far from the spiritual - that is why the spiritual Torah is not found in this material world [so much]. But soon, 'before we call out,' the lower beings will be aroused to the spiritual Torah, 'and it will answer,' ""Here I am!"" As existence is appropriate for spiritual things."
30,20,Quoting Commentary,Derekh Chayyim 5:23:15,"And afterwards, he added to say (Avot 5:21), ""Five years [is the age] for [the study of] Scripture, etc."" - to make known the content of man and the continuation of his existence and goal, until his end - it is all to elucidate the content of this individual person. So afterwards, he mentions the level of a person, from the angle of the Torah [that he studies]. For this thing is higher than the level of man alone; for the Torah is completely above the world, as we have explained. And this will be explained further in the chapter [entitled] Shanu (Derekh Chayim 6:2). As from the angle of man himself, death is necessitated by man; but the Torah is above this. For it is the life of man - as it is stated (Deuteronomy 30:20), ""for it is your life and the length of your days."" And that is why he placed this statement of, ""Search in it and search in it, since everything is in it,"" after he said, ""one hundred, is [the age at which one is] as if [...] passed away, and ceased from the world."" [Hence] he mentioned the three parts of man, one after the other - meaning, corresponding to his body, to his soul and to his intellect, which is the Torah. For these three things are 'all of man.' And afterwards, he ordered the final goal that man has, which is reward. So he said, ""According to the pain is the reward"" - and that thing is the goal of man. And all of these things are very orderly."
30,20,Midrash,Aggadat Bereshit 66:1,"Chapter (65) 66: Writings [1] A song of ascents. Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth, let Israel now say— (Psalm 129:1) See, O LORD, the distress I am in! My heart is in anguish, [*Lit.  “My heart has turned over within me”; cf. Exod. 14.5; Hos. 11.8.I know how wrong I was ] To disobey. Outside the sword deals death; Indoors, the plague. (Lamentations 1:20) The Knesset of Israel said: ""Master of the Universe, you saw fit for us to experience suffering, as it is written 'With him who wrote with me, I am in distress' (Psalm 91:15). Behold, we are in distress, and it is good for You. Until now, Israel would say of themselves that no one had risen up against them like Balaam the wicked. Our rabbis said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Pazi that when Balak sent Balaam to curse Israel, Balaam said to him, 'What are you doing? Do you want to anger the Lord who is with them? They are like two people who are inseparable. If one of them is hit, it is as if both are hit. The Lord is like this with Israel. If I curse them, it is as if I am touching Him.' As it says, How can I damn whom God [God Heb El, as often in these poems.] has not damned, How doom when יהוה has not doomed? (Numbers 23:8). Similarly, Jeremiah says, 'For as the girdle cleaves to the loins of a man' (Jeremiah 13:11). When will this happen? When what Moses said is fulfilled: 'You shall love the Lord your God and listen to His voice, and you shall cling to Him' (Deuteronomy 30:20). Therefore, David said: ""Though I walk through  [*Others “the valley of the shadow of death.”] a valley of deepest darkness, I fear no harm, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff—they comfort me. (Psalm 23:4)"
30,20,Halakhah,"Abudarham, Weekday Prayers, Amidah 61","And compassion upon all of us, all your people Israel: is based on “As a father has compassion for his children,so Adonai has compassion for those who fear Him.” (Ps. 103:13) Bless us, our Father, all of us as one with the light of Your countenance: in other words, You the One God and we are the children of Abraham who is called “One,” as is written, “Abraham was one (man),” (Ez. 33:24) and, “For he was “one” when I called him.” (Is. 51:2) and so we are called “one” nation, as it is written, “And who is like Your people Israel, “one” nation on earth.” (II Sam. 7:23) If so, “Bless all of us as one. One says: By the light of your countenance: is based on the Priestly benediction in which is written, “Shine Your light upon us and be gracious to us,” (Nu. 6:25) and,”They shall walk in the light of Your presence.” (Ps. 89:16) For by the light of Your countenance You gave us Adonai our God, a Torah of life: is based on,“For the commandment is a lamp, the teaching is a light;” (Pro. 6:23) light is greater than a lamp.  (Why is the lamp of Mitzvah less than the light of Torah? See BT Sota 21a – The Gemara asks: Does the merit of a mitzvah protect one so much as to delay her punishment? But isn’t it taught in a baraita: Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei interpreted this verse homiletically: “For the mitzvah is a lamp and the Torah is light” (Pro. 6:23). The verse associates the mitzvah with a lamp and the Torah with the light of the sun. The mitzvah is associated with a lamp in order to say to you: Just as a lamp does not protect one by its light extensively but only temporarily, while the lamp is in one’s hand, so too, a mitzvah protects one only temporarily, i.e., while one is performing the mitzvah. Also see Rashi on Pro.6:23)  Of life: refers to Torah, as is stated, “For thereby you shall have long life.” (Deut. 30:20) Love: is based on, “With eternal love I have loved you.” (Jer. 31:3) Kindliness, Righteousness: is based on, “Bestow Your loving kindness on those devoted to You, and Your beneficence on upright people.” (Ps. 36:11) And compassion, blessing and peace: as we have explained above. And good in Your sight to bless us: in other words ‘may it be good in your sight.” To bless your people Israel with much strength and peace, :is based on, “May Adonai grant strength to His people; may Adonai bestow on His people with peace.” (Ps. 29:11) Blessed are You, Adonai, who blesses His people Israel with peace:as it is stated, “I will grant peace in the land.” (Lev. 26:6)"
30,20,Tanakh,"Covenant and Conversation Family Edition, Bamidbar, I; Egalitarian Society, Jewish Style 16","It is the same with us Jews. Now we sit and study Torah, about which it is written: “For that is your life, and the length of your days” (Devarim 30:20). If we fear the Romans now, imagine how much more so if we stop studying Torah, which is the source of our life!"
