But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account.

This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself.

In Levine’s view, most of Chapters 25–36 function to establish matters of importance in the priestly view, just as in Chapters 1–10. Here law takes precedence over narrative.", "Despite the varied subject matter of this section, it holds together structurally, via the common biblical technique of word (sound) repetition. The rather common verb <i>tzivvah</i>, “command,” weaves through every one of Chapters 26–36, except for 33. Sometimes it introduces what God wants the Israelites to do; sometimes it leads to the formula of fulfillment, “as YHWH commanded the Children of Israel, so they did”; still other times it refers to a command given by Moshe himself. The entire section begins with the verb (26:4), and ends with it as well (36:13). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking.", "Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. 26), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come-near” (27:1 and 36:1). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it.", "Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again.", "What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy.", "<img>", "<b><i>Num. 26:3</i> Moshe spoke, and El’azar the priest, to them in the Plains of Moav …</b>"], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the statement \"all seven days\" is based on a simple computation of the three \"three days ago\" mentioned in the verse. Meir Ayin notes that this statement is quoted in Yalqut Shemot 152.</i> as it is written: \"And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.\" (Exodus 4:10). \"Heretofore\" is three days, and three [times] \"neither, nor, nor,\" and the day on which He was speaking, in all seven days. And this section was [at the time of] Passover, and they fix it on the 15th of Nissan.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that this follows from his commentary on the preceding chapter, that the ten plagues took a full year from the time Moses was first sent to Pharaoh.  He also notes that in a different midrashic source (Exodus Rabbah 9(12)) it is stated that the duration of each plague was one month; hence, there would not have been time to accommodate the entire sequence of ten plagues in half a year. R. Jacob Emdin notes that he already explained this in chapter 3. Meir Ayin notes that the statement \"and they fix it on the 15th of Nissan\" is not found in the Yalqut. </i>  And in that same time the next year, the Children of Israel went out from Egypt. Also on the 15th of Nisan was our father Abraham spoken to at the Covenant Between the Pieces,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that the Covenant Between the Pieces and the Exodus both happened on the same calendar date, Nisan 15, \"exactly on that day.\" (Ex. 12:41).   Meir Ayin notes that this tradition is found in Tanhuma Buber, Beshallah 9.</i> on the 15th of Nisan the angels came to our forefather Abraham to announce to him [the birth of Isaac], and in that same Section of the year following was Isaac born,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is in accordance with Genesis 18:14: \"At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.\" Meir Ayin notes that Tanhuma, Pequdei 11, places the birth of Isaac on Nisan 1.</i>  as it is written \"At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son\" (Genesis 18:14), and on the 15th of Nisan the Children of Israel went out from Egypt, as it is written \"And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt\" (Exodus 12:41), [that is] one term for all [of these events]. On the 14th [of Nisan] the Children of Israel slaughtered their Passover offerings in Egypt, and on the fifth day [after that] was the last festival day of Passover. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to Seder Olam, Passover started on a Friday. This is also the opinion of Rashi and Tosaphot (Sabbath 87b). R. Jacob Emdin notes that in Megillah 8a it is reported that the Rabbis disagree about the date of the Exodus. In the opinion of R. Yose, it was on a Friday and in the opinion of R. Yehuda, it was on a Tuesday. According to all Babylonian sources, the giving of the Torah was on a Sabbath, and the day of the giving of the Torah is the holiday of Shavuot, which is 50 days after Passover.  Hence, in Babylonian tradition Passover started on a Friday.  R. Jacob Emdin explains that the 14th of Nisan, the day of slaughtering the Paschal lamb, was a Thursday, and that the Children of Israel left Egypt the next morning, Friday the 15th. He adds that it is explicitly stated in the Bible that they travelled day and night; hence, it is reasonable to assume that the places mentioned in the Biblical narrative are places of rest, one per day.  The argument for placing the Exodus on a Friday is that according to Jewish tradition, Pentecost was on a Sabbath, as derived from Ex. 13:3: \"Remember this day, in which ye came out of Egypt\" and Ex. 20:8: \"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" By applying the principle \"Scripture does not come to hide but to explain,\" one sees that since Ex. 13:3 was spoken on the 15th of Nisan, also Ex. 20:8 refers to a Sabbath.  Since the giving of the Torah was 50 days after the Exodus, the Exodus must have been on a Friday. R. Jacob Emdin notes that according to the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 8a) the Children of Israel left Rameses, the first station of their journey to the Red Sea, on a Sabbath, since Scripture does not specifically state that they travelled for seven days. However, Meir Ayin notes that the text here reflects the opinion of the Babylonian Talmud, Sabbath 8a, that \"the 14th [of Nisan] the Children of Israel slaughtered their Passover offerings in Egypt,\" while in the Yalqut it says \"on the 14th day the Children of Israel slaughtered their Passover offerings in Egypt and the day was Wednesday.\" </i>  And in that night the firstborn [of Egypt] were stricken. From the day after Passover,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the term \"Passover\" here refers to the ritual of slaughtering the Paschal lamb on the afternoon of the 14th of Nisan.</i>  which was a Friday, they travelled from Rameses, as it is written: \"And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children\" (Exodus 12:37), and it is written \"And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the Lord had smitten among them: upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments\" (Numbers 33:3-4).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse states explicitly that the Children of Israel left Egypt on the day after the slaughtering of the Passover sacrifice. R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that according to Seder Olam, the Children of Israel traveled day and night, resting only one day at each of the places mentioned in the Exodus narrative.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that there is a disagreement in the Talmud (Shabbat 8a) regarding the day on which the Children of Israel left Rameses. According to Rab, it was on a Friday, while according to Shmuel, it was on a Sunday. The former opinion is adopted by Rashi, the latter by Tosafot.  </i> From Rameses they traveled to Succoth, and from Succoth to Etham, and from Etham to Pi-hahiroth, in all three days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication is that the places mentioned in the list of Num. 33 are resting places for the Israelites.</i>  On the fourth day, \"And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled\" (Exodus 14:5).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The news that the Children of Israel had left their assigned place of residence reached Pharaoh on the day following their arrival at Pi-hahiroth.</i> On the fifth and the sixth, \"And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon\" (Exodus 14:9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this disagrees with Rashi, who thinks that Pi-hahiroth was close to Egypt, just two days away from the last place where Pharaoh resided. The implication of Seder Olam is that there were at least five days between Pharaoh's residence and Pi-hahiroth.</i> In the evening of the seventh day, they went down to the sea, as it is written \"And the cloud and darkness [were there, but it gave] light by night [to them]\" (Exodus 14:20).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The implication here is that the sea split during the night, and the Egyptians were drowned the next morning.</i> In the morning, Israel went up from the sea, and Egypt sank, and in that hour the Children of Israel said the song, as it is written \"Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord\" (Exodus 15:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that since Iyyar 1 was a Sabbath, it follows that Nisan 14, the day on which the Children of Israel slaughtered the Passover sacrifice in Egypt, was a Thursday. The statement that the Israelites sang the song of the sea on the last festival day of Passover disagrees with the Midrash (Exodus Rabbah 23(11), Mechilta Beshallah 4, Shirata 3) that Moses and the Children of Israel said the song on the seventh day after the crossing of the Red Sea, when Miriam and the women sang and danced with timbrels.  Guggenheimer explains that according to R. Yehoshua in the Mekhilta, Exodus 15:1, the Children of Israel sang on the holiday of the last day of Passover but Miriam and the women sang and danced on Sabbath, the seventh day after the crossing.</i> And the day was Thursday, and it was the last festival day of Passover. <br>From the Red Sea they traveled to Marah, as it is written \"And they came to Marah\" (Exodus 15:23). And it says \"And he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them\" (Exodus 15:25).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meir Ayin notes that this is explained in Sanhedrin 56b, Yalqut Beshallah 117, and the Mekhilta.</i> There were given to the Children of Israel ten commandments; of them, seven were already commanded to the Children of Noah, as it is written: \"And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat\" (Genesis 2:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that \"commanded\" here refers to the giving of laws. Meir Ayin cites Sanhedrin 56b.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that this is explained in Sanhedrin 56b.</i> \"Commanded\" - these are the judgments,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The detailed argument for deriving the seven Noahide commandments from Gen. 2:16-17 is given in the Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 56b, in the name of R. Yohanan.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that in some manuscripts of Seder Olam and the Talmud, the wording of the arguments is almost identical.  He explains that in Yerushalmi sources, the six commandments given to Adam are: recognition of God, prohibition of idolatry, prohibition of murder, prohibition of adultery, prohibition of robbery, and establishment of courts.  The prohibition of eating limbs of a live animal was added for Noah, since before the Flood only vegetarian food was permitted.  In Genesis Rabbah, R. Jacob of Kfar Hanin notes that the verse Gen. 2:17 also contains a hint to the future prohibition of eating limbs of a live animal.  Guggenheimer notes that the detailed derivation of the seven Noahide laws from Gen. 2:16-17 presented here is based on the hermeneutic principle of \"gezerah shavah\" (\"equal decree\"), that all words of God in the Pentateuch have the same meaning.  He explains that the verse Gen. 2:16 only serves as mnemonic device, since all seven laws are explicitly stated elsewhere in Genesis: the prohibition of incest and adultery in 2:24 and the prohibition of murder in 9:6.  He also explains that the term \"law\" (\"dinim\") in the text refers to the specific laws mentioned in Ex. 21-23, while the term \"ordinance\" (\"hukim\") refers to ritual laws.</i> and so it says \"For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him\" (Genesis 18:19). And it is written \"[to do] justice and judgment.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the term \"judgment\" refers to the appointment of courts. He notes that constitutional safeguards regarding the testimony of relatives, the composition of the court, and the right of appeal were only added at Marah, and before that they were not applicable to gentiles.</i> \"The Lord\" this is the blasphemy of the [Divine] Name, as it is written \"And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death\" (Leviticus 24:16).  \"God\" - this is idolatry,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the term \"God\" here refers to the prohibition of worshipping any deity besides God.</i> as it is written:  \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" (Exodus 20:3). \"The man\"-  this is bloodshed,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that the term \"man\" (Adam) here refers to the prohibition of murder.</i> as it is written: \"Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed\" (Genesis 9:6). \"Saying\"-  this is adultery,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that in some manuscripts one finds a tradition that the prohibition of adultery was derived from the verse (Ex. 20:14): \"Thou shalt not commit adultery.\" In his opinion, this is a later addition, probably taken from Leviticus Rabbah 23.  He notes that the Talmud (Yevamot 11:12) understands the prohibition of adultery to be derived from the verse (Gen. 2:24): \"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.\"  Guggenheimer explains that \"saying\" refers to adultery by gezerah shavah from the verse in Jeremiah: \"Saying, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord.\" (Jeremiah 3:1). Since there are no divorces for non-Jews, the verse in Jeremiah cannot apply to gentiles and therefore must be taken as symbolic.  R. Jacob Emdin notes that this is explained in Sanhedrin 56b.</i> as it is written \"Saying, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord\" (Jeremiah 3:1). \"Of every tree of the garden\" this is robbery, as it is written: \"or anything else about which one swore falsely, that person shall repay the principal amount and add a fifth part to it.\" (Leviticus 5:24). And R. Hiyya taught: \"[produce] that is guarded on the roof is forbidden because of [the laws of] robbery, and [produce] that is not guarded on the roof is permitted because of [the laws of] robbery.\" \"Thou mayest freely eat\" - this is [the prohibition of eating] a limb from a live animal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this is based on Genesis 9:4: \"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.\"</i> as it is written: \"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.\" (Genesis 9:4). The Children of Israel added to these at that time [Sabbath], the laws, and the honoring of father and mother.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to R. Yehoshua (Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ismael, Beshallah 1, ed. Horovitz-Rabin p. 156) \"ordinances\" (\"hukim\") refer to the Sabbath, and \"laws\" (\"dinim\") refer to the honoring of father and mother.  In his opinion, since the Sabbath was given before the Children of Israel arrived at Sinai (Ex. 16) and \"as I commanded you\" refers to a commandment given at Marah, the commandment to honor one's parents must also have been given at Marah.  In a different tradition (Jerusalem Talmud, Bezah 2:1, fol. 61a) it is discussed whether the Sabbath was given at Marah or at Alush, the station before Rephidim (Num. 33:13, Ex. 16:1). R. Jacob Emdin explains that the statement that the Children of Israel received the Ten Commandments at Marah refers to the specific rulings on the thirty-nine categories of forbidden work on the Sabbath, as opposed to the general prohibition to work on Sabbath that was given earlier.  He notes that this agrees with the general approach of Seder Olam, that if a matter is stated in general terms, it was already given before; a subsequent statement of details of the law implies that before that the general law was already known.</i><br>From Marah they travelled to Elim, as it is written: \"And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they encamped there\" (Numbers 33:9).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meir Ayin notes that the verse implies that the Children of Israel encamped only near water.</i> So we learn [from here] that the Children of Israel only encamped near water.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that \"near water\" means that they encamped near a sufficient source of water, for example, a spring or a well. </i> From Elim they travelled to Alush,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The resting place before Rephidim is called \"Wilderness of Sin\" in Exodus (16:1) and \"Alush\" in the list of Numbers 33.  Meir Ayin notes that in Keddushin 38a, the location is given as \"Alush\".</i> as it is written: \"And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt\" (Exodus 16:1).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meir Ayin notes that in this verse we see that Alush was in the Wilderness of Sin.</i> And it was Sabbath. So we learn that the first [day] of Iyyar was on Sabbath, and in addition we learn [from here] that the Children of Israel ate of the cakes that they brought out in their hands from Egypt for thirty full days,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that in the Mechilta to Exodus 15:1 it is stated that the Children of Israel ate of the unleavened bread they took from Egypt for 30 days, and on that day it was finished. In the evening they ate quail and in the morning they collected manna.  Guggenheimer notes that according to R. Yehoshua in the Mekhilta, Israel arrived at Alush on Sunday and rested there on the next day, Monday.  However, manuscripts of Seder Olam put the day of rest at Alush on Sabbath and this is the reading of most Yerushalmi sources. R. Eliyahu from Vilna points out that the Babylonian Talmud (Sabbath 87b) notes that it is possible that Israel arrived at Alush on Sabbath if one assumes that the month of Iyyar of that year had 30 days. Meir Ayin notes that Keddushin 38a gives the 15th of Iyyar as the date the Children of Israel arrived at Alush.</i> and on that day it finished. And in the evening they ate quail and in the morning they collected the manna. And at Alush they were given the Sabbath,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Guggenheimer notes that the statement that the rules of Sabbath observance were given at Alush contradicts R. Yehoshua's opinion in the Mekhilta (Beshallah 1, ed. Horovitz-Rabin, p. 156) that the rules of Sabbath were given at Marah, and therefore the Babylonian Talmud (Sabbath 87b) notes that it is possible that the Children of Israel arrived at Alush on Sabbath if one assumes that they made the month of Iyyar 30 days long. However, Guggenheimer prefers to follow the manuscript readings against the reading of the editio princeps. R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that in Ashkenazic manuscripts one reads here \"Sabbath,\" not \"Sunday.\"  He explains that this is the reading of the Mekhilta. R. Jacob Emdin notes that Seder Olam is of the opinion here that at Alush the Israelites received the commandments regarding \"techum Shabbat\" (\"Sabbath limit\"), the prohibition to leave the camp on Sabbath, but that they did not yet observe the laws of Sabbath since the verse Ex. 16:22 states that \"on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread,\" implying that on the following Sabbath, they left the camp to gather manna.  Meir Ayin, quoting Keddushin 38a, states that they learned that at Alush the Children of Israel received the law of \"techum Shabbat.\"</i> and there the Children of Israel kept the first Sabbath, as it is written \"And the people rested on the seventh day\" (Exodus 16:30). On Sunday, on the 23rd of Iyyar, they travelled from Alush and came to Rephidim,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Meir Ayin notes that this is derived from the fact that Alush was in the Wilderness of Sin.</i> and there the well was given to them, and they fought with Amalek, and there they observed the second Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that at Alush they received the law of Sabbath but they did not yet observe it. They only started to observe Sabbath after their victory over Amalek.</i> They travelled from Rephidim and came to the wilderness of Sinai, and found its top in clouds of glory. All five days was Moses ascending to the top of the mountain, and descending, and telling the people the words of the Omnipresent, and returning their answer to the Omnipresent.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The five days were Sivan 2-6.  R. Eliyahu from Vilna notes that this proves that Moses went up to the mountain every day at dawn and that he did not ascend the mountain more than once on any given day. Meir Ayin notes that the five days are a later addition to the text.</i>  In the third month, on the sixth of the month, the Ten Commandments were given to them; that was Sabbath.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">R. Eliyahu from Vilna explains that according to R. Aqiba (Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashanah 11b), the Ten Commandments were given to Israel on the seventh day of the week, the seventh day of the month, and the seventh day of their encampment at Sinai.  However, this chronology is impossible to accept if the holiday of Shavuot, the \"time of the giving of the Torah,\" was on Sabbath, the 50th day after the Exodus.  Therefore, Seder Olam follows here the chronology of R. Yose the Galilean (Babylonian Talmud, Rosh Hashana 11a). Meir Ayin notes that this is a Baraita and not according to R. Yose, but to the Sages.</i>  ", "versionTitle": "Seder Olam Translation Draft", "license": "", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "53f17a31fbfba22336ea749d", "index_title": "Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim on Numbers", "category": "Commentary", "type": "commentary", "ref": "Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim on Numbers 33:13:1", "anchorRef": "Numbers 33:13", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 33:13"], "sourceRef": "Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim on Numbers 33:13:1", "sourceHeRef": "קיצור בעל הטורים על במדבר ל״ג:י״ג:א׳", "anchorVerse": 13, "sourceHasEn": false, "compDate": [1280, 1340], "commentaryNum": 13.0001, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Kitzur Ba'al HaTurim", "he": "קיצור בעל הטורים "}, "heTitle": "קיצור בעל הטורים על במדבר", "he": "<b>באלוש</b> נתן להם המן בזכות לושי ועשי עגות:", "heVersionTitle": "On Your Way", "heLicense": "Public Domain", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "ובלכתך בדרך", "text": [], "versionTitle": null, "license": null, "versionTitleInHebrew": null}, {"_id": "59b79eb4d6e4a972e7b7f5ce", "index_title": "Chomat Anakh on Torah", "category": "Commentary", "type": "commentary", "ref": "Chomat Anakh on Torah, Numbers 33:13:1", "anchorRef": "Numbers 33:13", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 33:13"], "sourceRef": "Chomat Anakh on Torah, Numbers 33:13:1", "sourceHeRef": "חומת אנך על תורה, במדבר ל״ג:י״ג:א׳", "anchorVerse": 13, "sourceHasEn": false, "compDate": [1784, 1804], "commentaryNum": 13.0001, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Chomat Anakh", "he": "חומת אנך"}, "heTitle": "במדבר", "he": "<b>ויחנו באלוש.</b> בנחל קדומים כתבתי משם גאוני קמאי בספר רבינו אפרים ז״ל כי באלוש ירד להם המן בזכות שרה ושרה זו יסכ״ה בגימטריא המ״ן ע״ש ועתה ראיתי שכן כתב בספר פענח רזא ע״ש:", "heVersionTitle": "Chomat Anakh, Jerusalem 1965", "heLicense": "", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "חומת אנ״ך, ירושלים 1965", "text": [], "versionTitle": null, "license": null, "versionTitleInHebrew": null}, {"_id": "5d6f8963a0ef0c006f0caa5e", "index_title": "Nachal Kedumim on Torah", "category": "Commentary", "type": "commentary", "ref": "Nachal Kedumim on Torah, Numbers 33:13:1", "anchorRef": "Numbers 33:13", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 33:13"], "sourceRef": "Nachal Kedumim on Torah, Numbers 33:13:1", "sourceHeRef": "נחל קדומים על תורה, במדבר ל״ג:י״ג:א׳", "anchorVerse": 13, "sourceHasEn": false, "compDate": [1768, 1792], "commentaryNum": 13.0001, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Nachal Kedumim", "he": "נחל קדומים"}, "heTitle": "במדבר", "he": "<b>ויחנו באלוש.</b> שם ירד להם המן בזכות שרה שנאמר בה לושי ועשי עוגות. כך כתוב בלקוטי גאוני קמאי אשכנז בספר רבינו אפרים ז\"ל. וכתב עוד יסכה גימטריא המן. ולפי מה שכתבנו בעניותנו לדרוש לשבח לשרה אמנו ע\"ה דאברהם אע\"ה אמר שלש סאים וסתמא הם קמח והשיבה שרה אע\"ה קמח סלת כלומר נראה כונתך קמח אבל סלת אעשה וממ\"ש אברהם כן מוכח דהאשה עינה צרה דכבר נודע דהיה ותרן גדול אבל שרה יצאה מכללן והיא שרה ולא צרה. השתא א\"ש דשרה אמרה אלוש סלת. ולזה במסע אלוש זכו למן בזכות שרה ודוק היטב:", "heVersionTitle": "Nachal Kedumim, Warsaw, 1889", "heLicense": "Public Domain", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "נחל קדומים, וורשא תרמ\"ט", "text": [], "versionTitle": null, "license": null, "versionTitleInHebrew": null}, {"_id": "606ae1470253386bb13782d0", "index_title": "Ibn Ezra on Exodus; Perush HaArokh", "category": "Quoting Commentary", "type": "", "ref": "Ibn Ezra on Exodus; Perush HaArokh 17:1:1", "anchorRef": "Numbers 33:12-14", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 33:12", "Numbers 33:13", "Numbers 33:14"], "sourceRef": "Ibn Ezra on Exodus; Perush HaArokh 17:1:1", "sourceHeRef": "אבן עזרא על שמות; פירוש הארוך י״ז:א׳:א׳", "anchorVerse": 12, "sourceHasEn": true, "compDate": [1155, 1165], "commentaryNum": 1.0001, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Ibn Ezra on Exodus; Perush HaArokh", "he": "אבן עזרא על שמות; פירוש הארוך"}, "heTitle": "אבן עזרא על שמות; פירוש הארוך", "he": "<b>ויסעו.</b> אחז הכתוב דרך קצרה לומר למסעיהם כי ממדבר סין נסעו אל דפקה. ומשם לאלוש. ומאלוש לרפידים.", "heVersionTitle": "On Your Way", "heLicense": "Public Domain", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "ובלכתך בדרך", "text": "JOURNEYED.
