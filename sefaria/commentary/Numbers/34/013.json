Thus the fact that each tribe had to put a rod there shows that the controversy embraced them all.</i> also proves that the controversy embraced all tribes of Israel. In addition, Scripture expressly states, [<i>and they rose up in the face of Moses</i>,] <i>with certain men ‘of the children of Israel,’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, Verse 2.</i> in order to point out that the men were from all the tribes, not only from the two tribes [previously] mentioned [Reuben and Levi]. But the reason why [Moses said] <i>ye take too much upon you, ‘ye sons of Levi’</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, Verse 7.</i> is that Korach won the tribes over to his side [by persuading them] that it was because of <i>their</i> honor that he wanted to restore the service [of the offerings] to their firstborns, as he said, <i>seeing all the congregation are holy</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 3.</i> But Moses in his wisdom laid bare the hidden motives of Korach’s heart to the whole people, namely that he was only protesting because of his own [failure to attain the] priesthood; therefore Moses said to him that he had sufficient [honor] in the honor bestowed upon his tribe, for “you have enough honor, you sons of Levi.” Then Moses continued and said, <i>Hear now, ye sons of Levi</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> [This he said] to Korach their leader — as is shown by [the first part of] that verse, <i>And Moses said unto Korach</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 8.</i> — but he included in his words all the Levites, since Moses in his wisdom spoke conciliatory words to Korach and all his tribe, so that none of them should be drawn after him.<br>Now it was Moses himself who thought of this procedure, and chose the burning of incense [as the test to show who was suitable for the priesthood] rather than any of the other offerings, because he had already seen in the case of Nadab and Abihu that when they offered strange incense before the Eternal they were burnt.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 10:1-2.</i> Therefore he permitted Aaron to burn the incense, because of the special needs of the time,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Exodus 30:9 (Vol. II, p. 509) that all offerings of incense are forbidden as “strange” incense, except for those especially prescribed [e.g., the daily offering of incense]. In times of emergency and special need, however, such as when the overall authority of the Torah is at stake, it is permitted to suspend temporarily the operation of a particular law or prohibition, and it was this power which Moses now made use of when he allowed Aaron to offer up this non-prescribed incense. Or it may be, as Ramban continues, that this test took place at the Service of the Morning Whole-offering, which included the burning of incense, so that there is no need to say that Moses resorted to special emergency powers.</i> or maybe it was the [daily] incense of the morning which he used to burn when he kindled<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Tur: when he “dressed” the lamps. See Vol. II, pp. 472-474, for an explanation of the Service done in connection with the lamps at the daily Morning Service. See also my Hebrew commentary here, p. 257.</i> the lamps, according to the ordinance, and Moses trusted that G-d <i>confirmeth the word of His servant, and performeth the counsel of His messengers</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah 44:26.</i><br>And some scholars<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">So quoted by Ibn Ezra in Verse 4.</i> say that [the meaning of the verse], <i>And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above Verse 4.</i> is [that he did so] in order to inquire of G-d to know what to do, and then he was told, <i>In the morning the Eternal will make known</i> etc.;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">62</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 5 before us. According to this interpretation, the test of incense was declared by G-d, as is implied in Moses’ falling on his face to ask for Divine guidance, and the verse only tells us what G-d told him to do when mentioning Moses’ speech to <i>Korach and all his company</i>.</i> but it is mentioned only in Moses’ account to the people. I have already shown you<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">63</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See e.g., Vol. II, pp. 101, 111.</i> that in many places Scripture will sometimes deal at length with the account of G-d’s communication to Moses, but mention [the matter] in brief in Moses’ narration thereof, and at other times it does the opposite. At other instances [still] it does not mention one of the communications at all, such as in the story of the children of Gad and the children of Reuben, where Scripture tells the event [only] with respect to Moses himself [that he gave them the land east of the Jordan as a conditional inheritance], and [this whole matter] was [in fact] done by the commandment of the Eternal, as they said, <i>As the Eternal hath said unto thy servants, so will we do</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">64</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 32:31.</i> And in [the Book of] Joshua it is written, [<i>And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh returned … to go</i>] <i>unto the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, ‘according to the commandment of the Eternal by the hand of Moses’</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">65</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua 22:9.</i> And if we say that [Moses in fact gave these lands to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Menasheh on his own authority, and the above-mentioned verse which says that it was done <i>according to the commandment of the Eternal</i>] refers to G-d’s [subsequent] agreement to Moses’ action, similar to that which it says, <i>This is the Land wherein ye shall receive inheritance by lot, which the Eternal hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 34:13. The verse thus indicates that G-d agreed that the nine and a half tribes should take their inheritance west of the Jordan, and therefore that the remaining two and a half tribes should take the land Moses gave them on the east side of the Jordan.</i> in which case this would be one of the occasions when Moses acted of his own accord and the Holy One, blessed be He, [later] approved his decision<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In Shabbath 87a, the Talmud mentions three occasions when Moses acted on his own authority and G-d subsequently approved his decisions. Ramban is thus saying here: “In case one should suggest that Moses’ decision to grant the lands east of the Jordan as an inheritance to the two and a half tribes was in reality his own decision, which was subsequently approved by G-d — this hypothesis cannot be correct because etc.,” as Ramban continues. — See also at the end of <i>Seder Naso</i> where Ramban cites cases, where man’s opinion coincided with that on High. There is a marked difference though between the cases of Moses and those mentioned above. Moses according to tradition acted on his own reasoning, and G-d subsequently approved. In the cases mentioned above [such as in the section about the impure people on Passover, etc.] inquiry was first made for Divine guidance, and it happened that the opinion of those seeking guidance coincided with that on High.</i> — [this cannot be so because] it is not right [to say] that Moses would have done anything in connection with the division of the Land without [Divine] permission. For [in dividing the Land] he did everything at the command of G-d, as it is written, [<i>And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying:</i>] <i>Unto these the Land shall be divided</i> etc.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 26:53. The verse saying <i>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses</i> clearly indicates that he acted originally on Divine instruction.</i><br>My own opinion in this matter [of Moses’ command to Korach and his company to take censers and burn incense], and in that which he said to Aaron [during the outbreak of the plague], <i>Take thy fire-pan, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 17:11.</i> is that <i>the hand of the Eternal was upon</i> him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ezekiel 37:1.</i> in these matters, and it is this which is called <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally: “The Holy Spirit.” See in Moreh Nebuchim, II, Chapter 45, beginning: “the second degree of prophecy.” See also further, <i>Seder Balak</i> Note 63, and Ramban <i>ibid.</i></i> as happened with the books of David and Solomon which were written by <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Such is also the opinion of Rambam in his Moreh Nebuchim II, 45.</i> and as David said, <i>The spirit of the Eternal spoke by me, and His word was upon my tongue</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">II Samuel 23:2.</i> For Moses our teacher was <i>trusted in all</i> His <i>house</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">74</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, 12:7.</i> and I have explained the matter of “the house”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">75</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 6.</i> and mentioned it many times;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See e.g. Exodus 32:19.</i> but since this was not in the usual course of Moses’ prophecy, Scripture did not mention G-d’s communication to him about these matters.<br>Now I have seen in Onkelos’ translation that every time the word <i>k’toreth</i> (incense) appears in this section, he rendered it in his language [Aramaic also] as <i>k’toreth</i> and he did not translate it [as he does in all other places] as <i>k’toreth busmin</i> (aromatic incense), as he usually does.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See e.g. Onkelos <i>ibid.</i> 30:8. — But note, however, that in our versions of Onkelos, the word <i>k’toreth</i> in this section <i>is</i> translated as <i>k’toreth busmin</i> (<i>aromatic incense</i>). In the opinion of the author of Minei Targima (Rabbi Yeshayah Pick), Ramban’s version of the text of Onkelos here is the correct one, and later copyists mistakenly amended the text. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 258.</i> From this it would appear that he was of the opinion that this was not the aromatic incense used in the Sanctuary [i.e., Tabernacle], but it [consisted of] frankincense and similar ingredients which he [Moses] made them burn for the test. Onkelos translated likewise in the case of Aaron’s sons [Nadab and Abihu, who burnt <i>the strange incense</i>, for there too he did not render the Hebrew <i>k’toreth</i> as he usually does: <i>k’toreth busmin</i>, but as <i>k’toreth</i>].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 10:1. In our version of Onkelos, again, the text there is <i>k’toreth busmin</i> (aromatic incense), which in the opinion of the author of Minei Targima is likewise a copyist’s mistake.</i> But in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Tanchuma <i>Korach</i> 5.</i> it <i>was</i> the sacred incense, and this is the correct interpretation. Perhaps Onkelos [agrees that this was the sacred incense, but he] did not want to praise the incense by adding thereto the word <i>busmin</i> (aromatics), except when it [the incense] was used in performance of the [daily] commandment [to burn incense].", "versionTitle": "Commentary on the Torah by Ramban (Nachmanides).

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

It is concerned, then, with the transfer of leadership from Moshe to Yehoshua (Joshua); with provisions for two and a half tribes to remain on the east bank of the Jordan River, as long as they take part in the impending invasion; with listing the entire route of the Israelites, from Egypt to the plains of Moab; and with the borders of the land to be conquered.", "As has been the case earlier in the book, however, other material intervenes: a theme and variation doublet on the inheritance of land in a case where a man leaves daughters, not sons; two chapters on what sacrifices are to be brought on holy days; a section on vows taken by women; war with Midyan and the precise apportioning of spoils, both to warriors and to the sanctuary; and the law regarding accidental homicide, in which family vengeance is circumvented by the existence of “safe” Levite towns to which the manslayer may flee.", "The inconsistent thematics may again be explained by the intrusion of an editorial hand, again by priestly interests. In Levine’s view, most of Chapters 25–36 function to establish matters of importance in the priestly view, just as in Chapters 1–10. Here law takes precedence over narrative.", "Despite the varied subject matter of this section, it holds together structurally, via the common biblical technique of word (sound) repetition. The rather common verb <i>tzivvah</i>, “command,” weaves through every one of Chapters 26–36, except for 33. Sometimes it introduces what God wants the Israelites to do; sometimes it leads to the formula of fulfillment, “as YHWH commanded the Children of Israel, so they did”; still other times it refers to a command given by Moshe himself. The entire section begins with the verb (26:4), and ends with it as well (36:13). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking.", "Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. 26), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come-near” (27:1 and 36:1). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it.", "Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again.", "What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy.", "<img>", "<b><i>Num. 26:3</i> Moshe spoke, and El’azar the priest, to them in the Plains of Moav …</b>"], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.
