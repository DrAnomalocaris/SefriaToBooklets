## Exodus 10

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה בֹּ֖א אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה כִּֽי־אֲנִ֞י הִכְבַּ֤דְתִּי אֶת־לִבּוֹ֙ וְאֶת־לֵ֣ב עֲבָדָ֔יו לְמַ֗עַן שִׁתִ֛י אֹתֹתַ֥י אֵ֖לֶּה בְּקִרְבּֽוֹ׃|1|Then יהוה said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh. For I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his courtiers, in order that I may display these My signs among them,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the change in heart needed to approach Pharaoh and the classes of miracles involved in the Exodus, while the Commentary discusses the hardening of Pharaoh's heart to demonstrate God's power and the importance of repentance. Jewish Thought emphasizes the role of free will in Pharaoh's actions and the need for multiple punishments to lead to repentance, while the Midrash debates Pharaoh's ability to repent and discusses the severe punishment brought upon Egypt. Musar connects G-d's warnings to Pharaoh with the ten plagues and the mystical concept of G-d's name expanding for justice, while the Quoting Commentary delves into the hardening of Pharaoh's heart due to his own wickedness and the predestined plan of the plagues. The Targum highlights how G-d hardened Pharaoh's heart to perform miraculous signs among them. 

|וּלְמַ֡עַן תְּסַפֵּר֩ בְּאׇזְנֵ֨י בִנְךָ֜ וּבֶן־בִּנְךָ֗ אֵ֣ת אֲשֶׁ֤ר הִתְעַלַּ֙לְתִּי֙ בְּמִצְרַ֔יִם וְאֶת־אֹתֹתַ֖י אֲשֶׁר־שַׂ֣מְתִּי בָ֑ם וִֽידַעְתֶּ֖ם כִּי־אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|2|and that you may recount in the hearing of your child and of your child’s child how I made a mockery of the Egyptians and how I displayed My signs among them—in order that you may know that I am יהוה.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut commentary on Exodus 10:2 highlights the importance of awareness and faith in avoiding sin, while Me'or Einayim emphasizes bringing awareness and Torah out of exile. Sefat Emet stresses telling the story to bring intellect and potential to actuality. The narrative in the Torah focuses on key messages and lessons to be learned, such as God's power and purpose in the plagues. The hardening of Pharaoh's heart in Jewish Thought serves to show God's signs and perpetuate true faith, while Midrash reveals God's compassionate nature and the warning of evil awaiting those who try to leave Egypt. Musar discusses the downfall of the Egyptian ruler and the eventual humbling from evil to good. Rabbi Horowitz emphasizes the storytelling tradition for future generations, with the obligation to discuss the Exodus starting on the eve of the fifteenth day of Nisan. The importance of recounting the Exodus and passing down the faith is seen as crucial in maintaining a connection to the past. Balaam's anger towards his donkey in Tanakh and God's desire for the Israelites to tell future generations about His miracles in Egypt in Targum further illustrate the importance of storytelling for future generations. 

|וַיָּבֹ֨א מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְאַהֲרֹן֮ אֶל־פַּרְעֹה֒ וַיֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗יו כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהֹוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽעִבְרִ֔ים עַד־מָתַ֣י מֵאַ֔נְתָּ לֵעָנֹ֖ת מִפָּנָ֑י שַׁלַּ֥ח עַמִּ֖י וְיַֽעַבְדֻֽנִי׃|3|So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says יהוה, the God of the Hebrews, ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go that they may worship Me.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the unity of locusts compared to the Egyptians' hatred, showing the lesson of remaining faithful and not spreading hatred. Commentary emphasizes Pharaoh's refusal to humble himself before God despite the plagues, questioning how long his resistance will last. Kabbalah explains humility as being poor and surrendered, accepting what comes. Musar discusses how the mantle of the שכינה leads to the downfall of the שר של מצרים, teaching the importance of humility. Quoting Commentary includes various interpretations of humility in biblical verses. Targum mentions Moshe and Aharon telling Pharaoh to let the Hebrew people go to worship God. 

|כִּ֛י אִם־מָאֵ֥ן אַתָּ֖ה לְשַׁלֵּ֣חַ אֶת־עַמִּ֑י הִנְנִ֨י מֵבִ֥יא מָחָ֛ר אַרְבֶּ֖ה בִּגְבֻלֶֽךָ׃|4|For if you refuse to let My people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts on your territory.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God instructed Moshe to announce the upcoming plague of locusts to Pharaoh as a sign of His power, emphasizing the importance of recounting these events to future generations. Some commentators argue for a brief interval between the plague of hail and locusts, with all ten plagues in Egypt lasting no more than a year. The concept of "tomorrow" symbolizes future reward and understanding of divine mysteries. God warns people through discipline for repentance, as seen with Pharaoh in Egypt, and Hur, Moses, and other figures are rewarded for their actions. If Pharaoh does not release the Israelites, locusts will come within Egypt's borders the next day. 

|וְכִסָּה֙ אֶת־עֵ֣ין הָאָ֔רֶץ וְלֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִרְאֹ֣ת אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ וְאָכַ֣ל ׀ אֶת־יֶ֣תֶר הַפְּלֵטָ֗ה הַנִּשְׁאֶ֤רֶת לָכֶם֙ מִן־הַבָּרָ֔ד וְאָכַל֙ אֶת־כׇּל־הָעֵ֔ץ הַצֹּמֵ֥חַ לָכֶ֖ם מִן־הַשָּׂדֶֽה׃|5|They shall cover the surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the land. They shall devour the surviving remnant that was left to you after the hail; and they shall eat away all your trees that grow in the field.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The locusts covered the land, devouring new growth and destroying trees, leaving nothing untouched. Balak sought Bileam's curses to defeat Israel, but G'd's reply was firm. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa argues that the earth was created for the generation, Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai states the Torah was created for Israel, and Rabbi Berekhya compares the human body to the earth. Adam and Eve caused semen to become smelly, requiring refinement like the exile in Egypt purified Jacob's descendants. Rashbam explains "כסות עינים" in Genesis 20:16:4, Ramban questions the placement of verses before Moses' prayer, and Ramban argues the interval between the hail and locust plagues was brief. Messengers invited Balaam to curse the Israelites, as stated in the Targums. 

|וּמָלְא֨וּ בָתֶּ֜יךָ וּבָתֵּ֣י כׇל־עֲבָדֶ֘יךָ֮ וּבָתֵּ֣י כׇל־מִצְרַ֒יִם֒ אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא־רָא֤וּ אֲבֹתֶ֙יךָ֙ וַאֲב֣וֹת אֲבֹתֶ֔יךָ מִיּ֗וֹם הֱיוֹתָם֙ עַל־הָ֣אֲדָמָ֔ה עַ֖ד הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה וַיִּ֥פֶן וַיֵּצֵ֖א מֵעִ֥ם פַּרְעֹֽה׃|6|Moreover, they shall fill your palaces and the houses of all your courtiers and of all the Egyptians—something that neither your fathers nor fathers’ fathers have seen from the day they appeared on earth to this day.’” With that he turned and left Pharaoh’s presence.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses defied Pharaoh by leaving after warning of the locust plague, causing Pharaoh to show fear and remorse before ultimately expelling him. R. Samuel explains God's creation with light, linking it to Noah's sacrifice and the construction of the Tabernacle. Ramban discusses blessings for health and the use of hornets in battles, emphasizing the importance of serving God. Targum mentions the locust plague filling Pharaoh's house. 

|וַיֹּאמְרוּ֩ עַבְדֵ֨י פַרְעֹ֜ה אֵלָ֗יו עַד־מָתַי֙ יִהְיֶ֨ה זֶ֥ה לָ֙נוּ֙ לְמוֹקֵ֔שׁ שַׁלַּח֙ אֶת־הָ֣אֲנָשִׁ֔ים וְיַֽעַבְד֖וּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵיהֶ֑ם הֲטֶ֣רֶם תֵּדַ֔ע כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם׃|7|Pharaoh’s courtiers said to him, “How long shall this one be a snare to us? Let a delegation  go to worship their God יהוה ! Are you not yet aware that Egypt is lost?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbi Schneur Zalman calls for the renewal and strengthening of the Jewish people through purification of the heart to serve God in truth. Pharaoh's servants questioned Moses' intentions, realizing the seriousness of the situation and recognizing the power of God. The Akeidat Yitzchak raises difficulties in the story of the plagues in Exodus, while Pharaoh's servants regretted letting the Israelites go due to the harm it brought them. Rashi explains Pharaoh's pursuit of the Israelites was due to the property they handed over, and various commentaries delve into the significance of the plagues in Egypt. Targum Jonathan and Onkelos highlight Pharaoh's advisors urging him to release the Israelites to avoid the destruction of Egypt. 

|וַיּוּשַׁ֞ב אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֤ה וְאֶֽת־אַהֲרֹן֙ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֔ה וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֔ם לְכ֥וּ עִבְד֖וּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֑ם מִ֥י וָמִ֖י הַהֹלְכִֽים׃|8|So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh and he said to them, “Go, worship your God יהוה ! Who are the ones to go?”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh initially allowed all Israelites to leave, including young and old, flocks and herds, and sacrifices and burnt offerings, but ultimately agreed to send only adult males to serve God. Ibn Ezra explains the emphasis on the word "lev" in Deuteronomy 20:8. Pharaoh asked who would be going to worship Adonoy with Moshe and Aharon. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֔ה בִּנְעָרֵ֥ינוּ וּבִזְקֵנֵ֖ינוּ נֵלֵ֑ךְ בְּבָנֵ֨ינוּ וּבִבְנוֹתֵ֜נוּ בְּצֹאנֵ֤נוּ וּבִבְקָרֵ֙נוּ֙ נֵלֵ֔ךְ כִּ֥י חַג־יְהֹוָ֖ה לָֽנוּ׃|9|Moses replied, “We will all go—regardless of social station  —we will go with our sons and daughters, our flocks and herds; for we must observe יהוה’s festival.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut teaches that being clean from desires for food and lusts is important before giving out, aligning with the intention of the passages of Matsot and the firstborn in Exodus. Performing a mitzvah can arouse all worlds to serve God, connecting to the ambulatory organs of Malkhut enclothing Netzach, Hod, Yesod. Commentary on Leviticus and Exodus emphasizes sacrificing to the Lord, celebrating festivals with family, and ensuring no one is left behind during Israel's exit. Midrash interpretations include the tree that sweetened bitter waters and the young and old leaving Egypt. Responsa highlights the uniqueness and authenticity of the Jewish religion, facing persecution throughout history and emphasizing adherence to the Torah. Targum translations describe the Israelites going to the festival with their children, old men, sons, daughters, sheep, and oxen before the Lord. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֗ם יְהִ֨י כֵ֤ן יְהֹוָה֙ עִמָּכֶ֔ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר אֲשַׁלַּ֥ח אֶתְכֶ֖ם וְאֶֽת־טַפְּכֶ֑ם רְא֕וּ כִּ֥י רָעָ֖ה נֶ֥גֶד פְּנֵיכֶֽם׃|10|But he said to them, “יהוה be with you—the same as I mean to let your dependents go with you! Clearly, you are bent on mischief.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh warns Moses and Aaron that their plan to escape will backfire, as indicated by the phrase "evil is before your face," with Targum Onkelos explaining the evil they contemplate will turn against them. The Tabernacle was constructed in a specific order, and locusts were a punishment for mistreating Israelites, leading Pharaoh to repent. Joseph alluded to the restoration of the Divine Presence in the third Temple, with details of his life foreshadowing the Jewish nation's exile. Rabbeinu Bahya explains that murderers often try to conceal their intentions, influenced by the serpent, and Aaron's construction of the golden calf was meant to receive divine input. Pharaoh warns the Israelites that the evil they intend to commit will backfire and lead to their downfall. 

|לֹ֣א כֵ֗ן לְכֽוּ־נָ֤א הַגְּבָרִים֙ וְעִבְד֣וּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֔ה כִּ֥י אֹתָ֖הּ אַתֶּ֣ם מְבַקְשִׁ֑ים וַיְגָ֣רֶשׁ אֹתָ֔ם מֵאֵ֖ת פְּנֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה׃|11|No! You gentlemen go and worship יהוה, since that is what you want.” And they were expelled from Pharaoh’s presence.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, G'd performs miracles to punish or change persecutors of the Jewish people, as seen in the Purim story and plagues in Egypt. Ibn Ezra notes "gever" refers to a man, Rashi explains "אתה אתם מבקשים" as seeking until now, and Rashbam highlights Pharaoh's anger at serving the Lord without women and children. In Kabbalah, a vision of the deaf hearing, the lame running, and the blind seeing emphasizes all having access to God's wisdom. In Midrash, Aaron's silence after his sons' death is seen as accepting God's decrees, leading to a reward. In Musar, Pharaoh questions who will participate in serving God, Moses insists everyone will go, and Pharaoh's refusal aims to undermine sacrificial service. Targum mentions only adult men should worship before Adonoy, as demanded by Israelites, leading to their expulsion from Pharaoh's presence. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה נְטֵ֨ה יָדְךָ֜ עַל־אֶ֤רֶץ מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ בָּֽאַרְבֶּ֔ה וְיַ֖עַל עַל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם וְיֹאכַל֙ אֶת־כׇּל־עֵ֣שֶׂב הָאָ֔רֶץ אֵ֛ת כׇּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר הִשְׁאִ֖יר הַבָּרָֽד׃|12|Then יהוה said to Moses, “Hold out your arm over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt and eat up all the grasses in the land, whatever the hail has left.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbi Moses thought "ba-arbeh" meant placing a locust on the rod, but Ibn Ezra corrected this, with Or HaChaim suggesting it may refer to a single locust on Moses' staff. Rashi explained it as "on account of the plague of locusts," while Rav Hirsch translated it as "wider die Heuschrecke." The locusts were brought upon Egypt due to forcing Israel to sow wheat and barley, with a delay given for Pharaoh to repent, ultimately leading to him asking for forgiveness and the removal of the locusts. Ramban argued that all ten plagues on Egypt occurred within a year, with the locusts coming in the month of Nisan, destroying the blossoms and flowers of the trees. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish agreed with Rabbi Yehuda that one is not flogged for violating the prohibition against leaving over the flesh of the Paschal offering. Adonoy commanded Moshe to stretch out his hand over Egypt to bring locusts that would eat all the remaining vegetation after the hail. 

|וַיֵּ֨ט מֹשֶׁ֣ה אֶת־מַטֵּ֘הוּ֮ עַל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֒יִם֒ וַֽיהֹוָ֗ה נִהַ֤ג רֽוּחַ־קָדִים֙ בָּאָ֔רֶץ כׇּל־הַיּ֥וֹם הַה֖וּא וְכׇל־הַלָּ֑יְלָה הַבֹּ֣קֶר הָיָ֔ה וְר֙וּחַ֙ הַקָּדִ֔ים נָשָׂ֖א אֶת־הָאַרְבֶּֽה׃|13|So Moses held out his rod over the land of Egypt, and יהוה drove an east wind over the land all that day and all night; and when morning came, the east wind had brought the locusts.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The east wind brought locusts to Egypt, associated with disaster in the Bible and a forerunner to disaster. The plagues in Egypt were designed to show G-d's power and convince Pharaoh to release the Israelites. In Shemot Rabbah, the locusts were brought upon Egypt as punishment. Nachmanides, Onkelos, and Rabbi Shimon question G'd's ability to perform miracles, while Rashi interprets "humbling" as a sign of poverty and humility. Moses stretched out his rod over Egypt in Exodus 10:13, causing an east wind to bring locusts over the land. 

|וַיַּ֣עַל הָֽאַרְבֶּ֗ה עַ֚ל כׇּל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם וַיָּ֕נַח בְּכֹ֖ל גְּב֣וּל מִצְרָ֑יִם כָּבֵ֣ד מְאֹ֔ד לְ֠פָנָ֠יו לֹא־הָ֨יָה כֵ֤ן אַרְבֶּה֙ כָּמֹ֔הוּ וְאַחֲרָ֖יו לֹ֥א יִֽהְיֶה־כֵּֽן׃|14|Locusts invaded all the land of Egypt and settled within all the territory of Egypt in a thick mass; never before had there been so many, nor will there ever be so many again.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The plague of locusts in Egypt during Moses' time was unique and severe, consisting of a single species according to Rashi, while other commentaries mention multiple species. The prophecy stated that such a plague would never occur again in Egypt, emphasizing its unparalleled nature as a special act of God. The plagues in Egypt were designed to show Pharaoh the power of God and convince him to release the Israelites, with Moses' prayers instrumental in ending each plague. Pharaoh's stubbornness led to a progression of increasingly severe plagues, culminating in the devastating hailstorm that finally prompted Pharaoh to admit his guilt. Israel can withstand the anger of the Lord's messengers, as shown through various biblical examples, because His anger comes with mercy. The locust plague in Egypt was unique and would never be repeated, covering the entire land of Egypt and causing severe damage. 

|וַיְכַ֞ס אֶת־עֵ֣ין כׇּל־הָאָ֘רֶץ֮ וַתֶּחְשַׁ֣ךְ הָאָ֒רֶץ֒ וַיֹּ֜אכַל אֶת־כׇּל־עֵ֣שֶׂב הָאָ֗רֶץ וְאֵת֙ כׇּל־פְּרִ֣י הָעֵ֔ץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הוֹתִ֖יר הַבָּרָ֑ד וְלֹא־נוֹתַ֨ר כׇּל־יֶ֧רֶק בָּעֵ֛ץ וּבְעֵ֥שֶׂב הַשָּׂדֶ֖ה בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|15|They hid all the land from view, and the land was darkened; and they ate up all the grasses of the field and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left, so that nothing green was left, of tree or grass of the field, in all the land of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The locusts brought darkness and consumed all vegetation in Egypt, leaving no greenery on trees or in the fields, as punishment for forcing Israelites to sow wheat and barley. The plague of locusts came after a brief interval following the hail, destroying blossoms and leading to the redemption of the Israelites. (Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Shemot Rabbah, Ramban, Targum) 

|וַיְמַהֵ֣ר פַּרְעֹ֔ה לִקְרֹ֖א לְמֹשֶׁ֣ה וּֽלְאַהֲרֹ֑ן וַיֹּ֗אמֶר חָטָ֛אתִי לַיהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֖ם וְלָכֶֽם׃|16|Pharaoh hurriedly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “I stand guilty before your God יהוה and before you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh apologized to Moses and Aaron for banishing them, acknowledging his sin against them and the Lord, specifically mentioning driving them away in disgrace. The locusts were removed by a wind after Moses prayed, preventing further destruction. In the Midrash, Pharaoh questions the power of God when confronted by Moses and Aaron, leading to a discussion about God's actions. The plague of locusts in Shemot Rabbah 13:6 is seen as punishment for mistreating the Israelites, causing Pharaoh to momentarily repent before changing his mind again. The Targum shows Pharaoh admitting his sin before the Lord and Moses and Aaron. 

|וְעַתָּ֗ה שָׂ֣א נָ֤א חַטָּאתִי֙ אַ֣ךְ הַפַּ֔עַם וְהַעְתִּ֖ירוּ לַיהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵיכֶ֑ם וְיָסֵר֙ מֵֽעָלַ֔י רַ֖ק אֶת־הַמָּ֥וֶת הַזֶּֽה׃|17|Forgive my offense just this once, and plead with your God יהוה that this death but be removed from me.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh shows respect to Moses by addressing him alone when asking for forgiveness, but uses the plural form when asking for prayer as a courtesy to Aaron. The locust plague is described as "this death" because it destroyed what was left after the hail, and Pharaoh implies that he will change his mind once the plague is over. Pharaoh promises not to sin again by rebelling against the Lord and Moses prays outside the city due to the presence of idols. The locust plague is seen as a complete destruction of Egyptian agriculture, threatening future harvests. Both the Selichot Nusach Lita Linear and Selichot Nusach Ashkenaz Lita prayers on the Fourth Day of the Ten Days of Penitence mention a plea to God to remove a specific death, referencing Exodus 10:17. Pharaoh admitted his sin against God and Moses, asking for forgiveness and for the locusts to be removed. Pharaoh's repentance was insincere, as he only wanted the plague to stop and did not truly fear or revere God. The word "ach" in Exodus 10:17 shows Pharaoh's plea for the removal of the plague of locusts, which caused terror and death among the Egyptians. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both depict Pharaoh asking Moses to pray to God to remove the plague of death from him. 

|וַיֵּצֵ֖א מֵעִ֣ם פַּרְעֹ֑ה וַיֶּעְתַּ֖ר אֶל־יְהֹוָֽה׃|18|So he left Pharaoh’s presence and pleaded with יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses prayed to God to remove the locusts, preventing the plagues from continuing in Egypt. The timing of the plagues was meant to give the Egyptians a chance to repent, with Pharaoh eventually asking for forgiveness and the removal of the locusts. 

|וַיַּהֲפֹ֨ךְ יְהֹוָ֤ה רֽוּחַ־יָם֙ חָזָ֣ק מְאֹ֔ד וַיִּשָּׂא֙ אֶת־הָ֣אַרְבֶּ֔ה וַיִּתְקָעֵ֖הוּ יָ֣מָּה סּ֑וּף לֹ֤א נִשְׁאַר֙ אַרְבֶּ֣ה אֶחָ֔ד בְּכֹ֖ל גְּב֥וּל מִצְרָֽיִם׃|19|יהוה caused a shift to a very strong west wind, which lifted the locusts and hurled them into the Sea of Reeds;  not a single locust remained in all the territory of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how a strong west wind carried all the locusts away from Egypt, even those stored as food, leaving none behind. This wind acted as a reversal of the east wind that had brought the locusts to Egypt in the first place. Moses' prayer ensured the locusts would not return, and even the salted locusts were removed completely. Pharaoh hardened his heart further, believing the plague was due to sorcery. Additionally, the Israelites were instructed to journey through various territories, including the Sea of Reeds and the land of Edom. 

|וַיְחַזֵּ֥ק יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה וְלֹ֥א שִׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|20|But יהוה stiffened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart to reinforce his resolution during the plagues, including the locusts which were removed by a west wind, possibly leading to Pharaoh's continued refusal to release the Israelites despite the Egyptians urging him to do so before the eighth plague. The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan both emphasize the Lord's role in strengthening Pharaoh's heart to resist freeing the Israelites. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה נְטֵ֤ה יָֽדְךָ֙ עַל־הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם וִ֥יהִי חֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם וְיָמֵ֖שׁ חֹֽשֶׁךְ׃|21|Then יהוה said to Moses, “Hold out your arm toward the sky that there may be darkness upon the land of Egypt, a darkness that can be touched.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the darkness during the plagues in Egypt was a tangible manifestation of hidden light, symbolizing different regions with varying light intensity that the Israelites could navigate with the Torah. Commentary notes that the darkness was impenetrable by light, lasting six days and affecting only the Egyptians as a punishment. Midrash describes the darkness as a punishment from God for the Egyptians, preventing them from moving or performing tasks. Musar emphasizes the unity of night and day as part of the same whole, created by G-d's self-restriction. Quoting Commentary provides various interpretations of the darkness during the plagues, while Second Temple warns against losing God's light by not returning seized pledges. Targum explains how Moshe caused tangible darkness in Egypt by stretching out his hand towards the sky. 

|וַיֵּ֥ט מֹשֶׁ֛ה אֶת־יָד֖וֹ עַל־הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם וַיְהִ֧י חֹֽשֶׁךְ־אֲפֵלָ֛ה בְּכׇל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם שְׁלֹ֥שֶׁת יָמִֽים׃|22|Moses held out his arm toward the sky and thick darkness descended upon all the land of Egypt for three days.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the darkness in Egypt during the plagues eliminated the wicked and prevented the Egyptians from claiming they were punished like the Israelites, linking Avraham's doubts to the Israelites' decisions. Commentary highlights that the darkness allowed the Israelites to search for valuables and led the Egyptians to willingly lend items. Kabbalah describes how God sheds darkness upon the nations during redemption, contrasting it with the light for the Children of Israel. Midrash discusses how Moses accorded honor to Pharaoh, the darkness allowed the Israelites to bury their dead and borrow valuables, and compared it to future darkness. Quoting Commentary discusses the symbolism of green figs and the timing of the plagues, while Targum describes how Moshe caused total darkness in Egypt for three days. 

|לֹֽא־רָא֞וּ אִ֣ישׁ אֶת־אָחִ֗יו וְלֹא־קָ֛מוּ אִ֥ישׁ מִתַּחְתָּ֖יו שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֑ים וּֽלְכׇל־בְּנֵ֧י יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל הָ֥יָה א֖וֹר בְּמוֹשְׁבֹתָֽם׃|23|People could not see one another, and for three days no one could move about; but all the Israelites enjoyed light in their dwellings.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The darkness during the plague in Egypt was a thick cloud that extinguished all light sources, preventing movement and sight for the Egyptians but not the Israelites, who had light in their dwellings even in Egyptian homes. Moses emphasized loyalty to G-d, who investigated before punishing the Jews for worshipping the calf. Israel is associated with light in Kabbalah, symbolizing redemption from spiritual darkness. The Lord protected the Israelites from the plagues in Egypt, showcasing the importance of trust and faith during times of trouble. During the three days of darkness, the Israelites had light to bury the dead and study the Torah, contrasting with the Egyptians who could not see or move. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֨א פַרְעֹ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ לְכוּ֙ עִבְד֣וּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֔ה רַ֛ק צֹאנְכֶ֥ם וּבְקַרְכֶ֖ם יֻצָּ֑ג גַּֽם־טַפְּכֶ֖ם יֵלֵ֥ךְ עִמָּכֶֽם׃|24|Pharaoh then summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship יהוה ! Only your flocks and your herds shall be left behind; even your dependents may go with you.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh initially wanted the Israelites to leave their livestock behind as a guarantee, but Moses insisted they needed to take them for sacrifices. Ultimately, Pharaoh allowed all the people, including women and children, to depart with their flocks and herds. The plague of darkness led Pharaoh to beg the Israelites to leave, and Moses predicted the plague of the firstborn. Pharaoh only allowed the Israelites to take a limited amount of livestock with them for sacrifices. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֔ה גַּם־אַתָּ֛ה תִּתֵּ֥ן בְּיָדֵ֖נוּ זְבָחִ֣ים וְעֹלֹ֑ת וְעָשִׂ֖ינוּ לַיהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ׃|25|But Moses said, “You yourself must provide us with sacrifices and burnt offerings to offer up to our God יהוה;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Moses used sacrifices to demonstrate God's power to Pharaoh, who eventually acknowledged his lack of prayer and provided animals for offerings. The Talmud discusses the distinction between sacrifices and burnt offerings, with Rashi explaining that the Israelites were to take cattle as requested. The Targum clarifies that sacrifices were intended for the worship of the Israelites' God. 

|וְגַם־מִקְנֵ֜נוּ יֵלֵ֣ךְ עִמָּ֗נוּ לֹ֤א תִשָּׁאֵר֙ פַּרְסָ֔ה כִּ֚י מִמֶּ֣נּוּ נִקַּ֔ח לַעֲבֹ֖ד אֶת־יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֑ינוּ וַאֲנַ֣חְנוּ לֹֽא־נֵדַ֗ע מַֽה־נַּעֲבֹד֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֔ה עַד־בֹּאֵ֖נוּ שָֽׁמָּה׃|26|our own livestock, too, shall go along with us—not a hoof shall remain behind: for we must select from it for the worship of our God יהוה; and we shall not know with what we are to worship יהוה until we arrive there.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes using physical desires for holiness and transforming evil desires into holy ones. Moses clarified to Pharaoh about taking their own cattle for sacrifices, possibly to avoid misunderstanding. The Talmud rejects discriminatory laws and sacrifices are not for atonement but to obey God's commandments. In Midrash, Moses refused to pray in Pharaoh's palace due to idols, and God consulted with Abraham about the final plague. In Musar, the expression "not a hoof will remain" is questioned and different translations are provided. Rashi explains that the chariots of Egypt were provided by those who feared the word of the Lord. The Targum translations of Exodus 10:26 emphasize the importance of taking flocks for worship. 

|וַיְחַזֵּ֥ק יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה וְלֹ֥א אָבָ֖ה לְשַׁלְּחָֽם׃|27|But יהוה stiffened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not agree to let them go.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The hardening of Pharaoh's heart led him to refuse to let the Israelites go, either due to his own stubbornness or in an attempt to outsmart God and Moses. Moses sarcastically responded to Pharaoh's threats, indicating that Pharaoh lacked the ability to carry them out. The hardening of Pharaoh's heart is linked to the increasing darkness, which prevented him from making the right decision to let the Israelites go. Ibn Ezra connects the word "needy" in Deuteronomy 15:7 with the word "would" in Exodus 10:27, explaining that an evyon desires everything due to his need. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan agree that God hardened Pharaoh's heart. 

|וַיֹּֽאמֶר־ל֥וֹ פַרְעֹ֖ה לֵ֣ךְ מֵעָלָ֑י הִשָּׁ֣מֶר לְךָ֗ אַל־תֹּ֙סֶף֙ רְא֣וֹת פָּנַ֔י כִּ֗י בְּי֛וֹם רְאֹתְךָ֥ פָנַ֖י תָּמֽוּת׃|28|Pharaoh said to him, “Be gone from me! Take care not to see me again, for the moment you look upon my face you shall die.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh banishes Moses and threatens his life if he approaches him again, leading to the discussion of difficulties in the text, the fulfillment of Moses' word during the plague of darkness, the importance of showing respect to royalty, Rashi's explanation of the phrase "בחרי אף", Judah's warning from Egypt, and Pharaoh's warning to Moses in the Targum. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֖ה כֵּ֣ן דִּבַּ֑רְתָּ לֹא־אֹסִ֥ף ע֖וֹד רְא֥וֹת פָּנֶֽיךָ׃|29|And Moses replied, “You have spoken rightly. I shall not see your face again!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

After the plague of the firstborn, Moses did not see Pharaoh again, as Pharaoh would have to come to him instead. The Egyptians confronted the Israelites during the feast of the Lord, leading to a battle where they were defeated. Pharaoh pursued the Israelites with a large army, leading to the events at the Red Sea. In Exodus 10:21-29, darkness foreshadows the final plague of death, with Moshe and Pharaoh raging in anger against each other. Moshe agrees with Pharaoh's statement that he will not see his face again, mentioning that he had been told previously that those who sought to kill him were dead, and predicts a tenth plague on Pharaoh's firstborn son.

## Exodus 11

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה ע֣וֹד נֶ֤גַע אֶחָד֙ אָבִ֤יא עַל־פַּרְעֹה֙ וְעַל־מִצְרַ֔יִם אַֽחֲרֵי־כֵ֕ן יְשַׁלַּ֥ח אֶתְכֶ֖ם מִזֶּ֑ה כְּשַׁ֨לְּח֔וֹ כָּלָ֕ה גָּרֵ֛שׁ יְגָרֵ֥שׁ אֶתְכֶ֖ם מִזֶּֽה׃|1|And יהוה said to Moses, “I will bring but one more plague upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt; after that he shall let you go from here; indeed, when he lets you go, he will drive you out of here one and all.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of maintaining holiness by avoiding consuming cruel creatures, while the Sefat Emet highlights the purity of Bnei Yisrael despite exile. The commentary discusses God informing Moses of the final plague in Midian, Moses' understanding of its severity, and the ultimate expulsion of the Israelites due to Pharaoh's obstinacy. Liturgy describes God's intervention to save His people and defeat tyrants, with Moses and Aaron confronting Pharaoh. Midrash explores the plague of the firstborn as retribution for Pharaoh's refusal to let the Israelites go, referencing Abraham's lineage and Israel as God's firstborn son. Quoting commentary includes interpretations from Ramban, Sforno, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rashi, and Midrash BeChiddush on various events in the Torah. Targum mentions Adonoy informing Moses of the final plague that would lead to Pharaoh sending the Israelites away. 

|דַּבֶּר־נָ֖א בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י הָעָ֑ם וְיִשְׁאֲל֞וּ אִ֣ישׁ ׀ מֵאֵ֣ת רֵעֵ֗הוּ וְאִשָּׁה֙ מֵאֵ֣ת רְעוּתָ֔הּ כְּלֵי־כֶ֖סֶף וּכְלֵ֥י זָהָֽב׃|2|Tell the people to borrow, each man from his neighbor and each woman from hers, objects of silver and gold.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites were instructed to take valuables from the Egyptians as gifts, not loans, to fulfill God's promise of great wealth upon leaving Egypt, reflecting their entitlement to compensation for years of slavery and moral integrity. The Torah emphasizes the importance of moral values and adherence to specific laws for both Israelites and gentiles, attributing the Israelites' redemption from Egypt to their righteousness. The request for silver and gold from the Egyptians was significant as it tested the Israelites' ability to resist temptation and fulfill a divine plan, ultimately leading to their forgiveness. 

|וַיִּתֵּ֧ן יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת־חֵ֥ן הָעָ֖ם בְּעֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם גַּ֣ם ׀ הָאִ֣ישׁ מֹשֶׁ֗ה גָּד֤וֹל מְאֹד֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם בְּעֵינֵ֥י עַבְדֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה וּבְעֵינֵ֥י הָעָֽם׃|3|יהוה disposed the Egyptians favorably toward the people. Moreover, Moses himself  was much esteemed in the land of Egypt, among Pharaoh’s courtiers and among the people.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Egyptians showed favor to the Israelites after the plagues, leading to improved social standing for the Israelites and high esteem for Moses. Pharaoh's heart was hardened by God, eventually resulting in him pleading for the Israelites to leave. The Kabbalah relates a verse about slaying an Egyptian man of great stature to a secret, while the Midrash describes the events surrounding the tenth plague and Moses' interaction with Pharaoh's daughter. The quality of pride is associated with sight in Musar, exemplified by Moses' humility. Various commentaries analyze Moses' successful fulfillment of decrees in Egypt, his nobility, and his appointment as an emissary to Pharaoh, while the Targum highlights the favor granted to the Israelites by the Egyptians and the high esteem for Moses. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֔ה כֹּ֖ה אָמַ֣ר יְהֹוָ֑ה כַּחֲצֹ֣ת הַלַּ֔יְלָה אֲנִ֥י יוֹצֵ֖א בְּת֥וֹךְ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|4|Moses said, “Thus says יהוה: Toward midnight I will go forth among the Egyptians,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the use of wine in Jewish rituals and the significance of the Exodus occurring at midnight, Ba'al Shem Tov stresses intentions for God's sake, Halakhah explains the establishment of the Minha prayer, Jewish Thought discusses the importance of the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, Kabbalah highlights God's direct involvement in the plague of the firstborn, Midrash depicts the devotion of the Assembly of Israel and the importance of fulfilling vows, Quoting Commentary explores various interpretations of biblical texts, Talmud discusses the timing of midnight during Passover, and Targum states that God will be revealed at midnight in Egypt. 

|וּמֵ֣ת כׇּל־בְּכוֹר֮ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֒יִם֒ מִבְּכ֤וֹר פַּרְעֹה֙ הַיֹּשֵׁ֣ב עַל־כִּסְא֔וֹ עַ֚ד בְּכ֣וֹר הַשִּׁפְחָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֖ר אַחַ֣ר הָרֵחָ֑יִם וְכֹ֖ל בְּכ֥וֹר בְּהֵמָֽה׃|5|and every [male] first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the first-born of the slave girl who is behind the millstones; and all the first-born of the cattle.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries discuss the reasons behind the people weeping in front of their tents in Sefer Bamidbar, Beha'alotcha 12:1, with some attributing it to forbidden marriages or missing the food in Egypt. The significance of the firstborn dying in Egypt in Exodus 11:5 is explored, highlighting that all firstborn individuals, regardless of status, were affected. The lower crowns of the Kelipot defeated by God in Egypt are discussed in Zohar Vayishlach 2:25, associated with the firstborn of cattle, captives, and maidservants. The smiting of all the firstborn in Egypt is seen as punishment for rejoicing in the decrees against Israel, as detailed in Midrash. The redemption from Egypt through the plague of the firstborn aimed to demonstrate the power and unity of God, as emphasized in the Quoting Commentary. In the Second Temple text, dreaming of the firstborn of Egypt perishing symbolizes the silencing of negative traits before God's power. The debate in the Talmud regarding the timing of eating the Paschal offering until midnight aligns with differing opinions of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya and Rabbi Akiva, reconciled by Rav Yosef. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan affirm that every firstborn in Egypt, from the highest to the lowest, would perish, including animals, as stated in Exodus 11:5. 

|וְהָ֥יְתָ֛ה צְעָקָ֥ה גְדֹלָ֖ה בְּכׇל־אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם אֲשֶׁ֤ר כָּמֹ֙הוּ֙ לֹ֣א נִהְיָ֔תָה וְכָמֹ֖הוּ לֹ֥א תֹסִֽף׃|6|And there shall be a loud cry in all the land of Egypt, such as has never been or will ever be again;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentators analyze the unique language in Exodus 11:6 describing an unprecedented outcry in Egypt resulting from calamity and death. In Midrash, the hail in Egypt is described as unparalleled and will reoccur during Gog and Magog, with God's mercy sparing livestock of the warned. Targum translations emphasize the severity and uniqueness of the impending plague in Egypt. 

|וּלְכֹ֣ל ׀ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל לֹ֤א יֶֽחֱרַץ־כֶּ֙לֶב֙ לְשֹׁנ֔וֹ לְמֵאִ֖ישׁ וְעַד־בְּהֵמָ֑ה לְמַ֙עַן֙ תֵּֽדְע֔וּן אֲשֶׁר֙ יַפְלֶ֣ה יְהֹוָ֔ה בֵּ֥ין מִצְרַ֖יִם וּבֵ֥ין יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃|7|but not a dog shall snarl  at any of the Israelites, at human or beast—in order that you may know that יהוה makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The absence of dog barking at the Israelites during the plague of the firstborn in Egypt symbolizes divine protection and respect towards the Jewish people, with various sources discussing the significance of dogs in protecting the Israelites and their merits. Moses retrieving Joseph's bones and the Israelites leaving Egypt in haste are highlighted in Midrash texts, while speaking lashon hara is compared to being worse than a dog in Musar teachings. The Talmud discusses the blessings and curses associated with dogs and the importance of being tender like a reed, while the Tanakh mentions the Israelite army returning safely to Joshua. The Targum emphasizes that dogs will not harm the children of Israel, showing God's differentiation between them and Egypt. 

|וְיָרְד֣וּ כׇל־עֲבָדֶ֩יךָ֩ אֵ֨לֶּה אֵלַ֜י וְהִשְׁתַּֽחֲווּ־לִ֣י לֵאמֹ֗ר צֵ֤א אַתָּה֙ וְכׇל־הָעָ֣ם אֲשֶׁר־בְּרַגְלֶ֔יךָ וְאַחֲרֵי־כֵ֖ן אֵצֵ֑א וַיֵּצֵ֥א מֵֽעִם־פַּרְעֹ֖ה בׇּחֳרִי־אָֽף׃|8|“Then all these courtiers of yours shall come down to me and bow low to me, saying, ‘Depart, you and all the people who follow you!’ After that I will depart.” And he left Pharaoh’s presence in hot anger.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of rebuking the generation as emissaries of God, with the feet symbolizing attraction and concealment to reveal teachings. Moses showed respect to Pharaoh and the importance of respecting rulers is highlighted in various Midrashic texts. Musar discusses the negative consequences of accepting converts wholesale, cautioning against being misled by them. Talmudic commentary debates Moses' actions towards Pharaoh, with Rabbi Yannai stressing the importance of showing respect to kings. The Targum states that Pharaoh's servants prostrated themselves before Moses, asking him to leave in Exodus 11:8. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה לֹא־יִשְׁמַ֥ע אֲלֵיכֶ֖ם פַּרְעֹ֑ה לְמַ֛עַן רְב֥וֹת מוֹפְתַ֖י בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|9|Now יהוה had said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not heed you, in order that My marvels may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

G-d informed Moses that Pharaoh's hardened heart would lead to more miracles, including the plague of the firstborn and judgments against Egyptian gods, with the final plague being separated due to its severity. Despite warnings, Pharaoh's obstinacy allowed G-d to demonstrate His power through the plagues. In Akeidat Yitzchak, it is explained that G-d did not interfere with Sichon King of the Emorites' free will when hardening his spirit. R. Judah and R. Nehemiah disagree on the timing of Pharaoh not hearkening to Moses, with the wonders performed being credited to both Moses and Aaron. The plague of blood during the Exodus resulted in many signs and wonders, with the events in Egypt foreshadowing future redemption. Adonoy tells Moshe that Pharaoh will not listen to him, leading to more wonders in Egypt. 

|וּמֹשֶׁ֣ה וְאַהֲרֹ֗ן עָשׂ֛וּ אֶת־כׇּל־הַמֹּפְתִ֥ים הָאֵ֖לֶּה לִפְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה וַיְחַזֵּ֤ק יְהֹוָה֙ אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה וְלֹֽא־שִׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵאַרְצֽוֹ׃|10|Moses and Aaron had performed all these marvels before Pharaoh, but יהוה had stiffened the heart of Pharaoh so that he would not let the Israelites go from his land.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, Noam Elimelekh questions the reasons for the people weeping at their tents and the connection between verses about God hearing and Moshe being humble. In the Commentary, Moses and Aaron performed miracles before Pharaoh, leading to the final plague of the firstborn and the Israelites' freedom. The Midrash discusses Moses using a staff with plagues etched on it, wonders performed by Moses and Aaron, God strengthening Pharaoh's heart, and Elyasaf's offering symbolizing the Exodus. The Quoting Commentary highlights motifs in Exodus 11, the hardening of Pharaoh's heart, and the ten plagues as wonders performed by Moses and Aaron. In the Targum, Moshe and Aharon's wonders did not persuade Pharaoh to release the Israelites.

## Exodus 12

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְאֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֔ן בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם לֵאמֹֽר׃|1|יהוה said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes God's communication with Moses in various locations before the Tabernacle was built, then emphasizing modesty by speaking in the Tabernacle (Numbers 1:1). The Mishnah outlines the reading of special Torah portions on specific Shabbatot during Adar, while the Talmud discusses various instances of specific instructions in the Torah regarding mitzvot. Leviticus 16:29 establishes a law for self-denial on the tenth day of the seventh month. 

|הַחֹ֧דֶשׁ הַזֶּ֛ה לָכֶ֖ם רֹ֣אשׁ חֳדָשִׁ֑ים רִאשׁ֥וֹן הוּא֙ לָכֶ֔ם לְחׇדְשֵׁ֖י הַשָּׁנָֽה׃|2|This month shall mark for you the beginning of the months; it shall be the first of the months of the year for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The significance of the month of Nissan is emphasized in various texts, highlighting its importance as the first month historically and agriculturally for the Jewish people. The commandment to sanctify the new month is carried out by a court of sages, ensuring holidays are observed at the correct times. The determination of the new moon is based on calculations and traditions, with the sounding of trumpets on the new moon serving as a reminder of Nissan's importance. The month of Nissan is considered holy, with connections to sacrifices, atonement, and the divine order. Additionally, the month is associated with renewal, holiness, and the witnessing of God's existence by Bnei Yisrael. 

|דַּבְּר֗וּ אֶֽל־כׇּל־עֲדַ֤ת יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר בֶּעָשֹׂ֖ר לַחֹ֣דֶשׁ הַזֶּ֑ה וְיִקְח֣וּ לָהֶ֗ם אִ֛ישׁ שֶׂ֥ה לְבֵית־אָבֹ֖ת שֶׂ֥ה לַבָּֽיִת׃|3|Speak to the community leadership of Israel  and say that on the tenth of this month each of them shall take a lamb  to a family, a lamb to a household.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The command to take a lamb for the Passover sacrifice on the tenth of Nisan symbolized the Jews' freedom from the zodiac sign Aries worshipped by the Egyptians, demonstrating faith and compliance with God's command to eat the Egyptian deity. Specific laws included the circumcision of servants bought for money to partake in the Passover sacrifice, the requirement to eat the sacrifice in one house without breaking bones or taking meat outside, and the importance of the tenth day of Nisan in the liberation of the Israelites from Egypt. Other texts explored various aspects of Jewish law, traditions, rituals, and symbols, such as the significance of numbers, the laws regarding impurity and offerings, and the construction of sacred items in the Tabernacle. The Talmud discussed Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel's ruling based on Moses' warning about the first Pesaḥ, clarifications on women's exclusion from the first Pesaḥ, and the requirements of the Paschal lamb in Egypt not applying to later generations. 

|וְאִם־יִמְעַ֣ט הַבַּ֘יִת֮ מִהְי֣וֹת מִשֶּׂה֒ וְלָקַ֣ח ה֗וּא וּשְׁכֵנ֛וֹ הַקָּרֹ֥ב אֶל־בֵּית֖וֹ בְּמִכְסַ֣ת נְפָשֹׁ֑ת אִ֚ישׁ לְפִ֣י אׇכְל֔וֹ תָּכֹ֖סּוּ עַל־הַשֶּֽׂה׃|4|But if the household is too small for a lamb, let it share one with a neighbor who dwells nearby, in proportion to the number of persons: you shall contribute for the lamb according to what each household will eat.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators provide interpretations on sharing the Passover lamb, including allowing two unrelated individuals to share, addressing financial concerns, and determining who may be included based on their ability to eat. The Paschal sacrifice must only be slaughtered for those fit to partake, including minors, elders, and the infirm if capable of eating. Rabbi Yehudah, Rabbi Yosi, and others offer differing opinions on sharing a fellowship's portion, counting others, and excluding certain individuals from partaking. The Talmud discusses registration requirements, the role of women, and differing interpretations of verses related to the Paschal lamb. The Tosefta highlights differences between the Passover in Egypt and the generations, including who can partake and the proper procedures for slaughter. 

|שֶׂ֥ה תָמִ֛ים זָכָ֥ר בֶּן־שָׁנָ֖ה יִהְיֶ֣ה לָכֶ֑ם מִן־הַכְּבָשִׂ֥ים וּמִן־הָעִזִּ֖ים תִּקָּֽחוּ׃|5|Your lamb shall be without blemish, a yearling male; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Passover lamb must be without blemish, a male of the first year, taken from either sheep or goats, kept from the tenth to the fourteenth day of the month, slaughtered in the afternoon, and eaten roasted with fire that night with matzot and bitter herbs. The laws regarding the Pesach offering also include discussions on acceptable animals, differentiation between sheep and goats, and the importance of following specific guidelines for the sacrifice. Rabbi Shimon states that lambs and goats are equal for offerings, and the Gemara discusses various requirements for the Paschal offering to be unblemished and in its first year. Job was a blameless man who feared God, and Deuteronomy instructs the slaughter of the passover sacrifice in the chosen place. The lamb for sacrifice must be a flawless male, one year old, taken from sheep or goats. Pesach Rishon and Pesach Sheni both require an unblemished year-old male lamb, not to be eaten raw or boiled, override the Sabbath, and require staying overnight in Jerusalem. 

|וְהָיָ֤ה לָכֶם֙ לְמִשְׁמֶ֔רֶת עַ֣ד אַרְבָּעָ֥ה עָשָׂ֛ר י֖וֹם לַחֹ֣דֶשׁ הַזֶּ֑ה וְשָׁחֲט֣וּ אֹת֗וֹ כֹּ֛ל קְהַ֥ל עֲדַֽת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בֵּ֥ין הָעַרְבָּֽיִם׃|6|You shall keep watch over it until the fourteenth day of this month; and all the assembled congregation of the Israelites shall slaughter it at twilight.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains David's vulnerability in Psalms 118:11, leading to reliance on God's protection, influencing the Sabbath before Passover called "שבת הגדול." Ramban clarifies "bein ha'arbayim" as noon to sunset, associated with slaughtering the Passover lamb. Halakhah mandates slaughtering the Pasach sacrifice on the fourteenth of Nissan in the late afternoon, with Torah scholars permitted sexual relations on Friday nights. Midrash emphasizes the Pesach sacrifice's timing, while Mishnah details the Paschal lamb's slaughter in three groups. Talmud discusses the inspection of offerings and the significance of the Paschal lamb's slaughter in the afternoon. Targum translations highlight keeping the Passover lamb safe until the fourteenth day for slaughter. Tosefta addresses the sanctification of the new month and the timing of the moon's sighting. 

|וְלָֽקְחוּ֙ מִן־הַדָּ֔ם וְנָ֥תְנ֛וּ עַל־שְׁתֵּ֥י הַמְּזוּזֹ֖ת וְעַל־הַמַּשְׁק֑וֹף עַ֚ל הַבָּ֣תִּ֔ים אֲשֶׁר־יֹאכְל֥וּ אֹת֖וֹ בָּהֶֽם׃|7|They shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in which they are to eat it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains the significance of placing blood on the window and side-posts during Passover to avoid antagonizing the Egyptians and signal the destroyer to pass over. Mishnah Pesachim 7:13 details how two groups can eat one Paschal lamb in one house. The Talmud discusses the application of blood on the lintel and doorposts in Egypt, and the rules regarding eating the Paschal lamb in two separate groups. Tosefta outlines the liability for moving meat during the Passover meal and the precautions for attendants serving multiple groups. 

|וְאָכְל֥וּ אֶת־הַבָּשָׂ֖ר בַּלַּ֣יְלָה הַזֶּ֑ה צְלִי־אֵ֣שׁ וּמַצּ֔וֹת עַל־מְרֹרִ֖ים יֹאכְלֻֽהוּ׃|8|They shall eat the flesh that same night; they shall eat it roasted over the fire, with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Passover meat should be eaten on the night of Passover, roasted with fire, accompanied by matzot and bitter herbs, not raw or boiled, including the head, legs, and inner parts, with any leftovers burned before morning (Guides). The commandment is to eat the Paschal sacrifice meat on the night of the fifteenth of Nisan with matzah and bitter herbs, women must eat matzah on Pesach night, and bitter herbs are dependent on the Paschal sacrifice consumption (Halakhah). The importance of circumcision in partaking in the paschal offering is emphasized in Midrash, while the Talmud discusses the specific rules for cooking and eating the Paschal lamb and the use of blessings for different foods. II Chronicles 35:13 describes the roasting of the passover sacrifice in fire according to tradition (Tanakh). Onkelos and Targum Jonathan explain that the meat should be eaten roasted over fire with matzos and bitter herbs on the fifteenth of Nisan (Targum). 

|אַל־תֹּאכְל֤וּ מִמֶּ֙נּוּ֙ נָ֔א וּבָשֵׁ֥ל מְבֻשָּׁ֖ל בַּמָּ֑יִם כִּ֣י אִם־צְלִי־אֵ֔שׁ רֹאשׁ֥וֹ עַל־כְּרָעָ֖יו וְעַל־קִרְבּֽוֹ׃|9|Do not eat any of it raw, or cooked in any way with water, but roasted—head, legs, and entrails—over the fire.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that different parts of the human body symbolize attributes of God, with the legs representing faithfulness and the hands symbolizing the relationship with God based on love and reverence. The commandment to eat the Passover lamb roasted over fire, including its head, legs, and entrails, applies for all generations. The Israelites are instructed to select a perfect male lamb, keep it until the 14th day of the month, then slaughter and eat it roasted with fire. The Paschal sacrifice must be eaten only roasted with fire, not raw or boiled in water. The specific laws concerning the Passover lamb were designed to be eaten quickly and in unity, with the lamb being roasted whole without breaking its bones to symbolize haste and oneness. The Talmud discusses the prohibitions and requirements related to the preparation and consumption of the Paschal lamb, emphasizing that it must be roasted with fire, not boiled in any liquid, partially roasted, or eaten raw. The Targum commentaries on Exodus 12:9 emphasize the specific instructions for roasting the Passover lamb over fire, including its head, knees, and inner organs, and prohibiting boiling it in any liquids. The Tosefta states that both Pesach Rishon and Pesach Sheni require an unblemished year-old male lamb and prohibit eating it raw or boiled, with specific regulations on preparation and cooking methods. 

|וְלֹא־תוֹתִ֥ירוּ מִמֶּ֖נּוּ עַד־בֹּ֑קֶר וְהַנֹּתָ֥ר מִמֶּ֛נּוּ עַד־בֹּ֖קֶר בָּאֵ֥שׁ תִּשְׂרֹֽפוּ׃|10|You shall not leave any of it over until morning; if any of it is left until morning, you shall burn it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Halakhah prohibits leaving any meat of the Paschal sacrifice overnight, with a positive commandment to burn any leftovers, which applies to all sacrifices and can be rectified by fulfilling a positive commandment. The Mishnah lists prohibited materials for Shabbat lamps and scenarios where individuals are flogged for transgressions related to Paschal offerings, while the Talmud discusses interpretations of Exodus 12:10 regarding the Paschal lamb and the requirement to burn any remaining meat. The Tosefta compares Pesach Rishon and Pesach Sheni, noting similarities and differences in their observance. 

|וְכָ֘כָה֮ תֹּאכְל֣וּ אֹתוֹ֒ מׇתְנֵיכֶ֣ם חֲגֻרִ֔ים נַֽעֲלֵיכֶם֙ בְּרַגְלֵיכֶ֔ם וּמַקֶּלְכֶ֖ם בְּיֶדְכֶ֑ם וַאֲכַלְתֶּ֤ם אֹתוֹ֙ בְּחִפָּז֔וֹן פֶּ֥סַח ה֖וּא לַיהֹוָֽה׃|11|This is how you shall eat it: your loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it hurriedly: it is a passover offering  to יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The mitzvah of eating the paschal lamb in haste symbolizes breaking cravings, prioritizing serving God over fulfilling desires, and readiness for departure from Egypt. The consumption of the lamb was done with loins girded and shoes on, symbolizing liberation and preparation for a journey. The haste in eating the lamb was to prevent harm and ensure it was fully consumed before morning. The Talmud discusses the differences between the Paschal lamb eaten in Egypt and in later years, emphasizing the urgency and specific rituals involved. The messengers in II Kings 7:15 found discarded clothing and gear along the road, reporting back to the king. 

|וְעָבַרְתִּ֣י בְאֶֽרֶץ־מִצְרַ֘יִם֮ בַּלַּ֣יְלָה הַזֶּה֒ וְהִכֵּיתִ֤י כׇל־בְּכוֹר֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם מֵאָדָ֖ם וְעַד־בְּהֵמָ֑ה וּבְכׇל־אֱלֹהֵ֥י מִצְרַ֛יִם אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה שְׁפָטִ֖ים אֲנִ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|12|For that night I will go through the land of Egypt and strike down every [male] first-born in the land of Egypt, both human and beast; and I will mete out punishments to all the gods of Egypt, I יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how miracles by God elevate His name, adversity strengthens one's relationship with God, the killing of the firstborn in Egypt sanctifies God's name, hidden Torah is revealed through concealment, judgments against Egyptian gods are executed by God, Israel is chosen by God directly, and Divine Presence is symbolized by a burning lamp. The plague of the death of the firstborn in Egypt was actualized by God Himself, the Passover lamb was acquired from the Egyptians to demonstrate it was not a deity, the giving of the Torah symbolized the wedding between God and the Jewish people, and the Paschal offering can only be eaten until midnight according to Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. God's judgment against the Egyptians demonstrated His superiority over their gods, and the punishment of nations is linked to the behavior of their gods. 

|וְהָיָה֩ הַדָּ֨ם לָכֶ֜ם לְאֹ֗ת עַ֤ל הַבָּתִּים֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אַתֶּ֣ם שָׁ֔ם וְרָאִ֙יתִי֙ אֶת־הַדָּ֔ם וּפָסַחְתִּ֖י עֲלֵכֶ֑ם וְלֹֽא־יִֽהְיֶ֨ה בָכֶ֥ם נֶ֙גֶף֙ לְמַשְׁחִ֔ית בְּהַכֹּתִ֖י בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|13|And the blood on the houses where you are staying shall be a sign for you: when I see the blood I will pass over  you, so that no plague will destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.|

The mezuzah with the names Shad-dai, ve hayah, and kaf, vav, zayin, vav, along with the blood of the Passover sacrifice, protected the Israelites in Egypt from destructive forces by surrounding the entrance with the names of God. The blood on the doorposts served as a sign for the Israelites to be spared from the plague, as G'd would pass over them due to their faithfulness and obedience. The importance of remembering and performing mitzvot is emphasized, with the idea that even if certain commandments may not be physically possible to fulfill, the lessons and concepts they represent remain valid forever. In Siddur Sefard, it is emphasized to inquire and search diligently in the Book for the atonement money, which is to be brought as a gift to God. In Shemot Rabbah 18:2, it is explained how the Israelites were spared during the Plague of the Firstborn by placing blood on their doorposts, while Midrash Tanchuma, Beshalach 27:1 and Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 29:11 further elaborate on the significance of the blood on the doorposts and lintels during the Exodus. The blood of the paschal oblation will be a sign on the houses where you dwell, serving as a bail for protection. 

|וְהָיָה֩ הַיּ֨וֹם הַזֶּ֤ה לָכֶם֙ לְזִכָּר֔וֹן וְחַגֹּתֶ֥ם אֹת֖וֹ חַ֣ג לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה לְדֹרֹ֣תֵיכֶ֔ם חֻקַּ֥ת עוֹלָ֖ם תְּחׇגֻּֽהוּ׃|14|This day shall be to you one of remembrance: you shall celebrate it as a festival to יהוה throughout the ages; you shall celebrate it as an institution for all time.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the mitzvah to eat the paschal lamb in haste on Pesach is to teach not to be drawn after cravings for delicious food, but to sustain oneself for service to God. Passover is a memorial feast contingent on dwelling in the Land of Israel, serving as a reminder of the freedom granted by God. The Midrash clarifies that the redemption of the Israelites from Egypt began in the evening, and the Mishnah details the requirements for burnt-offerings and peace-offerings on pilgrim Festivals. Musar emphasizes the fixed nature of commandments revealed in the Torah, and Talmud discusses differing opinions on disposing of leavened matter on Passover Eve. Targum highlights the importance of celebrating a festival in remembrance of the Lord as an eternal statute for future generations. 

|שִׁבְעַ֤ת יָמִים֙ מַצּ֣וֹת תֹּאכֵ֔לוּ אַ֚ךְ בַּיּ֣וֹם הָרִאשׁ֔וֹן תַּשְׁבִּ֥יתוּ שְּׂאֹ֖ר מִבָּתֵּיכֶ֑ם כִּ֣י ׀ כׇּל־אֹכֵ֣ל חָמֵ֗ץ וְנִכְרְתָ֞ה הַנֶּ֤פֶשׁ הַהִוא֙ מִיִּשְׂרָאֵ֔ל מִיּ֥וֹם הָרִאשֹׁ֖ן עַד־י֥וֹם הַשְּׁבִעִֽי׃|15|Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread; on the very first day you shall remove leaven from your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day to the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the commandments of eating Matzah on Passover and offering sacrifices symbolize God's miracles, with Matzah representing the sudden redemption from Egypt, while the sin of the golden calf reflects spiritual regression. Halakhah details the obligation to destroy chametz before Pesach, with severe punishments for eating chametz during the holiday. Mishnah lists offenses punishable by karet, including eating leavened bread on Passover. Musar suggests controlling evil urges by neutralizing impurity before Passover. Talmud discusses the prohibition of leaven on Passover, with Rabbi Yehuda requiring a search three times. Tanakh outlines the fixed times of the Lord to observe, emphasizing the importance of sacred occasions. Targum specifies the requirement to eat matzos during Pesach and remove all leaven from homes. 

|וּבַיּ֤וֹם הָרִאשׁוֹן֙ מִקְרָא־קֹ֔דֶשׁ וּבַיּוֹם֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י מִקְרָא־קֹ֖דֶשׁ יִהְיֶ֣ה לָכֶ֑ם כׇּל־מְלָאכָה֙ לֹא־יֵעָשֶׂ֣ה בָהֶ֔ם אַ֚ךְ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֵאָכֵ֣ל לְכׇל־נֶ֔פֶשׁ ה֥וּא לְבַדּ֖וֹ יֵעָשֶׂ֥ה לָכֶֽם׃|16|You shall celebrate a sacred occasion on the first day, and a sacred occasion on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them; only what every person is to eat, that alone may be prepared for you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the spiritual realm of "Hoo" where only God exists, providing for those who focus on nurturing their souls, surpassing even sacrifices. Ramban discusses the prohibition of work on festivals, while the Babylonian Talmud distinguishes between prohibited labor on Shabbat and Festivals. Halakhah commands resting on the first and seventh days of Pesach, with exceptions for food preparation. The Midrash delves into the laws of rest and work on Sabbath and festivals, stressing sanctification through food, drink, and attire. The Mishnah details the consumption and preparation of offerings on Shavuot and the significance of sacrifices in future times. Musar explores the mystical connections between sacrifices, the Jewish calendar, and spiritual growth. Quoting Commentary interprets "shabbathon" as rest from labor on festival days, supported by various texts. Responsa advises trusting in God for needs, not angels. Talmud discusses interpretations of Exodus 12:16 regarding work on Festivals, while Tanakh outlines the Feast of Booths and its offerings. Targum emphasizes the holiness of the first and seventh days, and Tosefta addresses issues like collecting water for baking and separating challah during Passover. 

|וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם֮ אֶת־הַמַּצּוֹת֒ כִּ֗י בְּעֶ֙צֶם֙ הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה הוֹצֵ֥אתִי אֶת־צִבְאוֹתֵיכֶ֖ם מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם וּשְׁמַרְתֶּ֞ם אֶת־הַיּ֥וֹם הַזֶּ֛ה לְדֹרֹתֵיכֶ֖ם חֻקַּ֥ת עוֹלָֽם׃|17|You shall observe the [Feast of] Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your ranks out of the land of Egypt; you shall observe this day throughout the ages as an institution for all time.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Sh'mot Rabbah contrasts the hasty departure from Egypt with the future redemption that will not be in haste or at night, focusing on the spiritual darkness of the Jewish people during the Exodus. The Yalkut Reuveni suggests that in the future redemption, there will be no opportunity for accusations of idol worship, as the protective angel of the people will not oppress them. The Mishnah states that a person can fulfill their obligation to eat matza on the first night of Passover with specific grains, while matza made from untithed produce or consecrated grain that was not redeemed cannot be used. Rabbi Judah advises to be bold, light, fast, and mighty to fulfill God's will, emphasizing the urgency in serving God. Ramban explains the commandment to rest on a festival day, while Rambam clarifies that eating Matzah on Passover is a positive commandment from God. The Talmud discusses the prohibitions against selecting, grinding, or sifting on the Sabbath and holidays, as well as the requirements for preparing matza and the permissibility of eating matza prepared by Samaritans on Passover. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize the importance of observing the feast of unleavened bread on the day the Israelites were brought out of Egypt as an eternal statute for future generations. 

|בָּרִאשֹׁ֡ן בְּאַרְבָּעָה֩ עָשָׂ֨ר י֤וֹם לַחֹ֙דֶשׁ֙ בָּעֶ֔רֶב תֹּאכְל֖וּ מַצֹּ֑ת עַ֠ד י֣וֹם הָאֶחָ֧ד וְעֶשְׂרִ֛ים לַחֹ֖דֶשׁ בָּעָֽרֶב׃|18|In the first month, from the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at evening.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra and Rashi explain the timing and significance of eating matzah and removing leaven during Passover, while Siftei Chakhamim, Rav Hirsch, Steinsaltz, and Chizkuni elaborate on the obligations and symbolism of eating matzah throughout the festival period. Halakhah dictates that matzah must be eaten on the night of the fifteenth of Nissan, made from specific grains, and bitter herbs are linked to the consumption of the Paschal sacrifice. The Midrash emphasizes the importance of eating matzah during the festival, with the first day being mandatory. The Mishnah details the types of grain that fulfill the obligation to eat matzah and the requirements for its preparation. Quoting various commentaries, the Talmud discusses the specifics of the Passover holiday, including the timing of eating matzah and the elimination of leavened matter, while the Targum outlines the timeline for eating unleavened bread during Passover. 

|שִׁבְעַ֣ת יָמִ֔ים שְׂאֹ֕ר לֹ֥א יִמָּצֵ֖א בְּבָתֵּיכֶ֑ם כִּ֣י ׀ כׇּל־אֹכֵ֣ל מַחְמֶ֗צֶת וְנִכְרְתָ֞ה הַנֶּ֤פֶשׁ הַהִוא֙ מֵעֲדַ֣ת יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בַּגֵּ֖ר וּבְאֶזְרַ֥ח הָאָֽרֶץ׃|19|No leaven shall be found in your houses for seven days. For whoever eats what is leavened, that person—whether a stranger or a citizen of the country—shall be cut off from the community of Israel.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that repentance and Yom Kippur are not enough for atonement of severe sins, requiring suffering as well. The prohibition of leaven during Passover extends to external properties and even includes leavened bread owned by non-Israelites. The Halakhah strictly prohibits chametz during Pesach, necessitating its removal and destruction before the holiday. Rabbi Yosef Albo argues for the immortality of the soul based on biblical punishments, and Kabbalah discusses the symbolism of eating matzah on Passover. The Mishnah outlines differences between the first and second Pesaḥ offerings, and the Talmud explores the removal of leavened bread during Passover. The Responsa state that vinegar mixed with beer yeast must be sold to a Gentile before Passover to avoid violating the prohibition of possessing leaven during that time. 

|כׇּל־מַחְמֶ֖צֶת לֹ֣א תֹאכֵ֑לוּ בְּכֹל֙ מוֹשְׁבֹ֣תֵיכֶ֔ם תֹּאכְל֖וּ מַצּֽוֹת׃|20|You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your settlements you shall eat unleavened bread.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses how fasting can rectify anger symbolized by chametz, emphasizing the connection between fasting and controlling anger. The prohibition against eating leavened food on Passover is mandatory to remember the Exodus, applicable universally, unlike the Passover lamb. Specific Torah portions are read on each day according to subject matter, with a specific order of readings for different holidays and occasions. The punishment for eating chametz is for seven days, with the exhortation against it being continuous. The purpose of creation is man, with Adam's corruption leading to the pollution of the world symbolized by chametz. The Mishnah explains the order of special readings on Shabbat before Pesah, with specific portions read on subsequent special Shabbatot. The Talmud discusses the prohibition against eating leavened bread on Passover, clarifying the timing of the prohibition, the requirements for matza, and the types of substances that combine with leavened bread. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Exodus 12:20 as a command to not eat anything leavened, but rather to eat unleavened bread in all dwellings. 

|וַיִּקְרָ֥א מֹשֶׁ֛ה לְכׇל־זִקְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֲלֵהֶ֑ם מִֽשְׁכ֗וּ וּקְח֨וּ לָכֶ֥ם צֹ֛אן לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתֵיכֶ֖ם וְשַׁחֲט֥וּ הַפָּֽסַח׃|21|Moses then summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, pick out lambs for your families, and slaughter the passover offering.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes removing evil desires from the heart to lead a good life, with mystical techniques for annulling harsh judgments. Commentary discusses the preparation for Passover, while Halakhah details the Torah readings during the festival. Midrash praises the elders for leading the people to believe in God's name, and Mishnah outlines the Torah portions read on different holidays. Quoting Commentary provides the reading order for the intermediate days of Passover, and Talmud discusses Torah portions and Jewish law interpretations. Targum highlights the importance of turning away from idol worship and focusing on the paschal lamb. 

|וּלְקַחְתֶּ֞ם אֲגֻדַּ֣ת אֵז֗וֹב וּטְבַלְתֶּם֮ בַּדָּ֣ם אֲשֶׁר־בַּסַּף֒ וְהִגַּעְתֶּ֤ם אֶל־הַמַּשְׁקוֹף֙ וְאֶל־שְׁתֵּ֣י הַמְּזוּזֹ֔ת מִן־הַדָּ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּסָּ֑ף וְאַתֶּ֗ם לֹ֥א תֵצְא֛וּ אִ֥ישׁ מִפֶּֽתַח־בֵּית֖וֹ עַד־בֹּֽקֶר׃|22|Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and to the two doorposts. None of you shall go outside the door of your house until morning.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The ritual of placing blood on the lintel in Exodus 12:22 involved using a bunch of hyssop with three stalks, symbolizing the creation of the universe, to protect the Israelites until morning by avoiding destructive forces. The Midrash emphasizes the significance of following specific instructions, such as not leaving one's house during the plague of the firstborn, and explores themes of redemption, protection, and the distinction between the righteous and the wicked. Rabbi Yehuda derived the requirement to take the four species in a bundle from the bundle of hyssop by a verbal analogy in the Talmud, while the Tanakh instructs the use of hyssop for purification processes in Leviticus 14:4. The Targums highlight the importance of using hyssop to sprinkle blood on the doorposts and lintel during the Passover to be protected from the plague. 

|וְעָבַ֣ר יְהֹוָה֮ לִנְגֹּ֣ף אֶת־מִצְרַ֒יִם֒ וְרָאָ֤ה אֶת־הַדָּם֙ עַל־הַמַּשְׁק֔וֹף וְעַ֖ל שְׁתֵּ֣י הַמְּזוּזֹ֑ת וּפָסַ֤ח יְהֹוָה֙ עַל־הַפֶּ֔תַח וְלֹ֤א יִתֵּן֙ הַמַּשְׁחִ֔ית לָבֹ֥א אֶל־בָּתֵּיכֶ֖ם לִנְגֹּֽף׃|23|For יהוה, when going through to smite the Egyptians, will see the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, and יהוה will pass over  the door and not let the Destroyer enter and smite your home.|

Chasidut discusses revelation through the fall of a tzaddik, the protection of Israelites during the plague in Egypt is explained by various commentators, the Amidah prayer requests blessings from God, Jewish Thought explains commandments and rituals, Kabbalah discusses symbolic sacrifices and angels, Liturgy explains the symbolism of the Passover sacrifice, Midrash recounts God's protection of Israel and future judgment, Mishnah details the dissolution of certain vows, Musar connects tzaraat affliction to the Exodus, Quoting Commentary emphasizes God's sole power in the Exodus, Second Temple texts discuss God's name in relation to punishment, Talmud establishes a rule regarding doorposts, Targum mentions the protection of Israelites with blood on their doorposts, and Tosefta highlights Divine beneficence towards Israel. 

|וּשְׁמַרְתֶּ֖ם אֶת־הַדָּבָ֣ר הַזֶּ֑ה לְחׇק־לְךָ֥ וּלְבָנֶ֖יךָ עַד־עוֹלָֽם׃|24|“You shall observe this as an institution for all time, for you and for your descendants.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The meaning of "this thing" in Exodus 12:24 is interpreted differently by various commentators, with some referring to the Passover offering itself and others to the killing and eating of the Passover lamb. The Torah contains commandments reflecting HaShem's quality as the Living God, such as the Passover decree and circumcision blessing. In Midrash, the blood on the doorposts during the Passover in Egypt is seen as a sign for God to protect the Israelites, with a promise of future mercy mentioned. Rabbeinu Bahya explains that חק refers to commandments from the attribute זכור, while חקה refers to commandments from the attribute שמור. Targum interpretations emphasize the eternal nature of the Passover ritual to be observed by the Israelites and their descendants. 

|וְהָיָ֞ה כִּֽי־תָבֹ֣אוּ אֶל־הָאָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִתֵּ֧ן יְהֹוָ֛ה לָכֶ֖ם כַּאֲשֶׁ֣ר דִּבֵּ֑ר וּשְׁמַרְתֶּ֖ם אֶת־הָעֲבֹדָ֥ה הַזֹּֽאת׃|25|And when you enter the land that יהוה will give you, as promised, you shall observe this rite.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries discuss the requirement for the Israelites to observe the Passover once they enter the Land of Israel, with special dispensation given for the Passover observed at Mount Sinai. The Hebrew verb "bo" signifies the arrival or entrance of a living being, as well as the occurrence of events or the fulfillment of God's word, metaphorically referring to the manifestation of God's presence. The service of observing Pesach is contingent upon entering the land of Israel, as commanded by God, and the importance of serving God is emphasized in the text. The Book of Numbers does not follow strict chronological order, with the chapter about the Passover occurring in the first month of the second year after the exodus, due to completing other commandments first. The Talmud discusses the requirements for the Passover offering, stating that the offering is invalidated only if all members of the group are uncircumcised, and the obligation to separate ḥalla is clarified. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize the importance of preserving the service commanded by the Lord when the Israelites enter the land He will give them. 

|וְהָיָ֕ה כִּֽי־יֹאמְר֥וּ אֲלֵיכֶ֖ם בְּנֵיכֶ֑ם מָ֛ה הָעֲבֹדָ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את לָכֶֽם׃|26|And when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this rite?’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Passover ritual is questioned by the wicked son, emphasizing the importance of active engagement in learning and understanding Jewish traditions. Different types of sons are discussed in the Midrash, highlighting the importance of passing down knowledge and faith to future generations. The Haggadah structure encourages questions and answers to teach about the Exodus from Egypt, with the Talmud explaining the different questions asked by children during the Passover Seder. In Deuteronomy 6:20, it is stated that children should be taught about the laws and decrees of God when they inquire about them. 

|וַאֲמַרְתֶּ֡ם זֶֽבַח־פֶּ֨סַח ה֜וּא לַֽיהֹוָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר פָּ֠סַ֠ח עַל־בָּתֵּ֤י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בְּמִצְרַ֔יִם בְּנׇגְפּ֥וֹ אֶת־מִצְרַ֖יִם וְאֶת־בָּתֵּ֣ינוּ הִצִּ֑יל וַיִּקֹּ֥ד הָעָ֖ם וַיִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוֽוּ׃|27|you shall say, ‘It is the passover sacrifice to יהוה, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when smiting the Egyptians, but saved our houses.’ Those assembled then bowed low in homage.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary on Exodus 12:27 discusses the significance of the Passover festival, emphasizing the relationship between the Jewish people and God through the wearing of phylacteries. The Ba'al Shem Tov provides a mystical technique for annulling harsh judgments by circling a table with specific meditations and recitations, focusing on Divine Names and verses from Psalms and Exodus, to be done for seven days straight with a rabbinical court. The term "pesach" refers to God skipping over the homes of the Israelites during the plague in Egypt, signifying pity, rescue, or escaping from danger, with the people expressing gratitude for their deliverance through the Passover offering. Rabban Gamliel emphasizes explaining the significance of the Paschal lamb, matza, and bitter herbs during Passover to children, connecting the meal with the story of the Israelites' redemption from Egypt. Rav Pappa explains the requirements for the Paschal offering, stressing the importance of proper intent and actions done for its purpose. The Passover sacrifice symbolizes the Lord sparing the Israelites in Egypt, with parents instructed to explain this to their children. The Targum interpretations highlight the Pesach-offering as a symbol of compassion and mercy towards the Israelites. 

|וַיֵּלְכ֥וּ וַֽיַּעֲשׂ֖וּ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר צִוָּ֧ה יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֥ה וְאַהֲרֹ֖ן כֵּ֥ן עָשֽׂוּ׃|28|And the Israelites went and did so; just as יהוה had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites obediently followed Moses and Aaron's commands to slaughter the Passover offering on the fourteenth day of Nisan, receiving praise for their meticulous adherence to the commandments. The mention of the Israelites "going" signifies the reward for their effort and preparation, with a transition from darkness to light through accepting rebuke and following the teachings of Torah scholars. Passover reflects a strong sense of Israelite community and centrality to the Exodus story, with the Israelites quickly and obediently following God's instructions through Moses and Aaron. 

|וַיְהִ֣י ׀ בַּחֲצִ֣י הַלַּ֗יְלָה וַֽיהֹוָה֮ הִכָּ֣ה כׇל־בְּכוֹר֮ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֒יִם֒ מִבְּכֹ֤ר פַּרְעֹה֙ הַיֹּשֵׁ֣ב עַל־כִּסְא֔וֹ עַ֚ד בְּכ֣וֹר הַשְּׁבִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֖ר בְּבֵ֣ית הַבּ֑וֹר וְכֹ֖ל בְּכ֥וֹר בְּהֵמָֽה׃|29|In the middle of the night יהוה struck down all the [male] first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sat on the throne to the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the first-born of the cattle.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

At midnight, the Lord smote every firstborn in Egypt, including animals, as retribution for crimes committed by the Egyptians, showing the power of Hashem and bringing about the redemption of His people. The significance of waking up at midnight to study Torah is emphasized in Halakhah, while Jewish Thought discusses the Creator's control over the length of a person's life based on righteousness. The Kabbalah references lower crowns of the Kelipot slain by God in Egypt, and Liturgy highlights significant events occurring at midnight, including divine judgments and victories. In Midrash, the protection of the Children of Jacob from harm is illustrated, and various commentators provide insights on the plagues in Egypt. The Talmud connects a north wind blowing at midnight during the wilderness years to divine favor and discusses fasting practices and the timing of eating the Passover sacrifice. 

|וַיָּ֨קׇם פַּרְעֹ֜ה לַ֗יְלָה ה֤וּא וְכׇל־עֲבָדָיו֙ וְכׇל־מִצְרַ֔יִם וַתְּהִ֛י צְעָקָ֥ה גְדֹלָ֖ה בְּמִצְרָ֑יִם כִּֽי־אֵ֣ין בַּ֔יִת אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵֽין־שָׁ֖ם מֵֽת׃|30|And Pharaoh arose in the night, with all his courtiers and all the Egyptians—because there was a loud cry in Egypt; for there was no house where there was not someone dead.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The plague of the firstborn in Egypt affected not only the firstborn of their mothers, but also the firstborn of the fathers and the chief person in each household. The Egyptians marked houses where firstborns died with portraits or statues, which were shattered by God's strike, causing survivors to mourn as if the death had just occurred. The night of the plague was bright as day, and the Egyptians felt the loss deeply. The influences projected upon the terrestrial world do not reach specific individuals through specific agencies but through generic ones, as seen in the case of the firstborn of Egypt. The Midrash discusses how the Egyptians were punished based on their specific sins, with every blow measured and weighed accordingly. Pharaoh eventually relented and allowed the Israelites to leave after the death of the firstborn. 

|וַיִּקְרָא֩ לְמֹשֶׁ֨ה וּֽלְאַהֲרֹ֜ן לַ֗יְלָה וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ ק֤וּמוּ צְּאוּ֙ מִתּ֣וֹךְ עַמִּ֔י גַּם־אַתֶּ֖ם גַּם־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וּלְכ֛וּ עִבְד֥וּ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֖ה כְּדַבֶּרְכֶֽם׃|31|He summoned Moses and Aaron in the night and said, “Up, depart from among my people, you and the Israelites with you! Go, worship יהוה as you said!|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron at night to give permission for the Israelites to leave immediately and go serve the Eternal, leading to the redemption from bondage taking place at night, while the actual exodus happened during the day. The Midrash emphasizes Pharaoh's reluctance to release the Israelites, likening it to giving away valuable pearls without realizing their worth, and highlighting the consequences of his actions. Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Ramban provide insights into the interactions between Moses, Pharaoh, and the Israelites during this time, with Ramban emphasizing the importance of staggered punishments to allow Pharaoh to fully experience the impact of each plague for true repentance. Rebbi Jacob bar Aḥa and Rebbi Levi discuss the power of Moses's voice during the Exodus, reaching all of Egypt and leading the Israelites to serve the Eternal instead of Pharaoh. 

|גַּם־צֹאנְכֶ֨ם גַּם־בְּקַרְכֶ֥ם קְח֛וּ כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּרְתֶּ֖ם וָלֵ֑כוּ וּבֵֽרַכְתֶּ֖ם גַּם־אֹתִֽי׃|32|Take also your flocks and your herds, as you said, and begone! And may you bring a blessing upon me also!”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Pharaoh asked for blessings and prayers from the Israelites to avoid punishment, acknowledging God's power and eventually allowing them to leave Egypt. Elazar Kalir's poem in the Haggadah highlights the theme of liberation and redemption, noting the use of the word "gam" to introduce contrasting elements in the Torah, such as Pharaoh's request for blessings from Moses. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan translate Pharaoh's request as a plea for prayers to avoid death. 

|וַתֶּחֱזַ֤ק מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ עַל־הָעָ֔ם לְמַהֵ֖ר לְשַׁלְּחָ֣ם מִן־הָאָ֑רֶץ כִּ֥י אָמְר֖וּ כֻּלָּ֥נוּ מֵתִֽים׃|33|The Egyptians urged the people on, impatient to have them leave the country, for they said, “We shall all be dead.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the symbolism of Moses using the word "רמה" and "מבחר" in the Exodus story to illustrate the Egyptians' choices leading to their demise. Commentary from Ibn Ezra, Rashi, Rabbeinu Bahya, and Chizkuni offer insights into the fear and punishment experienced by the Egyptians. Midrash texts discuss the miracles performed by God and the parallels between Abraham and the Israelites. Quoting commentary highlights the urgency of the Israelites' departure from Egypt and the role of Pharaoh in their freedom. Targum texts emphasize the Egyptians' fear of further plagues and the pressure for the Israelites to leave quickly to avoid death. 

|וַיִּשָּׂ֥א הָעָ֛ם אֶת־בְּצֵק֖וֹ טֶ֣רֶם יֶחְמָ֑ץ מִשְׁאֲרֹתָ֛ם צְרֻרֹ֥ת בְּשִׂמְלֹתָ֖ם עַל־שִׁכְמָֽם׃|34|So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls wrapped in their cloaks upon their shoulders.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites carried their kneading bowls on their shoulders, bundled in their garments, as they did not have time to let the dough rise before leaving. Before eating the karpas, hands should be washed without a blessing, each person should have less than a kazayis, dip it in salt water, say the blessing for fruit of the ground, and recline while eating. The people took their dough before it leavened, indicating they cherished their religious obligations deeply by carrying the unleavened bread and bitter herbs on their shoulders. Kimcha Davshuna explains the breaking of the matzah during the Pesach Haggadah as a reminder of the Passover offering, to be consumed later, and to symbolize the bread of affliction. The people took unleavened dough and carried it wrapped in their clothing, either on their shoulders (Onkelos) or on their heads (Targum Jonathan), along with leftovers of paschal cakes and bitter herbs. 

|וּבְנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֥ל עָשׂ֖וּ כִּדְבַ֣ר מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַֽיִּשְׁאֲלוּ֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם כְּלֵי־כֶ֛סֶף וּכְלֵ֥י זָהָ֖ב וּשְׂמָלֹֽת׃|35|The Israelites had done Moses’ bidding and borrowed from the Egyptians objects of silver and gold, and clothing.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yosef gave Binyamin silver and clothing symbolizing spiritual growth, reflecting the benefit of exile in rectifying external garments. The Israelites borrowed silver, gold, and clothing from the Egyptians, with clothing being most prized. The Israelites left Egypt with great wealth, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham. Avram's experiences in Egypt foreshadowed the Israelites' exile and Exodus, both facing famine, having wives taken, experiencing plagues, and leaving with great wealth. 

|וַֽיהֹוָ֞ה נָתַ֨ן אֶת־חֵ֥ן הָעָ֛ם בְּעֵינֵ֥י מִצְרַ֖יִם וַיַּשְׁאִל֑וּם וַֽיְנַצְּל֖וּ אֶת־מִצְרָֽיִם׃|36|And יהוה had disposed the Egyptians favorably toward the people, and they let them have their request; thus they stripped the Egyptians.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

On Pesach, the Israelites were granted favor by the Egyptians who willingly gave them valuables, leading to the Israelites leaving Egypt with great wealth. Despite some ethical concerns, the command to borrow silver and gold was part of the providence and reward at the exodus. The Torah is compared to a healing remedy, and completing all mitzvot is emphasized. The Egyptians found favor in the eyes of the Israelites after the plague of the first-born, recognizing Israel as a source of blessing. The Israelites emptied Egypt of its wealth, which was eventually returned. God promised to judge the nation that enslaved the Israelites, leading to their eventual freedom with great wealth. 

|וַיִּסְע֧וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מֵרַעְמְסֵ֖ס סֻכֹּ֑תָה כְּשֵׁשׁ־מֵא֨וֹת אֶ֧לֶף רַגְלִ֛י הַגְּבָרִ֖ים לְבַ֥ד מִטָּֽף׃|37|The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand fighting men on foot, aside from noncombatants.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the Israelites only possessed faith in Egypt, other virtues were acquired at Mount Sinai. Commentary clarifies details of the Israelites' journey from Rameses to Succoth. Halakhah defines a plague and who is included in determining it. Jewish Thought reflects on the significance of the number 600,000 for Israel. Kabbalah references the aspect of the feet of the blessed Holy One. Midrash discusses Balak and Balaam's interactions. Musar explores Moses' misunderstanding of the purpose of counting the Israelites. Quoting Commentary emphasizes Moses' care for the people. Talmud discusses Geviha ben Pesisa's challenge and the population of over 600,000. Targum describes the Israelites' journey from Ramseis to Sukkos with specific details about protection from clouds of glory. 

|וְגַם־עֵ֥רֶב רַ֖ב עָלָ֣ה אִתָּ֑ם וְצֹ֣אן וּבָקָ֔ר מִקְנֶ֖ה כָּבֵ֥ד מְאֹֽד׃|38|Moreover, a mixed multitude went up with them, and very much livestock, both flocks and herds.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the concept of the erev rav, the mixed multitude, who obstruct the Tzaddikim, with enemies often coming from within. Various commentators explain the mixed multitude as Egyptians who assimilated with the Israelites. Kabbalah connects impure forces with the night and the spleen, while the Midrash highlights God's protection of Israel and the blessings upon entering the Promised Land. Quoting commentary offers different interpretations of the Israelites' desires and actions, while the Second Temple and Talmud discuss the mixed multitude symbolizing beast-like doctrines and lack of compassion. The Tanakh and Targum mention the Israelites' complaints about meat and the multitude of foreigners who left Egypt with them. 

|וַיֹּאפ֨וּ אֶת־הַבָּצֵ֜ק אֲשֶׁ֨ר הוֹצִ֧יאוּ מִמִּצְרַ֛יִם עֻגֹ֥ת מַצּ֖וֹת כִּ֣י לֹ֣א חָמֵ֑ץ כִּֽי־גֹרְשׁ֣וּ מִמִּצְרַ֗יִם וְלֹ֤א יָֽכְלוּ֙ לְהִתְמַהְמֵ֔הַּ וְגַם־צֵדָ֖ה לֹא־עָשׂ֥וּ לָהֶֽם׃|39|And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough that they had taken out of Egypt, for it was not leavened, since they had been driven out of Egypt and could not delay; nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the symbolism of matzah representing divine providence and faith in God's miracles, contrasting it with chametz symbolizing lower mentalities. Halakhah highlights the importance of the Paschal sacrifice, maror, and matzah in commemorating the exodus from Egypt. The Mishnah stresses the need for each individual to view themselves as if they personally left Egypt, while the Talmud explains that matza is eaten to remember the haste of the Israelites' departure. The Targum clarifies that the Israelites baked matzah in haste due to their sudden expulsion from Egypt, lacking time to prepare provisions. 

|וּמוֹשַׁב֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָשְׁב֖וּ בְּמִצְרָ֑יִם שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה וְאַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָֽה׃|40|The length of time that the Israelites lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries and texts explore the significance of the 430-year period in Egypt mentioned in the Torah, with explanations ranging from the covenant with Abraham to the birth of Isaac. The Talmud discusses alterations made to biblical verses by scribes to clarify meanings or avoid negative connotations, while the Tanakh and Targum emphasize the four hundred years of enslavement prophesied to Abram's descendants. Additionally, Midrashic texts reconcile the discrepancy in years and highlight the merit of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in shortening the Israelites' time in Egypt. 

|וַיְהִ֗י מִקֵּץ֙ שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה וְאַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיְהִ֗י בְּעֶ֙צֶם֙ הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה יָ֥צְא֛וּ כׇּל־צִבְא֥וֹת יְהֹוָ֖ה מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם׃|41|at the end of the four hundred and thirtieth year, to the very day, all the ranks of יהוה departed from the land of Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that Tzedakah sustains the Land of Israel by bringing supreme life from the En Sof to the Shechinah, even in exile. The 430 years in Exodus refers to the time from Abraham's departure to the Israelites leaving Egypt, with the departure being predetermined. The custom of reciting U'va letzion at the end of Shabbat coincides with the wicked re-entering Gehenom, while the opening verses are omitted on Saturday evening to avoid negative perceptions. The offerings of high-quality flour symbolize honor to ancestors like Sarah and Abraham. Rabbenu Bachyah and Rabbi Berechyah draw parallels between creation and the construction of the Tabernacle, highlighting heavenly elements. Ramban explains the phrase "b'etzem" in Leviticus 23:28 as indicating the essence of the day, with other commentators providing insights on redemption and symbolism in Torah verses. The House of Shammai and House of Hillel debate mentioning the Exodus in the Passover Seder, while Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan detail the timeline of events leading up to the Israelites leaving Egypt. 

|לֵ֣יל שִׁמֻּרִ֥ים הוּא֙ לַֽיהֹוָ֔ה לְהוֹצִיאָ֖ם מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרָ֑יִם הֽוּא־הַלַּ֤יְלָה הַזֶּה֙ לַֽיהֹוָ֔ה שִׁמֻּרִ֛ים לְכׇל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לְדֹרֹתָֽם׃|42|That was for יהוה a night of vigil to bring them out of the land of Egypt; that same night is יהוה’s, one of vigil for all the children of Israel throughout the ages.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The night of the Exodus was a time of divine protection and redemption, guarded by God from harmful forces, and designated for observance and celebration by the Israelites. Various commentaries, including Chasidut, Kabbalah, Midrash, and Talmud, emphasize the significance of this night as a time of divine intervention and future redemption, with parallels drawn to other instances of salvation in Jewish history. The Targum commentary highlights four key nights in Jewish history before the Lord, including the liberation from Egypt, as moments of divine intervention and redemption to be remembered and celebrated. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְאַהֲרֹ֔ן זֹ֖את חֻקַּ֣ת הַפָּ֑סַח כׇּל־בֶּן־נֵכָ֖ר לֹא־יֹ֥אכַל בּֽוֹ׃|43|יהוה said to Moses and Aaron: This is the law of the passover offering: No foreigner shall eat of it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses the significance of the Pesach offering and the Red Heifer as statutes, with the ashes of the Red Heifer being greater. Moshe represents the first commandment, focusing on the Oneness of God, while Rabbi Akiva represents the second commandment, refining evil from Israel. Halakhah prohibits feeding the Paschal sacrifice to apostates and includes a prayer against them. Midrash justifies Moses breaking the tablets and emphasizes the importance of circumcision for the paschal offering. Musar forbids heretics from participating in the Passover sacrifice. The Talmud explains Moses breaking the tablets due to apostate Jews and discusses the rules for the Paschal lamb. Targum clarifies that only Jews who have not renounced their religion can eat the Pesach offering. 

|וְכׇל־עֶ֥בֶד אִ֖ישׁ מִקְנַת־כָּ֑סֶף וּמַלְתָּ֣ה אֹת֔וֹ אָ֖ז יֹ֥אכַל בּֽוֹ׃|44|But any householder’s  purchased male slave may eat of it once he has been circumcised.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators and texts discuss the obligation of masters to circumcise their slaves for participation in the Passover sacrifice, with Mishneh Torah emphasizing the necessity of circumcision before partaking in the sacrifice. The Gemara in the Talmud addresses the requirement of circumcision for eating the Paschal lamb and the emancipation of slaves, while the Tosefta highlights differences between the Passover in Egypt and future generations, including the exclusion of uncircumcised or non-immersed slaves. Onkelos explains in Exodus 12:44 that a man's purchased slave must be circumcised before joining in the Passover meal. 

|תּוֹשָׁ֥ב וְשָׂכִ֖יר לֹא־יֹ֥אכַל בּֽוֹ׃|45|No bound or hired laborer shall eat of it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Exodus 12:45:1 states that a tolerated sojourner and a hired servant, who are Israelites, should not eat the Passover lamb unless a portion is assigned to them, contrary to interpretations by some rabbis who believed the verse applied to non-Jews. Uncircumcised individuals are prohibited from partaking of terumah and other consecrated foods, feeding the meat of the Paschal sacrifice to a resident alien is forbidden, and an uncircumcised priest is prohibited from eating priestly tithe and other consecrated foods. The Mishnah clarifies that specific shreds of flesh must be removed for a proper circumcision, and uncircumcised individuals cannot eat teruma. The Gemara explains that an uncircumcised man is prohibited from eating the Paschal lamb and teruma, while Targums on Exodus 12:45 emphasize that aliens, sojourners, or hired workers are not allowed to eat the Passover meal. 

|בְּבַ֤יִת אֶחָד֙ יֵאָכֵ֔ל לֹא־תוֹצִ֧יא מִן־הַבַּ֛יִת מִן־הַבָּשָׂ֖ר ח֑וּצָה וְעֶ֖צֶם לֹ֥א תִשְׁבְּרוּ־בֽוֹ׃|46|It shall be eaten in one house: you shall not take any of the flesh outside the house; nor shall you break a bone of it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commandment not to break any bones of the Passover sacrifice is related to the importance of circumcision, emphasizing unity and oneness within the Jewish people. The Halakhah prohibits breaking bones or removing meat from the group being eaten in, with consequences detailed in Exodus, Numbers, and Tosefta. The Mishnah outlines punishments for improper offerings, while the Talmud debates the implications of breaking bones and transferring meat between groups or houses. The Tanakh and Targum emphasize the importance of following the laws regarding the Passover sacrifice, with specific rules outlined in the Tosefta. 

|כׇּל־עֲדַ֥ת יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל יַעֲשׂ֥וּ אֹתֽוֹ׃|47|The whole community of Israel shall offer it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

All individuals obligated to observe the commandments must prepare a paschal lamb, with the congregation of Israel allowed to eat it together, forming a unified community. Sacrificing a Paschal offering for oneself is acceptable if it can be eaten entirely, but it is preferred to have multiple people offer it. The importance of properly observing the Sabbath is emphasized in the liturgy, with rewards for sanctifying it, blessings associated with keeping it, and the connection to the ultimate redemption and rebuilding of Jerusalem. In future generations, the entire congregation of Israel can eat the Pesach sacrifice in various groups, not just family groups, as emphasized in the Midrash and Targum. 

|וְכִֽי־יָג֨וּר אִתְּךָ֜ גֵּ֗ר וְעָ֣שָׂה פֶ֘סַח֮ לַיהֹוָה֒ הִמּ֧וֹל ל֣וֹ כׇל־זָכָ֗ר וְאָז֙ יִקְרַ֣ב לַעֲשֹׂת֔וֹ וְהָיָ֖ה כְּאֶזְרַ֣ח הָאָ֑רֶץ וְכׇל־עָרֵ֖ל לֹֽא־יֹ֥אכַל בּֽוֹ׃|48|If a male stranger who dwells with you would offer the passover to יהוה, all his males must be circumcised; then he shall be admitted to offer it; he shall then be as a citizen of the country. But no uncircumcised man may eat of it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the symbolic importance of not breaking any bones of the Passover sacrifice as a reminder for Jews to scrutinize themselves regarding their brit. The Mishnah and Talmud discuss the requirement for circumcision before participating in the Passover ritual, with uncircumcised individuals being prohibited from partaking in the offering. The act of sacrifice in Jewish tradition creates a sense of community, with the Paschal lamb emphasizing the need for haste and unity among the people, while the Midrash delves into the significance of circumcision and the Paschal sacrifice, highlighting the unity of the home-born and the convert in observing the Torah. Male converts and slaves must circumcise themselves before celebrating Passover, as the presence of the foreskin represents impurity that prevents them from approaching the Divine Presence. 

|תּוֹרָ֣ה אַחַ֔ת יִהְיֶ֖ה לָֽאֶזְרָ֑ח וְלַגֵּ֖ר הַגָּ֥ר בְּתוֹכְכֶֽם׃|49|There shall be one law for the citizen and for the stranger who dwells among you.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The mitzvah "This month is for you" connects Bnei Yisrael to the Torah, giving them the power to repair the world physically before spiritually. Proselytes are equal to native-born Israelites in all matters of the Torah, emphasizing the divine origin of the text. Both citizens and strangers in the Jewish community have the same obligations and privileges, raising questions about their true distinctions. Abraham's meticulous observance of commandments and the importance of converts are highlighted in the text, emphasizing equality in respect to all commandments. Rabban Gamliel's differing opinion on roasting the Pesaḥ in Egypt and the unity of treating proselytes like native-born Israelites are also discussed. 

|וַיַּֽעֲשׂ֖וּ כׇּל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל כַּאֲשֶׁ֨ר צִוָּ֧ה יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֥ה וְאֶֽת־אַהֲרֹ֖ן כֵּ֥ן עָשֽׂוּ׃|50|And all the Israelites did so; as יהוה had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text in Exodus 12:50 refers to the circumcision of strangers during the Passover offering in the wilderness of Sinai, highlighting the importance of this requirement for participation in the Israelite community. This passage emphasizes the continuity of the Passover ritual among the Jewish people since the time of the Exodus, as commanded by God through Moses and Aaron, as mentioned in Targums Onkelos and Jonathan on the same verse. 

|וַיְהִ֕י בְּעֶ֖צֶם הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה הוֹצִ֨יא יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶת־בְּנֵ֧י יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם עַל־צִבְאֹתָֽם׃|51|That very day יהוה freed the Israelites from the land of Egypt, troop by troop.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Israelites left Egypt in the daylight after being granted permission by Pharaoh at night, with the significance of the previous night being the permission to leave, not the actual departure. God decided to bring the Israelites out of Egypt during the day to prevent them from thinking He acted like a thief. Passover readings and Haftarot are outlined for each day of the holiday, as well as for other special occasions throughout the year, following a set order that has become a custom in Israel. On the same day, God led the Israelites out of Egypt with their multitudes and hosts.

## Exodus 13

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֥ה לֵּאמֹֽר׃|1|יהוה spoke further to Moses, saying,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the sanctity of the firstborn in the Jewish people, connecting it to Torah study and worldly tasks, Moses' legislation including natural born Jews and converts, the importance of the Exodus and Passover rituals, the renewal of the universe daily, and the significance of the month of Nissan in Jewish tradition. Various commentaries such as Ibn Ezra, Yefet, Rabbeinu Bahya, Rav Hirsch, and Steinsaltz provide insights on Moses' role, hidden meanings in the Torah, and the commandments related to commemorating the exodus from Egypt. The Torah requirements for tefillin, the specific order of the passages, and differing opinions on the arrangement are outlined in Halakhah. Rulings by R. Yossi Haglili on Bikkurim and interpretations by Ramban, Rabbeinu Bahya, Mishnah Berurah, and Daf Shevui regarding the significance of the commandment to lay script of the exodus from Egypt on the hand and head are also discussed. The oracle in the Second Temple dedicates "beginnings" to God and commands the sanctification of every firstborn among the sons of Israel, human and animal. Abaye explains the mnemonic phrase used to read portions during Passover in the Diaspora in the Talmud, while discussions on tithes, Sabbatical, and sanctification of firstborn animals are presented. The Targum translations of Exodus 13:1 are also noted. 

|קַדֶּשׁ־לִ֨י כׇל־בְּכ֜וֹר פֶּ֤טֶר כׇּל־רֶ֙חֶם֙ בִּבְנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בָּאָדָ֖ם וּבַבְּהֵמָ֑ה לִ֖י הֽוּא׃|2|“Consecrate to Me every male first-born; human and beast, the first [male] issue of every womb among the Israelites is Mine.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of understanding divine guidance and the attributes of Mercy and Justice through the sanctification of firstborns, symbolizing unity of thought and action. The halakha of redemption of the firstborn defines a firstborn as a male born naturally to an Israelite woman, excluding sons born after a miscarriage or by caesarean section. The commandment of sanctifying the firstborn in the Land of Israel applies to all firstborn males born from the womb of a female, including people and certain beasts, and owners are obligated to sanctify the firstborn, give it to the priests, and care for it before offering it in Jerusalem. The Mishnah discusses various scenarios in which a son may or may not be considered a firstborn with regards to inheritance and redemption from a priest, based on the circumstances of his birth and his mother's status. The Talmud states that the obligation to redeem all firstborn sons is derived from the verse emphasizing the redemption of "all" firstborn sons, and the redemption of the firstborn son involves giving the priest five sela coins. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Exodus 13:2 state that all firstborn males, whether human or animal, belong to the Lord and must be sanctified before Him. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר מֹשֶׁ֜ה אֶל־הָעָ֗ם זָכ֞וֹר אֶת־הַיּ֤וֹם הַזֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יְצָאתֶ֤ם מִמִּצְרַ֙יִם֙ מִבֵּ֣ית עֲבָדִ֔ים כִּ֚י בְּחֹ֣זֶק יָ֔ד הוֹצִ֧יא יְהֹוָ֛ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם מִזֶּ֑ה וְלֹ֥א יֵאָכֵ֖ל חָמֵֽץ׃|3|And Moses said to the people,“Remember this day, on which you went free from Egypt, the house of bondage, how יהוה freed you from it with a mighty hand: no leavened bread shall be eaten.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that God communicated with Moses in a way that even women could understand, linking the sanctification of Jewish firstborns to being spared by Justice. Commentary highlights the importance of remembering the Exodus and avoiding putting faith solely in Justice, with the prohibition of chametz serving as a constant reminder. Halakhah prohibits eating chametz on Pesach, punishable by karet. Jewish Thought debates the timing of recalling the Exodus and discusses the obligation to tell the story on Passover eve. Kabbalah outlines specific actions and behaviors, while Midrash connects observance of Passover to key events in Jewish history. Mishnah details differences in the Paschal lamb offerings, and Musar warns against speaking against others. Quoting Commentary emphasizes remembering past events and the severity of violating the Sabbath. Talmud discusses the timing and duration of the prohibition of leavened bread on Passover. Tanakh commands treating others with compassion, and Targum emphasizes the strength of the Lord in bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. 

|הַיּ֖וֹם אַתֶּ֣ם יֹצְאִ֑ים בְּחֹ֖דֶשׁ הָאָבִֽיב׃|4|You go free on this day, in the month  of Abib.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes speaking favorably about the Jewish people and raising hands in gratitude to God, while Halakhah specifies the timing of Passover based on the ripening of barley in Israel. Jewish Thought highlights the importance of remembrance in fulfilling commandments, Midrash discusses the significance of the month of Aviv for the Israelites' departure from Egypt, and Mishnah details the number of judges required for various legal decisions. Musar connects the Erev Rav to Passover observance, and Quoting Commentary clarifies the prohibition of leavened bread during the Egyptian Passover. Talmud debates the disposal of leftover leavened bread, Tanakh commands the observance of Passover in the month of Abib, and Targum mentions the Israelites leaving Egypt in the month of Aviv. Lastly, Tosefta compares the Passover of Egypt and the generations, noting specific requirements for the sacrifice and singing. 

|וְהָיָ֣ה כִֽי־יְבִיאֲךָ֣ יְהֹוָ֡ה אֶל־אֶ֣רֶץ הַֽ֠כְּנַעֲנִ֠י וְהַחִתִּ֨י וְהָאֱמֹרִ֜י וְהַחִוִּ֣י וְהַיְבוּסִ֗י אֲשֶׁ֨ר נִשְׁבַּ֤ע לַאֲבֹתֶ֙יךָ֙ לָ֣תֶת לָ֔ךְ אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּדְבָ֑שׁ וְעָבַדְתָּ֛ אֶת־הָעֲבֹדָ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את בַּחֹ֥דֶשׁ הַזֶּֽה׃|5|So, when יהוה has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which was sworn to your fathers to be given you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall observe in this month the following practice:|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the inclusion of all seven Canaanite nations under the term "Canaanite," with Rashi explaining the land of the five nations was more fruitful than the other two. Mishneh Torah contains variations in spelling and form of specific words. The Pesach sacrifice symbolizes the unity of Hashem and the Israelites, emphasizing His singular divinity. The Midrash explains that the land promised to the Israelites was sworn to their forefathers. Rebbi Jehudah and Rebbi Simeon have differing views on the prohibition of eating leavened matter on the 14th of Nisan. Genesis 15:18 details God's covenant with Abram regarding the land promised to his descendants. 

|שִׁבְעַ֥ת יָמִ֖ים תֹּאכַ֣ל מַצֹּ֑ת וּבַיּוֹם֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י חַ֖ג לַיהֹוָֽה׃|6|“Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival of יהוה.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Festival-offering for Passover must be brought on the first day and not later than the seventh day, with amends only possible for the first day, emphasizing the continuous service of eating unleavened bread for seven days. R. Shimon b. Elazar explains that the command to eat matzoth for six days refers to new grain, while the command for seven days refers to old grain. The obligation to eat matzoth for seven days during Passover remains even without the Temple. One who vows to bring a thanks or peace offering must use non-sacred money, as all obligatory offerings must come from non-sacred funds. Rambam explains that the Second Passover has different specifications from the First Passover, but all are unnecessary as long as the sacrifice is in strict accordance with the law. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the requirement to eat matzoh for seven days, with the seventh day being a festival to Adonoy. 

|מַצּוֹת֙ יֵֽאָכֵ֔ל אֵ֖ת שִׁבְעַ֣ת הַיָּמִ֑ים וְלֹֽא־יֵרָאֶ֨ה לְךָ֜ חָמֵ֗ץ וְלֹֽא־יֵרָאֶ֥ה לְךָ֛ שְׂאֹ֖ר בְּכׇל־גְּבֻלֶֽךָ׃|7|Throughout the seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten; no leavened bread shall be found with you, and no leaven shall be found in all your territory.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that chametz represents arrogance and lowliness, while matza symbolizes submission and humility. Commentary emphasizes the importance of avoiding leavened bread during Passover, even on one's own property. Halakhah details the prohibitions and requirements regarding chametz during Pesach, including the need to sell chametz before the holiday. Kabbalah highlights the removal of chametz during Passover to elevate matzah, while the Midrash discusses the prohibition against having leavening in the house. Mishnah explains differences in offerings and practices between the first and second Pesaḥ. Musar connects anulling chametz to mitzvot of the heart, action, and speech. Quoting Commentary from various sources, Responsa stresses the meticulous observance of the commandments regarding chametz. Talmud delves into the reasons for conducting three searches for leavened bread and debates the handling of leavened bread in different scenarios. Targum reiterates the prohibition of chametz during Passover. 

|וְהִגַּדְתָּ֣ לְבִנְךָ֔ בַּיּ֥וֹם הַה֖וּא לֵאמֹ֑ר בַּעֲב֣וּר זֶ֗ה עָשָׂ֤ה יְהֹוָה֙ לִ֔י בְּצֵאתִ֖י מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃|8|And you shall explain to your child on that day, ‘It is because of what יהוה did for me when I went free from Egypt.’|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text delves into the interpretation of the command to eat matzah during the Passover Seder, with debates on whether the Haggadah should be recited over the matzah. It emphasizes the importance of telling the story of the Exodus from Egypt to future generations during the Passover holiday, underlining the personal connection to the events. The obligation to remember the Exodus applies to all generations, with individuals required to see themselves as if they personally experienced leaving Egypt, fostering a sense of collective memory and connection to Jewish history. The story must be told even if the child does not know how to ask, with a focus on connecting them to the memory of the Exodus until they develop greater understanding. 

|וְהָיָה֩ לְךָ֨ לְא֜וֹת עַל־יָדְךָ֗ וּלְזִכָּרוֹן֙ בֵּ֣ין עֵינֶ֔יךָ לְמַ֗עַן תִּהְיֶ֛ה תּוֹרַ֥ת יְהֹוָ֖ה בְּפִ֑יךָ כִּ֚י בְּיָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה הוֹצִֽאֲךָ֥ יְהֹוָ֖ה מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃|9|“And this shall serve you as a sign on your hand and as a reminder on your forehead  —in order that the Teaching of יהוה may be in your mouth—that with a mighty hand יהוה freed you from Egypt.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of using Passover rituals to purify the mouth, strengthen memory, and connect actions to Hashem through tefillin, highlighting the significance of humility and pure-heartedness in Torah study. Halakhah specifies the materials and rules for writing and wearing tefillin, while Jewish Thought underscores the role of mitzvoth like tefillin in perpetuating faith. Midrash discusses the specifics of wearing tefillin and the importance of cleanliness, while Mishnah warns against deviating from traditional practices. Musar emphasizes memory in observing commandments, and Responsa and Talmud delve into the requirements and significance of tefillin construction and usage. Lastly, Tanakh and Targum underscore the symbolism of binding God's teachings on the hand and forehead as a reminder of His power and presence. 

|וְשָׁמַרְתָּ֛ אֶת־הַחֻקָּ֥ה הַזֹּ֖את לְמוֹעֲדָ֑הּ מִיָּמִ֖ים יָמִֽימָה׃|10|You shall keep this institution at its set time from year to year.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the importance of using wisdom and understanding for God alone, nullifying personal attributes in favor of higher knowledge in the context of tefillin, observing the three pilgrimage festivals, and the significance of wearing tefillin to remember the miracles of the Exodus and fulfill all 613 commandments. Specific guidelines for writing and wearing tefillin, the importance of salt in sacrifices, the inheritance of wisdom in Kabbalah, and the arrangement of passages in tefillin according to the Torah and Talmud are also discussed. Rabbi Yaakov Tam disputes Rashi regarding the order of parchment scriptures in tefillin, and the Mishnah states that the absence of any part of the seven branches of the Candelabrum, the lamps, the passages in the mezuzah, the passages in the phylacteries, or the ritual fringes on a garment prevents the fulfillment of the mitzva. 

|וְהָיָ֞ה כִּֽי־יְבִאֲךָ֤ יְהֹוָה֙ אֶל־אֶ֣רֶץ הַֽכְּנַעֲנִ֔י כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר נִשְׁבַּ֥ע לְךָ֖ וְלַֽאֲבֹתֶ֑יךָ וּנְתָנָ֖הּ לָֽךְ׃|11|“And when יהוה has brought you into the land of the Canaanites, as [God] swore to you and to your fathers, and has given it to you,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The law of "openeth the womb" and sanctifying the firstborn applied in the Land of Israel, with the firstborn of man and beast to be sanctified upon entering the Land, and the redemption law for future generations. The mitzvah of tefillin involves writing specific passages on parchment, with crowns on certain letters, and different opinions on the order of the passages. The land of Canaan was named after Canaan, who made way for the Israelites, and the mitzvah of tefillin is mentioned in four places in the Torah, with specific sections needing to be written in a particular order. The Levites were chosen to serve in the Tabernacle instead of the firstborns of Israel, who were sanctified but not yet redeemed, and the mitzvot related to Passover, tefillin, and sanctification of firstborns are connected to the exodus from Egypt. Moses commands that offerings should only be separated if given by God, and the Gemara discusses mitzvot dependent on the land, such as tefillin and redeeming the firstborn donkey, applying both in and outside of Eretz Yisrael. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize that the Lord will bring the Israelites into the land of the Canaanites as promised to their ancestors. 

|וְהַעֲבַרְתָּ֥ כׇל־פֶּֽטֶר־רֶ֖חֶם לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה וְכׇל־פֶּ֣טֶר ׀ שֶׁ֣גֶר בְּהֵמָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִהְיֶ֥ה לְךָ֛ הַזְּכָרִ֖ים לַיהֹוָֽה׃|12|you shall set apart for יהוה every first issue of the womb: every male firstling that your cattle drop shall be יהוה’s.|

The text discusses the commandment to set apart the firstborn of animals for the Lord, with interpretations on which animals are included and explanations of specific terms. It emphasizes the sacredness of dedicating firstborns to God as an act of loyalty and devotion. The Mishnah addresses various scenarios regarding firstborn animals, including those born by caesarean section and the exemption of animals from firstborn status in certain cases. The Talmud debates when firstborns were sanctified and exemptions from firstborn status, while the Tosefta provides guidelines for determining which offspring are subject to the first-born law. 

|וְכׇל־פֶּ֤טֶר חֲמֹר֙ תִּפְדֶּ֣ה בְשֶׂ֔ה וְאִם־לֹ֥א תִפְדֶּ֖ה וַעֲרַפְתּ֑וֹ וְכֹ֨ל בְּכ֥וֹר אָדָ֛ם בְּבָנֶ֖יךָ תִּפְדֶּֽה׃|13|But every firstling ass you shall redeem with a sheep; if you do not redeem it, you must break its neck. And you must redeem every male first-born among your children.|

Chasidut discusses the redemption of the firstborn in either Nissan or Tishrey, the sanctification of the firstborn as a reminder of gratitude, and Moses questioning God's purpose in allowing suffering. The redemption of firstborn animals and children is outlined in Exodus 13:13 and must be done before the Levites replace them. The Halakhah explains the commandment to redeem a firstborn donkey with a sheep, the process of redemption, and the regulations involved.

Tanakh recounts Abraham's obedience in sacrificing his son Isaac and God's promise of blessing, while Targum explains the redemption of firstling donkeys with a sheep and the redemption of firstborn sons. 

|וְהָיָ֞ה כִּֽי־יִשְׁאָלְךָ֥ בִנְךָ֛ מָחָ֖ר לֵאמֹ֣ר מַה־זֹּ֑את וְאָמַרְתָּ֣ אֵלָ֔יו בְּחֹ֣זֶק יָ֗ד הוֹצִיאָ֧נוּ יְהֹוָ֛ה מִמִּצְרַ֖יִם מִבֵּ֥ית עֲבָדִֽים׃|14|And when, in time to come, a child of yours asks you, saying, ‘What does this mean?’ you shall reply, ‘It was with a mighty hand that יהוה brought us out from Egypt, the house of bondage.|

Various commentators and texts emphasize the importance of explaining the story of the Exodus from Egypt to future generations, particularly through the questions asked by different types of children during the Passover Seder. The mitzvah of recounting the events in detail on the fifteenth of Nissan, even if not asked, highlights the significance of praising God for His actions and tailoring the explanation to the understanding of the children. The Haggadah structures questions and answers to educate and emphasize seeking knowledge, while Talmudic discussions further elaborate on the responses given to the Four Children. The importance of God's strong hand in redeeming the Israelites from Egypt is a central theme in these explanations, emphasizing the obligation to pass down this story for generations. 

|וַיְהִ֗י כִּֽי־הִקְשָׁ֣ה פַרְעֹה֮ לְשַׁלְּחֵ֒נוּ֒ וַיַּהֲרֹ֨ג יְהֹוָ֤ה כׇּל־בְּכוֹר֙ בְּאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם מִבְּכֹ֥ר אָדָ֖ם וְעַד־בְּכ֣וֹר בְּהֵמָ֑ה עַל־כֵּן֩ אֲנִ֨י זֹבֵ֜חַ לַֽיהֹוָ֗ה כׇּל־פֶּ֤טֶר רֶ֙חֶם֙ הַזְּכָרִ֔ים וְכׇל־בְּכ֥וֹר בָּנַ֖י אֶפְדֶּֽה׃|15|When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, יהוה slew every [male] first-born in the land of Egypt, the first-born of both human and beast. Therefore I sacrifice to יהוה every first male issue of the womb, but redeem every male first-born among my children.’|

Moses explains that the strength of the Lord bringing Israel out of Egypt refers specifically to the plague of the first-born, connected to the sacrifice of all that opens the womb. The Torah commands parents to explain the events of the Exodus to children and outlines specific requirements for Torah passages with crowns. Jewish Thought discusses various commandments and their reasons, emphasizing the importance of following God's commandments. The Midrash discusses the meanings of "tomorrow," the laws of Passover, and the redemption of the firstborn.

|וְהָיָ֤ה לְאוֹת֙ עַל־יָ֣דְכָ֔ה וּלְטוֹטָפֹ֖ת בֵּ֣ין עֵינֶ֑יךָ כִּ֚י בְּחֹ֣זֶק יָ֔ד הוֹצִיאָ֥נוּ יְהֹוָ֖ה מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃|16|“And so it shall be as a sign upon your hand and as a symbol  on your forehead that with a mighty hand יהוה freed us from Egypt.”|
