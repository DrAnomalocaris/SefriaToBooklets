Edition", "heLicense": "", "heVersionTitleInHebrew": "", "text": "AND THE GARMENTS OF ‘HA’SROD.’<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">214</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rashi explains it as “the garments of net-work” [with which the sacred vessels were covered during the journeyings]. Ramban will differ with this interpretation.</i> I do not know why He did not command the making of these garments at the beginning, as He did concerning all the [rest of the] work of the Tabernacle and the garments of Aaron and his sons, for it would have been proper that He say to Moses, “and thou shalt make cloth of blue-purple to cover with it the ark,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">215</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Numbers 4:6.</i> and a red-purple cloth to cover with it the altar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">216</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 13.</i> and a cloth of scarlet to cover with it the table,” and now when charging Moses about those who were to make these things, He should have included these garments with the rest of the work. Perhaps there was no insistence on how they were to be made, and they could have made these garments of <i>srod</i> of one kind alone, but they made them of blue-purple, red-purple and scarlet. They did not want to make them of linen, as that is not distinguished, as are those other colors. After they made them, G-d willed that the blue-purple cloth be for the ark, the red-purple for the altar, and the scarlet for the table. Therefore, it was sufficient to command them in brief [here] when He gave the command about those who were to do all the work, for these <i>garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> were to be made according to their understanding.<br>Now it is not befitting that a garment made to cover [the sacred vessels] should have many holes in it, as Rashi has said. Rather, the word <i>ha’srod</i> is of the term <i>sarid</i> (a lone survivor), because all these garments were of one kind,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">217</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e. wool, excepting that they were colored differently: blue-purple, red-purple, and scarlet.</i> as Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said.<br>All this I have written in accordance with the line of thought of Rashi. <i>Yet all this availeth me nothing</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">218</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Esther 5:13.</i> For what meaning is there in the Holy One, blessed be He, saying to Moses that they should make “garments of <i>kela</i>,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">219</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Hebrew word <i>kla’im</i> (hangings) (above 27:9) Onkelos translates <i>s’radin</i>. Similarly he translates the Hebrew word <i>michbar</i> (grate) (<i>ibid.</i>, Verse 4) as <i>s’rada</i>. On the basis of these translations of Onkelos, Rashi suggests here that the word <i>ha’srod</i> is an Aramaic term, which means “garments of net-work,” because they were made with many holes. — It is with reference to this basis for Rashi’s explanation that Ramban says, “garments of <i>kela</i>.”</i> or “garments of <i>s’ridah</i>,” without explaining to him how many of them there should be, two or a hundred, how long and wide they should be, and why they should be made altogether, since the matter cannot be understood at all from this communication [stated here]? Moreover, why are they mentioned always before the garments of Aaron?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">220</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the verse before us: <i>And the garments of ‘ha’srod,’ and the holy garments for Aaron</i> etc. — Likewise further, 35:19, and 39:41.</i> Besides, what is the meaning of the phrase, <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’, for ministering in the holy place</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">221</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 35:19.</i> for this seems to refer to the sacrificial rites in the holy place, just as He says, <i>or when they come near to the altar to minister</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">222</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 30:20.</i> in the holy place. Similarly, <i>even he who cometh into the Tent of Meeting to minister in the holy place</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:30.</i> does not refer to outer work, or the carrying of the holy vessels. Furthermore, it is written, <i>and they will make all that I commanded thee: the Tent of Meeting</i> etc., <i>and the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> etc., <i>and the incense of sweet spices; according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">224</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verses 6-11.</i> But He had not commanded him before about <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> at all!<br>What appears from the words of our Rabbis is that <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> are the actual garments of the priesthood. This is mentioned in Tractate Yoma.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">225</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yoma 72 a-b. “What is the meaning of the verse, <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’ for ministering in the holy place</i> (further 35:19)? If not for the garments of the priesthood [which are worn during the service which brings atonement to Israel], there would not have been left a survivor [a <i>sarid</i>] of Israel’s enemies.” The final expression is a euphemism. But the whole quotation shows that <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> refer to the actual garments of the priests.</i> If that is so, it is correct that we translate <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> as “the garments of uniqueness,” that is to say, the garments which when worn designate the outstanding one of the people, <i>the highest among his brethren</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 21:10.</i> Similarly, <i>‘u’basridim’ whom the Eternal shall call</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">227</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joel 3:5.</i> means the remnants of those who have survived, [the word being] of the root, <i>escape ‘v’sarid’ (and remain)</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">228</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Jeremiah 44:14.</i> [<i>The garments of ‘ha’srod’</i>] thus allude to the garments of Aaron, which are so called [‘unique’] because only one of the generation may wear them — Aaron in his lifetime, and after him <i>the priest that is highest… upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">226</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 21:10.</i> And Scripture always mentions Aaron’s garments in a way of honor, as it says: <i>for splendor and for beauty;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">229</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Above, 28:2.</i> <i>holy garments;</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">230</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, Verse 4.</i> <i>the golden plate, the holy crown</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">231</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Leviticus 8:9.</i> It is for this reason that they are called <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> — garments of royalty. This is the meaning of the verse, <i>And the garments of ‘ha’srod’</i> (the High Priest) <i>to minister in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest</i>, Scripture thus reverting [in the second half of the verse] to explain [that the garments of <i>ha’srod</i> are for Aaron]. Similarly it is mentioned in the section beginning, <i>And they brought the Tabernacle unto Moses</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">232</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Further, 39:33. In Verse 41 there it is stated: <i>the garments of ‘ha’srod'… the holy garments for Aaron the priest</i>.</i> And the reason why in this section of <i>See, I have called by name</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">233</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Verse 2.</i> it says, <i>And the garments of ‘ha’srod,’ ‘and’ the holy garments for Aaron the priest</i> [when the second half of the verse should have been without the connective <i>vav</i> which signifies “and,” since, as explained, it is in apposition to the first<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">234</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also Note 232; further in 39:41 the connective “and” is not used by Scripture. The question then appears why is it mentioned here.</i>], is to indicate that these garments are superior in two qualities: they are garments of <i>ha’srod</i> [the High Priesthood], and they are garments of holiness. This is in order to tell us that only the outstanding one among the people should wear them, [and only] when he comes in to minister in the holy place. And seeing that He did not mention here the phrase, <i>to minister in the holy place</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">223</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ibid.</i>, 29:30.</i> He added in explanation that they are garments of <i>s’rod</i> and garments of holiness. Besides, there are many cases in Scripture where a redundant <i>vav</i> occurs.

The phrases “Thus was finished …” (v.32), “And Moshe saw all the work: and here, they had made it” (v.43), and “Then Moshe blessed them” (v.43), echo “Thus were finished …” (Gen. 2:1), “Now God saw all that he had made,/and here: it was exceedingly good” (Gen. 1:31), and “God gave the seventh day his blessing” (Gen. 2:3). At the end of the passage describing the erection of the Tabernacle, there is an additional parallel: “So Moshe finished the work” (40:33); cf. Gen. 2:2: “God had finished … his work.” The close parallels suggest what we find in the case of many cultures: human building, especially (but not exclusively) of sanctuaries, is to be viewed as an act of imitating God. The Israelites, at the close of the book chronicling their founding as a people, link up with God’s scheme in creating the world. The Dwelling is therefore a reflection of the perfection of the world and the divine hand that oversees it.

G<small>ENESIS HAD CONCERNED</small> itself with the beginnings of the world, of human beings and their institutions, and of the people of Israel as a tribal family. Exodus continues this thrust as it recounts the origin of the people on a religious and political level (here inseparable as concepts). A number of biblical ideas receive their fullest early treatment in this book: God’s acting directly in history; making himself “known” to both Israelites and foreigners; covenant as a reciprocal agreement between God and humans; law as an expression of total worldview; and the use of sacred structure (Tabernacle or “Dwelling”) as a vehicle for and expression of perceived truths about the world. In addition, several biblical institutions make their first appearance in Exodus: Passover, Sabbath, rudimentary leadership/government, and cult/priesthood. All this is presented in a general narrative framework, raising the question as to whether what we have here is story or history. Is Exodus a fanciful reconstruction of what happened to Moshe (Moses) and his generation, riddled with anachronisms? Or is it a faithful and reliable handing-down of eyewitness data which only the cynical or irreligious would doubt?", "For the first position there are several supports. We possess virtually no extra-biblical references to the events recorded in our book, either in Egypt or elsewhere. Then, too, there seem to be inconsistencies of time within the story (Chaps. 16 and 18 appear to presuppose laws which were given later), and patterns within the telling of the tale that are too symmetrical (the Plagues) or too stereotyped (the constant use of stylized language) to be simple reporting of fact. Finally, Exodus is lacking in the citation of personal and geographical names, especially as compared to the books that precede and follow (Genesis and Numbers).", "For the second position, that of Exodus as a reliable historical record, there exist no methods of proof other than evaluation of literary form—that is, accepting that oral literature is able to preserve facts without later coloration. But even if it could be shown that Exodus is oral literature—an evaluation which is too sweeping, given the present form of the book—modern scholarship has come to cast doubt on the absolute historical reliability of oral tradition (see Vansina).", "Despite these observations, there is still something unsettling about writing Exodus off as a work of fiction, however pious that fiction may have been. For the rest of the Hebrew Bible abounds in emotional references to the experience of the exodus. At every stage of biblical literature, that experience is invoked for the purpose of directing behavior (see especially Judg. 2, I Sam. 8, II Sam. 7, II Kings 17, Neh. 9, and Ps. 78; and most of Deuteronomy is rhetorically grounded in it). The entire structure and emotional force of biblical law rest upon such exhortations as “A sojourner you are not to oppress:/you yourselves know (well) the feelings of the sojourner,/for sojourners were you in the land of Egypt” (Ex. 23:9) and such situations as that of the Hebrew serf (Ex. 21:2ff.). Apparently the experience of the exodus period was crucial in forming the group consciousness of the Israelites, and ever since it has provided a model from which both later Judaism and Christianity were to draw frequently and profoundly.", "A hypothetical analogy, based on American history, may help to shed light on the historicity of Exodus. Imagine a book based on the following outline: first, a section on the American Revolution, with some biographical material on a few of the Founding Fathers, focusing mostly on the outbreak of the war and key battles; second, a description of the Constitutional Convention, including some of the more important speeches and discussions; third, the text of the Constitution itself; and finally, L’Enfant’s original blueprints for the building of the new capital, Washington, D.C., interspersed with accounts of the first few presidents’ inaugural addresses. What would be the underlying message of such a book? We are certainly dealing here with more than a straight journalistic description of the events, more than a legalistic discussion of constitutional law, and more than a technical presentation for architects. Such a book would actually be presenting the ideals of America’s self-image: a nation founded on the willingness to fight for particular rights against Old World tyranny, established under democratic laws based on reason and providing governmental checks and balances, and whose ideals would be embodied in the construction of a brand-new, centrally located capital city that used classically grounded forms of architecture to express grace and reason as the basis for the new society.", "Now this portrayal is very simplistic, but it gets its point across (and I would be willing to wager that, somewhere in this country, there exists a school textbook written along these lines). In a similar manner, although with much more weight given to God’s role in the process, the book of Exodus unfolds. The dramatic story of Israel’s deliverance from bondage, coupled with Moshe’s own early development, is only the first part of the book, and accounts for less than half of it. It is followed by several stories of desert wanderings, and then by a presentation of the covenant made between God and Israel at Sinai, against a stunning natural backdrop. The second half of the book enumerates a series of laws which constitute the covenant, and the details of construction of a portable sanctuary designed both to symbolize and actually to accommodate God’s presence among the Israelites (with the interruption of a major rebellion). So, like our theoretical American model, Exodus conveys far more than information about events. It is, rather, the narration of a worldview, a laying out of different types of texts bearing the <i>meaning</i> of Israel’s historical experience.", "I stress the word “experience” because that is what is at stake here. Human memory is always selective. We remember what we wish to remember, giving weight to particular emotions, sometimes over and above the facts (or, as the poet Maya Angelou puts it autobiographically, “The facts sometimes obscure the truth”). The same thing appears to be true of group memory. What a people remembers of substance is not nearly as important as how they process their experience.", "In our Exodus text one can perceive a characteristically Israelite process at work. The book emerges as a mix of historical recollection, mythical processing, and didactic retelling, what Buber and others have called a “saga.” What is preserved in the book of Exodus, therefore, is a Teaching (Heb. <i>Tora</i>) based on a set of experiences, which became history for ancient Israel. Hence, to understand better the workings of the book, we need to turn to its themes and its structure. This will be more fruitful than trying to find the exact location of the Sea of Reeds or Mount Sinai, or the “Lost Ark,” or Moshe’s burial site— of whose location “no man has knowledge until this day” (Deut. 34:6). These have all receded into archeological oblivion. What has survived of ancient Israel is its approach to history and to life, and its literature. In that sense, the book of Exodus is an attempt to distill history and to learn from it, using echoes from the past to shape the present and the future.", "When we turn to a closer consideration of the structure of Exodus, we must proceed on the assumption that a work of art stems from both artful and unconscious design. Therefore, any structuring of such a book can only be hypothetical and must not limit itself to ironclad categories.", "With that said, a number of potential divisions of our book present themselves. The first emerges from a close look at the subject matter of the text. Strikingly, Exodus appears to be arranged in groups of a few chapters each (bearing in mind that the chapter divisions are historically late), resulting in the following scheme:", "1. Prologue in Egypt (Chap. 1)<br>2. Moshe’s Early Life and Call (Chaps. 2–4)<br>3. Moshe’s Mission in Egypt (5:1–7:13)<br>4. The First Nine Plagues (7:14–10:29)<br>5. The Tenth Plague and the Exodus (Chaps. 11–13)<br>6. In the Wilderness I: The Deliverance at the Sea (14:1–15:21)<br>7. In the Wilderness II: Early Experiences (15:22–18:27)<br>8. Covenant at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20)<br>9. The Terms (Laws) and Conclusion of the Covenant (Chaps. 21–24)<br>10. Details of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–27)<br>11. Details of the Cult (Chaps. 28–31)<br>12. Rebellion and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)<br>13. The Building of the Tabernacle, Priestly Vestments (Chaps. 35–39)<br>14. Conclusion (Chap. 40)", "Such a measured shifting of focus helps to maintain the flow of the text and our interest in it.", "A glance through this list will also lead to the positing of larger structures. The traditions collected in Exodus fall naturally into both geographical and thematic divisions. The first part of the book takes place in Egypt (1:1–15:21), the second in the wilderness (15:22–40:38); this could alternatively be viewed as the events preceding Mount Sinai (Chaps. 1–17/18) and those that take place there (Chaps. 18/19–40). One could also combine the geographical and thematic aspects, resulting in the structure (1) Israel in Egypt (1:1–15:21), (2) Israel in the Wilderness (15:22–24:18), and (3) Tabernacle and Calf (Chaps. 25–40).", "My own preference for structuring Exodus also combines these aspects, as follows:", "I. The Deliverance Narrative (1:1–15:21)", "II. In the Wilderness (15:22–18:27)", "III. Covenant and Law (Chaps. 19–24)", "IV. The Blueprints for the Tabernacle and Its Service (Chaps. 25–31)", "V. Infidelity and Reconciliation (Chaps. 32–34)", "VI. The Building of the Tabernacle (Chaps. 35–40)", "These divisions exhibit a great deal of overlapping. In Part I, Israel’s life in Egypt (Chap. 1) paves the way for Moshe’s early years (Chaps. 2–4), then the account of his mission before Pharaoh and the Plagues (Chaps. 5–13), and the final victory (Chaps. 14–15); Part II is anticipated by some of what happens after the exodus itself (Chap. 14), and leads to Sinai (Chap. 19); the covenant and laws of Part III naturally lead to other prescriptions, this time the building instructions for the Tabernacle (Chaps. 25–31); planning the sacred structure in Part IV is followed by the making of a forbidden construction, the Golden Calf (Chaps. 32–33); and the reconciliation between God and Israel (Chap. 34) restores Israel’s capacity to return to the actual building of the Tabernacle, and to complete it (Chaps. 35–40). So despite the presence of what must have been several very diverse traditions behind the final text of Exodus, it has been skillfully woven together to form a coherent whole. In addition to the above structures, it can be said that the book of Exodus rests on several textual backbones, inner structures and recurring themes and motifs that help to create a unified work. These may be listed by category:", "1. There are various climaxes which serve to highlight the action—the Encounter at the Bush (Chaps. 3–4), the Tenth Plague and Exodus (12:29–42), the Deliverance at the Sea (14–15:21), the Revelation at Sinai (Chaps. 19–20), the Calf Episode (Chap. 32), and Completion of the Tabernacle (Chap. 40). Anchoring these dramatic scenes, at the center of the book, is the Sinai Revelation. The Binding of Yitzhak (Isaac) in Chapter 22 of Genesis serves much the same focusing function.", "2. There exist three strategically placed accounts of God’s Presence accompanying the Israelites (13:21–22, 24:15–18, 40:34–38) which share a common vocabulary. Key words in these passages are “day/night,” “cloud,” “fire,” “dwell,” “Glory,” “cover,” “go up,” and “in the eyes of the Children of Israel/before the people” (it should be noted that not every passage uses all of these terms). These words chart God’s movement: first, following the Exodus; second, following the concluding of the covenant; and third, following the erection of the Tabernacle, at the end of the book. A variation of these Presence accounts occurs in Numbers 9:15–23, where it rounds out the picture—for it is at this point that the Israelites finally depart from Sinai (having spent about a year there), on their journey toward the Promised Land.", "3. Several leading words recur throughout the book and give it a sense of unity:", "<i>serve</i>— The Israelites pass from “servitude” to Pharaoh into the “service” of God; laws are given that warn against “serving” other gods, that specify how a “serf” is to be treated, and that detail the “service” (i.e., construction and dismantling) of a sanctuary where God is to be properly “served.”", "<i>Glory</i>—Liberated from Pharaoh’s “stubbornness” (Heb. <i>koved lev</i>), the Israelites experience God’s “Glory” (Heb. <i>kavod</i>) at the Sea of Reeds, and encounter it again at Sinai (Chap. 24) and when the Tabernacle is completed (Chap. 40). When Israel falters in Chapter 32, Moses begs to see God’s “Glory” as a sign of reassurance. This is one of the central issues of the book, receiving its clearest formulation in Chap. 17:7—“Is Y<small>HWH</small> in our midst, or not?” Without the accompanying Presence, the Israelites can survive neither in Egypt nor in the wilderness. That the book ends with the “Glory” taking up residence in the Tabernacle is a sign that all is well in this regard.", "<i>know</i>—The Plagues and the liberation take place so that Egyptian and Israelite alike will acknowledge God as the true ruler (who “knows” the slaves’ sufferings). The book as a whole portrays a God who is “known” by his compassion toward the oppressed.", "<i>see</i>—God “sees” and rescues the people early in the book (Chap. 3); they “see” his deliverance at the sea (Chap. 14) and the awesome display at Sinai (Chaps. 19-20); the Tabernacle blueprint is given to Moshe to “see” (Chaps 25ff.).", "4. Aside from theme words, there are also several thematic threads that run through the book. These may be listed as well:", "<i>distinction</i>—The Israelites learn what it is to be separated out, first for oppression and later for God’s service. This process occurs during the Plagues and throughout the legal sections, which are often based on the making of distinctions (the Hebrew word for “holy,” <i>kadosh,</i> may originally have had this connotation). In general, Exodus is a book that abounds in polarities and distinctions: between God and Pharaoh, life and death, slavery and freedom, Egyptianness and Israeliteness, city and wilderness, visible gods/magic and an invisible God who is not conjurable, doubt and trust.", "<i>construction</i>—The Israelites are enslaved as builders of Egyptian cities; they go on to build a society, a calf-god, and a Tabernacle.", "<i>rebellion</i>—From the beginning, God and Moshe are often unheeded, as the Israelites seek to maintain or return to their status as dependent slaves in Egypt (Chaps. 2, 5, 14, 15–17, 32).", "<i>Sabbath</i>—As a newly freed people, Israel is to adapt to a rhythm of work and sacred cessation, which celebrates both creation and freedom. The Sabbath is at issue immediately after liberation (Chap. 16) and is commanded three times (Chaps. 20, 31, 35); and the account of the Tabernacle’s completion echoes the vocabulary of God’s completed creation in Genesis 2, a passage which serves as one justification for observing the Sabbath (see Ex. 20:11).", "<i>origins</i>—We are told of the beginnings of the new covenant (distinct from that concluded with Abraham), the law system, the cult/priesthood, and the sacred calendar, but with the significant omission of the monarchy.", "<i>covenant</i>—God establishes a relationship with the people of Israel: if they will obey him and observe his laws, he will protect them and treat them as his “firstborn son.” This form of covenant is different from the ones in Genesis, and plays a significant role in subsequent books of the Bible.", "<i>God in History</i>—The God of Exodus actively intervenes to rescue a people, defeating their oppressors in battle; he leads them through the wilderness, meets them, and makes a covenant with them.", "5. The above themes are specifically Israelite themes. There are, however, motifs in Exodus that have a more universal ring. One could term these anthropological, since they employ standard aspects of human experience to convey the overall messages of the book.", "<i>Fire</i> is used frequently and in varied contexts (at the Burning Bush and later back at Mount Sinai, in the desert trek, in the Tabernacle service, and at the Calf incident), usually to make a statement about God. In contrast to conventional fire gods (e.g., the Norse trickster Loki), the God of Exodus is most often associated with the more positive aspects of fire: constancy, purity, and transformation. The fire at Sinai does not destroy Moshe and the people, but rather turns them into something new. At the same time it should not be forgotten that fire is used regularly to connote anger in the Bible, especially God’s, and especially in the later wilderness narratives.", "<i>Water</i> appears throughout Exodus, not as a backdrop but as an active medium which most often signifies life and death simultaneously. The Nile, into which the enslaved Hebrews’ babies are thrown, gently bears the infant Moshe to safety: the Nile, the giver of life in Egypt, is changed into blood, itself a major signifier of life in the Bible but useless here because it is undrinkable; the Sea of Reeds acts as a passageway of birth for the Israelites but as a graveyard for their Egyptian pursuers. The availability of water becomes a central issue in the wilderness, as an instrument for survival and for the testing of the Israelites’ faith. Finally, water creates the ritual purity necessary for the people at Sinai and their priests in the Tabernacle to approach God.", "<i>Desert/Wilderness</i> is the scene of the crucial second part of the book. Only in the desert, away from the massive influence of age-old Egyptian culture, can the new Israelite society be forged. Moshe, like many other real-life and fictional heroes, demonstrates this in his own early life. The desert acts as a purifying agent for him, changing the Egyptian prince into a member of his own true people. Similarly, the Israelites begin the process of transformation from bondage to self-rule, a process which is taught in the harsh reality of desert life and which will take an entire generation to complete.", "In point of fact, all these media—fire, water, and desert—suggest change as a major concern of the book of Exodus. Our text chronicles the start of Israel’s journey as a nation, a transformative journey which takes vastly changed circumstances, a whole generation in time, and indeed several books of recounting to complete. Exodus is very concerned with topography—not for the purposes of historical recollection (as Genesis was, apparently) but as an account of an inner journey. Thus the people travel to the boundary between Egypt and the desert, through the sea, to the great fiery mountain; and we know that they cannot but be on their way to a final goal. That goal, the Promised Land, will not be realized in Exodus, because in this book we stand only at the beginning of the journey. Change does not occur quickly, and the true molding of a people, like that of an individual, requires formative experiences over time. In Exodus, then, the People of Israel begins in adolescence, as it were. It has survived infancy in Genesis, a period marked by constant threats of physical extinction, and must now begin the tortuous process of learning to cope with adulthood—that is to say, people-hood—in a hostile world.", "That process will take us past the present text. Exodus stands at the beginning of a trilogy in the middle of the Torah. It takes us from slavery up to Sinai, inaugurating the law-giving process. Leviticus will concentrate almost exclusively on laws (of “holiness”), never budging geographically, while Numbers will see the conclusion of the Sinai experience and the traveling toward (and actually reaching) the land of Israel. Exodus is thus of great importance in the overall five-book pattern, introducing key elements of the wilderness books: law, institutions, rebellion, and—Moshe himself. It serves as a bridge between the great narratives of Genesis and the priestly code of Leviticus and the wanderings of Numbers (Green­berg 1972 notes how the opening of Exodus points back, to Gen. 46; and the closing points forward, to Num. 9). It in fact contains elements of all three books.", "Exodus is the basis not only of what follows in the Torah, but also sets the stage for the rest of the Hebrew Bible. What Israel understood of its God, and what that God expects of them, are set forth most directly and unforgettably in the memories enshrined in the book of Exodus."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.
