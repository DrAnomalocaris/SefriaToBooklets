Those who wish to excel still further in their מצוה performance light an additional light every evening of the eight evenings in question according to the school of Hillel, or, according to the school of Shammai, they light eight lights the first evening and one light less every subsequent evening. Ullah says that two scholars (Rabbi Yossi bar Avin and Rabbi Yossi bar Zevida) disagreed as to why the school of Hillel and the school of Shammai in turn disagreed on the proper course to follow. One Rabbi said that the reason that the school of Shammai holds that one kindles one light less each evening is that the number of lights indicates how many days of the holiday are still to come, (the literal quote is ימים הנכנסים, we adopt Rashi's translation of this, however), whereas the school of Hillel is concerned with the number of days of the holiday that have already passed. The other Rabbi holds that the difference between the two schools of thought is due to the school of Hillel holding that in matters of sanctity one progresses \"upwards,\" i.e. מעלין בקודש ואין מורידין. The reason that the school of Shammai holds that one kindles one less light each night, however, is that we follow the pattern established by the Torah on Sukkot, when successively fewer bulls were offered on each of the seven days of the holiday (Numbers 29,12-34). Rabbi Bar Chanah reported in the name of Rabbi Yochanan that the two Rabbis Yossi quoted were flanked by two elders, one of whom followed the directive of the school of Shammai, whereas the other followed the directive of the school of Hillel. Each of those two elders justified his practice by citing the last two reasons mentioned.

Containing six paragraphs.</b><br>We take out (from the ark) two Torah scrolls.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">168</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Two Torah scrolls are taken out on the festivals because portions from two separate sections of the Torah are read. The Torahs can be set before hand so that they can be opened to the correct portion without the necessity of rolling the scroll from one portion to the next.</i> In the first Torah six men read from the portion “<span dir=\"ltr\">אחרי מות</span>”, (Leviticus 16:1-18:30) until “and he did as the Lord commanded (Moses)”, (Leviticus 16:34). But if (Yom Kippur) falls on Shabbat, seven (men read from the first Torah), and the <i>Maftir</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">169</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Maftir</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">מפטיר</span>, means literally \"one who concludes\". It is the name given to the man who is the last to read in the Torah and he also usually reads the <i>haftarah</i> (see footnote 170), the section of the prophets that corresponds to the Torah reading. <i>Maftir</i> is also the name given to the three or more concluding verses of the regular weekly Torah portion as well as to the final verses read on festivals and public fast days.<br>Editorial Staff, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 11, p. 685.</i> (the last reader) reads from the second (Torah scroll) from the portion, <i>Pinḥas</i>, (Numbers 25:10-30:1), the section “and you shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month”, (Numbers 29:7-11). The <i>Maftir</i> (the <i>Haftarah</i> section from the Prophets<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">170</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Haftarah</i>, <span class=\"rtl\">הפטרה</span>, is a portion from the Prophets section of the Bible read after the Torah is read on Sabbaths, festivals, and fast days. On Sabbaths and festivals the <i>haftarah</i> is read during the Morning, <i>Shaḥarit</i> Service (see footnote 17), but on fast days it is read only during the Afternoon, <i>Minḥah</i> Service (see footnote 40). The exception to this is Yom Kippur and <i>Tishah be-Av</i> (see footnote 102) where there is a <i>haftarah</i> after the Torah reading in both the Morning and the Afternoon Service.<br>The Torah in its regular portions is read straight through during the year but such is not the case on festivals and some special Sabbaths. The <i>haftarot</i> are selected in parts from both the Former and Latter Prophets. Only two prophetic books are read in their entirety as <i>haftarot</i>, the Book of Obadiah which has only twenty-one verses and is read after the Torah portion <i>Va-Yishlaḥ</i> (Genesis 32:4-36-43) according to the Sephardi rite, and the Book of Jonah which is the <i>haftarah</i> for the <i>Minḥah</i> Service on Yom Kippur (see the Shulḥan Arukh, <i>Oraḥ Ḥayyim</i> 622:2).<br><i>Haftarot</i> were usually selected so there would be some similarity in content between the Pentateuchal and the Prophetic portions, but often this did not happen and <i>haftarot</i> were chosen because of historical events or because of some special date. Special <i>haftarot</i> are read on special Sabbaths and the <i>haftarah</i> for each festival is based on the nature of the festival.<br>When the custom of reading the <i>haftarah</i> got started is not known for sure, but it is thought that it began during the persecutions of the Antiochus Epiphanes which preceded the Hasmonean revolt. The Torah was not permitted to be read by the Jews during the persecution for it was felt that the reading of it kept the Jews together and gave them a special strength. As a substitute for the Torah reading, sections form the Prophets were chosen that would remind the Jews of the corresponding Torah portion. Appearantly when the ban against reading the Torah was lifted, the practice of reading the <i>haftarah</i> continued. The first mention of the practice of the reading of the <i>haftarah</i> is found in the New Testament. Acts 13:15 states, \"after the reading of the law and the prophets\". <i>Haftarot</i> are also discussed in the Talmud as to which are to be read at specific times and festivals. In Mishnaic times different communities read different <i>haftarot</i>, and a set order was probably not established until talmudic times. Some <i>haftarot</i> today differ from those recorded in the Talmud, and there are differences in the Sephardi and Ashkenazi rites.<br>The <i>maftir</i>, the one who reads the <i>haftarah</i> also reads the last part of the weekly portion, (i.e., the Torah reader reads it for him). On the Sabbath, after the seventh reader from the Torah, the <i>maftir</i> usually rereads the last three verses of the weekly portion. On festivals and the four special Sabbaths, the <i>maftir</i> reads the special section from the second scroll which is usually a short description of of the festival found in the Torah. Before the <i>haftarah</i> is read (or chanted) the <i>maftir</i> precedes the <i>haftarah</i> with two blessings and after he ends the <i>haftarah</i> he recites three blessings to which a fourth one is added on Sabbaths and festivals. This fourth blessing changes with the nature of the day. The Sabbath <i>haftarah</i> usually has a minimum of twenty-one verses while the festival has at least fifteen verses. Lately it has become the custom for the Bar Mitzvah boy (a man upon reaching the age of thirteen) to chant the <i>haftarah</i> to display his ability with a Hebrew text.<br>Louis Isaac Rabinowitz, <i>E</i>. <i>J</i>., v. 16, pp. 1342-44.</i>) comes from Isaiah, “and shall say, cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way” until “for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it”, (Isaiah 57:14-58:14).", "versionTitle": "Hilkhot Yom ha-Kippurim, trans. by Jan M.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

The purpose of that passage, however, was to indicate the overlay of the holy on the cycle of the year; the material here neither creates the calendar itself nor has anything to do with either voluntary offerings or those brought for expiation of sin. It may have been inserted at this point, in this book, because in its drawn-out, formulaic rhetoric, it has the character of a list such as we often find in Numbers.

The entire section begins with the verb (26:4), and ends with it as well (36:13). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking.", "Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. 26), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come-near” (27:1 and 36:1). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it.", "Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again.", "What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy.", "<img>", "<b><i>Num. 26:3</i> Moshe spoke, and El’azar the priest, to them in the Plains of Moav …</b>"], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

דעות שונות בבבלי מגילה לא,א מה הם ענייני הפסח ומה סדרם. יש מי שפירש, שהמשנה מתכוונת לכל ימי הפסח, שכל ימי הפסח חוזרים וקוראים אותה פרשת מועדות שבתורת כוהנים. אך ניתן גם  להניח, שלפי המשנה אין קוראים אלא ביום הראשון של הפסח, כי חול המועד של הפסח והיום האחרון אין בהם כל שינוי בסדר הקורבנות, ואף את ה'הלל' לא קראו בארץ ישראל בימי התנאים ובימים שלאחר מכן לא בחול המועד של הפסח ולא ביום האחרון. אם נקבל פירוש זה, יהיה בו גם כדי להסביר מדוע צורפה לקריאה של היום הראשון אף פרשת הנפת העומר ולא השאירוה לקריאה של היום הראשון של חול המועד, היום שבו הניפו את העומר: יום הנפת העומר לא היתה בו קריאה, ולקביעת יום ההנפה היתה חשיבות רבה, לכן המשיכו ביום הראשון אף את קריאת פרשת הנף שנעשית ביום שלאחריו. בימי עריכתה הסופית של התוספתא כבר קראו כל ימי חג הפסח בענייני הפסח שבתורה. בירושלמי אין כל התייחסות לקריאה בשאר ימי הפסח, אך ייתכן שאין זה אלא מקרה, שכן אין הסוגיה בירושלמי דנה כלל בקריאה של פסח (\"משנת ארץ ישראל\", תענית ומגילה, עמודים 339-340).<br><br>מנהגם של בני ארץ ישראל (בתקופת הגניזה) ביום טוב ראשון של פסח היה לקרוא ב\"שור או כבש\" (ויקרא כב,כו). הם קראו ביום שני של חג ב\"כי תבואו אל הארץ\" (ויקרא כג,ט), היא הפרשה המדברת בהנפת העומר. ביום השלישי קראו ב\"זאת חוקת הפסח\" (שמות יב,מג). ביום הרביעי קראו ב\"במדבר סיני\" (במדבר ט,א). ביום החמישי קראו ב\"שמור את חודש האביב\" (דברים טז,א). ביום השישי קראו ב\"אם כסף תלווה את עמי\" (שמות כב,כד). ביום השביעי קראו בפרשת \"בשלח\" (\"תפילה ומנהגי תפילה

It is dealing with the first day. But nowadays, it is the general practice that on the first day [of Passover] we read: “Go, pick out [lambs for your families…]” (Exodus 12:21 through verse 51), and we recite the Haftarah concerning the Passover in Gilgal (Joshua 3:5-7 and Joshua 5:2-16 and 6:1, 27); on the Second Day [of Passover” we read [in the Torah]: “When an ox or sheep or a goat [is born…]” (Leviticus 22:26-23:44). And we recite the Haftarah of the Passover of [King] Josiah (II Kings 23:1-9; 21-25 – though Bartenura errantly lists chapter 22). On the third day, [we read]: “Consecrate to Me every first-born” (Exodus 13:1-16). On the fourth day, [we read]: “If you lend money to My people…” (Exodus 22:24-23:19); on the fifth day [we read]: “Carve [two tablets of stone like the first…” (Exodus 34:1 – though today, the Torah reading, if it is Shabbat Hol HaMoed/the Intermediate Sabbath, begins with Exodus 33:12 and extends to Exodus 34:26); on the sixth day, [we read]: “Let the Israelite people offer the Passover sacrifice at its set time” (Numbers 9:2 – but the reading begins at Numbers 9:1 as pointed out in the Bartenura commentary – and extends to Numbers 9:14); on the seventh day, the Song at the Sea of Reeds (Exodus 13:17 – which extends to Exodus 15:26); and we recite the Haftarah: “And David spoke” (II Samuel 22:1-51). On the eighth day, which is the last day of Yom Tov in the Diaspora, we read [from the Torah]: “All male firstlings” (Deuteronomy 15:17 through Deuteronomy 16:17) and recite from the Haftarah: “This same day at Nob He will stand [and wave his hand]…” (Isaiah 10:32 through verse 34, Isaiah 11:1-16 and Isaiah 12:1-6). On Shavuot/Atzeret, on the first day of Yom Tov,[we read in the Torah]: “In the third month…” (Exodus 19:1 through Exodus 20:23) and recite the Haftarah of the Chariot of Ezekiel (Ezekiel, 1:1-28 and 3:12; on the Second Day of the Diaspora, [we read in the Torah}: “All male firstlings” (Deuteronomy 15:17 through Deuteronomy 16:17] and recite from the Haftarah Habbakuk (Chapter 3, verses 1-19; there is a Sephardic practice to extend the reading from Habbukuk 2:20-3:19). On Rosh Hashanah [we read in the Torah]: “And God took note of Sarah” (Genesis 21:1 through verse 24) for on Rosh Hashanah, Sarah was remembered, and we recite from the Haftarah of Hannah (I Samuel 1:1 through chapter 2, verse 10) as she too was remembered on Rosh Hashanah. On the Second Day of Rosh Hashanah, [we read in the Torah] the Akedah/the Binding [of Isaac] (Genesis, chapter 22, verses 1 through 24) and we recite the Haftarah portion: “Truly, Ephraim is a dear son to Me…” (verse 20 is the verse quoted at the conclusion of the Haftarah – of chapter 31 of Jeremiah – the Haftarah begins at verse 2). On Yom Kippur morning [we read in the Torah]: “After the death” (Leviticus 16:1 – the reading extends to the end of the chapter, verse 34) and we recite the Haftarah portion: “[For thus said] He who high aloft forever dwells” (verse 15 of the Haftarah from Isaiah that begins with chapter 57 verse 14 and concludes in Isaiah chapter 58 verse 14). At Minhah/Afternoon Service, [we read from the Torah]: the [laws of] incest (Leviticus chapter 18, verses 1-30) and recite the Haftarah [of the book of] Jonah. On [both] of the first two days of Yom Tov of “the holiday” (i.e., Sukkot), [we read from the Torah]: “When an ox or sheep or goat [is born]…” (Leviticus 22:26-23:44) and on the first day, we recite the Haftarah: “Lo, the day of the LORD is coming…” (Zechariah 14:1 and continuing to verse 21), and on the Second Day [of the Holiday], we recite the Haftarah: “All the men of Israel gathered [before King Solomon at the Feast…]” (I Kings, chapter 8, verses 2-21). And all the rest of the days of the Holiday (i.e., Sukkot), we read the sacrifices of the Holiday. How so? On the third day, which is the first day of Hol HaMoed, the Kohen reads, “And on the second day” (Numbers 29:17 and onwards to 19), the Levite reads: “And on the third day” (Numbers 29:20-22) and the Israelite reads: “On the fourth day” (Numbers 29:23-25), and the fourth Aliyah returns and reads: “On the second day” (Numbers 29:17-19) and “On the third day” (Numbers 29:20-22). On the fourth day (which is the second day of Hol HaMoed), the Kohen reads: “On the third day” (Numbers 29:20-22); the Levite reads “On the fourth day” (Numbers 29:23-25); the Israelite reads: “On the fifth day” (Numbers 29:26-28), and the fourth Aliyah reads: “On the third day” (Numbers 29:20-22) and “On the fourth day” (Numbers 29:23-25) and similarly for all of them. On the concluding day of the Holiday (i.e., Shemini Atzeret, as we know it today), [we read from the Torah]: “All male firstlings” (Deuteronomy 15:17 through Deuteronomy 16:17 – but today, if Shemini Atzeret occurs on Shabbat, we begin the Torah reading at Deuteronomy 14:22). And we recite the Haftarah: “When Solomon finished [offering to the LORD]…” (I Kings 8, 54-66), and on the morrow, we read [from the Torah]: “And this is the blessing” (Deuteronomy 33:1-through the conclusion of the Torah, Deuteronomy 34:12. The Bartenura does NOT mention the reading of the first chapter of Genesis as well). And we recite the Haftarah: “And it came to pass after the death of Moses” (Joshua, 1:1-18). And on the Shabbat that falls on Hol HaMoed/the Intermediate Days, whether for Passover or Sukkot, we read [from the Torah]: “See, You say to me…” (Exodus 33:12-34:26), and recite for the Haftarah: On Passover – The Dry Bones (Ezekiel 37:1-14) and for Sukkot: “When Gog sets foot [on the soil of Israel]…” (Ezekiel 38:18-39:16), for the tradition is in our hands that the Resurrection of the Dead will someday occur during Passover, and the War of Gog and Magog on Sukkot.", "versionTitle": "Bartenura on Mishnah, trans. by Rabbi Robert Alpert, 2020", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "5f901dd68c4346ab33bf78db", "index_title": "Gevurot Hashem", "category": "Jewish Thought", "type": "", "ref": "Gevurot Hashem 47:25", "anchorRef": "Numbers 29:13-32", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 29:13", "Numbers 29:14", "Numbers 29:15", "Numbers 29:16", "Numbers 29:17", "Numbers 29:18", "Numbers 29:19", "Numbers 29:20", "Numbers 29:21", "Numbers 29:22", "Numbers 29:23", "Numbers 29:24", "Numbers 29:25", "Numbers 29:26", "Numbers 29:27", "Numbers 29:28", "Numbers 29:29", "Numbers 29:30", "Numbers 29:31", "Numbers 29:32"], "sourceRef": "Gevurot Hashem 47:25", "sourceHeRef": "גבורות השם מ״ז:כ״ה", "anchorVerse": 13, "sourceHasEn": false, "compDate": [1562, 1582], "commentaryNum": 47.0025, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Gevurot Hashem", "he": "גבורות השם"}, "he": "<b>וכנגד אלו</b> שלש אמונות, שהם שרשים ויסוד לדת, צוה השם יתברך בשלשה רגלים (שמות כג, יד). ונקראים \"רגלים\" על שם שהם רגלי הדת, שעומד עליהם הדת<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"165\"></i>. כי חג הפסח בו נודע שהוא יתברך כל יכול על ידי אותות ומופתים<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"166\"></i>, עד קריעת ים סוף שהיה בשביעי של פסח (רש\"י שמות יד, ה)<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"167\"></i>, ובו נודע בבירור שהכל ביכלתו, ואין חוץ ממנו<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"168\"></i>. וחג השבועות, בו נודע נתינת התורה<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"169\"></i>. וחג הסוכות, שהושיב אותם בענני כבוד בשמירתו<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"170\"></i>, וזה מורה על ההשגחה והשמירה שהיה עליהם, ולא עזב אותם, שהושיב אותם בסכות<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"171\"></i>, שהיא השמירה. וכמו שאנו אומרים \"פורס סכת שלום עלינו* ועל כל עמו ישראל ועל ירושלים\"<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"172\"></i>. ובחג הסוכות היו מקריבין שבעים פרים (במדבר כט, יג-לב), נגד שבעים אומות, ויום השמיני פר אחד (שם פסוק לו), נגד אומה יחידה (סוכה נה:)<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"173\"></i>. לכך פר אחד באחרונה, כי אחר שיעברו האומות*<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"174\"></i>, יהיו נשארים ישראל<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"175\"></i>. וכל זמן ששבעים אומות בעולם, אז צריך סוכה ושמירה<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"176\"></i>. וכאשר יעברו שבעים אומות העולם*, אז אין כאן סוכה<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"177\"></i>, כי אין צריך עוד סוכה ושמירה כאשר אין אומות עוד מושלים<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"178\"></i>, ודי בזה<i data-commentator=\"Notes by Rabbi Yehoshua Hartman\" data-label=\"179\"></i>.

The reason for that is that the Torah is divided into five books and then into paragraphs, some of which are intended exclusively for the masses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">13. Cf. above chap. VIII, p. 170, where Kaspi explains that Genesis is intended primarily for the select individuals, whereas the later portions are for the masses.</i> The reason for this is that the Torah was to be handed to the masses (as well as) the singular individuals, which are opposites. So it was necessary to write some things exclusively for the select few, | and some things exclusively for the masses. The part that is intended for “the individuals of truth” relates to the subjects of the Account of Creation and the Account of the Chariot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">14. These two “accounts” correspond to the Aristotelian categories of Physics and Metaphysics respectively. See L. Strauss, <i>Persecution and the Art of Writing</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1952), pp. 38 ff.</i> This includes most of Genesis. The part that is exclusively for the masses includes most of Leviticus, which is mostly sacrifices and related things that include all the sacrificial rites. Sacrifice was one of the most necessary practices for the masses to be able to rely on its performance, just as the select few rely on intellectual truths. For this reason Moses impressed this act upon their hearts,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">15. This reflects Kaspi’s earlier comments that sacrifices are only for the benefit of the masses, who need to perform such ceremonies. Cf. chap. VI.</i> by describing the sacrifices of the princes at length. Thus, while they were all of a kind, he recorded the sacrifice twelve complete times—whereas had this been a matter concerning the select few, it would have sufficed to write the procedure followed by the first prince, and then said, “and thus did each one.” That would have been the same as in the case of the six branches of the candelabra,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">16. Exod. 25:33, “so for the six branches going out of the candlestick …”</i> which was written for intellectual purposes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">17. In the <i>Menorat Kesef</i> (AS II 103 ff.), while explaining the Temple as a microcosm reflecting the macrocosm of the universe, Kaspi explains that the candelabra represents the six Separate Intelligences, which are beyond man’s comprehension.</i> Even some of the popular subjects used such methods, such as “and so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother,”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">18. Deut. 23:3, which does not repeat all the possible objects that might be lost.</i> for the Torah customarily uses analogy based on specific example, which is known as a principle of logic.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">19.
