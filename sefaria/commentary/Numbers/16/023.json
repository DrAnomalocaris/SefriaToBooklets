This pattern was already seen in the book of Exodus, where, despite the climactic miracle of deliverance at the Sea of Reeds, the Israelites “grumbled against Moshe” at Mara because of lack of drinkable water. Although a strain in later biblical thinking remembered the wilderness period as a kind of honeymoon (cf. Jer. 2:2), the Torah itself chose to remember it as a severe time of testing which the ex-slaves ultimately failed to pass.", "The second part of Numbers is a remarkable collection of rebellion narratives that simultaneously display striking similarities and great and colorful differences. The section details six rebellions of the people, and two of the leaders themselves. They are united by a consistent vocabulary: verbs such as “grumble” and “assemble/gather/speak against” depict complaints against Moshe and Aharon and against God. These stories also display the recurring themes of dearth of food and water, and God’s anger at the rebellions, usually expressed in some form of plague (or, additionally, fire).", "Rather than unfold in simple chronological order, one following another, these pieces of the text have been intensified by priestly editing, which has interspersed the stories with a number of cultic and legal passages (Chaps. 15, 18, and 19, all of which bear the theme word “law” [Heb. <i>hok</i> or <i>hukka</i>]), and which are somehow related to previous or succeeding narratives. The interruptions also allow each of the memorable rebellion narratives to “breathe,” giving the audience time to digest the images and the drama presented therein. The stories possess both in abundant measure; one thinks, for instance, of the “meat between the teeth” (11:33), of the grape clusters borne on a pole by two men (13:23); and of the great confrontation with Korah in Chapter 16 (not to mention its resolution), as well as Moshe’s dramatic failure in Chapter 20.", "As in any great literature, repetition of story type or type scene is here accomplished via variation of the most telling kind. In this case we observe once again an alternating pattern to the rebellions, a pattern which reveals not one theme but several:", "The people, over lack of food (chapter 11)", "Moshe’s siblings, over prophetic primacy (12)", "The people, over the spies’ false report (14)", "Levites, over Moshe and Aharon’s prerogatives (16)", "The people, over the rebellious Levites’ sinister fate (17)", "Moshe himself, over the burden of leading the people (20)", "The people, over the lack of food and water (21)", "The pattern observable here is broken, in true biblical rhetorical style (where the last in a sequence often serves by its oddness to reinforce the whole), in a final rebellion (Chap. 25), where the people’s actions involve neither the “complaining” vocabulary nor a revolt against human leadership, but rather comprise the greatest biblical crime of them all: worship of other gods. Viewed in this patterned fashion, the rebellion narratives emerge with a kind of crescendo effect.", "It is also possible, as I have done in “On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure,” above, to follow the scheme put forth by Mann—a three-part structure to the section, each with its internal logic and conclusions. These are treated below; for the moment, it will suffice to see in the first subsection (Chaps. 11–14) the inevitable result of wilderness rebellions: the divine decree that the slave generation must die out before entering the Promised Land; the second subsection (16–20) deals with the challenges to the leadership of Moshe and Aharon, and results in a similar decree, that they will die outside the land; and the third subsection (20–25) chronicles the encounter of the Israelites with neighboring nations, which initially goes in their favor but ends with the disastrous incident at Baal Pe’or (25).", "The primary issue in these stories, to the biblical writer, is lack of trust in God. Each of the three sections mentions or implies that problem; 14:11 and 20:12 use the verb itself, and the narrative of Chapter 25 suggests it. The bottom line is that the Israelites could not keep faith with God—even after both staggering acts of divine intervention (i.e., rescue) and demonstrations of the force of divine wrath—and this lack of faith led ultimately to their dying out in the wilderness outside the Promised Land, in punishment. The stories clearly were meant to be understood as an unfortunate example for later generations, and were taken as such already in the biblical period (see, for example, the treatment in Psalm 78).", "Read on another level, the rebellion narratives are largely concerned with the issue of human leadership, its qualifications, manifestations, and limitations (and even failures). Has there ever been a leader as beleaguered as Moshe? From the beginning of his career on the sands of Egypt, where he assumes the mantle of leadership in the matter of retaliating against the sadistic Egyptian taskmaster (Ex. 2:11–12), to its end at the plains of Moab, in stern address to the people he has struggled to lead (this is the setting of the entire next book, Deuteronomy), he must evoke trust in God, lead the people through an uncharted wilderness, and inspire confidence in his own leadership. His success is muted by the passing of the generation he initially leads, before it can enter Canaan; like them, he too must pass on—with merely a look beyond the Jordan, but no more. Later generations of Jewish readers wept on confronting Moshe’s seemingly premature death, and created heroic tales of his pleading before God to be let into the land he had so long sought to reach. In Numbers he fully deserves this stature, alternately interceding with and cajoling God, standing up for and then almost giving up on this people with whom his life has become so enmeshed. Our stories stress his gifts of prophecy and his pathos as a deeply human leader.", "A final, troubling issue is the character of God in this part of the book. It is a measure of the Bible’s artistry that the rebellion accounts are so varied in content and style; but the variations in punishment—from undetailed death to skin disease to stoning and the earth opening up, just to mention a few examples—create an impression, not of artistic richness but of unremitting severity. The Bible does not seem to have a problem with this kind of divine behavior, and other ancient cultures would have felt at home here, but already in late antiquity, and continuing down to our own day, Jews and Christians most often have preferred, and prayed to, a more forgiving, nurturing, and compassionate God. Dealing with these texts, in the end, raises the question of whether to understand them as the result of “historical necessity” or “literary conceit” (that is, the old generation simply had to die out) or as they stand in the text: a harsh portrayal of what happened when the covenant people violated the covenant."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

The story of the revolt of Korah the Levite and Datan and Aviram the Reubenites, which may have stemmed from two different accounts, holds the common thread of the rebels’ feeling left out—Korah, as Moshe’s and Aharon’s first cousin, might well have headed the priestly line (his father was older than theirs), whereas Datan and Aviram’s tribe of Re’uven had lost some of its firstborn primacy, and was not even camped on the choice east side of the Dwelling. Moshe clearly sees the political motivation behind the revolt, and is indignant that anyone would impute greed (cf. v.15) or lust for power to him.", "As Buber (1988) points out, however, more is at stake here. The rebels’ contention that “the entire community, the entirety of them, are holy,” though it sounds at first blush like the ideal expressed in Ex. 19:6 (God’s offer to make of the Israelites “a kingdom of priests, / a holy nation”), is in reality a most dangerous claim. Holiness in the Bible is a trait that can be acquired, even transmitted to an extent, but it is not absolutely innate, except in the case of God; and the Torah sees as ope of its major goals developing the means whereby people can, with holy intent and preparation, properly serve the Holy. The fate of the rebels therefore bespeaks the seriousness of the threat they pose, and is unique in the Bible.", "The narrative hinges on a number of expressions. The conflict between Moshe and the rebels is nicely encapsulated by two pairs of identical charges and countercharges—“Too much (is) yours” (vv.3 and 7) and “Is it too little” (vv.9 and 13). The terms “community” and “assembly” are played upon, designating alternately the body of the people and the minicommunity of the rebels. More significantly, this chapter and those around it—15, 17, and 18—are meaningfully linked together by variations on the Hebrew root <i>k-r-b</i> (Buber 1994). The thread of meaning runs from “bringing near-offerings near,” to God “declaring [Moshe and Ahron] near” to him, to the fact that he has “brought-near” the Levites in terms of their duties, to Korah and his band being asked to “bring-near” the incense, whose fire-pans later become holy because they were “brought-near,” and finally, to the repeated warning to outsiders not to “come-near” the sancta. At issue is what Buber calls “authorized” and “unauthorized nearing,” which is mentioned frequently in Leviticus but is used in the present text with the full artistic resources at the narrator’s command. Viewed in this light, order is restored to the blurring of lines threatened by Korah.", "for it was an error,", "but they have brought their near-offering,", "a fire-offering of soothing savor for Y<small>HWH</small>,", "and their <i>hattat</i>-offering before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>, on account of their error."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

congregation, saying: Withdraw from around the dwellings of Koraḥ, Datan, and Aviram” (Numbers 16:24).</b> <br>“The Lord spoke to Moses, saying…Withdraw from around the dwellings of Koraḥ” – although Moses heard it directly from the Omnipotent, he did not say to them: “Withdraw” until he went and forewarned them, as it is stated: “Moses arose and went to Datan and Aviram” (Numbers 16:25). This was to make known the extent of their wickedness as, although he went on foot to them, it is difficult to placate these wicked ones. What did they do? They did not wish to come out on their own <alternatively, of their tents> to confront him. When Moses saw this, he said: ‘It was incumbent upon me to go this far.’ <br><b>“He spoke to the congregation, saying: Depart now, away from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that is theirs, lest you be destroyed for all their sins” (Numbers 16:26).</b> <br>“He spoke to the congregation, saying: Depart now, away from the tents of these wicked men” – our Rabbis taught: Four are characterized as wicked: One who extends his hand toward another to strike him, even though he did not strike him, is characterized as wicked, as it is stated: “He said to the wicked one: Why do you strike your counterpart” (Exodus 2:13). “Did you strike” is not written, but rather, “do you strike [<i>takeh</i>].”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word takeh is in the future tense.</i> One who borrows but does not pay, as it is stated: “Wicked is one who borrows and does not repay; righteous is one who is gracious and gives” (Psalms 37:21). One who has insolence, and is not ashamed in the presence of one who is greater than he, as it is stated: “The wicked man is insolent before him, but the upright discerns his way” (Proverbs 21:29). And one who is a disputant, as it is stated: “Depart now away from the tents of these wicked men.” Two of them [wicked characteristics] were in Datan and Aviram, insolence and dispute [<i>maḥloket</i>]. <i>Maḥloket: mem </i>– <i>maka </i>[smiting]; <i>ḥet</i> – <i>ḥaron </i>[fury]; <i>lamed </i>– <i>likui </i>[punishment]; <i>kof</i> – <i>kelala </i>[curse]; <i>tav</i> – <i>to’eva</i> [abomination]. Some say, <i>takhlit </i>[end], as it brings extermination to the world. <br><b>“They withdrew from around the dwelling of Koraḥ, Datan, and Aviram, and Datan and Aviram emerged and stood at the entrance of their tents, with their wives, and their children, and their infants” (Numbers 16:27).</b> <br>“They withdrew from around the dwelling of Koraḥ” – when they saw that Israel had departed from around them, they emerged cursing and blaspheming, as it is stated: “Datan and Aviram emerged standing” (Numbers 16:27), and elsewhere it is written: “The Philistine approached every morning and evening and stood for forty days” (I Samuel 17:16).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See above, Bemidbar Rabba 16:4.</i> <br><b>“Moses said: With this you will know that the Lord has sent me to perform all these actions, as it is not from my heart” (Numbers 16:28). <br>“If these die like the death of all people, and the destiny of all people will be visited upon them, the Lord has not sent Me” (Numbers 16:29).</b> <br>“Moses said: With this you will know that the Lord has sent me…. If these die like the death of all people” – to what is this matter comparable? It is to the patron of a king’s daughter, who had her proof in his possession.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He kept the proof that she had been a virgin before her wedding night – a sheet with blood on it.</i> One of the guests stood and cursed the groomsman and alleged that the king’s daughter had not been a virgin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On her wedding night.</i> The patron stood and confronted the king: 'If you do not demand that retribution be exacted, and you do not take this one out and put him to death before everyone, I, too, will say that, apparently, the king’s daughter had not been a virgin.’ The king immediately said: ‘It is preferable for me to put this one to death and not have the patron disseminating slander about my daughter.’ <br>So, Koraḥ entered into a dispute with Moses and said: ‘From his heart and at his initiative, Moses said all these matters.’ Moses began and said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘If these die in their beds in the manner that people die, and the doctors enter and visit them in the manner that all the ill are visited, I, too, will deny and say: “The Lord did not send me” (Numbers 16:29), and I fabricated it in my heart.’ This is one of three prophets who spoke in this style: Elijah, Mikhaihu, and Moses. Elijah said: “God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today it will be known that You are God in Israel, and I am Your servant, and at Your word I performed all these matters. Answer me, Lord, answer me, and this people will know that You, Lord, are God, and it is You who have turned their heart back” (I Kings 18:36–37). ‘If you do not answer my plea, I will say: It is You who turned their hearts back.’ <br>Likewise, Mikhaihu said to Ahab: “If you return in peace” (I Kings 22:28), I, too, say: “The Lord did not speak through me” (I Kings 22:28).  <br><b>“But if the Lord creates a creation, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them and everything that is theirs, and they descend alive into the abyss, you shall know that these people have scorned the Lord” (Numbers 16:30).</b> <br>Likewise, Moses: “If these die like the death of all people…”  The Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: ‘What do you seek?’ He said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, “but if...a creation” – if You created a mouth to the earth, that is excellent; but if not, “the Lord creates [<i>yivra</i>]” – let Him create [<i>yivra</i>] it a mouth now.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “You decide something, and He will fulfill it for you, and light will shine upon your ways” (Job 22:28).", "versionTitle": "The Sefaria Midrash Rabbah, 2022", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "5d8ccee3e686194f6d052e65", "index_title": "Machzor Yom Kippur Ashkenaz", "category": "Liturgy", "type": "", "ref": "Machzor Yom Kippur Ashkenaz, The Morning Prayers, Akeidah (The Binding of Yitzchak) 4", "anchorRef": "Numbers 16:2-35", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 16:2", "Numbers 16:3", "Numbers 16:4", "Numbers 16:5", "Numbers 16:6", "Numbers 16:7", "Numbers 16:8", "Numbers 16:9", "Numbers 16:10", "Numbers 16:11", "Numbers 16:12", "Numbers 16:13", "Numbers 16:14", "Numbers 16:15", "Numbers 16:16", "Numbers 16:17", "Numbers 16:18", "Numbers 16:19", "Numbers 16:20", "Numbers 16:21", "Numbers 16:22", "Numbers 16:23", "Numbers 16:24", "Numbers 16:25", "Numbers 16:26", "Numbers 16:27", "Numbers 16:28", "Numbers 16:29", "Numbers 16:30", "Numbers 16:31", "Numbers 16:32", "Numbers 16:33", "Numbers 16:34", "Numbers 16:35"], "sourceRef": "Machzor Yom Kippur Ashkenaz, The Morning Prayers, Akeidah (The Binding of Yitzchak) 4", "sourceHeRef": "מחזור אשכנז ליום כיפור, תפלת שחרית, עקדה ד׳", "anchorVerse": 2, "sourceHasEn": true, "compDate": [1155, 1205], "commentaryNum": 4, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Machzor Yom Kippur Ashkenaz", "he": "מחזור אשכנז ליום כיפור"}, "heTitle": "עקדה", "he": "<b>לְעוֹלָם </b>יְהֵא אָדָם יְרֵא שָׁמַֽיִם בַּסֵּֽתֶר וּבַגָּלוּי וּמוֹדֶה עַל הָאֱמֶת וְדוֹבֵר אֱמֶת בִּלְבָבוֹ וְיַשְׁכֵּם וְיֹאמַר: רִבּוֹן כָּל הָעוֹלָמִים לֹא עַל צִדְקוֹתֵֽינוּ אֲנַֽחְנוּ מַפִּילִים תַּחֲנוּנֵֽינוּ לְפָנֶֽיךָ כִּי עַל רַחֲמֶֽיךָ הָרַבִּים, מָה אָֽנוּ מֶה חַיֵּֽינוּ מֶה חַסְדֵּֽנוּ, מַה צִּדְקוֹתֵֽינוּ, מַה יְּשׁוּעָתֵֽנוּ, מַה כֹּחֵֽנוּ מַה גְּבוּרָתֵֽנוּ, מַה נֹּאמַר לְפָנֶֽיךָ יְהֹוָה אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ וֵאלֹהֵי אֲבוֹתֵֽינוּ הֲלֹא כָּל הַגִּבּוֹרִים כְּאַֽיִן לְפָנֶֽיךָ וְאַנְשֵׁי הַשֵּׁם כְּלֹא הָיוּ וַחֲכָמִים כִּבְלִי מַדָּע וּנְבוֹנִים כִּבְלִי הַשְׂכֵּל כִּי רוֹב מַעֲשֵׂיהֶם תֹּֽהוּ וִימֵי חַיֵּיהֶם הֶֽבֶל לְפָנֶֽיךָ, וּמוֹתַר הָאָדָם מִן הַבְּהֵמָה אָֽיִן כִּי הַכֹּל הָֽבֶל: ", "heVersionTitle": "The Metsudah Machzor.
