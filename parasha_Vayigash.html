                <h4>Ba'al Shem Tov, Vayigash 1:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>And Judah drew near to him and said, Oh my lord, (Genesis 44:18) The Talmud says, “A person should always praise G-d first, and then pray [for his needs]. (Berachos 31a.)  Yet, in another place, the Talmud states the opposite view. (“Rabbi Eliezer said, a person should first ask for his needs, and then pray.” Avoda Zara 7b.)  The answer is that there are two separate opinions. The Ramban (Nachmanidies (1194-1270).)  writes that the essence of a craftsman can be found in the craft that he creates. (Meaning, whenever a person creates something, something of his soul enters into and remains in their handicraft. Great kabbalists, such as the Arizal and the Baal Shem Tov could look at an object, and immediately know everything about the one who made it. Here, the Baal Shem Tov applies the principle to creation itself. Since it is G-d’s handiwork, there must be a remnant of the Creator within it.)  [Likewise], the Creation is compared to a snail, whose garment is part of itself. (Midrash Rabbosai, Bereishis 21:5. Just as the garments of a locust are part of itself, so the creation is not something separate from or outside of the Divine. It is part of Him, and His Presence is continually present within it.)  In all suffering, there exists a spark of holiness from G-d, although it is hidden within many garments. This is the meaning of the verse: “the seven maids chosen to be given to her, from the king’s house” (The “seven maids” represent the sparks of holiness that have fallen among the “shells” of impurity. The word maid, na’arah, is related to the word “to shake out,” mino’ar, because the holiness found in these sparks has been “shaken out” of them, until almost nothing remains. However, these sparks yearn to return to their root. Thus, the verse from Esther continues: “When it came the turn for each maid to come into the king…” (Esther 2:12); that is, each spark of holiness has a pre-determined time that it will leave the shells of impurity, and come before the King. (See Baal Shem Tov on the Torah, Miketz, on Genesis 41:1.)  (Esther 2:9). When a person realizes that G-d is with him even there, the garments become transparent and disappear, and the suffering is abated. This is what it means to offer praise first. G-d’s praise is that His glory fills the entire universe. “In all their afflictions, He is afflicted” (Isaiah 63:9) – then, there is no affliction (The word lo in this verse is written different than it is read. It is written lamed vav, which mean “him,” in this case, G-d. However, tradition tells us to read the word lo as though it were written with lamed aleph, which means “no,” in this case, “there is not.” The Baal Shem Tov combines both readings. When a person realizes that G-d is present in all of his afflictions, then the afflictions themselves cease to exist.)  – and one can pray. When one knows how to praise G-d in this way, the suffering will disappear by itself. (R. Yaakov Yosef adds here: “I heard from my Master (the Baal Shem Tov) that this is the meaning of ‘You will establish their heart, Your ears will hear [their prayers]” (Psalms 10:17).)  The other opinion says to pray first. (I.e., a person who prays for his needs, without first praising G-d; that is, coming to the realization that G-d is present even in the affliction.)  In this case, a person’s has faith that G-d is also there [in the affliction], so that he can offer his praise [afterward]. (In other words, even though a person does not perceive the spark of holiness in the suffering, if he believes that G-d is with him even there, he will eventually come to this realization.) </p>

              <p>Then Judah drew near to him, and said: ‘Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord’s ears. Do not be angry with your servant; for you are even like Pharaoh. (Genesis 44:18) A careful reading of this verse raises several questions. The words “drew near” (hagasha) denote a sense of confrontation. But in that case, the words “Oh” (בי) and “I pray you” (נא) are redundant. Likewise, in the phrase “Do not be angry,” the word “not” (אל) is redundant, since it would have been more appropriate to say “Be angry; I do not care.” Similarly, the word “like” (כ) is redundant, for it should have said: “For Pharaoh is a person like you, who decrees and does not fulfill. (See Rashi on this verse. The Baal Shem Tov’s reading is based upon a redundancy in the Hebrew, which contains a double adjective “like” – ki k’mocha k’Pharaoh (כִּי כָמוֹךָ כְּפַרְעֹה) It would have been sufficient to write “ki k’mocha Pharaoh.”)  However, all of these extra letters (בי נא אל כ) form an acronym for the verse: “How shall a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to Your word” (Psalms 119:9). (בַּמֶּה יְזַכֶּה נַּעַר אֶת אָרְחוֹ לִשְׁמֹר כִּדְבָרֶךָ.)  And these words have the numerical value of the Divine Names S’ag (ס”ג) and B’an (ב”ן), (S’ag and B’an have the numerical equivalent of 113. By adding one (a common technique in gematria) they equal the numerical equivalent of the seven first letters of the verse from Psalms.)  which rectify anger. This is a wondrous thing.

              <p>Our attitude toward the struggle of life can be greatly enhanced by consideration of this parable. Is observance difficult? Yes. There are walls in our lives, periods when we are tempted or when God seems to be missing. But the King is waiting for us to scale them, and once we succeed, all the pain will melt away. Apply this lesson to human suffering, evil in history; it is a wall hiding the Creator. Break the wall. Realize that God is causing the moment of suffering and trial, and He is with you even during trials. You might feel the burden lifted and your pain alleviated. (The Sfas Emes writes, “And Yehudah stepped forward to him (Gen. 44:18): this is the advice to surmount any moment of travail or when God seems to be hiding His face, accept the will of God and acknowledge that it is God’s doing. Clarify to yourself that what you are experiencing is coming from God, and that while He is hidden His life force is what sustains the predicament you are in. Yehudah stepped forward to Him, he accepted that his difficult trial came from God	Once it is clear to you that all comes from God, that essence is revealed, disaster is averted, the stresses relax, and you sense God’s grace in a revealed manner” Parashas Vayigash (5631) s.v. Vayigash.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>Genesis 44,18. “Yehudah came forward and said: ‘please ‎my lord allow your servant to say something for your ears ‎only, and do not become angry at your servant, for you are ‎similar to Pharaoh himself.” When reading this ‎introduction of Yehudah’s plea we are reminded of a statement in ‎the Talmud Moed katan 16, when quoting Samuel II 23,3. ‎‎[The following is misquoted in the Hebrew versions of ‎several editions, and no Biblical source is given. Ed.] David is speaking in his final address; ‎אמר אלוקי ישראל לי דבר ‏צור ישראל מושל באדם צדיק מושל יראת אלוקים‎. “Israel’s G’d said: ‎‎‘concerning Me, Israel’s Rock: “be ruler over mankind; be ‎righteous, be a ruler practicing the fear of the Lord.” The Talmud ‎understands the unspoken rhetorical question of G’d as to who ‎‎“rules” Him, by answering that the righteous does so when he is ‎able to squash decrees issued by G’d. [As the author has ‎mentioned several times already. Ed.]‎ This also appears to be the meaning of the verse (psalms 48,5) ‎כי הנה המלכים נועדו‎, “see the kings joined forces,” (strove against ‎one another) quoted by the Zohar I, 206. The “kings” in our ‎verse are understood as being Joseph and Yehudah respectively; ‎Joseph is called there ‎קדוש ברוך‎, whereas Yehudah is called ‎כנסת ‏ישראל‎, “the collective soul of the Jewish people.” In our verse the ‎Torah describes the confrontation on a spiritual level of the ‎collective soul of the Jewish people and the individual ruler ‎represented by Joseph. The collective soul of the Jewish people, ‎Yehudah, confronts G’d represented by Joseph. This collective ‎soul of the Jewish people seeks to overturn an evil decree issued ‎by G’d by prayer (concerning the detention of Binyamin in Egypt ‎as a slave). When the tzaddikim, i.e. people normally ‎content to live by the stringent standards of the attribute of ‎Justice, resort to an appeal to the attribute of Mercy, they do so ‎when they plead on behalf of others. Hence Yehudah prefaces ‎his words with the word ‎בי‎, an appeal not to justice but to do ‎something beyond justice. These tzaddikim are at pains not ‎to create the impression that they have lowered their standards ‎concerning their own conduct. The category of tzaddikim ‎to whom such power of squashing G’d’s decrees is attributed are ‎the ones who relate to G’d from the vantage point of ‎אין‎, ‎‎“naught” [explained by the author as a negation of “self,” ‎one’s own dignity, opposite Hashem.] This total ‎negation of self is rewarded by G’d when they intercede on behalf ‎of others in an effort to squash or soften a negative decree.‎‎ The sages, (introduction to the Zohar 10,) when ‎commenting on Jeremiah 10,7 ‎כי בכל חכמי הגוים ובכל מלכותם מאין ‏כמוך‎, “for amongst all the wise men of the gentile nations and ‎amongst all their kings there is none comparable to You,” the ‎implication is that “but amongst the Israelites” there is someone ‎comparable to You. When the prophet Elijah as well as the ‎prophet Elisha revived the dead, this was considered as proof that ‎the ‎חכמי ישראל‎, the wise men of Israel, can perform acts that only ‎G’d can perform. When the just succeed in squashing decrees of ‎G’d that were meant to kill the victims, they too compare to G’d ‎by that same criterion, i.e. they revive those that were “dead,” ‎were it not for the prayers of the righteous. G’d is perceived of ‎granting life or denying life just as He provides rainfall, without ‎which we would not survive for long; the righteous’ prayers for ‎rain when granted achieve exactly the same result.‎ According to the writings of the Ari’z’al  the “attribute” ‎אין‎ is described in the Hebrew alphabet in the Holy Scriptures as ‎the letter ‎כ‎, whereas the “attribute” ‎יראה‎, “awe and reverence” is ‎represented by the letter ‎י‎. The word ‎כי‎ in the verse from ‎Jeremiah quoted in the previous paragraph therefore alludes to ‎this quality of ‎אין‎, total negation of self, that characterizes some ‎of our tzaddikim in their relationship to G’d, and in their ‎service of Him, when they completely deny their ego, or “self.” ‎This very denial of self, obliteration of one’s ego, is capable of ‎resulting in a commensurate degree of ‎התגלות ה'‏‎, “revelation” of ‎aspects of G’d’s essence. When Yehudah described Joseph as ‎כ-‏פרעה‎, where the ‎כ‎ symbolizes this negation of self found in the ‎most exalted ruler, (who does no longer need to impress his peers ‎with his “superiority,”) who can therefore reveal a different ‎virtue, the revelation of an attribute superior to that of Justice, ‎the attribute of Mercy. ‎</p>

              </summary>
              <p>“And Yehuda drew close to him.” (Bereshit, 44:18) This is as the writings say (Shmuel 2, 23:3, the last words of King David), “God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me [thus], the ruler of man is righteous, ruling in the fear of God.” Our sages have explained this in this way (Moed Katan, 16b), “A Tsaddik rules in the fear of God.” “God of Israel said” means the principles of the Torah, and they are the Rama’ch, 248 positive mitzvot, and the Shas’ah, 365 prohibitive mitzvot, that were given to all of Israel in complete equality. “The Rock of Israel spoke to me”—“to me” refers to the ba’al teshuva, the master of return to the law, to whom God speaks specifically, and gives him vigorous strength after he sinned in thinking that there was no hope from Him. Then he returns to God, and he is given tekifut (holy strength). For this reason does the verse formulate itself the way it does, for first it says “said,” a formulation denoting softness, and with the ba’al teshuva it says “spoke,” denoting strength. Also, first the verse says E-lohei, and later Rock, which is also a term of still greater strength. “The ruler of man is righteous” means if the sin was a result of the decree of the sages (namely desecration of the brit, and the “righteous” refers to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai). On this it says “the ruler of man is righteous,” meaning that the ba’al teshuva rules over them (these sins), for nothing stands in the way of return. “Rules in the fear of God” means if the sin was against the written Torah. On this it says “rules in the fear of God,” meaning that he will also rule over this, and on all of this it is said (Avoda Zara, 5a), “said the man who was raised up (Shmuel 2, 23:1), means who raised an offering of teshuva [return].” For even if words of Torah were delivered with great fear, and several known punishments threatened by our sages, still, only before the sin occurred was it said that you have nothing that stands against teshuva. Yet after one has failed he is not to give up, for in the time to come no sin shall remain in any soul of Israel. The principle of this tekifut that we are discussing is in the tribe of Yehuda, so therefore it said, “Yehuda drew close to him.” Even though it seemed now that he had nothing new to say, yet still we can sense the vigor in his words where he has no doubt that salvation will now emerge. This is the meaning of the verse (Mishlei, 24:21), “Fear God, my son, and rule.” “My son [B’ni]” meaning wisdom (Bina), and this is to say that your fear should be refined and true. “And rule” means that you shall be a king who is vigorous in his great trust in God. (And the verse continues), “and do not mix with the hateful,” meaning as the Gemara says (Sotah, 22a), “those who teach the law out of their hatefulness,” and it is asked of this, “is it so simple? It is taught as one who understands it like Rav Huna, who said (that “the hateful” means) one who transgressed, and then taught that it was permitted to him,” meaning that there exists a place even for this, as is explained [in the Mei HaShiloach on the verse, “you shall have a shovel” (Parshat Ki Teitsei]. And this was tekufut of Yehuda after what had happened to him, saying, “I will be a surety for him [Binyamin],” (Bereshit, 43:9) transgressing what is said (Yevamot, 109b), “be wary against vouching [leaving a pledge],” for nevertheless he was confident that salvation would emerge from this. (And this is, “the Rock of Israel spoke to me,” for dibbur, speaking, meaning that God will lower unto him his explicit word, as it were. This matter has special relevance for the tribe of Yehuda, for this tribe, since its power is awesome, will do things that seem to be like people who are not in a state of devekut (intense cleaving) to God. For example, King David, for whom the principle of his birth was from Ruth, and they did not understand the difference between a male Ammonite and a female Ammonite. Giliyon Mei HaShiloach, R. Gershon Henoch Lainer of Radzin, ZY”A.) </p>

              <p>“And Yehuda drew close to him.” (Bereshit, 44:18) The power that God instilled in the tribe of Yehuda is that he will never give up, even if he fears certain things will overcome him. We find in the previous Parsha that he said, “we are my lord’s servants,” (Bereshit 45:16) and it seems as if he began to give up hope, thinking to himself that it was a mistake to risk loosing his share in two worlds over Binyamin. In this Parsha he strengthens himself greatly before God by saying, even though I have done improperly, still, it is in the ability of God to save me. This is, “and Yehuda drew close to him,” “to him” meaning to the innermost depths of Yosef’s heart, to such an extent that he would be forced to reveal himself to them. For all these verses (at the beginning of the Parsha) are a claim against God, with Yehuda supposing all the while that he was standing before and arguing with a Gentile king. Then when God sent them the salvation, then they saw that even in retrospect they were never in danger, for truly they were arguing with their brother. Thus it will be in the future, when God will save us and redeem us, then God will show us that we were never in exile, and that a foreign nation never ruled over us, only God alone. This is the meaning of the verse (Tehilim, 37:10), “and a little more, and there is no evil one, and you considered his place, and there is nothing there,” meaning that very soon evil will be banished. “And you considered,” meaning the understanding of the heart, for if you want to understand its place, “there is nothing there,” meaning that in it there was no power of governance over you.</p>

              <p>&quot;And Yehuda approached him…&quot; (Bereishit 44:18). The Midrash (Rabba 93:2) explains the verse, &quot;If you provided surety for your friend&quot; (Mishlei 6:1-3), as referring to Hashem. Rashi elucidates that each person is a guarantor for his neshama, tasked with returning it to its Father in heaven. Despite the neshama becoming sullied through sin, true teshuva from the depths of one's heart can transform sins into merits, as seen when Yehuda’s repentance led Yosef to reveal himself. While we might not fully understand how sins convert into merits, this transformation is due to the divine influence within us. Just as one turns their heart back to Hashem, so too do their sinful actions transform (Mida keneged mida). Bnei Yisrael, being part of Hashem, retain their identity even when they sin, granting them the strength to approach the divine essence within. This is reflected in the phrase &quot;And he approached him,&quot; meaning Yehuda approached his own internal Godliness. Yehuda’s plea, &quot;Bi Adoni,&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;Hashem is in me.&quot; It is essential that one's desire be solely for the sake of Heaven. Yehuda’s words, &quot;Let your servant speak,&quot; signify that all intentions should align with royal manners, enabling one to speak to the Master of the Universe. When one clarifies this intention genuinely, even if tainted by sin, they can find a way to return to Hashem.</p>

              <p>כי כמוך כפרעה, “for you are just like Pharaoh.” Compare a similar expression in Kings II 3,7: כמוני כמוך, “me and you .” Or Hoseah 4,9: כעם ככהן, the common people just like the priests.” Or, Kohelet 9,2: כטוב כחוטא, “the sinner just as the good one.” Or, Psalms 139,12: כחשיכה כאורה, “darkness and light are the same.”According to Rashi, what Yehudah meant was that “just as Pharaoh issues decrees and does not keep his promises, so you decree and do not keep your promise.” According to a Midrash, what Yehudah referred to was that Joseph had only demanded to “see” Binyamin before releasing Shimon and letting us buy food and return to the land of Canaan. Instead he had detained them, invited them. caused them to become drunk with him, etc., as a result of which they found themselves in their present predicament. Another Midrash quotes Yehudah as saying: just as Pharaoh violated the Egyptian law that a slave cannot be appointed ruler and he appointed you, so you too act illegally. Furthermore, Pharaoh had announced to the whole world that everybody was welcome to buy grain in Egypt, whereas his family had been discriminated against by having to bring his youngest brother all the way from the land of Canaan in order to buy grain for their starving family.</p>

The word אליו also does not seem necessary. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 93,6 explained that the word ויגש refers to Yehudah girding himself for war. This is a homiletical commentary. We are concerned with the plain meaning of the verse. Why did Yehudah say בי אדוני, &quot;please my lord&quot; at this point? If these words were intended to put Joseph into a more conciliatory frame of mind he should have said these words when he said ואל יחר לאדוני, &quot;let my lord not become angry.&quot; Furthermore, what need was there for the words &quot;in the ears of my lord?&quot; We also need to understand what Yehudah meant when he said: &quot;you are just like Pharaoh?&quot;</p>

              <p>Yehudah said: &quot;please my lord&quot; for three reasons. 1) He had to explain to Joseph why he alone kept speaking. This was especially so seeing Joseph had already demonstrated that he knew that Reuben was the oldest brother when he had seated the brothers according to their age (43,33). Joseph was liable to interrupt him at any moment demanding to know why Reuben was not acting as the spokesman. Yehudah therefore wanted to explain this before Joseph could become angry. He explained that Benjamin's detention concerned him most because of the guarantee he had given to his father. 2) He used a stratagem designed to free Benjamin by claiming that he himself had stolen the goblet but had hidden it in Benjamin's pouch, deflecting any suspicion from himself in the event that the goblet would be found. It was only proper then that he and not Benjamin should pay the penalty. Now the situation was that Benjamin denied being a thief whereas Yehudah confessed. 3) The word בי may be an allusion by the Torah to the present time when Joseph was the ruler; ultimately, however, authority would pass to Yehudah, i.e. the kingdom of David who was a descendant of Yehudah.</p>

The circle of advisers separates the petitioner from the king who presides on the throne. Up until this point Yehudah had stood outside the circle. The word ויגש indicates that at this point Yehudah moved forward to within the area separating the advisers from the king himself. He did so in order that the advisers should not be able to hear what he was about to tell Joseph.</p>

              <p>Yehudah entreated the ruler (Joseph) to speak with him privately; this is the meaning of the words: &quot;please my lord let your servant speak in the hearing of my lord.&quot; He also pleaded with Joseph not to become angry immediately; this is why he added: &quot;and let not my lord become angry.&quot; He implied that though it is customary for great men to become angry at each other, there is no cause for a highly placed person such as Joseph to waste his energy by becoming angry at a lowly servant such as himself. This was the reason Yehudah emphasised that he was Joseph's servant. The reason that Yehudah said: &quot;for you are just like Pharaoh&quot; is explained in A vodah Zarah 10 in a story involving a certain Ketiah bar Shalum. A certain Roman Emperor disliked the Jews and consulted his advisers what he should do about them. He asked whether if one has a painful fibroid in one's foot one should cut it off and be at ease or whether one should allow it to remain and suffer pain? The advice of all the other ministers was that the Emperor should have the fibroid removed. Ketiah- also one of the officers of the Emperor- said to him: &quot;first of all you cannot get rid of all the Jews, quoting a verse in Zachariah 2,10. Secondly, if you do this your empire will henceforth be known as one that kills its own subjects.&quot; The king replied that Ketiah's advice was sound but that there was a law which stipulated that anyone who obstructed the wishes of the emperor must be thrown into the furnace. He had Ketiah executed. As soon as Ketiah was burned to death a heavenly voice was heard proclaiming that Ketiah had acquired his life in the Hereafter in the time it had taken for him to suggest the Jews be saved. Yehudah was careful not to create a situation which would make his words boomerang on himself as had the words of Ketiah. This is why he wanted no one to hear what he had to say to Joseph.</p>

If Yehudah were to speak publicly, his advisers would pressure Joseph not to follow his heart's inclination so that ultimately he would not decide according to the will of heaven. By speaking in this way Yehudah indicated to Joseph that he considered him a fair ruler, and that his closest advisers were the ones who were in danger of committing a travesty of justice.</p>

              <p>מענה רך ישיב חמה, ודבר עצב יעלה כעס, “A gentle response turns away wrath; a harsh word causes anger.” (Proverbs 15,1) Solomon warns us in this verse to train ourselves to become mature enough to respond in measured tones even to extreme provocations. A softly worded reply is apt to reduce the wrath of someone who had expressed himself very angrily. On the other hand, provocative responses are apt to incite the party to whom they are addressed. It is a well known fact that the spoken word possesses the power to achieve either positive or negative results. Speech is to man what fruit is to a tree. If we were not able to verbalize our thoughts we would not be human anymore than a tree which does not bear fruit does truly perform the function for which trees have been created. [Compare Rashi on the earth failing to fully respond to G’d’s command to produce trees which had both edible trunks and edible fruit Genesis 1,12. Ed.] When the Torah wrote (Genesis 2,1) “man became a living creature,” it meant to inform us that the essential part of man was its נפש חיה, its life-force, i.e. its ability to communicate its thoughts by means of speech. This is why Onkelos translates this expression as לרוח ממללא, “a talking spirit.” We have examples of speech being considered as “a fruit, i.e. as a product “ in Isaiah 57,19: בורא ניב שפתים “who creates the fruit of the lips.” Speech is the product of one’s lips. If Isaiah attributed the fruit of the lips to something G’d had “created,” this is due to the fact that speech is derived, distilled, from the abstract power of the human brain. Man’s נפש life-force, is different from that of the animals which do not possess this power of speech. This advantage man possesses over the animals is expressed in Job 35,11 in these words: “who gives us more knowledge than the beasts of the earth, makes us wiser than the birds of the sky.” We also have a verse in Proverbs 18,21 making this point even more strongly. Solomon writes “death and life are within the power of the tongue.” This is a warning to those people who indulge in free use of their tongue to be very careful with each word they utter as their words may hold an awesome power which must not be abused. Such power is to be used to spread the knowledge of Torah, to further the performance of G’d’s commandments, etc.. It must not be used for anything contrary as then it becomes an instrument leading to someone’s death. Solomon tells us that if one uses most of one’s words in the right way this leads to man qualifying for Leviticus 19,24 “all its fruit shall be set aside for jubilation before the Lord.” People who are circumspect in the use of their tongue will qualify for a great deal of reward. If, perchance, they abuse this power of speech on a regular basis, they will be severely punished. It is precisely because the power of speech is so crucial to man that Solomon felt impelled to teach us something about the prudent use of this power. He taught us that a gentle response is apt to influence even the decisions of powerful kings and to assuage their feelings if they had been bruised, as we find in Proverbs 16,14 “the king’s wrath is a messenger of death.” Yehudah, who was very well aware of the potential of any words he might say, couched what he had to say in words which were apt to touch the heart of even the most obstinate ruler. Joseph’s relenting and revealing himself to the brothers was the direct result of the diplomatic use of his tongue by Yehudah. Had he accused Joseph of planting the goblet in Binyamin’s bag, something which was the truth, after all, he would not have achieved the desired result, i.e. to make Joseph reconsider his decree to keep Binyamin as a slave. Yehudah had three major objectives i.e. to assuage Joseph’s anger with words. 2) to demand his rights on a legal basis. 3) (as a last resort) to take Binyamin back by force. This is the meaning of the following verse:</p>

              <p>Having taken permission to speak by saying ידבר נא עבדך דבר באזני אדני, Yehudah came to the substance of the issue, i.e. the circumstances preceding Binyamin traveling to Egypt altogether. He used the tactic suggested by Solomon in being extremely gentle in any implied rebuke of Joseph’s part in this whole affair. He begins with the fact that Joseph had inquired about their family background in order to appeal to his feelings of mercy. At the same time he implied that Joseph had described himself as a G’d-fearing man in 42,18. He reminds Joseph אדוני שאל את עבדיו לאמור, “my lord asked your servants to say,” Yehudah reminded Joseph that he and his brothers had not volunteered speaking about their family status, etc. but had been forced to do so in answer to Joseph’s inquiries concerning their younger brother. Originally, they had not been willing to have Binyamin travel to Egypt at all and had only brought him there in response to Joseph’s ultimatum. By giving them this ultimatum Joseph had severely endangered their aged father’s peace of mind. Had it not been a matter of survival for them to come to Egypt and to buy grain, they would never have been able to persuade their father to agree that his youngest son Binyamin undertake a potentially dangerous journey. If Binyamin would now fail to return home his father would die an embittered man.</p>

              <p>והורידו עבדיך, “and your servants would bring down;” Yehudah used a third person pronoun, i.e. “they would bring down,” instead of saying “you would bring down.” He did not want to accuse Joseph outright of becoming the cause of their father’s premature death as an embittered man. By adding the words עבדיך, “your servants,” meaning himself, he suggested that by keeping him instead of Binyamin, Joseph would not only save their father’s life, but he would acquire a far better slave than Binyamin seeing that he, Yehudah, was superior to Binyamin in all aspects pertaining to performing the tasks allocated to slaves. Moreover, Joseph would thereby be spared the sin of failing to honour his guarantee that he would bring Binyamin back safely.</p>

              <p>ועתה ישב נא עבדך תחת הנער עבד לאדוני...כי איך אעלה אל אבי והנער אינני אתי?; “And now allow your servant to remain as a slave to my lord,...for how could I return to my father when the lad is not with Me? Yehudah made it plain that he would feel more at ease as a slave for the rest of his life than returning as a free man to his father minus Binyamin. A Midrashic approach based on Tanchuma Vayigash 3 to Yehudah’s speech. The words ויגש יהודה introduce a confrontation between the lion and the ox. Yehudah represents the lion (Gen. 49,9), Joseph the ox (Deut. 33,17). The words בי אדני are a plea not to apply the attribute of Justice when judging Binyamin as well as themselves. The words: “let me say a word in the hearing of my lord,” mean “may my words find a receptive ear.” He then proceeded to tell Joseph that Sarah, the great-grandmother of Binyamin had been kept against her will in the palace of a previous Pharaoh. (Genesis 12,17) As a result, both Pharaoh and his entire household had been so stricken by G’d that he immediately not only released her but pacified her husband with generous gifts. Joseph was to reflect what this G’d would to him if he tried to keep Binyamin as a slave. He added that Binyamin’s mother died prematurely due to a carelessly worded curse by her husband Binyamin’s father (Gen. 31,32). Imagine what would happen if his father were now to pronounce a deliberate curse upon Joseph for depriving him of his son! He asked Joseph to also reflect on the fact that two of their number had destroyed an entire city (Gen. 34,25). He could imagine what all of them could do if they set their mind on it. At that time the reason for their act of vengeance had been the rape of their sister. This time it involved freedom of a male, their brother. Seeing this male was destined to house the Sanctuary of the G’d of the heavens on earth (Deut. 33,12), they would move heaven and earth to ensure that that prophecy would be fulfilled. Yehudah added: ”for you are like Pharaoh.” He meant: “just as Pharaoh makes promises and does not keep them, so you too make promises and do not keep them.” You had said that you merely wanted to take a look at Binyamin to convince yourself that we had spoken truthfully (42,20). Just as Pharaoh is known to indulge his homosexual tastes, so you appear to want to keep Binyamin for similar reasons. Just as Pharaoh is the King and you are his number two, my father has the rank of king in his country and I am second in command. He added that if he were to draw his sword he would start by slaying Joseph and finish by slaying Pharaoh.</p>

              <p>ויגש אליו יהודה ויאמר בי אדוני, ידבר נא עבדך דבר באזני אדוני ואל יחר אפך בעבדך כי כמוכך כפרעה, “Yehudah approached him and said: “if you please my lord, may your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears and let not your anger flare up at your servant for you are equal to Pharaoh.” The expression הגשה, “approach” is found as having one of three meanings. דין, פיוס, מלחמה “judgment, reconciliation, or war.” (based on Bereshit Rabbah 93,4) “and they approach the court and they shall judge them.” It occurs as meaning reconciliation in Joshua 14,6: “the members of the tribe of Yehudah approached Joshua, etc.” Finally, it occurs as a prelude to war in Samuel II 10,13: “Yoav and the people with him marched into battle.” In this instance, Yehudah combined all these three meanings of the word when he “approached” Joseph. When he said בי אדני, this meant that he gave Joseph the chance to choose which of the three kinds of הגשה he wanted to make the basis of this meeting. He spoke like someone who is fully armed, ready for a military confrontation. He meant: “you may find in me a partner for discussion on any one of these three levels. If you want to be conciliatory, fine and good. If you want to debate the rights and wrongs of what has happened also well and good. If, however, you want to use your military power to enforce your decree I am willing to confront you also on that basis. Alternatively, the word בי here means: “(the guilt is all) mine.” He said this seeing that superficially it appeared that the entire guilt was that of Binyamin in whose sack the goblet had been found. He pleaded with Joseph not to treat Binyamin as the sole guilty party but to consider him, Yehudah, the guilty party instead. He asked Joseph to keep him as a slave in lieu of Binyamin and to treat him as if he had been the guilty party. He wanted Joseph to set Binyamin free. Throughout the entire story Yehudah focused on substituting for Binyamin. When he said the words ידבר נא עבדך דבר he meant that this “word” would be instead of any that Binyamin would have to say. Yehudah had no other purpose than to serve as the surrogate slave instead of his brother Binyamin.</p>

Yehudah then proceeded to explain that seeing he had guaranteed the safety of Binyamin it was logical that he should take it upon himself to pay any penalty Binyamin had incurred.</p>

              <p>כי כמוך כפרעה, the repeated use of the prefix כ is meant to draw a comparison between the two subjects mentioned. We find a parallel construction in Isaiah 24,2 כעבד כאדוניו, “like master like servant.” [that verse contains a string of these comparisons. Ed.] What Yehudah meant was “on the one hand you rule like Pharaoh, and Pharaoh is like you in many respects.” I am therefore as afraid to speak up in front of you as I would be afraid to speak up in front of Pharaoh. However, due to the extreme difficulty we are finding ourselves in I cannot remain silent. I can only ask that in all that I am going to say אל יחר אפך בעבדך, “do not become angry at your servant.” You have already accused us of crimes when we first came here, as distinct from other people who came to buy grain whom you did not subject to such treatment.”

Thus Yehudah said [in explanation]: “For you are equal to Pharaoh,” i.e., “You are as esteemed in my eyes as a king.” However, “For you are equal to Pharaoh” does not explain Yehudah’s statement of, “And do not be angry,” which he had previously made. On the contrary, since Yoseif was as esteemed as a king, this is a reason for Yehudah not to speak harshly to him, [so Yoseif’s anger would be justified]. </p>

Thus it explains, “Ultimately you will be stricken...” But there is a question on the Midrash: Why did it not say, “For you will be like Pharaoh”? Thus Rashi offers another explanation: “Just as Pharaoh issues decrees...” I.e., right now you are like Pharaoh. But there is a question regarding this explanation: Why did it not say אתה כפרעה? Thus, both explanations are needed. And there is a question regarding all the [above] explanations: Why did it not say כפרעה כמוך, since Yoseif was being compared to Pharaoh? Thus Rashi offers another explanation: “If you will provoke me...” Now, Pharaoh is compared to Yoseif as regards being killed. But this explanation is implausible on its own because how could Yehudah have said, “Do not be angry,” when he was threatening to kill him? That is why the above explanations are also needed.

              <p>Just as Pharaoh issues decrees without carrying them out... Meaning: Pharaoh wrote in his register that a slave may not rule nor may he wear silk garments, yet he did not carry it out because he made you a ruler though you were a slave. And “he makes promises without fulfilling them,” i.e., if he did not carry out his decree where there is no monetary loss, surely he will not carry out a promise where there is monetary loss. You, too, do the same. You promise and do not fulfill, for is this [the meaning of, “Set your eyes on him?”] “You, too, do the same” does not refer to issuing decrees without carrying them out, for nowhere do we see Yoseif issuing a decree and not carry it out. And nowhere do we see Pharaoh making a promise and not keep it. You might ask: What did Yehudah have against Pharaoh, that he so denigrated the king? The answer is: Yehudah was saying to Yoseif, “On what do you rely? Do you place your trust in Pharaoh [to protect you from our retribution]? Pharaoh himself issues decrees but does not carry them out, as he wrote in Egypt’s laws that a slave may not be a ruler yet he did not carry it out.” (Maharshal)</p>

Naga‘, in the first sense, viz., expressing the contact of two bodies, occurs in “And she cast it (va-tagga‘) at his feet” (Exod. 4:25); “He caused it to touch (va-yagga‘) my mouth” (Isa. 6:7).

              <p>[2] Another interpretation: &quot;Far be it, don't think that way.&quot; The Almighty does not keep silent about acts of heroism and grace (Job 41:4). The Holy One, blessed be He, said that people should not say, 'We too can speak with God just as Abraham did.' God said to Abraham (whose name was read as 'to him') 'I keep silent only for you, because you have kept silent for Me. And when did Abraham keep silent? It was when I told him, &quot;Through Isaac shall your seed be called&quot; (Genesis 21:12), and then I said to him, &quot;Take him up as an offering&quot; (Genesis 22:2), and he kept silent, as it is said, &quot;But as for me, I am like the deaf, I do not hear&quot; (Psalms 38:14). So I too keep silent for him, 'I keep silent only for you.' Even though he spoke harshly to Me and spoke of acts of heroism and grace, I still consider him pleasing. But what acts of heroism did he speak of? It was when he approached Me (Genesis 18:23-33). Rabbi Judah says, the term 'he approached' (vayigash) can only mean a warlike approach, as it is said, 'And Joab approached, and the people that were with him, for the battle' (2 Samuel 10:13). And Rabbi Nehemiah says, it can only mean a request, as it is said, 'Then Judah approached him' (Genesis 44:18). And the Sages say, it can only mean prayer, as it is said, 'And when the meal offering was presented, he approached and completed' (1 Chronicles 23:30). God said to him, 'No, no, may it never be that they should say, &quot;This is God's way, to subject His creatures to cruelty.&quot; In the generation of the Flood, and in the generation of the Dispersion, I did not restrain My wrath, but with you, may it never be.'&quot; God said to him, &quot;What do you decree? Come and I will show you all the generations that I have lost, and I will show you that I did not collect from them according to their sins, but rather less than deserved. And if you think that I have acted unfairly, teach me and I will act fairly from now on, as it is said, 'Without you seeing me, I will see what I have done. If I have done wrong, I will no longer do so' (Job 34:32). Without you seeing me, I will see what I have done without you, and I will see,&quot; they said. &quot;From now on, if I have done wrong, I will not do so anymore.&quot; Abraham said to him, &quot;You do not pass judgment on a creature, as it is said, 'Therefore, you men of understanding, hear me: Far be it from God to do wickedness, and from the Almighty to do wrong. For according to the work of a man he will repay him' (Job 34:10-11). Therefore, God forbid.&quot;</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Chapter (75) 76: Torah  [1] &quot;Then Judah approached him&quot; (Genesis 44:18). And scriptures say this: &quot;Have we not all one Father? [Did not one God create us? Why do we break faith with one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?]&quot; (Malachi 2:10). &quot;We, your twelve servants, are brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan&quot; (Genesis 42:13). Not like the tents of the measure of mercy, nor like the Egyptians who bow down to every kind of idolatry, as it was said in the tribes of Egypt, &quot;and do not defile yourselves [with the fetishes of Egypt]&quot; (Ezekiel 20:7). But we trust in only one God who created us, as it is said, &quot;Did not one God create us?&quot; (Malachi 2:10). So why would one betray his brother? As it is said, &quot;Why should you betray us, by secretly keeping the money you found in our sacks?&quot; (Genesis 44:8). And you accuse us of theft, as it is said, &quot;The man who found the cup&quot; (Genesis 44:17). We violate the covenant that the Lord made with our forefathers, and not only that, but the laws that we have made among ourselves. As it is said, &quot;If you are honest, leave one of your brothers here in prison&quot; (Genesis 42:19). And you said, &quot;Bring your youngest brother&quot; (Genesis 44:23). Our father did not ask for it, yet we complied with his request, as it is said, &quot;If I don't bring him back to you, I'll be guilty forever&quot; (Genesis 43:9). And you say, &quot;The man who found the cup&quot; (Genesis 44:17). So where is the covenant that the Lord gave us in His Torah, saying, &quot;Do not oppress one another&quot; (Leviticus 25:17), and &quot;You shall not work your brother like a slave&quot; (Leviticus 25:39)? Why then would one betray his brother? (Malachi 2:10).</p>

                <h4>Bamidbar Rabbah 13:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>“The one who presented…” (Numbers 7:12), that is what is written: “A man’s pride will humble him, and the lowly spirit will attain honor” (Proverbs 29:23). Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba said: “A man's pride will humble him,” this is Adam the first man. How so? When he violated the command of the Holy One blessed be He and ate from the tree, the Holy One blessed be He sought to have him repent, and He provided him with an opening. Adam did not seek to do so. That is what is written: “The Lord God said: Behold, the man [has become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now, lest] [pen]…” (Genesis 3:22). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: What is “and now”? It is, rather, that the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Even now, repent and I will accept you.’ Adam said: ‘I do not wish to do so.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: “And now,” and Adam said: ‘pen, I do not wish to do so.’ Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: When Adam emerged from judgment, he began cursing and blaspheming. “Cherubs” is stated here: “He stationed the cherubs east of the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 3:24), and “cherubs” is stated by Sennacherib: “Lord of hosts, God of  Israel, who abides over the cherubs” (Isaiah 37:16). Just as there, cursing and blaspheming, (By Sennacherib (see Isaiah 37:17).)  so, too, here, cursing and blaspheming. That is, “a man’s pride will humble him.” Because he was too haughty vis-à-vis the Holy One blessed be He to repent, He humbled him and banished him from the Garden of Eden. “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Abraham, who lowered his spirit and said: “I am dust and ashes” (Genesis 18:27). That is why the Holy One blessed be He called him: “The man greatest among the giants” (Joshua 14:15) (See the Alshikh on the verse.) ; this characterization means greater than Adam the first man.  Another matter, “a man's pride will humble him,” this is Pharaoh, who was haughty vis-à-vis Moses and said: “Who is the Lord that I will heed His voice…?” (Exodus 5:2). The Holy One blessed be He humbled him: “He hurled Pharaoh and his army [into the Red Sea]” (Psalms 136:15). “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Moses; “For when shall I entreat on your behalf…?” (Exodus 8:5), and it says: “Upon my leaving the city, I will spread my hands [to the Lord]” (Exodus 9:29). (In both of these verses, Moses tells Pharaoh that ending the plague does not depend on him; rather, he will pray to the Holy One blessed be He to end the plague in question.)   Another matter, “a man’s pride,” this is Amalek, who was haughty vis-à-vis the Holy One blessed be He, with his curses and blasphemies, as he would send the foul smell to His nose, (This is a phrase from Ezekiel 8:17; it refers to something done with the intent of insulting God.)  and he would take the male organ of Israel and cast it upward, cursing and blaspheming, saying: ‘Is this what You wanted?’ That is what is written: “And attacked you from behind [vayzanev]” (Deuteronomy 25:18); they struck them a strike on the tail [zanav]. (This is a euphemism for their male organs.)  “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Joshua, who killed him, as it is stated: “Joshua weakened Amalek and his people…” (Exodus 17:13).  Another matter, “a man’s pride will humble him,” this is Tavor and Carmel, that came from the ends of the earth, (Tavor and Carmel are mountains. See Bereshit Rabba 99:1.)  haughtily saying: ‘We are high, and upon us, the Holy One blessed be He is giving the Torah.’ “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Sinai, that humbled itself, saying: ‘I am low.’ As a result, the Holy One blessed be He rested His glory upon it. The Torah was given upon it, and it merited all this honor, just as it says: “The Lord descended upon Mount Sinai” (Exodus 19:20).  Another matter, “a man's pride will humble him,” this is Joseph, who conducted himself with superiority, as his brothers would say before him: “Your servant, our father” (Genesis 43:28), and he would keep silent. That is why he is called “bones” during his lifetime, as it is stated: “And you shall carry up my bones from here” (Genesis 50:25). “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Judah, who humbled himself before Joseph on behalf of Benjamin: “May your servant speak a matter?” (Genesis 44:18); “for your servant took responsibility for the lad” (Genesis 44:32); “now, please, your servant will remain…” (Genesis 44:33). Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen bar Rabbi said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Judah, you humbled yourself before your brother who is younger than you; as you live, when the Tabernacle will be erected and the tribes will come to present an offering, not one of them will present an offering before you, but rather they will accord you deference, and it is you who will present an offering first.’ That is what is written: “The one who presented his offering on the first day…of the tribe of Judah…”</p>

              <p>“They sat to eat bread, and they lifted their eyes and saw, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilad, and their camels were bearing spices, and balm, and ladanum, going to take them down to Egypt” (Genesis 37:25).  “They sat to eat bread” – Rabbi Aḥva bar Ze’eira said: The transgression of the tribes is remembered forever; it gave hope to the world. “They sat to eat bread” – he gave everyone in the world bread to eat. (The sale of Joseph led to his appointment to viceroy in Egypt and to his role as dispenser of food during the famine.)   “And they lifted their eyes and saw…” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: But is it not typical of the Ishmaelites to bear only hides and tar? Rather, see what the Holy One blessed be He prepared for that righteous one at that moment: Sacks filled with spices, so that the wind would blow through them [and provide a pleasant smell] to counteract the odor of the Arabs. (Because the Ishmaelites generally transported foul-smelling substances, they and their equipment had an unpleasant odor. God arranged for the caravan carrying Joseph to Egypt to have pleasant-smelling spices in order to mask the foul, unpleasant odor. )  “Judah said to his brothers: What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood” (Genesis 37:26).  “Judah said to his brothers…” – Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai said: The verse is speaking in praise of Judah. In three places, Judah spoke before his brothers and they crowned him king over them. (They accepted his advice or his leadership. )  “Judah said to his brothers”; “Judah and his brothers came [.…And Judah said]” (Genesis 44:14); (This was after Benjamin was caught with Joseph’s goblet; Judah led the brothers in their return to Joseph and spoke as their representative.)  “Judah approached him [and said]” (Genesis 44:18). (This was after Joseph informed them that Benjamin would be his slave. Judah again spoke on behalf of the brothers, argued for Benjamin’s release, and offered to take Benjamin’s place as a slave. )  “Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let our hand not be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh. His brothers heeded him” (Genesis 37:27).  “Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites” – they said: Let us adopt the way of the world. Canaan, who sinned, (Canaan reported Noah’s nakedness to Noah’s sons (see Bereshit Rabba 36:7). )  was he not cursed to be a slave? This one, too, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites. (Joseph had slandered his brothers (Genesis 37:2; see above, section 7). Therefore, they considered him worthy of a similar fate to that of Canaan. )  “His brothers heeded him.”</p>

It is betrothal by rabbinic law, and she has the right to refuse to remain in this relationship when she reaches age twelve. Rabbi Ḥanina said that one should not counsel the girl to refuse to remain.)  and from serving as a guarantor between one person and another. Adhere to ḥalitza, (If a married man dies without children, it is a mitzva for the man’s brother to marry his widow in a levirate marriage. If he refuses, the widow performs ḥalitza, in order to dissolve the levirate bond.)  to nullification of vows, and to introducing peace between one person and another. Rabbi Berekhya said that Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said: Its name is not a deposit [pikadon], but rather, puk don – take this out. (Do not allow a deposit into your house. )   Another matter, “my son, if you became a guarantor for your friend” – this is Judah, [as it states]: “I will guarantee him” (Genesis 43:9). “If you have shaken your hands for a stranger” (By which you are agreeing to become a guarantor.)  (Proverbs 6:1) – “from my hand you can demand him” (Genesis 43:9). (The midrash relates Judah’s acceptance of responsibility for Benjamin, “from my hand you can demand him,” to the statement in the verse in Proverbs about shaking hands when becoming a guarantor. )  “You have been snared by the sayings of your mouth” – “if I do not bring him to you” (Genesis 43:9). “Do this, then, my son, and be delivered” (Proverbs 6:3) – go and cleave to the dust of his feet and accept his kingdom and lordship – “Judah approached him.” (According to this, Judah approached Joseph in order to kiss his feet and accept his kingship (Etz Yosef). ) </p>

Someone came and tied rope to rope, thread to thread, and cord to cord, and he drew from it and drank. Everyone began drawing from it and drinking.

(The “rope” that drew Jacob to Egypt was a man, namely Joseph. )  “The mountains will drip nectar” (Joel 4:18) (The Sages often view mountains as metaphors for the righteous.

              <p>Another matter, “Judah approached [vayigash] him” – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis. Rabbi Yehuda says: An approach for war, just as it says: “Yoav and the people who were with him advanced [vayigash] to the battle” (II Samuel 10:13). Rabbi Neḥemya says: An approach for conciliation, just as it says: “The children of Judah approached Joshua” (Joshua 14:6) – to placate him. (Members of the tribe of Judah sought to placate Joshua so that he would grant Caleb’s request.)  The Rabbis say: An approach for prayer – “Elijah the prophet approached, and he said: Lord, God of …” (I Kings 18:36). Rabbi Elazar resolved it in accordance with all of them: If [I must engage in] war, I am coming; if [I must engage in] conciliation, I am coming, if [I must engage in] prayer, I am coming.  “Please my lord [bi adoni]” (Genesis 44:18) – [take] me [bi] and not him [bei] – whether it is to fill water, it is I; for service, it is I; to split logs, it is I. (Judah was telling Joseph that he would be a better servant than Benjamin, and therefore Joseph should take him and not Benjamin. )   Another matter, “Please my lord [bi adoni]” – injustice [baya] you are bringing upon us, my lord, as so you said to us: “Bring him down to me, [and I will set my eye upon him]” (Genesis 44:21); is this the setting of an eye? It is the opposite of what you said: It is blindness of the eye. (You obscured the truth from us.)   Rabbi Simon said: (This statement is an explanation of Judah’s argument that Joseph was acting unjustly in demanding that Benjamin become his slave. )  It is written in our law books: “If he has nothing, he shall be sold for his theft” (Exodus 22:2), but this one has the means to pay.  “May your servant please speak [a word in my lord's ears]” – may my words enter your ears. This one’s grandmother, because Pharaoh abducted her for one night, he and his household were stricken with leprosy, as it is written: “The Lord afflicted Pharaoh [and his household with great afflictions over the matter of Sarai, Abram’s wife]” (Genesis 12:17), take care that this person (A reference to Joseph himself.)  will not be stricken with leprosy. The mother of this one died only due to our father’s curse. You cite it from here: “With whomever you find your gods, he shall not live” (Genesis 31:32); (The midrash understands that due to this statement, uttered by Jacob, Rachel died. )  take care that a curse will not take effect upon you and that man (A reference to Joseph himself.)  will die. Two of us entered a certain city and destroyed it in its entirety. There it was on behalf of a female, here it is on behalf of a male. (Judah suspected that Joseph intended to sexually abuse Benjamin, and considered homosexual abuse to be worse than Shekhem’s abuse of Dina, or Pharoah’s intent to abuse Sarah (Etz Yosef). )  For coming against the apple of [Jacob’s] eye, against the host of the Holy One blessed be He, in whose regard it is stated: “He hovers over him all the day” (Deuteronomy 33:12), (The Sages viewed this verse as an allusion to the fact that the Temple was located in the territory of Benjamin (see Yoma 12a). )  all the more so.  Another matter, “may your servant please speak [yedaber na]…” – Rabbi Yirmeya bar Shemaya said: I will remove something [davar] from within and introduce pestilence [dever] into No, (Another name for Egypt, or the capital city of the Egyptian empire. )  and exterminate you.  Rabbi Ḥanin said: When Judah was filled with rage, the hairs over his heart would rip through his garments and emerge, and he would place chunks of iron in his mouth and expel them as dust.  “As you are like Pharaoh” – just as Pharaoh decrees and does not fulfill, so, too, you decree and do not fulfill. Just as Pharaoh lusts after males, so, too, do you. Just as Pharaoh is king and you are second to him in the land of Egypt, so, too, my father is king in the land of Canaan and I am second to him. If I draw my sword, I will begin with you and conclude with Pharaoh your master. Had he said: ‘I will begin with Pharaoh,’ [Joseph] would have left him alone. Since he said: ‘I will begin with you,’ [Joseph] signaled to Manasseh, who stamped one foot and the entire palace quaked. [Judah] said: ‘This is a stamp from Father’s household.’ (No one but members of Jacob’s family were so powerful. )  When he saw that matters were thus, (When Judah saw he would not be able to overpower Manasseh (Etz Yosef). )  he began speaking gentle words – “my lord asked” (Genesis 44:19).</p>

Corresponding to whom did Solomon say this verse? He said it only corresponding to Joseph the righteous. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When Joseph the righteous seized Benjamin and said to his brothers: “The man in whose hand the goblet was found, he shall be my slave [and you, go up in peace to your father]” (Genesis 44:17), Judah said to him: ‘Benjamin, you are seized; can there be peace in Father’s household?’ Immediately, Judah grew angry and roared in a loud voice. His voice traveled four hundred parsangs, until Ḥushim son of Dan heard and leapt from the land of Canaan and came to Judah. Both of them roared and the land of Egypt was on the verge of being upended. In their regard Job said: “The roar of the lion and the voice of the great cat” (Job 4:10). “The roar of the lion” – this is Judah, in whose regard it is written: “Judah is a lion cub” (Genesis 49:9). “And the voice of the great cat” – this is Ḥushim son of Dan, as both of them were likened to a lion, as it is stated: “To Dan he said: Dan is a lion cub” (Deuteronomy 33:22). “The teeth of the young lions are broken” (Job 4:10) – these are Joseph’s warriors. When Judah grew angry, the teeth of all of them fell out.  Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When [the brothers] saw that Judah grew angry, they too, were filled with anger. They kicked the ground and caused it to be full of furrows, as it is stated: “The lion perishes for lack of prey” (Job 4:11) – this is Judah, who risked his life on Benjamin’s behalf. He said: ‘Perhaps, the Holy One blessed be He will forgive me for that iniquity of misleading my father and saying: I will bring him to you.’ (Judah had guaranteed to return Benjamin, who was now being seized by Joseph. Judah was willing to risk his life in order to attempt to fulfill that guarantee, thinking that even if he was unsuccessful, perhaps he would at least not be held accountable for the sin of failing to fulfill his guarantee (Etz Yosef). Alternatively, it had been Judah who had misled Jacob about Joseph’s disappearance and caused him to think that Joseph was dead (Maharzu). )  At that moment he became filled with rage at Joseph. When Joseph saw the signs of Judah’s [rage], he was immediately shaken and alarmed. He said: ‘Woe is me, perhaps he will kill me.’   What were the signs [of rage] upon Judah? Those of the house of Shilo said: Blood flowed from his two eyes. Some say: He would wear five garments that were like warriors’ armor. When he would grow angry, there was one hair over his heart that would rip through them all. What did Joseph do at that moment? That stone pillar upon which he was seated, he kicked it and rendered it a heap of pebbles. At this Judah was astonished and said: ‘This one is mightier than I am.’ At that moment, Judah grasped his sword and sought to draw it from its scabbard, but it would not be drawn for him. Judah said: ‘This one must be a God-fearing man; that is why it is stated: “Wisdom will fortify the wise”’ (Ecclesiastes 7:19). (The midrash understands the term wisdom in this verse as a reference to fear of God, as in Job 28:28. ) </p>

First, the actual speaker of the words “…the Lord has found out the sin of your servants…” is Yehuda himself, although in the midrash, the words are attributed to all the brothers (lines 53–54). Putting Yehuda’s words in the mouths of all the brothers is another mechanism enabling the midrash to claim that all the brothers, and not only Yehuda, experience feelings of unacknowledged guilt after selling Yosef. In doing so, the midrash is not radically altering the plain sense of Genesis 44 since, from Genesis 43:15, until Genesis 44:18, when Yehuda alone speaks, the brothers are shown acting and speaking as a unit.</p>

And where did the generations (i.e., the sages) find support that they should fast on Monday and Thursday? &lt; It is &gt; simply &lt; that &gt;, when Israel committed that act (i.e., of the golden calf), Moses went up &lt; onto the mountain &gt; on a Thursday and came down on a Monday.

And from Sabbath eve through &lt; the following &gt; Sabbath eve to the Sabbath eve &lt; after that &gt; there are fifteen &lt; days &gt;, for a total of thirty. Also from Sabbath to Sabbath there are eight &lt; days &gt;, for a total of thirty-eight. Then a Sunday and a Monday make forty &lt; days &gt; (The time Moses spent on Mount Sinai before he descended to discover Israel worshiping the golden calf. So Exod. 34:28; Deut. 9:9-11.)  Therefore, the sages have ruled that one should fast on Monday and on Thursday, on &lt; the day of &gt; Moses' ascent and on &lt; that of &gt; his descent. Now at the end of forty days they fasted and wept before Moses, so that the Holy One was filled with mercy for them and appointed that day for them as a day of atoning for their sins. And this was the Day of Atonement, as stated (in Lev. 16:30): FOR ON THIS DAY ATONEMENT SHALL BE MADE FOR YOU TO CLEANSE YOU. See how lovely repentance (rt.: ShVB) is! The Holy One said (in Mal. 3:7): RETURN (rt.: ShVB) UNTO ME AND I WILL RETURN (rt.: ShVB) UNTO YOU. For, if there are some sins on one's hand and that person returns to the Holy One, he credits him as if he had not sinned. Thus it is stated (in Ezek. 18:22): &lt; NOT &gt; ANY OF HIS SINS WHICH HE COMMITTED &lt; SHALL BE REMEMBERED AGAINST HIM &gt;…. But, when the Holy One has warned him a first time, and a second and a third, without him repenting, he exacts punishment from him, as stated (in Job 33:29): BEHOLD, GOD DOES ALL THESE THINGS &lt; TWO OR THREE TIMES TO A PERSON &gt;…. When he does not find pleasure in &lt; such a &gt; one, he immediately exacts punishment from him. You yourself know that it is so. When the Holy One desired to destroy Sodom and its people, Abraham stood and sought mercy for them. He thought that there might be hope for them, as stated (in Gen. 18:23): THEN ABRAHAM DREW NEAR AND SAID: &lt; WILL YOU ALSO DESTROY THE RIGHTEOUS WITH THE WICKED &gt; ? What is the meaning of DREW NEAR? (Cf. Gen. R. 93:6.)  R. Joshua says: DREW NEAR is nothing but an expression relating to battle, as when it is stated (in II Sam. 10:13): SO JOAB AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH HIM DREW NEAR TO THE BATTLE. R. Nehemiah says: It is nothing but an expression relating to prayer, as when it is stated (in I Kings 18:36): AND IT CAME TO PASS WHEN IT WAS TIME TO PRESENT THE MEAL OFFERING, THE PROPHET ELIJAH DREW NEAR…. But the sages say: DREW NEAR is nothing but an expression of entreaty, as when it is stated (in Gen. 44:18): THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM AND SAID: &lt; PRAY, MY LORD, PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK &gt;…. Abraham said to the Holy One (in Gen. 18:25): FAR BE IT FROM YOU &lt; TO DO SUCH A THING &gt;…. And he sought mercy for them until (in vss. 26-33) &lt; his request &gt; went down from fifty to ten. When he found no merit for them, the Divine Presence departed from him, as stated (in vs. 33): THEN THE LORD WENT AWAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED…. Immediately the retribution came upon them. {Thus it is stated} [Where is it shown? From what we read on the matter] (in Gen. 19:24): THEN THE LORD RAINED DOWN UPON SODOM &lt; AND UPON GOMORRAH BRIMSTONE AND FIRE &gt;.</p>

              <p>(Gen. 44:18:) THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM…. This text is related (to Eccl. 9:14-15): THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT; &lt; AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT, BESIEGED IT, AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT &gt;. NOW THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A [POOR WISE] PERSON {WHO WAS POOR AND WISE}, &lt; WHO MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED THE CITY BY HIS WISDOM; BUT NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT POOR PERSON &gt;. What does it mean? (Eccl. R. 9:14/15:8; Ned. 32b; above, 11:1.)  This verse is stated about all generations. THERE WAS A LITTLE CITY, i.e., the body; WITH FEW PEOPLE IN IT, i.e., the two hundred and forty-eight members [which are in a person]; AND A GREAT KING CAME AGAINST IT, i.e., the evil drive, which is bigger than the good drive, &lt; i.e., older &gt; by thirteen years and one day. Now the evil drive says: Let us eat, drink, and fulfill all our desires; but the good drive says: Let us not eat and drink, but be occupied with Torah. Then we heed the evil drive. Why? Because it is bigger than all of them. (Eccl. 9:14, cont.:) AND BUILT GREAT SIEGE WORKS AGAINST IT, i.e., sins and transgressions. (Eccl. 9:15:) NOW THERE WAS FOUND IN IT A PERSON WHO WAS POOR AND WISE, i.e., the good drive; WHO MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED THE CITY BY HIS WISDOM; (Cf. Ned. 32b, which adds here, “I.e., repentance and good deeds.”)  BUT NO ONE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT POOR PERSON, for no one heeds the good drive, because it is insignificant. So, whoever heeds the good drive is blessed, as stated (in Ps. 41:2 [1]): BLESSED IS THE ONE WHO PAYS HEED TO A POOR PERSON…. (See Lev. R. 34:1.) </p>

THE COUNSEL IN ONE'S HEART IS DEEP WATER: This refers to Joseph. (Gen. R. 93:4.)  However wise Joseph was, Judah came and vanquished him, as stated (in Gen. 44:18): THEN JUDAH PRESSED AGAINST HIM. (This translation is possible in an unpointed text and fits the sense of the midrash. The traditional pointing has the meaning, DREW NEAR UNTO HIM. For another possibility, see below, 11:8.)  To what is the matter comparable? To a cistern which was so deep that no one was able to go down in it. There came one who was astute &lt; enough &gt; to bring a long rope. So he reached his water and drew &lt; some &gt; out of it. Thus Joseph was deep, but Judah came and drew out of him.</p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM. This text is related (to Job 41:8 [16]): ONE IS SO NEAR TO THE OTHER THAT NO AIR CAN COME BETWEEN THEM. This refers to Judah and Joseph, for in whatever Joseph prided himself, Judah came and vanquished, as stated (in Gen. 45:1): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF. To what were they comparable? (Tanh., Gen. 11:3.)  To a bull that went out; and, when all the beasts fled from him, he kicked (rt.: B'T) at one and gored at another. Then came the lion, but he did not stand up to him. Rather, when the lion appeared and sought out the bull, he was not to be found. So Joseph is likened to the bull, as stated (in Deut. 33:17): LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY. The tribes also have been likened to beasts, and Joseph was priding himself as being over them and despising (rt.: B'T) them. (According to Gen. 42:7) HE BECAME A STRANGER TO THEM. Then goring at a particular one, (according to Gen. 42:24) HE TOOK SIMON FROM THEM. He acted so only until the lion came, &lt; for &gt; (according to Gen. 49:24) JUDAH IS A LION'S WHELP. He sought him out as the bull, but he was not to be found. Rather (according to Gen. 45:1): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF. Why? (Prov. 30:30:) THE LION IS THE MIGHTIEST AMONG THE BEASTS, AND RETREATS BEFORE NONE, even because it is written of him (in Gen. 47:12): AND &lt; JOSEPH &gt; SUSTAINED &lt; HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS &gt;. (One would expect some saying about Judah. Buber’s note here suggests that SUSTAINED be read as two words, apart from the biblical context, and interpreted as “All in all,” i.e., the lion is “all in all” in the world of beasts. Cf. Tanh., Gen. 11:3: “Who has stood facing a bull? The lion, as stated (Gen. 44:18): THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM.”)  Also in the world to come a fighting Messiah is going to arise from Joseph, but a Messiah who is to arise from Judah will be stronger than he, as stated (in Zech. 10:6): I WILL STRENGTHEN THE HOUSE OF JUDAH, &lt; BUT THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH I WILL SAVE &gt;.</p>

YOU ARE ENSNARED IN THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH…. DO THIS, THEN, MY SON, AND SAVE YOURSELF, &lt; FOR YOU HAVE COME INTO THE POWER OF YOUR NEIGHBOR. GO HUMBLE YOURSELF, AND URGE YOUR NEIGHBOR &gt;. Joseph said to &lt; Judah &gt;: Why are you multiplying words? I see that people older than you are standing here without speaking. And is not Reuben older than you? Is not Simeon also older than you? Yet none of them are speaking. But in your case, why are you multiplying words? &lt; Judah &gt; said to him: Of all these people, not one of them is anxious about &lt; Benjamin &gt; except me alone because I stood surety &lt; for him &gt;, as stated (in Gen. 43:9): I MYSELF WILL BE SURETY FOR HIM. Now I said this to my father, that, if I do not bring him to you and set him before you, I am sinning before you in two worlds, in this world and in the world to come, as stated (in Gen. 44:32): I AM GUILTY BEFORE MY FATHER FOREVER.

Ergo: You are bringing injustice upon us. He said to him: You are judging neither by the royal law nor by divine law. Under divine law one who is found stealing pays twofold, as stated (in Exod. 22:6 [7]): IF THE THIEF IS FOUND HE SHALL PAY DOUBLE. If he does not have the wherewithal to pay, he shall be sold for his theft. Under royal law one takes everything he has. If you are seizing us under royal law, take for yourself whatever we have on hand; but, if under divine law, if we cannot pay his price, here we are for you as slaves.

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): When Judah saw that Joseph was not appeased, he began saying to his brothers: [Why] are we standing around? We will begin with this one and wind up with Pharaoh! Now they did not know that Joseph understood their language, as stated (in Gen. 42:23): NOW THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT JOSEPH UNDERSTOOD. When Joseph saw that, he began to talk to them with supplications and with gentle language. He said to them: About this Benjamin, I want only to know who &lt; it was that &gt; advised him to steal the goblet. Did you perhaps advise him to steal the goblet? When Benjamin heard that, he said: They did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. He said to them: Swear to me. He began to swear to him. By what did he swear to him? By the separation of my brother Joseph from me, (This clause may also be translated as follows: “By the scriptural section on the separation of my brother Joseph from me (in Gen. 37:18-36).”)  I did not touch it. Now &lt; I swear &gt; neither by the launching of arrows which were sent against him, as stated (in Gen. 49:23): ARCHERS HAVE HATED HIM (Joseph); nor by the stripping with which they stripped him, as stated (in Gen. 37:23): THEY STRIPPED JOSEPH OF HIS TUNIC; nor by the throwing with which they threw him into the cistern, as stated (in Gen. 37:24): AND THEY CAST HIM INTO THE PIT; nor by the selling with which they sold him to the Ishmaelites (in vs. 28); nor by the dipping with which they dipped his tunic in the blood (in vs. 31). &lt; By none of these do I swear &gt; that they did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. Joseph said: Who will make known to me that you are swearing truthfully about your brothers? He said to him: You can know how much I love him from the names of my sons, since I set names for them on the basis of what I feared for &lt; each one &gt;. (Sot. 36b (bar); Gen. R. 93:7; Tanh., Gen. 11:40.)  He said to him: And what were the names of your sons? He said to him (in agreement with Gen. 46:21): BELA, BECHER, ASHBEL, GERA, NAAMAN, EHI, ROSH, MUPPIM, HUPPIM, AND ARD. He said to him: Why Bela (BL')? He said to him: Because my brother was swallowed up (rt.: BL') from me. Becher (BKR)? Because he was my mother's first-born (rt.: BKR). Ashbel ('ShBL)? Because my brother was captured (NShBH). Gera? Because my brother was a sojourner (ger) with &lt; merely &gt; the privileges of a transient. (Gk.: xenia, i.e., “rights of a foreigner” or “guest privileges.”)  Naaman (N'M)? Because his words were pleasing (N'M). Ehi ('HY)? Because he was my brother ('HY) from &lt; the same &gt; mother, and I had none but him. Rosh (which means &quot;head&quot;)? Because he was older than I. Muppim (MPYM)? Because he learned Torah from our father's mouth (MPY) and taught it to me. When all his brothers would return to shepherding, he would sit with my father and learn the traditions which he had received from Shem and Eber. Huppim (rt.: HPP)? Because he has been covered over (rt.: HPP) until this day. Another interpretation of Huppim: Because I did not see his wedding canopy (huppah) nor did he see my wedding canopy. Another interpretation of Huppim (rt.: HPP): Because until now I have been mourning over him and going barefoot (rt.: YHP). And Ard ('RD)? Because he brought (rt.: YRD) all of us down here. Another interpretation of ARD (from Gen. 37:35): NO, I WILL GO DOWN ('RD) MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL. Will you please not bring down ('RD) Daddy to Sheol through grief! And so Judah said (in Gen. 44:34): FOR HOW SHALL I GO UP UNTO MY FATHER &lt; IF THE LAD IS NOT WITH ME &gt;? When Joseph heard that, he was not able to suppress his compassion, as stated (in Gen. 45:1-3): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF…. AND HE WEPT ALOUD…. THEN JOSEPH SAID UNTO HIS BROTHERS: I AM JOSEPH. When he said to them: I AM {YOUR BROTHER JOSEPH} … (in vs. 3, cont.): HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE DISMAYED BECAUSE OF HIM. R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon said in the name of R. Eleazar ben Azariah: (Gen. R. 93:11.)  Now, if in the case of Joseph, when he said to his brothers: I am Joseph, they knew what they had done with him and were unable to answer him; how much the less will a creature be able to stand when the Holy One comes to dispute with each and every one of &lt; his &gt; creatures and to tell him his deeds, just as it is written (in Amos 4:13): FOR BEHOLD, THE ONE WHO FORMS THE MOUNTAINS, &lt; CREATES THE WIND, AND TELLS ONE WHAT HIS THOUGHT IS &gt; … !</p>

              <p>(Gen. 44:18:) AND &lt; JUDAH &gt; SAID: PRAY, MY LORD…. FOR YOUR SERVANT HAS BECOME SURETY FOR THE LAD. When did Judah discharge his surety? In the days of Goliath. At that time, when Israel was in trouble, what is written (in I Sam. 17:16)? THEN THE PHILISTINE DREW NEAR AT DAWN AND IN THE EVENING. &lt; He was &gt; cursing and reviling. Saul began sending out a herald &lt; to proclaim &gt; (as implied in I Sam. 17:25): AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR THE MAN WHO KILLS HIM THAT THE KING SHALL ENRICH HIM &lt; WITH GREAT RICHES &gt;…. Now you find that anyone who curses is liable for death, as stated (in Lev. 24:16): AND THE ONE WHO BLASPHEMES THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH … but that wicked man had been cursing (according to I Sam. 17:16): FOR FORTY DAYS. Moses said (in Deut. 7:10): AND &lt; GOD &gt; INSTANTLY REPAYS THOSE WHO HATE HIM WITH DESTRUCTION. In the case of someone wicked who performs a righteous act, the Holy One renders it unfit &lt; by giving him his reward &gt; during his life in this world in order to destroy him in the world to come; but for the righteous, he sets aside their righteous acts for the world to come. (M. Pss.94:4.)  What &lt; righteous act &gt; did this wicked man (i.e., Goliath) do for him to curse for forty days? R. Isaac and R. Levi differ. (Ruth R. 2:20.)  R. Levi said: Because his mother, Orpah ('RPH), walked four miles (Lat.: mille.)  with her mother-in-law (cf. Ruth 1:7, 14), [the Holy One repaid her for it]. So from her the Holy One raised four heroes. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 21:22): THESE FOUR WERE BORN TO THE GIANT (HRPH) OF GATH. (According to vss. 15-20, the four heroes were Ishbi-benob, Saph, Goliath, and a fourth man with twelve fingers and twelve toes.)  R. Isaac said: She walked forty paces (Lat.: passus.)  with her; therefore, the Holy One granted her her reward and gave her Goliath. (Ruth R. 2:20 states more specifically that in return for her forty paces the Holy One granted her son a forty-day reprieve.)  So he was cursing before the Holy One forty days, as stated (in I Sam. 17:16): AND HE (the Philistine) TOOK HIS STAND FOR FORTY DAYS. Jesse said to his son David: Now is the time to make good on the surety of your ancestor who became surety for Benjamin under the hand of his father, as stated (in Gen. 43:9): I MYSELF WILL BE SURETY FOR HIM. Now go and discharge him from his surety. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 17:18): SEE ALSO TO THE WELFARE OF YOUR BROTHERS, AND TAKE THEIR TOKEN. Now THEIR TOKEN ('RBH) is nothing but a surety ('RBWT). What did David do? He went and made good on the surety by killing Goliath. The Holy One said to him: By your life, just as you have risked your life for Saul, since he is from the tribe of Benjamin, even as your ancestor Judah did for Benjamin &lt; himself &gt;, as stated (in Gen. 44:33): AND NOW PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD … so I am placing the Sanctuary &lt; both &gt; within your territory and within the territory of Benjamin. And where is it shown that the Sanctuary is &lt; both &gt; within the inheritance of Benjamin and within the inheritance of Judah? Where one text (Gen. 49:27) says: BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF; IN THE MORNING HE CONSUMES PREY, i.e., the dawn tamid (sacrifice), AND IN THE EVENING HE DIVIDES THE SPOIL, i.e., the twilight tamid; while another text (Ps. 48:3 [2]) says: BEAUTEOUS LANDSCAPE, JOY OF THE WHOLE EARTH, &lt; EVEN MOUNT ZION &gt;. By your life, moreover, when all the tribes are going into exile, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin are not going into exile along with them. Why? Because these two tribes believed in me and sanctified my name in the sea with Moses. R. Abba bar Kahana said in the name of R. Levi: When the sea was split open for Israel, there was mire in it. Now the tribe of Reuben said to the tribe of Simeon: From mud you have come and to mud you are going. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 12:1): EPHRAIM SURROUNDS ME WITH DECEIT, THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WITH FALSE-HOOD…. What did the tribes of Judah and Benjamin do? They sanctified the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 68:28 [27]): LITTLE BENJAMIN IS THERE RULING OVER THEM, THE PRINCES OF JUDAH IN THEIR GLORY….</p>

(Vs. 33:) AND NOW PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN &lt; AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD &gt;…. (The point of all these citations is to demonstrate that Judah has now humbled himself.)  The Holy One said to him: Behold, you have now let go of your former power, and spoken supplications. By your life, in spite of what I said (in Hos. 12:3 [2]): THE LORD HAS A LAWSUIT WITH JUDAH, I will instead be gracious and have compassion on you. It is so stated (in Is. 57:16): FOR I WILL NOT CARRY ON A LAWSUIT FOREVER. And the EVER (in FOREVER) is nothing but a reference to Judah, since it is stated (in Joel 4:20 [3:20]): BUT JUDAH SHALL BE INHABITED FOREVER. (Since the FOR in FOREVER can mean AGAINST, Is. 57:16 is therefore understood to mean: FOR I WILL NOT CARRY ON A LAWSUIT AGAINST JUDAH.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>According to Midrash Tanchuma Ki Teytze 10 the words: “and he did not fear G’d,” mean that the people of Amalek (descendants of Esau) had a tradition that they could be defeated only by descendants of Rachel seeing that we have a verse in Jeremiah 49,20 אם לא יסחבום צעירי הצאן, “(hear then the plan G’d has devised against Edom) surely the shepherd boys shall drag them away.” These latter words are understood to refer to the youngest of the tribes of Israel, the ones which have been described as נער, (compare Genesis 37,2 where Joseph is described in these terms). We find that also Edom is described as junior in Ovadiah 2, קטן, “junior,” and it is appropriate that a junior such as Edom be defeated by another junior. The reason is that Joseph who attained prominence and remained loyal to G’d although in the environment of two sinners (Pharaoh and Potiphar) without learning from their deeds, is so superior to Esau who grew up between two righteous people (Yitzchak and Avraham) and still did not learn from the good deeds of those righteous people. The Torah testifies that Joseph said: “I fear the Lord,” (Genesis 44,18) as opposed to Amalek. No wonder that the one was doomed to fall by the hand of the other. [If Moses chose the נער Joshua to battle Amalek this was because he was a descendant of Ephrayim, a son of Joseph. Ed.]</p>

              <p>When Israel left Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign speech. Judah became His Holy One, Israel, His dominion. The Sea saw and fled, the Jordan River turned away. The mountains danced like rams, the hills like young sheep. What is happening to you, O Sea, that you are fleeing, O Jordan that you turn to the rear; O mountains that you dance like rams, O hills like young sheep? From before the Master, tremble O earth, from before the Lord of Jacob. Who turns the Rock into a pond of water, the flint into a spring of water. (Ps. 114) “When Israel left,” Israel refers to the males. “The house of Jacob” refers to the females. “A people of strange speech,” this refers to the Egyptians who committed slander. If they were willing to slander the Israelites, then against the wives of the Israelites, all the more so. But anyone who disqualifies others (by speaking poorly of them) is himself damaged, as well as one who opens his mouth to speak foolishly. “Judah became his Holy One,” In the past Israel guarded themselves from promiscuity for we find that wherever there is mention of holiness it is because there is a safeguard against promiscuity. The proof is, “Israel, His dominion.” Because of Israel’s chastity, it merited to have its own kings and princes rule over them, like a city that had everything in it.81 (81 See BT Hullin 56b)  “Judah became,” alludes to the time of the separation of languages (Dor Haflagah) when holy souls were placed in their own special treasury, as is explained by the מז&quot;ה of blessed memory, and in a Tosafot in the first chapter of Avodah Zara… This is the meaning of, “Judah became…” that is, only Judah had souls worthy of serving God from the storehouse of precious vessels. It also alludes to Judah (our forefather). The episode of Tamar all happened according to God’s plan and was “From God.” (Ps. 118),That is, it was God’s doing that Judah became a Holy One and was given dominion over Israel for dominion was a sign that one was guarded against promiscuity, as is said in Tanhumah and the Zohar at the end of Lech Lecha. Yesod and Malchut are united,82 (82 Joseph is associated in Kabbalah with the Sefirah of Yesod which is also connected with the rite of circumcision. Because Joseph resisted the temptation of Potephera’s wife - he has the merit of being associated with this Sephirah. The divine phallus brings fulfillment through its connection with the Shechinah which is the feminine aspect of divinity - thus, Joseph’s casket has the Mem for malchut engraved on it. Judah’s association is more difficult to understand - possibly his intimacy with Tamar is not seen as promiscuity since it was part of the divine plan.)  Josef in righteousness and “Judah drew near” (Gen. 44:18) so that righteousness and peace embraced each other. The Psalm continues, “The sea saw it and fled.” The sea saw Joseph’s casket for he guarded the sacred sign of the covenant (brit) and therefore it merited dominion. As the sages explain, it was through Joseph’s merit that the sea split, as it says, “The sea saw it and fled.” It saw the letter Mem that was written on the casket and fled, causing the sea to split for his sake…Israel also guarded itself from promiscuity by safeguarding the covenant. Israel was that the sea was calmed for them. This also occurred with the Jordan river, as is stated, “The Jordan River turned away.” Since they were all righteous and guardians of the holy covenant, “The mountains danced like rams” at Mount Sinai when God wanted to give the Torah to Israel. This was also a sign of their distinguished status. The sages say that Israel merited the Torah because all of them had true distinguished lineage. From this it came to be known that the Egyptians spoke falsely against the house of Jacob, the Israelite women. “What is happening to you, O Sea, that you are fleeing,” in the future redemption, as the sages say regarding the verse, “Adonai will dry up the tongue of the Egyptian sea.” (Isa.11:15) “O Jordan that you turn to the rear,” in the messianic future. This is how the commentators explain the verse, “...they crossed the river on foot, we therefore rejoice in Him.” (Ps. 66:6) “From before the Master, tremble O earth…” In the future there shall be trembling, exactly. That is, the earth all that is found in it, the river and the sea and the mountains, as Radak83 (83 David Kimchi (Radak) 1160 - 1235 was a Provencal rabbi, biblical commentator, grammarian and philosopher, born to a family of grammarians and commentators. Influenced by Ibn Ezra and the Rambam in philosophical matters, he sided with those who supported the permissibility of philosophic study. Radak cautioned, however, that it should be undertaken only by those whose faith was well-grounded. His commentaries on Tanakh display his grammatical mastery, and are amongst the most basic and commonly referenced. (Sefaria))  explains. “Who turns the boulder into a pond of water,” the final letters of these words spell Miriam;84 (84 ההופכי הצור אגם מים)  it alludes to the well which followed the Israelites through the wilderness through her merit. “the flint into a spring of water,” 85 (85 חלמיש למעינו מים The numerical value adds up to 346 - Moses is 345)  the final letters of these words have the numerical value Moshe (Moses) with one extra added for the word. For when Miriam died, the merit of providing water fell upon Moses.</p>

For truly, one is not punished for the deficiency within him in any matter until it is brought out into action. And here, if there was any deficiency concerning theft within Binyamin, God forbid, it would never have come into the realm of action in this way if he had remained at home, only the “accuser of the journey” caused it to happen. If so, this action that he is being punished for is not his fault, for the power of his own will would never have had him make the journey to Egypt. And here Yehuda claims this against God (“and You said to Your servants, bring him down”), for he believed that even what Yosef said to them, to bring Binyamin, was nothing other than God’s will.</p>

              <p>MY LORD ASKED HIS SERVANTS. I know no reason for this lengthy speech of Judah in which he relates that which has already transpired between them. And that which the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said in interpretation of Judah’s words: (Bereshith Rabbah 93:5, quoted here by Rashi.)  “Is this the ‘setting your eyes upon him’ to which you referred when you said, That I may set mine eyes upon him?” (Verse 21 here.)  — does not make it a valid argument, for a ruler who commands that a person be brought before him does not do so on condition that he be freed from the consequences of the evils he would commit, and the more so for a theft in which the goblet from which he drinks was stolen from the king’s house. And originally he had favorably cast his eyes upon Benjamin, greeting him by saying G-d be gracious unto thee, my son, (Above, 43:29.)  and he made all a party before him in the palace in Benjamin’s honor, and he gave them presents (Ibid., Verse 34.)  and gave them corn as much as they can bear (Ibid., 44:1.)  in excess of the money they had brought him, as I have explained, and what else was he to do for him! It therefore appears to me, in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, that Judah’s words are nought but supplications to bestir Joseph’s compassion, for Judah thought that he was a man who fears G-d, as he had told him, (Ibid., 42:18.)  and since he had conducted himself mercifully towards them in the manner of one who fears sin, by consoling them for the trouble he had caused them. (Ibid., 43:23.)  And this is the purport of the story. Judah said to him: “As a consequence of my lord’s inquiry, we were forced to tell you about this brother of ours, and we also did not consent to bring him down before you as you commanded at first, but we said that the lad cannot leave his father. (Verse 22 here.)  However, at the peril of our lives, because of the burning heat of famine, (Lamentations 5:10.)  we brought him, for you said, Ye shall see my face no more. (Verse 23 here.)  But our father did not want to listen and permit us to return to buy a little food until we were all in danger, and then he consented with fear and worry. But now when he seeth that the lad is not with us, (Verse 31 here.)  he will die in bitterness of soul. (Job 21:25.)  Therefore, let my supplication, I pray thee, be presented before thee, (Jeremiah 37:20.)  to have pity upon us and the aged father, and take me in place of the lad as a permanent servant, for I am better than he, and it shall be righteousness unto thee.” (Deuteronomy 24:13.)  This is the purport of the entire section. It is possible that the expression, and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, (Verse 31 here.)  is a euphemism out of respect [for Joseph, and Judah’s intent was to say], “and you will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father.” Similarly, But this thing brings sin upon thy people. (Exodus 5:16.)  [The officers meant to say, “This thing brings sin upon you.”] It may further be said, in line with that which our Rabbis have said: “Is this the ‘setting your eyes upon him’ to which you referred?”—that Judah said, For thou art even as Pharaoh, (Verse 18 here.)  meaning “it behooves you to stand by your word and your inquest, for it was on account of you that we have brought the lad under great duress,” as he [Judah] mentions, and he feared to be more explicit. But hidden in his words is the hint that the goblet affair was a scheme of his to have a pretext against them, for why should Joseph have wanted to see Benjamin to begin with, against their will. And so the Rabbis said in Bereshith Rabbah: (93:8.)  “Judah said to him, ‘I will prove to you that you moved against us with a pretext. The people of how many countries have come down to buy food? Have you interrogated them as you have interrogated us? Were we perhaps asking for your daughter in marriage or were you seeking to marry our sister?’” The Rabbis are saying that this was hinted at in his words.</p>

              <p>Why did you need to ask all these question? Were we seeking your daughter... [Rashi knows this] because only concerning marriage do people ask about sons and daughters and fathers and mothers. You might ask: Why does Rashi say “your daughter” pertaining to Yoseif, and “our sister” pertaining to his brothers, and not the opposite, since the brothers were older than Yoseif? The answer is: Since Yoseif was esteemed in their eyes as a king, they said, “Were we seeking your daughter.” For a son-in-law usually honors his father-in-law. Similarly with, “Were you seeking our sister,” i.e., we would need to treat you with honor so that it will be well with our sister. But the opposite would be a disgrace to Yoseif as a king, for Yoseif would need to honor them. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>אדוני שאל, ”my lord had inquired, etc.” Nachmanides writes that he does not understand what Yehudah had meant to accomplish by making such a long speech. Even recalling Joseph’s words of why he wanted to see their younger brother, this surely had not implied that if that brother would commit a criminal act he should go unpunished! All the more so will he deserve to be punished if this brother became guilty of stealing the goblet from the ruler of the country! As long as Joseph had not known anything negative about Binyamin he had welcomed him most cordially and even invoked G’d’s blessing on him (43,29). He had recompensed the brothers for having put them to so much trouble by giving them as much grain as their donkeys could carry, had wined and dined them and showered them with gifts. What could Yehudah have hoped to accomplish by arguing? The only thing he could possibly achieve was to appeal to Joseph’s sense of mercy and pity. Yehudah’s premise was that Joseph was a G’d–fearing man, seeing that Joseph had made that point when keeping only Shimon as a hostage instead of keeping them all and sending one brother to get Binyamin from the land of Canaan.
    Yehudah’s major argument was to convince Joseph that they had put their lives on the line in order to get their father’s permission to allow Binyamin to travel with them, and that failure to bring him home healthy and well would be like condemning them collectively to death, as well as to hasten the death of their father, something they could not bear to watch. Had it not been for Joseph’s threat to deny them and their families further food supplies, an indispensable lifeline during such a famine, their father would never have consented to allow this remaining son of his favourite wife to be separated from him. If Joseph’s concern was to secure for himself compensation for the theft by way of personal services to be provided for him, he Yehudah, could provide such services better than his brother Binyamin.
    Alternately, Yehudah may have reminded Joseph simply that it was appropriate for him to stand by his word that he only wanted to set his eyes upon Binyamin. He implied by what he did not spell out, that he considered the matter of the goblet as merely a pretext, a manipulation in order to justify keeping Binyamin with him. He could not risk saying something like this to Joseph’s face openly.

              <p>“My lord asked his servants, have you a father or another brother” [44:19]? He said: you Joseph, you came only with accusations from the beginning. Why did you need to ask if we have a father? Did we desire to marry your daughters? Judah said to Joseph. You went at us only with accusations. Why would you ask about our father or brothers? Because you asked about our father and brothers, we told you the truth that we have a father and a small brother, and that one brother was lost. (Rashi, Genesis, 44:19.)  In the previous portion they said that one brother was lost. The explanation is that the brothers were now afraid that they lost a brother. Perhaps Joseph would say, search for him and bring him here. Therefore, the brothers said: we learned that one brother died. (Rashi, Genesis, 44:20.)  We have told you that if the youth would be removed from his father, the father would die of anguish and also the youth.  (Rashi, Genesis, 44:22.)  You had said: you should not see my face without the youth. We came to our father and our father said, “my wife bore me two sons” [44:27]. That is to say, you will take Benjamin from me.

              </summary>
              <p>Chapter (55) 56: Prophets. [1] The vision of Obadiah (Obadiah 1). May the memory of the righteous be for a blessing. When Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said (Job 4:1), Rabbi Berachiah said, &quot;Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, exact punishment from Esau in a vision? Rather, it was to teach us how God repays both a hater and a lover according to their deeds. When Job was afflicted, Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau, was his friend, and Eliphaz was righteous and rebuked Job only in a vision. The verse says, &quot;Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 'If one ventures a word with you, will you be offended? But who can keep from speaking?'&quot; (Job 4:2). It is like a parable of a man who had two wives, one whose dowry was ten thousand and one whose dowry was four thousand. The one whose dowry was four thousand said to him, &quot;Why don't you treat me with the same respect as your other wife?&quot; He said to her, &quot;Your dowry is four thousand, and your friend's dowry is ten thousand.&quot; Similarly, Job said, &quot;Why don't you treat me with the same respect as Abraham?&quot; He said to him, &quot;Have you been tested like Abraham?&quot; He who is tested will be afflicted by what is said to him. And only Abraham was tested, as it says, &quot;God tested Abraham&quot; (Genesis 22:1). He said to them, &quot;But I did not bring in four wreaths.&quot; &quot;He was whole-hearted and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil&quot; (Job 1:1). They said to him, &quot;Abraham was tested with ten, and he had ten wreaths.&quot; He was called Ethan, as it says, &quot;A maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite&quot; (Psalms 89:1), and similarly, &quot;The mighty men are foundations of the earth&quot; (Micah 6:2). And why was he called Ethan? Because he strengthened himself to do the will of his Creator. He who believed in God was called Heman, as it says, &quot;And he believed in the Lord&quot; (Genesis 15:6). And why is Eitan called Heman, who strengthened himself to do the will of his Creator, called Heman, because he believed in the Almighty, as it says &quot;And he believed in the Lord&quot; (Genesis 15:6). Abram was originally called Abram, and then the Lord added to his name, and he became Abraham. Why did the Lord add to his name? Because he fulfilled the five books of the Torah even before they were given, as it says &quot;Because Abraham obeyed Me and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws&quot; (Genesis 26:5). Therefore, he is called Abraham. He is also called &quot;Ayit&quot; (Falcon), as it says &quot;One calls from the east a bird of prey&quot; (Isaiah 46:11), referring to the hen that protects her chicks from the wolves and the ravens. Similarly, Abraham risked his life by being thrown into the furnace for his beliefs. He is called &quot;Tzur&quot; (Rock), as it says &quot;Look to the rock from which you were hewn&quot; (Isaiah 51:1). Just as a rock has no [עיים ruins or eyes], so Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac when commanded to do so. He is called &quot;Nasi&quot; (Prince), as it says &quot;For thus says the High and Lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: 'I dwell in the high and holy place, with him who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones'&quot; (Isaiah 57:15). He is called &quot;Adon&quot; (Lord), as it says &quot;And he said, 'Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham'&quot; (Genesis 24:27). And if you ask why he was called Adon, was it not because he was his servant? Others also called him Adon, as it says &quot;And we said to my lord&quot; (Genesis 44:19), because he made the Almighty Lord over all of His creatures. He is called &quot;Elohim&quot; (God), as it says &quot;The prince of God&quot; (Genesis 23:6). This is because he made known the fear of the Almighty in his world, as it says &quot;You are God-fearing&quot; (Genesis 22:12). He is called &quot;Navi&quot; (Prophet), as he first revealed the power of the Holy Spirit, as it says &quot;And you return the wife of the man, for he is a prophet&quot; (Genesis 20:7). &quot;And he shall be called a God-fearing man, as it is said, 'Now I know that you are a God-fearing man' (Job 22:12), for he was in awe of the Lord and called a lover, as it is said, 'the seed of Abraham, my friend' (Isaiah 41:8). Behold, ten trials were given to correspond to the ten qualities. Eliphaz said to him, 'Do you possess these qualities? If so, then trouble will come upon you. Behold, you have comforted many' (Job 4:3-4). Those who suffer came to you, and you comforted them. The blind one came and said to you, 'God already knows what I am going to do, for He made me blind from my mother's womb.' And you said to him, 'Do not say that.' And you said to him, 'My son, if you built a house and did not want to make windows, who would have forced you?' You are a linchpin of the Almighty, and He did not do this out of hatred, but to praise you in the future, as it is said, 'Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened' (Isaiah 35:5). &quot;So shall Hashem of Hosts be a protecting wall to the remnant of Israel; to them shall they deliver from captivity and return. And the Passover [Haggadah] says, 'Do not say thus, &quot;If I were there, I would have built pillars for myself.&quot; Whoever says this, God praises him for the future, as it says, &quot;Then shall leap as a hart the lame&quot; (Zechariah 8:4). And also, the [Haggadah] says, 'The deaf-mute one says to him, &quot;If you were a skilled craftsman and did not want to make ears for your friend, who could compel you?&quot; Thus, God praises you for the World-to-Come, as it says, &quot;And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped&quot; (Isaiah 35:5). You comforted all who were afflicted, &quot;The tottering one will be restored by you&quot; (Job 4:4). And now, when afflictions have befallen you, you are confused, as it says, &quot;Now it shall come upon you and you will be broken&quot; (Job 4:5). &quot;Is not your fear of God your confidence?&quot; (Job 4:6) Because you said, &quot;I am pure and upright,&quot; if not for the fact that God acted towards you as one does towards a human being, and brought the Flood, your righteousness would have been before you. Remember now, who being innocent has ever perished?&quot; (Job 4:7). Eliphaz said to Job, &quot;Even if Abraham the righteous had been in your place, he would not have been spared,&quot; as it says, &quot;I am the Lord Who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans&quot; (Genesis 15:7). &quot;If you are righteous, He will have mercy upon you, for He does not destroy the righteous, as it is said, 'Remember now, who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off?' (Job 4:7-8). When I saw those who plow iniquity (Job 4:8), I envied the wicked who were at ease, who sow mischief and reap calamity. But lo, the day comes, burning like an oven, when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble; the day that comes shall burn them up, says the Lord of hosts, so that it will leave them neither root nor branch. (Malachi 3:19) He who roars like a lion and the voice of the fierce lion is heard no more (Isaiah 31:4), it was said to him, 'Israel will eventually sin before the Lord who is called a lion, as it is said, 'The lion has roared, who will not fear?' (Amos 3:8). He elevated them to Nebuchadnezzar who was called a lion, as it is said, 'The lion has come up from his thicket' (Jeremiah 4:7), and in the month of Tammuz, whose sign is the lion, he destroyed the Temple, which is called the lion, as it is said, 'Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt' (Isaiah 29:1), and he who rules over Judah is called a lion, as it is said, 'Judah is a lion's whelp' (Genesis 49:9). Here, he explains five names, all of them called a lion. The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the two young lions have been silenced. The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. (Job 4:10-11) Elihu said to him, 'It was not I who spoke, but the Spirit of God who dwells in me' (Job 32:8). And how were all of these proven in a vision? As it is said in the visions of the night (Job 4:13), the Lord said to him, 'You have proved My servant Job in a vision; even so I will send a prophet who will prove and punish the house of your father in a vision, as it is said, 'The vision of Obadiah. Thus says the Lord God concerning Edom: We have heard tidings from the Lord, and a messenger has been sent among the nations: &quot;Rise up! Let us rise against her for battle!&quot; (Obadiah 1:1) Why should you serve us? Even I will unsheathe My sword and come down upon him, as it is said, 'For My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; behold, it descends for judgment upon Edom, upon the people I have doomed to destruction' (Isaiah 34:5).</p>

              <p>Another matter, “Judah approached [vayigash] him” – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis. Rabbi Yehuda says: An approach for war, just as it says: “Yoav and the people who were with him advanced [vayigash] to the battle” (II Samuel 10:13). Rabbi Neḥemya says: An approach for conciliation, just as it says: “The children of Judah approached Joshua” (Joshua 14:6) – to placate him. (Members of the tribe of Judah sought to placate Joshua so that he would grant Caleb’s request.)  The Rabbis say: An approach for prayer – “Elijah the prophet approached, and he said: Lord, God of …” (I Kings 18:36). Rabbi Elazar resolved it in accordance with all of them: If [I must engage in] war, I am coming; if [I must engage in] conciliation, I am coming, if [I must engage in] prayer, I am coming.  “Please my lord [bi adoni]” (Genesis 44:18) – [take] me [bi] and not him [bei] – whether it is to fill water, it is I; for service, it is I; to split logs, it is I. (Judah was telling Joseph that he would be a better servant than Benjamin, and therefore Joseph should take him and not Benjamin. )   Another matter, “Please my lord [bi adoni]” – injustice [baya] you are bringing upon us, my lord, as so you said to us: “Bring him down to me, [and I will set my eye upon him]” (Genesis 44:21); is this the setting of an eye? It is the opposite of what you said: It is blindness of the eye. (You obscured the truth from us.)   Rabbi Simon said: (This statement is an explanation of Judah’s argument that Joseph was acting unjustly in demanding that Benjamin become his slave. )  It is written in our law books: “If he has nothing, he shall be sold for his theft” (Exodus 22:2), but this one has the means to pay.  “May your servant please speak [a word in my lord's ears]” – may my words enter your ears. This one’s grandmother, because Pharaoh abducted her for one night, he and his household were stricken with leprosy, as it is written: “The Lord afflicted Pharaoh [and his household with great afflictions over the matter of Sarai, Abram’s wife]” (Genesis 12:17), take care that this person (A reference to Joseph himself.)  will not be stricken with leprosy. The mother of this one died only due to our father’s curse. You cite it from here: “With whomever you find your gods, he shall not live” (Genesis 31:32); (The midrash understands that due to this statement, uttered by Jacob, Rachel died. )  take care that a curse will not take effect upon you and that man (A reference to Joseph himself.)  will die. Two of us entered a certain city and destroyed it in its entirety. There it was on behalf of a female, here it is on behalf of a male. (Judah suspected that Joseph intended to sexually abuse Benjamin, and considered homosexual abuse to be worse than Shekhem’s abuse of Dina, or Pharoah’s intent to abuse Sarah (Etz Yosef). )  For coming against the apple of [Jacob’s] eye, against the host of the Holy One blessed be He, in whose regard it is stated: “He hovers over him all the day” (Deuteronomy 33:12), (The Sages viewed this verse as an allusion to the fact that the Temple was located in the territory of Benjamin (see Yoma 12a). )  all the more so.  Another matter, “may your servant please speak [yedaber na]…” – Rabbi Yirmeya bar Shemaya said: I will remove something [davar] from within and introduce pestilence [dever] into No, (Another name for Egypt, or the capital city of the Egyptian empire. )  and exterminate you.  Rabbi Ḥanin said: When Judah was filled with rage, the hairs over his heart would rip through his garments and emerge, and he would place chunks of iron in his mouth and expel them as dust.  “As you are like Pharaoh” – just as Pharaoh decrees and does not fulfill, so, too, you decree and do not fulfill. Just as Pharaoh lusts after males, so, too, do you. Just as Pharaoh is king and you are second to him in the land of Egypt, so, too, my father is king in the land of Canaan and I am second to him. If I draw my sword, I will begin with you and conclude with Pharaoh your master. Had he said: ‘I will begin with Pharaoh,’ [Joseph] would have left him alone. Since he said: ‘I will begin with you,’ [Joseph] signaled to Manasseh, who stamped one foot and the entire palace quaked. [Judah] said: ‘This is a stamp from Father’s household.’ (No one but members of Jacob’s family were so powerful. )  When he saw that matters were thus, (When Judah saw he would not be able to overpower Manasseh (Etz Yosef). )  he began speaking gentle words – “my lord asked” (Genesis 44:19).</p>

              <p>“My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or a brother?” (Genesis 44:19).  “My lord asked his servants…” – [Judah] said to him: ‘From the outset you came against us with malice. How many countries descended to Egypt to purchase food? But you did not ask [this of] any of them. Did we, perhaps, come to take our daughter, or are you planning to marry our sister? Nevertheless, we hid nothing from you.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘I see that you are a prattler. Is there among your brothers a prattler like you?’ (Why are you the only one of the brothers talking? According to Tanḥuma (Vayigash 5), Joseph claimed that he knew through divination that Judah was not the oldest of the brothers, and therefore it was even more surprising that he was doing all the talking. )  [Judah] said to him: ‘All this that you see is because I became a guarantor for him.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘Why did you not do so on behalf of your brother when you sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver pieces, and you brought anguish to your father and said to him: “Joseph was mauled”?’ (Genesis 37:33). When Judah heard this he screamed and cried in a loud voice. (Judah screamed and cried because Joseph was not giving in to his demand to release Benjamin. )  He said: “For how will I go up to my father?” (Genesis 44:34). Judah said to Naphtali: ‘Go and see how many marketplaces there are in Egypt.’ He leapt and returned and said to him: ‘Twelve.’ Judah said to his brothers: ‘I will destroy three of them, and each and every one of you take one each, “and no man will be left among them”’ (I Samuel 14:36). His brothers said to him: ‘Egypt is not like Shekhem. If you destroy Egypt you will be destroying the entire world.’   “Joseph could not restrain himself before all those standing before him, and he called: Remove every man from before me. No man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers” (Genesis 45:1).  “He raised his voice in weeping; the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard” (Genesis 45:2).  “Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live? And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him” (Genesis 45:3).  “Joseph said to his brothers: Please approach me, and they approached. He said: I am Joseph your brother whom you sold to Egypt” (Genesis 45:4).  At that moment, “Joseph could not restrain himself” (Genesis 45:1). When Joseph saw that they had come to an agreement to destroy Egypt, Joseph said to himself: ‘It is preferable that I reveal myself to them and they will not destroy Egypt.’ Joseph said to them: ‘Did you not say that this one’s brother was dead? I will call him and he will come to you.’ He was calling: ‘Joseph son of Jacob, come to me. Joseph son of Jacob come to me.’ They were looking to the four corners of the palace. He said to them: ‘What are you looking for? “I am Joseph your brother”’ (Genesis 45:4). Immediately, their souls departed, as it is stated: “His brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3).

              <p>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: In all the matters that you read that Judah spoke to Joseph in the presence of his brothers until you reach: “Joseph could not restrain himself,” there is conciliation for Joseph, conciliation for his brothers and conciliation for Benjamin. Conciliation for Joseph, saying: See how he is giving his life for the sake of Rachel’s sons. (Joseph saw how Judah was willing to give his life for Benjamin, whereas earlier he had been one of the initiators when the brothers sold him. This showed that Judah had repented. )  Conciliation for his brothers, saying: See how he is giving his life for his brother’s sake. (Thus, Judah was reconciled with his brothers, who had demoted him from his position of leadership after the sale of Joseph (Etz Yosef; see Bereshit Rabba 42:3). )  Conciliation for Benjamin, he said to him: ‘Just as I am giving my life for your sake, so I am willing to give my life for your brother’s sake.’ (Benjamin had suspected his brothers in the disappearance of Joseph, but was conciliated through this process. )   “Joseph could not restrain himself…” – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Joseph did not act properly, (It was unwise for him to be alone with his brothers.)  as had one of them kicked him, he would have immediately died. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He acted appropriately and properly. He was aware of his brothers’ righteousness. He said: ‘God forbid, my brothers are not suspected of bloodshed.’</p>

            <summary>Ramban explains that Joseph's brothers altered the message for Jacob's peace, not mentioning that they were free to trade in the land, and Rashi interprets &quot;tis'charu&quot; as meaning they could travel around the land to buy grain. In response to Joseph's questions about their family, Judah explained that they were afraid of losing another brother and emphasized the importance of their father's well-being.</summary>

                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 42:34:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>AND YOU SHALL BE FREE (‘TIS’CHARU’) TO TRADE IN THE LAND. They altered it for the sake of peace (For we do not find that Joseph told this to his brothers.)  so that Jacob would consent to send Benjamin along with them. It had been their desire to return immediately were it not that Jacob had said, My son shall not go down with you. (Verse 38 here.)  Similarly, for the sake of peace, they told him Joseph’s words, ‘Leave’ one of your brothers with me, (Verse 33 here.)  and they did not tell their father of their imprisonment or of Simeon’s imprisonment. It is possible that Joseph did tell them, And you shall be free to trade in the land, but Scripture does not relate it. If so, the intent of the statement is that “you will be able to bring merchandise at your will for the purpose of purchasing grain, and I will not take it, as compensation for your embarassment.” (Thus he suggested that they will be able to keep their original merchandise for sale to others, and obtain grain free.)  Similarly, their saying, The man persisted in asking about ourselves, and our family, (Further, 43:7.)  constitutes a motivating plea to their father, [but the event never actually took place]. It may be that when they told Joseph, We are all one man’s sons, (Verse 11 here.)  he said to them, “Not so, but you have truly come to find out the condition of the land. (Verse 12 here.)  Now tell me if your father is alive, and if you have another brother, for I will investigate you and know what you are.” Then they said, “We are twelve brethren, the sons of one man who is presently in the land of Canaan, for he is still alive, and the youngest one is with him, and one is gone.” This was what Judah said to Joseph: My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother? (Further, 44:19.)  In a similar manner Scripture, in many places, is concise about an event or the recounting thereof, as I have mentioned. (See Ramban above in Verse 21.)  Now Rashi writes: “Tis’charu, you may travel round the land. All expressions of s’chorah (merchandise) and socharim (merchants) are derived from sochar, which means ‘going around,’ because the merchants go round looking for merchandise.” It would seem that the Rabbi [Rashi] (See Bereshith, Note 139.)  aimed by this interpretation to guard himself against this difficulty. (Namely, that we do not find that Joseph mentioned to his brothers about being free to trade in the land. Therefore, Rashi explained the word tis’charu as giving them the right to travel around the land and buy grain always without hindrance.)  He therefore explained their words as reporting only that Joseph had said that they would be permitted to travel around the land and always buy grain at their pleasure. But above, in the story of Shechem, Rashi did not so interpret the same expressions: Settle down ‘us’charuah’ (and engage in trade); (Above, 34:10. For there actual trade is referred to, while here only travelling around the land is meant. Therefore Rashi makes his comment here, and not there in the story of Schechem.)  ‘v’yis’charu othah’ (and engage in trade in it). (Ibid., Verse 21.) </p>

              <p>“My lord asked his servants, have you a father or another brother” [44:19]? He said: you Joseph, you came only with accusations from the beginning. Why did you need to ask if we have a father? Did we desire to marry your daughters? Judah said to Joseph. You went at us only with accusations. Why would you ask about our father or brothers? Because you asked about our father and brothers, we told you the truth that we have a father and a small brother, and that one brother was lost. (Rashi, Genesis, 44:19.)  In the previous portion they said that one brother was lost. The explanation is that the brothers were now afraid that they lost a brother. Perhaps Joseph would say, search for him and bring him here. Therefore, the brothers said: we learned that one brother died. (Rashi, Genesis, 44:20.)  We have told you that if the youth would be removed from his father, the father would die of anguish and also the youth.  (Rashi, Genesis, 44:22.) </p>

              <p>He thought, “If I tell him that he is alive, he will say, ‘Bring him to me.’” You might ask: On the contrary, was Yehudah not contradicting himself? When they had come previously to Yoseif, they said he was still alive but had been sold, as it says, “And one is no more” (42:13). The answer is: The first time they came, they said, “And one is no more.” But the second time they came, they were saying that he had died, and this verse pertains to [what they were saying] the second time. Although it is not expressly written that Yoseif asked [now for details] about their lost brother, we can still say that he asked, as we anyway have to say [something similar to] this. It is written here that Yoseif had said to them, “Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.” But we do not find it written previously that Yoseif had said this to them. Perforce, he must have said it to them although it is not written previously. And the same is true here: the second time they came, when he asked about their father, he inquired also about their lost brother — and they replied that he had died. [They so replied] out of fear. They saw he had told them to bring Binyomin, and perhaps he would tell them to search for the lost brother and bring him. So they replied that after having searched for him, they received word that he had died. </p>

Adda b. Ahaha raised the following objection: &quot;Whence do you know that Jacob warned his sons concerning cold and heat, which are the consequences of Heavenly accidents&quot; [Hence infer your theory,] perhaps his (Jacob's) warning was against lions and thieves, which are the consequence of human accidents? [Hence you have no inference.] Did then Jacob confine his warning against this and not against that? Jacob surely warned them against everything. [Hence the inference is understood.] And is then cold and heat the consequence of Heavenly acts? Behold, we are taught that everything is in the power of Heaven (comes through no human fault) except [sickness due to] cold and heat, as it is said (Pr. 22, 5) Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward; he that keepeth his soul holdeth himself far from them. And again a lion and thieves are then the consequence of human acts? Behold R. Joseph said, and so was also R. Chiya taught: &quot;Since the Temple was destroyed, although the court of the Sanhedrin has ceased, nevertheless the punishment of four kinds of death described in the Scriptures did did not cease.&quot; How can you say that it has not ceased when we see that they are indeed abolished? We must therefore say that it refers to the Divine Judgment taking the place of the form of capital punishment has not ceased; for he who is liable to be stoned finds his death by falling down from a roof or by being trodden down by a wild beast, which equals stoning; he who is liable to be burned finds likewise his death by fire or by the bite of a snake; he who is liable to be slain by the sword falls either into the hand of the government, [where he is slain,] or [he meets his death] by murderers; and he who ought to be hung finds his death either by drowning in the river, or by diphtheria. [Hence a murderer is not liable to the bite of a snake?] We must therefore reverse the above; namely, the accidents of lions or thieves are the result of Heaven, while cold and heat are the results due to human neglect. </p>

Another interpretation is that the facial features of Joseph were similar to those of Jacob. This is Rashi’s language. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra also explains it in this way: “Because he was the son of old age — for he begot him in his old age when he was ninety-one (For when Jacob stood before Pharaoh at the end of two of the lean years he was one hundred and thirty years old (47:9). Now when Joseph stood before Pharaoh he was thirty years old. Therefore after the seven years of plenty, and the two lean years he was thirty-nine. Subtract his age from Jacob’s age and there remain ninety-one years. This was Jacob’s age when Joseph was born. (Ohel Yoseph.))  years old. They likewise called his brother Benjamin a little child of his old age. “ (Further, 44:20.)  But in my opinion this is not correct for the verse states that Jacob loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age, whereas all his children were born to him during his old age! Issachar and Zebulun were not more than a year or two (See Seder Olam Rabbah, 2.)  older than Joseph. The correct interpretation appears to me to be that it was the custom of the elders to take one of their younger sons to be with them to attend them. He would constantly lean on his arm, never being separated from him, and he would be called ben z’kunav because he attended him in his old age. Now Jacob took Joseph for this purpose, and he was with him constantly. He therefore did not accompany the flock when they went to pasture in distant places. And Onkelos who translated, “he was a wise son,” intended to say that in his father’s eyes, Joseph was a knowledgeable and wise son, and his understanding was as that of elders. (See the interpretation of Ramban on Leviticus 19:32.)  However in the case of Benjamin, who is called yeled z’kunim (a little child of his old age), Onkelos translated: bar savtin (Rather than bar chakim, as in the case of Joseph.)  (a son of old age). [The explanation of Onkelos in the case of Joseph becomes clear] because the verse here does not state, “Joseph hayah (was) a son of old age;” instead, it says, hu lo (he was unto him), meaning that in his eyes he appeared to be [a ben z’kunim, and consequently it must mean bar chakim, a wise son]. (For if the sense of the verse is to be understood literally as meaning that “he was a son of his old age,” why specify “to Jacob?” Hence Onkelos correctly translated it as bar chakim, which means that Joseph was a wise son in his father’s estimate.)  This is the intent of the Sages when they said: (In the Rashi quoted above. The original source is Bereshith Rabbah 84:8.)  “Whatever Jacob had learned from Shem and Eber (The traditional masters who taught Torah to Jacob during the fourteen years he hid from Esau (Megillah 17 a). This source, however, mentions only Eber. See Bereshith Rabbah 84:8, where Shem is also mentioned.)  he transmitted to him,” meaning that he passed on to him wisdoms and the secrets of the Torah, and that the father found the son to be intelligent and profound in these areas as if he were an elder and a man of many years.</p>

Because you asked about our father and brothers, we told you the truth that we have a father and a small brother, and that one brother was lost. (Rashi, Genesis, 44:19.)  In the previous portion they said that one brother was lost. The explanation is that the brothers were now afraid that they lost a brother. Perhaps Joseph would say, search for him and bring him here. Therefore, the brothers said: we learned that one brother died. (Rashi, Genesis, 44:20.)

            <summary>The phrase &quot;that I may set mine eyes upon him&quot; in Genesis 44:21:1 is interpreted by various commentators as a promise to guard and treat Benjamin well, as seen in other biblical references such as Jeremiah 24:6 and 39:12. Yehudah's plea to Joseph to bring Benjamin to Egypt was based on the understanding that Joseph would have a benevolent interest in him, despite the fear or good manners that may have influenced his omission of certain details. Joseph's request to see Benjamin personally was seen as a promise of protection from harm according to Da'at Zekenim, while Chizkuni highlights Yehudah's guarantee of Benjamin's safety as the reason for his intervention.</summary>

              <p>THAT I MAY SET MINE EYES UPON HIM. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the meaning thereof is “that I may see him.” But I have not found “setting of eyes” in Scripture in reference to just seeing. Thus: And I will set Mine eyes upon them for good; (Jeremiah 24:6.)  Take him, and put your eye upon him, and do him no harm, (Ibid., 39:12.)  for Nebuchadrezzar did not command Nebuzaradan to merely see Jeremiah after he took him into custody, but to watch him and treat him well. But the meaning here is that Joseph had vowed to them to have pity on the lad and to guard him, even though it is not mentioned explicitly [in the narrative of the original confrontation between Joseph and his brothers], just as Scripture is concise there about all these matters which Judah related in Joseph’s presence. Now Judah did not mention the imprisonment of Simeon and the pretext that Ye are spies, (Above, 42:9.)  out of respect or out of the fear of majesty.</p>

              <p>ואשימה עיני עליו, “so that I may see him with my own eyes.” This expression is usually meant to convey a benevolent interest in the person one wishes to see. A well known example of this meaning is found in Jeremiah 24,6 ושמתי עיני עליהם לטובה, “So that I may look upon them favourably.” A similar verse with the identical expression is found in Amos. Even though in our verse the word “לטובה”, “favourably,” had not been spelled out by Joseph, it was reasonable for the brothers to understand Joseph’s request in that manner. Yehudah made no reference to Joseph having (in retrospect) imprisoned Shimon without cause, as the brothers had proved that they were not spies. He omitted this reference either because of fear, or because of good manners.

          <details>
            <summary>Hashgachah, divine providence, is present everywhere but manifests differently based on the merit of individuals or groups. G-d's personal intervention in history, such as the redemption from Egypt, is often attributed to the merit of our forefathers. This intervention is for the sake of the Jewish people or to save deserving individuals, as seen in examples like the preservation of the four kings of Sodom for Lot's sake. Psalm 33 emphasizes G-d's protection of His people and frustration of the counsel of nations to ensure His master plan is fulfilled.</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>
                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 54:1:12</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>C) There is a special hashgachah for Tzaddikim to whom G-d relates as if they were part of His own Self. Whenever G-d’s personal intervention is mentioned, this suggests that it was occasioned through the merit of our forefathers. Redemption is due to the good deeds of our ancestors. For instance, when G-d talks about redeeming Israel from Egypt, keeping His promise to Abraham the tzaddik, He says &quot;I shall pass through Egypt,&quot; which our sages interpret to mean that G-d personally, will do this, not by means of an angel, and emissary. (Exodus 12, 12) Or, &quot;I shall make it rain bread from heaven.&quot; (due to the merit of Moses) There are numerous other examples of this. To sum up, hashgachah exists everywhere, but its specific manifestation varies according to the merit of the individual or people concerned. A similar thought is expressed in Psalm 33. a) &quot;G-d frustrates the counsel of nations.&quot; b) &quot;Hail to the nation which counts the Lord as its G-d.&quot; c) &quot;Express jubilation to G-d, O righteous people.&quot; In the first instance hashgachah manifests itself negatively, preventing harm from befalling G-d’s people, preserving G-d’s master plan from being interfered with. Even when G-d exercises His personal hashgachah over the nations of the world, the objective is the preservation of His people.&quot; To save the life of His servants from death.&quot; (Psalms 33, 1) The four kings of Sodom that were saved, were saved for the sake of Lot, even though they themselves had long been guilty of death. Pharaoh was saved for the sake of Sarah. Clearly, whenever we have evidence of G-d’s personal interference in history, it is for the sake of the Jewish people or in order to save individual deserving Jews. </p>

              <p>Another matter, “Judah approached [vayigash] him” – Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Neḥemya, and the Rabbis. Rabbi Yehuda says: An approach for war, just as it says: “Yoav and the people who were with him advanced [vayigash] to the battle” (II Samuel 10:13). Rabbi Neḥemya says: An approach for conciliation, just as it says: “The children of Judah approached Joshua” (Joshua 14:6) – to placate him. (Members of the tribe of Judah sought to placate Joshua so that he would grant Caleb’s request.)  The Rabbis say: An approach for prayer – “Elijah the prophet approached, and he said: Lord, God of …” (I Kings 18:36). Rabbi Elazar resolved it in accordance with all of them: If [I must engage in] war, I am coming; if [I must engage in] conciliation, I am coming, if [I must engage in] prayer, I am coming.  “Please my lord [bi adoni]” (Genesis 44:18) – [take] me [bi] and not him [bei] – whether it is to fill water, it is I; for service, it is I; to split logs, it is I. (Judah was telling Joseph that he would be a better servant than Benjamin, and therefore Joseph should take him and not Benjamin. )   Another matter, “Please my lord [bi adoni]” – injustice [baya] you are bringing upon us, my lord, as so you said to us: “Bring him down to me, [and I will set my eye upon him]” (Genesis 44:21); is this the setting of an eye? It is the opposite of what you said: It is blindness of the eye. (You obscured the truth from us.)   Rabbi Simon said: (This statement is an explanation of Judah’s argument that Joseph was acting unjustly in demanding that Benjamin become his slave. )  It is written in our law books: “If he has nothing, he shall be sold for his theft” (Exodus 22:2), but this one has the means to pay.  “May your servant please speak [a word in my lord's ears]” – may my words enter your ears. This one’s grandmother, because Pharaoh abducted her for one night, he and his household were stricken with leprosy, as it is written: “The Lord afflicted Pharaoh [and his household with great afflictions over the matter of Sarai, Abram’s wife]” (Genesis 12:17), take care that this person (A reference to Joseph himself.)  will not be stricken with leprosy. The mother of this one died only due to our father’s curse. You cite it from here: “With whomever you find your gods, he shall not live” (Genesis 31:32); (The midrash understands that due to this statement, uttered by Jacob, Rachel died. )  take care that a curse will not take effect upon you and that man (A reference to Joseph himself.)  will die. Two of us entered a certain city and destroyed it in its entirety. There it was on behalf of a female, here it is on behalf of a male. (Judah suspected that Joseph intended to sexually abuse Benjamin, and considered homosexual abuse to be worse than Shekhem’s abuse of Dina, or Pharoah’s intent to abuse Sarah (Etz Yosef). )  For coming against the apple of [Jacob’s] eye, against the host of the Holy One blessed be He, in whose regard it is stated: “He hovers over him all the day” (Deuteronomy 33:12), (The Sages viewed this verse as an allusion to the fact that the Temple was located in the territory of Benjamin (see Yoma 12a). )  all the more so.  Another matter, “may your servant please speak [yedaber na]…” – Rabbi Yirmeya bar Shemaya said: I will remove something [davar] from within and introduce pestilence [dever] into No, (Another name for Egypt, or the capital city of the Egyptian empire. )  and exterminate you.  Rabbi Ḥanin said: When Judah was filled with rage, the hairs over his heart would rip through his garments and emerge, and he would place chunks of iron in his mouth and expel them as dust.  “As you are like Pharaoh” – just as Pharaoh decrees and does not fulfill, so, too, you decree and do not fulfill. Just as Pharaoh lusts after males, so, too, do you. Just as Pharaoh is king and you are second to him in the land of Egypt, so, too, my father is king in the land of Canaan and I am second to him. If I draw my sword, I will begin with you and conclude with Pharaoh your master. Had he said: ‘I will begin with Pharaoh,’ [Joseph] would have left him alone. Since he said: ‘I will begin with you,’ [Joseph] signaled to Manasseh, who stamped one foot and the entire palace quaked. [Judah] said: ‘This is a stamp from Father’s household.’ (No one but members of Jacob’s family were so powerful. )  When he saw that matters were thus, (When Judah saw he would not be able to overpower Manasseh (Etz Yosef). )  he began speaking gentle words – “my lord asked” (Genesis 44:19).</p>

Another explanation is: you are as unreliable as Pharaoh — just as Pharaoh issues decrees and does not carry them out, makes promises and does not fulfil them, so also do you. Is this what you meant by “setting your eyes” upon him when you said (Genesis 44:21) “Bring him down and I will set mine eyes upon him”?

        <summary>Judah, Ibn Ezra, Rashbam, Sforno, Tur HaArokh, Rabbeinu Bahya, Siftei Chakhamim, Rashi, and Steinsaltz all explain that if Benjamin were to leave his father, his father would die. In the Musar commentary, it is emphasized that standing up against evil is important, even if it means risking one's life. Rashi discusses King Shlomo's age when he became king, and explains that Judah's brothers revealed the truth out of fear of losing another brother. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both translate the statement about Benjamin not leaving his father as indicating that he would die if he did so.</summary>

            <summary>Judah explains that Benjamin cannot leave his father because he is the darling son, and if he were to leave his father, he would die. Ibn Ezra questions why certain verses were not included in a list of ambiguous verses, suggesting that the &quot;he&quot; in &quot;he would die&quot; refers to Jacob. Rashbam and Sforno also explain that if Benjamin leaves his father, his father will die. Tur HaArokh interprets the phrase as meaning that Benjamin would die if separated from his father. Rabbeinu Bahya emphasizes that the life of a father is tied to the life of his son, with Yehudah clarifying this connection in later verses. Siftei Chakhamim questions why Yehudah mentioned leaving his father, while Rashi explains that they feared Benjamin would die on the journey, as his mother had died during travel. Steinsaltz succinctly summarizes the situation, stating that if Benjamin were to leave his father, his father would die.</summary>

I.E. asks, why not. It should be noted that according to Nahmanides’ reading, I.E. explains that the “he” in he would die refers to Jacob. In that case I.E. only questions why Ruth 4:8 is not included in Isi ben Judah’s list.)  not include our verse and And he drew off his shoe (Ruth 4:8) among them.

It is possible that the words refer also to Yaakov dying in the event that Binyamin would not be restored to him. This teaches that the life of a father is tied in some way to the life of his son. Yehudah spelled this out more clearly in verse thirty with the words ונפשו קשורה בנפשו, “his soul is tied to his soul.” This is even clearer in verse thirty-one: “when he sees that the lad is missing he will die;”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND WE SAID UNTO MY LORD: THE LAD CANNOT LEAVE HIS FATHER; FOR IF HE SHOULD LEAVE HIS FATHER, HE WOULD DIE. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained this to mean “and his father would die.” But if so, Judah would have said: “Our father cannot leave his son, for if he should leave his son, he [the father] would die.” Or he should have said, “We cannot bear that the lad leave the father,” for they would not make the plea for compassion for their father dependent upon the lad, [saying, as the verse has it. ‘The lad’ cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father, he would die], since they considered him as a child who did not know the difference between good and evil. [Therefore, if it be as Ibn Ezra says, i.e., that the concern in this verse is lest the father die, they would have said, “We cannot bear that the lad should leave his father,” or “Our father cannot leave his son.”] Rather, the meaning is: The lad cannot leave his father on account of his youth and his being the darling son in the lap of his father who loves him, and if he should leave him and come on the journey the lad would die.</p>

              <p>One who does not perpetuate a dispute against those who stand on a path that is not good, and those that haul in iniquity, is surely punished for their transgressions in all their sins (of the actual sinners); and [also] transgresses a negative commandment - as it is stated (Leviticus 19:17), “and not bear sin because of him..” And it is stated (Hosea 10:9) “You have sinned more, O Israel, than in the days of Gibeah; there they stand; shall they not be overtaken [as] at Gibeah by a war upon scoundrels?” Its explanation is [that] if that generation (of Hosea) was standing there, they would not have overtaken those in Gibeah in war, to destroy the evil, as that generation had overcome [the evildoers of that time] in war. The understanding of “there they stand” is, if they stood there. And likewise “and leave his father” (Genesis 44:22) is, if he left. [This is] meaning to say, that their sin was of the type of sin of Gibeah. However [the earlier generation] was better than these, since they gathered and stood with their lives to destroy the evil. And it is stated (Judges 5:23), “‘Curse Meroz,’ said the angel of the Lord; ‘Bitterly curse its inhabitants, because they came not to the aid of the Lord, to the aid of the Lord among the warriors.” And it is stated (Deuteronomy 1:17), “do not fear in front of a man.” And anyone who is for God, may He be blessed, should give over his life for the sanctification of God, as it is stated (Exodus 32:26), “‘Whoever is for the Lord, come to me’; and all the Levites gathered to him.” And it is [also] stated (Numbers 25:7), “And Phinheas saw, etc. and he took a spear in his hand.” And it is an obligation on all that fear [God] - even if he is one that loves pureness of heart - to arouse zealotry when he sees that behold, the officers and the prefects are in trespass, as it is stated (Ezra 9:2), “and it was the hand of the officers and prefects who were in this trespass first.”</p>

              <p>A small lad. He was twelve years old. And this is how [his age] is calculated: “And he called his name Yedidyah.” (II Shmuel 12:25.)  At the same time Amnon raped Tamar, as it is stated, “And it was after this, and Avsholom [the son of Dovid] had a sister.” (Ibid., 13:1.)  At the end of, “two years, and Avsholom had sheep shearers,” (Ibid. v. 23.)  and he killed Amnon. Avsholom fled and went to Geshur, and he remained there three years, (Ibid. v. 38.)  so we have five years. Avsholom then returned to Yerusholayim, “and [Avsholom] lived in Yerusholayim two years,” (Ibid. 14:28.)  so we have seven [years in the life] of Shlomo. And he [Avsholom] rebelled against his father and was killed. After this, [it states], “And there was famine in the days of Dovid [for] three years,” (Ibid. 21:1.)  so we have ten [years]. In the eleventh [year] he counted the [Bnei] Yisroel, “and they scattered in all the land,” (Ibid 24:8.)  nine months. In the year of his death he instituted divisions as it is stated, “In the fortieth year of Dovid’s reign they were sought,” (I Divrei Hayomim 26:31.)  so we have twelve [years in the life] of King Shlomo. (Other, including Abarbanel, suggest that Shlomo may have been around twenty years old at the time. The fact that he is referred to as a “lad ]=נער]” is not necessarily a reflection of his age, for in Bereishis 44:22, Binyomin is described as a “lad [=נער]”at the age of thirty.) </p>

Why did you need to ask if we have a father? Did we desire to marry your daughters? Judah said to Joseph. You went at us only with accusations. Why would you ask about our father or brothers? Because you asked about our father and brothers, we told you the truth that we have a father and a small brother, and that one brother was lost. (Rashi, Genesis, 44:19.)  In the previous portion they said that one brother was lost. The explanation is that the brothers were now afraid that they lost a brother. Perhaps Joseph would say, search for him and bring him here. Therefore, the brothers said: we learned that one brother died. (Rashi, Genesis, 44:20.)  We have told you that if the youth would be removed from his father, the father would die of anguish and also the youth.  (Rashi, Genesis, 44:22.) </p>

              <p>Chapter (75) 76: Torah  [1] &quot;Then Judah approached him&quot; (Genesis 44:18). And scriptures say this: &quot;Have we not all one Father? [Did not one God create us? Why do we break faith with one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?]&quot; (Malachi 2:10). &quot;We, your twelve servants, are brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan&quot; (Genesis 42:13). Not like the tents of the measure of mercy, nor like the Egyptians who bow down to every kind of idolatry, as it was said in the tribes of Egypt, &quot;and do not defile yourselves [with the fetishes of Egypt]&quot; (Ezekiel 20:7). But we trust in only one God who created us, as it is said, &quot;Did not one God create us?&quot; (Malachi 2:10). So why would one betray his brother? As it is said, &quot;Why should you betray us, by secretly keeping the money you found in our sacks?&quot; (Genesis 44:8). And you accuse us of theft, as it is said, &quot;The man who found the cup&quot; (Genesis 44:17). We violate the covenant that the Lord made with our forefathers, and not only that, but the laws that we have made among ourselves. As it is said, &quot;If you are honest, leave one of your brothers here in prison&quot; (Genesis 42:19). And you said, &quot;Bring your youngest brother&quot; (Genesis 44:23). Our father did not ask for it, yet we complied with his request, as it is said, &quot;If I don't bring him back to you, I'll be guilty forever&quot; (Genesis 43:9). And you say, &quot;The man who found the cup&quot; (Genesis 44:17). So where is the covenant that the Lord gave us in His Torah, saying, &quot;Do not oppress one another&quot; (Leviticus 25:17), and &quot;You shall not work your brother like a slave&quot; (Leviticus 25:39)? Why then would one betray his brother? (Malachi 2:10).</p>

              <p>וחציו ימחץ AND PIERCE THEM THROUGH WITH HIS ARROWS — Onkelos translated this as meaning, the חצים of the adversaries, taking it in the sense of “their postion of land”, similar to (Genesis 44:23) בעלי חצים, which he translated by מרי פלנותא “those who part (differ) from him”. So, too, according to the Targum ימחץ denotes “dividing” having the same meaning as in (Judges 5:26): “She divided (מחצה) and struck through his temples”. The meaning therefore is, that they will divide amongst themselves their (the adversaries’) land (Hence the translation of Onkelos: “they shall take possession of their land”). — But it can also be explained as meaning חצים literally (i.e., arrows): the arrows of the Holy One, blessed be He, He will ימחץ in the blood of the adversaries — i.e., he will dip and thus dye the arrows in their blood. Similar is, (Psalms 68:24) “In order that thou mayest colour thy foot (תמחץ) by the blood”. However, even in this sense it does not lose the usual meaning of “wounding”, as in (Deuteronomy 32:39): “I wound (מחצתי)”, for what is dyed by blood, looks as though it were wounded and stricken.</p>

Judah said that immediately upon coming to their father, they told him that they will not see the ruler’s face again without their younger brother, but he refused to send him, and would have left Simeon to him in his prison. This is the meaning of the verse, And our father said: Go again, buy us a little food, (Verse 25 here.)  for he did not consent to send Benjamin in spite of all we said, until forced to by the famine.</p>

              <p>“Joseph fell upon his father’s face, wept upon him, and kissed him” (Genesis 50:1).   “Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father. The physicians embalmed Israel” (Genesis 50:2).  “Joseph fell…Joseph commanded his servants” – why did Joseph die before his brothers? Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] and the Rabbis, Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said: Because he embalmed his father. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Was I not able to preserve My righteous one? Did I not say to him: “Do not fear [ti’re’i], worm of Jacob” (Isaiah 41:14) – worm, do not see [tiri] Jacob?’ (God had decided to ensure that Jacob’s body would not decay, so it was unnecessary for Joseph to embalm him. )  The Rabbis say: It was he [Jacob] who commanded them to embalm him. That is what is written: “His sons did to him [just as he commanded them]” (Genesis 50:12). According to the opinion of Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi], it works out well. (It is understood why Joseph died before his brothers. )  According to the opinion of the Rabbis, [it is because] almost five times, Judah said: “Your servant, my father, your servant, my father” and Joseph heard and remained silent. (On four occasions, Judah referred to Jacob as Joseph’s servant, and Joseph remained silent: Genesis 44:24, 27, 30, 31. Additionally, on one occasion (Genesis 43:28) it is stated that the brothers referred to Jacob in this way in speaking to Joseph, although it is not explicitly stated that it was Judah who said it. ) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>(Gen. 46:28:) NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM UNTO JOSEPH TO TEACH BEFORE HIM. (This interpretation is assumed in the midrash.)  What is the meaning of &lt; TO TEACH BEFORE HIM &gt;? R. Nehemiah said: To establish an academy for him where he would teach Torah so that the tribes might study Torah. (Gen. R. 95:3; Tanh., Gen. 11:11; also Gen. R. 94:3.)  You know that this is so; &lt; for &gt;, when Joseph had left him, Jacob knew at what chapter he had left him because he had taught him. When Joseph's brothers came and said to him (in Gen. 44:26): JOSEPH IS STILL ALIVE &lt; … &gt; HIS HEART GREW FAINT, because he did not believe it, as stated (ibid.): FOR HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM. Jacob recalled at what chapter Joseph had left him. He said to them: Did he give you a sign (Gk.: semeion.)  &lt; indicating &gt; at what chapter Joseph left me? Jacob said in his heart: I know that he left me at the chapter on the heifer ('GLH, i.e., Deut. 21:1-9). He said to them: Say at what chapter he left me, and I will believe you. Joseph also recalled at what chapter he had left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons ('GLH in the singular), as stated (in Gen. 45:21): SO JOSEPH GAVE THEM WAGONS. &lt; This verse is &gt; to teach you that in every place that he went he was busy at Torah, just as his ancestors had been, even though the Torah had not yet been given. Ergo, it is written of Abraham (in Gen. 26:5): AND HE KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS. From where did Abraham learn the Torah? R. Simeon ben Johay says: &lt; His &gt; two kidneys became like two full vessels which spouted forth Torah. And where is it shown? Where it says so (in Ps. 16:17): EVEN IN THE NIGHTS MY KIDNEYS ADMONISH ME. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Jonathan ben Eleazar Ish haBirah: Our father Abraham even knew the eruvim of cooked foods. (See above, 3:14; also 3:1.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): BECAUSE ('QB 'ShR) ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE, &lt; AND KEPT MY CHARGE &gt;…. Now at the age of three Abraham recognized his Creator, as stated (through the first word of this verse): 'QB (with a numerical value of 172). Since all the days of Abraham were one hundred and seventy-five, from here (Gen. 26:5) you learn (by simple subtraction) that at the age of three he had recognized him and that he was even keeping the fine points of Torah. He also taught his children, as stated (in Gen. 18:19): FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &lt; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD, TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE &gt;…. The Holy One said to him: You have taught your children Torah in this world, but in the world to come I in my glory will teach them the Torah, as stated (in Is. 54:13): AND ALL YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE TAUGHT BY THE LORD, AND GREAT SHALL BE YOUR CHILDREN'S PROSPERITY.</p>

This distinction was important in justifying Judah's concern for Benjamin's safety.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>ילדה לי אשתי, “my wife bore for me.” The Torah should really have written “Rachel bore for me.” However, the point Yehudah made was that he too was aware that Yaakov had considered only Rachel his true wife, seeing that he had served Lavan for Rachel and not for Leah. His marrying Leah had been a totally unwilling act on his part. Yaakov’s true wife had borne him only two children one of whom had disappeared. His love for these two was therefore exceptional. If you will search the Bible you will find that Rachel’s name always precedes that of Leah though Leah was the older of the two. Even in the Book of Ruth, where the townsfolk of Bethlehem congratulate Boaz on taking Ruth as a wife, they phrase their blessing in these words: “may she become like Rachel and Leah who built up the house of Israel.” There are numerous other verses in all of which Rachel is mentioned before her older sister.</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 44:27:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>YE KNOW THAT MY WIFE BORE ME TWO SONS. If we say [that Jacob’s intention was to point out] that Benjamin is the only one left to his mother, why is this a reason [for his saying that if some harm will befall him] it will bring down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave? (Verse 29 here.)  After all, he has many sons and grandchildren, and Benjamin’s mother has already died, and she would no longer weep over him in Jacob’s presence. The meaning of the verse, however, is that Jacob took only Rachel as a wife on his own initiative. This is the sense of the words, my wife bore me: “for from a woman that was my wife of my own will there have been only two sons born to me, and I have bestowed my love upon them as if they were my only ones, the rest being to me as if they were children of concubines. And with his brother Joseph dead, this one alone is my only son whom I have loved.” It is for this reason that Scripture mentions Rachel before Leah: Like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; (Ruth 4:11.)  And he called Rachel and Leah to the field. (Above, 31:4.)  Rachel took precedence in his mind. The commentators (See Rashi further 46:19.)  have said that the reason why Scripture in this Seder says, The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife, (Further, 46:19.)  is that she is called his wife in truth, without any deception. In my opinion, however, this is because Rachel is mentioned there among the handmaids, as I have already so mentioned. (Above, 31:33 and 37:2. Ramban agrees with the principle as he himself explains it in connection with the verse above, 31:4. However, he points out that in the verse further, 46:19, the term, Jacob’s wife, is independently justified.) </p>

[they had described themselves as 12 brothers, all the sons of the same father. The loss of one, or even two, would not appear to Joseph as such a catastrophe. When he would hear that the dead brother and Binyamin were the only ones from their mother, he would begin to better understand the trauma involved. Ed] The word אשתי was meant to make a clear distinction between פילגשי, “my concubine.” </p>

              <p>And yet, Benjamin was innocent of theft or deception. He did not steal Joseph’s goblet. He was not part of the sale of Joseph, either. He was the clean-handed, pure son of Jacob and Rachel – and Judah, mastermind of the sale of Joseph, stepped in to take full responsibility for Benjamin’s welfare. From his oath to Jacob, “I personally will guarantee him,” (Genesis 33:9.)  to his acknowledgement before Joseph of the special relationship Jacob would always have with Rachel, Joseph, and Benjamin, (When Judah declared before Joseph, “Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons’” (Genesis 44:27), he acknowledged the love that Jacob had for Rachel, Joseph, and Benjamin over and against Leah, the maidservants, and their offspring – including himself.)

              <p>Here was the transformation of Judah. He rectified his earlier flaws: he protected his kin, he embraced accountability, he obligated himself beyond his own individual interest. Beyond even that, Judah demonstrated his commitment to and love for his father and family that were so deep that personal hurt ceased to matter at all. Consider the words he put into his father’s mouth: “My wife bore me two sons” (Genesis 44:27). This open acknowledgment was a matter-of-fact acceptance that Rachel and her sons were the principals to Jacob, and that he, Judah, would always run second place in his father’s affections. Effective leadership is found in one who can accurately assess and accept reality, and then adjust his vision and strategy to that reality. With his finessing of both Jacob and Joseph, Judah emerged the monarch. (The nofech (emerald, or turquoise) was chosen as the stone representing Judah to symbolize this essential trait. Judah turned green with embarrassment upon admitting his sin with Tamar, so his stone shone green as a testament to this admirable virtue (Rabbenu Baĥya, Exodus 28:17).) </p>

                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 30:1:4</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>The ten rulers referred to are the ten brothers of Joseph, since it is written, &quot;Ten of the brothers went down.&quot; They could have laid Egypt waste with their strength, but Joseph vanquished them with his wisdom. Since man is forced to sojourn on this earth although he has been provided with a soul by G-d, it is fitting that his fate be similar to the fate of other strangers in this world. Due to the soul's celestial antecedents, plus the fact that man was created in G-d’s image, his place should not really be down here on earth, but his natural habitat should be near the Almighty Himself. This is what David says in Psalms 119,19, &quot;Do not hide Your commandments from me, because I am a stranger on this earth.&quot; It is natural for man to keep his intimate secrets from those whom he considers of inferior status. David pleads with G-d in Psalm 55,14 not to keep His secrets from him, because he is aware that his place of abode is so inferior. Also in Psalms 39,13, he pleads that though he may have become estranged from G-d through some of his deeds, G-d should not turn away from his supplication, since at least his ancestry is so superior. The reason that ordinary man, i.e. the one who does not constantly advance towards moral and spiritual perfection, is called am ha-aretz, people of the earth, is precisely because he has made the &quot;lower&quot; world his permanent home instead of treating it like the foyer to a far superior world (Avot 4,21). This world is reserved for those who preserve the Divine image in which they were created. Because our world is merely a foyer to the ultimate palace reserved for us, it is only natural that during our stay on this earth we must submit to the indignities usually reserved for aliens everywhere. The two major areas in which aliens are disadvantaged while far from home are A) They cannot claim the respect due them as they would in their native society, and B) they have to perform work unbefitting the dignity of their real status in order to earn their livelihood. Jeremiah already compares G-d as not insisting on the respect due Him, since He is in exile when His people are in exile (Jeremiah 14,8). &quot;Why should You be a stranger on earth, like a guest requiring lodging, when Your name is proclaimed with us?&quot; The meaning there is &quot;Since You are not a stranger, and since You have existed from time immemorial, if You do not help us as our Savior, You will be considered like a man without recourse, like a disabled hero.&quot; This too is the line Moses took when he argued that people will comment on the demise of the Jewish people as evidence of the inability of G-d to overcome the Canaanites (Numbers 14,13-17). When our sages advise a person who is unable to master his passions to go to a place where he is unknown (Chagigah 16), they want to prevent the sin to be committed to fall into the category of chilul hashem, desecration of the holy name of G-d, something that it is impossible to atone for in this life. When a stranger is observed committing a sin, this does not influence the society of the place in which the sin is committed, since nobody pays the stranger any heed anyways. If the same sin were committed in one's hometown, others may use it as an excuse to do likewise, and the chilul hashem is beyond recall. The second major indignity suffered by strangers is their inability to converse in the language of that country, thereby making themselves laughingstocks and misfits in the new society they find themselves in. Even if in order to earn some money one subjects oneself to such indignities by becoming a stranger in a foreign land, since one has no guarantee that one will return home with a sizable fortune, what guarantee is there that even if the money has been earned, it will endure (see example of Rabbi Eleazar ben Charsum in Yuma 35)? Forsaking preoccupation with the acquisition of permanent wealth, namely Torah knowledge, cannot be justified. Our purpose in this world is to prepare ourselves for the world to come. It follows that those who demean themselves by unnecessary preoccupation with the acquisition of material wealth, demean the &quot;palace&quot; in favor of the &quot;foyer.&quot; When the Midrash comments on the words Vayeshev Yaakov, that if a person of the caliber of Jacob wanted to live serenely on this earth, Satan interfered, the meaning is quite plain. A tzaddik who demonstrates too much interest in material wealth and pleasure in this world imperils his standing as a tzaddik and invites yissurim, painful tribulations, to remind him of the error of his ways. This is what the Midrash meant when it says one cannot demand the &quot;goodies&quot; of both worlds. &quot;Peace&quot; is real only in the other world, as indicated by the promise to Abraham, &quot;And you will join your fathers in peace&quot; (Genesis 15,15). The yissurim, afflictions, make its recipient realize that his presence on this earth is comparable to that of a persecuted stranger. Jacob's experiences are a perfect example of this analysis. The disappearance of Joseph, the rape of Dinah, the famine, the apparent loss of Shimon, the threatened loss of Benjamin, all combined to bring home that truth. Unless Jacob was a stranger on this earth whose rightful abode was in the celestial regions, how could we account for all the indignities he had to suffer? The second disadvantage we have mentioned as being suffered by aliens in a country not their own, the language problem, is also relevant when we view man's temporary stay on earth. As a rule, speech is used to articulate man's physical needs, i.e. food and drink etc., or to put it more crudely, to communicate those of his needs that he shares with the animal kingdom to others. Whenever mere language does not suffice to assure him of his needs, he resorts to violence, i.e. a call to arms: (Proverbs 18,6) &quot;The lips of the fools engage in quarrels, his mouth calls for turbulence.&quot; Their very language becomes an instrument of violence. Jeremiah 18,18 illustrates this point further: &quot;Let us smite him by means of language!&quot; Wisdom, however, is superior to violence and to instruments of war and strife (Kohelet 9,16). When speech is employed to express the spiritual yearnings of man, it does not become an instrument of war or a means of animalistic gratification. When Solomon says, &quot;Do not answer the fool according to his foolishness; answer the fool in accordance with his folly!&quot; this means, &quot;Do not use the power of speech to answer the fool on his own level, but use the power of speech so that even a fool can recognize his folly (Proverbs 26,5). The ox is the animal that uses its brute strength to work hard uncomplainingly. Joseph had to suffer many indignities in the early part of his life, such as the brothers' jealousy, the Midianite slave merchants, Potiphar's wife's accusations etc. Nevertheless, he proved his moral superiority in his encounter with his master's wife. This moral superiority which he demonstrated when it clearly hurt his chances of a continued career (when he refused the advances of his master's wife), was richly rewarded by G-d, who alone was aware of the pure motives which had governed Joseph's behavior throughout. Joseph's ability to control his carnal urges made him a paragon of virtue. The Talmud Shabbat 63 says that whoever fulfills one single mitzvah completely, wholeheartedly, will not receive evil tidings. He will not need to worry about receiving bad news, but can enjoy undisturbed confidence that G-d’s personal Providence will remain at his side. Joseph's strength, i.e. the ox's strength, lay in the certainty that his cause was righteous, not in his ability to pull heavy loads. The lion, on the other hand, represents mere physical prowess. The brothers, in being described as &quot;rulers&quot; are conceived as having made themselves at home here on earth, not being content with remaining aliens, the purpose of man's sojourn on this globe. For this reason, then, Joseph representing the inner strength of a man of spiritual values, was able to overcome the combined strength of his brothers who had threatened to destroy Egypt failing release of their brother Benjamin. </p>

              <p>Concluding its discussion of the halakhot of prayer, the mishna discusses less practical aspects of prayer. One who prays and realizes that he erred in his prayer, it is a bad omen for him; it indicates to him that his prayer was not accepted. And if he who erred is the communal prayer leader, it is a bad omen for those who sent him, because a person’s agent has legal status equivalent to his own. On a similar note, they said about Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa that he would pray on behalf of the sick and immediately after his prayer he would say: This one shall recover from his illness and live and this one shall die. When they said to him: From where do you know? He said to them: If my prayer is fluent in my mouth as I recite it and there are no errors, I know that my prayer is accepted. And if not, I know that my prayer is rejected.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ACH’ (BUT) ON THE TENTH DAY OF THIS SEVENTH MONTH IS THE DAY OF ATONEMENT. “All expressions in the Torah of ach (but) and rak (only) indicate limiting qualifications, [and here the word ach indicates that the Day of Atonement] effects atonement ‘only’ for those who repent, but it does not effect atonement for those who do not repent.” This is Rashi’s language on the basis of the words of our Rabbis. (Shebuoth 13 a.)  And if so, the explanation of the verse is that on the first day of this month [Tishri] there will be for all of you a day of memorial of ‘t’ruah (Above, Verse 24.)  [a blowing of the quavering sound which signifies judgment], for you will all be judged then before Him, but for some of you [i.e., those who repent] there will be on the tenth day of this month a day of atonement. Thus the meaning of the word ach is like that of bilvad (“only,” “alone”). Similarly, Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my son ‘ach’ (only) this once. (Exodus 10:17.)  So also, ‘harak ach b’Moshe’ (Numbers 12:2.)  means “has He indeed spoken ‘only’ with Moses?” Likewise, ‘Ach’ on the fifteenth day of the seventh month (Further, Verse 39.)  means “only on the fifteenth day [of Tishri] ye shall keep the feast of the Eternal seven days, (Further, Verse 39.)  not consecutively,” for the Festival-offering [brought by the individual] (This is the Festival peace-offering which one is obliged to bring when making the pilgrimage to the Sanctuary three times in the year (see “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 60-61).)  does not override the Sabbath [and therefore it cannot mean seven days consecutively]. In the same way you are to explain [the word ach] in all the commandments, in accordance with the tradition of our Rabbis. Similarly, ‘ach’ he is torn in pieces (Genesis 44:28.)  means [that Jacob said] that nothing else [could have happened to Joseph] except that he was torn in pieces. So also, For the children of Israel and the children of Judah ‘ach’ have done that which was evil in My sight from their youth; for the children of Israel have ‘ach’ provoked Me, (Jeremiah 32:30.)  means that they have done nothing else. But by way of the plain meaning of Scripture the word ach means achein (“surely”), [a word which is used] to authenticate something, [as in the following expressions]: ‘achein’ (surely) the thing is known; (Exodus 2:14.)  ‘achein’ (surely) ye shall die like men. (Psalms 82:7.)  And here it means, “Surely on the tenth day of the seventh month is the day of atonement,” the expression constituting a [Divine] assurance on the authenticity of the matter, Scripture stating: “On the first day of the month is the day of judgment, but indeed on the tenth of the month is the day of atonement, therefore you shall afflict your souls, and you shall do no manner of work.” Similarly, ‘ach’ (surely) thou art my bone and my flesh; (Genesis 29:14.)  ‘ach’ (surely) it is the king of Israel; (I Kings 22:32.)  ‘ach’ (surely) G-d is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart. (Psalms 73:1.)  So also is the meaning of the verse, ‘ach’ ye shall keep My Sabbaths (Exodus 31:13.)  which declares: “Now I have commanded you concerning the work of the Tabernacle, but surely My Sabbaths you shall keep forever.” So also in all cases [where the word ach is mentioned] it may be explained to you in this way, if you will understand them.</p>

That is, “if harm befall him as it did to his brother Joseph, you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.” Perhaps the expression, and ‘ason’ (harm) befall him, means that it will so happen to him on account of his being young and tender and not accustomed to travel on the road, this being analogous to what Jacob said above, Lest ‘ason’ (harm) should befall him, (Ibid., 42:4.)  for the meaning of the word ason is accidental death, such as those killed by a human or a wild beast or the change of air on the road.</p>

              <p>As long as he is beside me I find comfort through him. Rashi is answering the question: Why is it written here that on account of Binyomin [Yaakov said], “You will bring my white head down to the grave in evil,” whereas in 37:35 it is written [that Yaakov said] a similar phrase on account of Yoseif? It is written there, “I will go down to the grave mourning for my son [Yoseif].” Rashi answers: Because of Yoseif, they indeed had already brought Yaakov down to the grave in mourning. But now, “As long [as Binyomin is beside me I find comfort through him].” Alternatively, Rashi is answering the question: Why would Yaakov be more sorrowful for Binyomin than for Rochel, Yoseif or Shimon? </p>

              <p>Of his mother and his brother. You might ask: How does Rashi know that it refers also to Rochel, when she is not mentioned in the verses? The answer is: It is written (v. 27), “Two sons were born to me by my wife [Rochel].” This conveys, “Two sons were born to me from her, and she is my wife” — i.e., she especially is my wife, [more than Leah]. This is because Yaakov lived mainly with Rochel. This verse implies that he mourned for Rochel but was comforted through Yoseif. And when Yoseif died, leaving Binyomin, he was comforted through him for both. “And if he dies, it will seem to me as if all three died the same day.” But it seems to me that [the answer is:] It is written here, “You will bring my white head down to the grave in evil,” whereas in 42:38 it [merely] is written, “You will bring my white head down to the grave in sorrow.” Accordingly, Yaakov was saying: until now I found comfort for the loss of his mother. But now I will no longer be comforted for her, thus I will go down in evil to the grave. This is because Chazal say (Yevamos 62b): “He who is without a wife is without good.” Consequently, he is with evil. (Maharshal) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>80. The Rabbi: It is said that it is done in order to arouse natural heat. My personal belief is that it stands in connexion with the subject under discussion. As it often happened that many persons read at the same time, it was possible that ten or more read from one volume. This is the reason why our books are so large. Each of them was obliged to bend down in his turn in order to read a passage, and to turn back again. This resulted in a continual bending and sitting up, the book lying on the ground. This was one reason. Then it became a habit through constant seeing, observing and imitating, which is in man's nature. Other people read each out of his own book, either bringing it near to his eyes, or, if he pleased, bending down to it without inconveniencing his neighbour. There was, therefore, no necessity of bending and sitting up. We will now discuss the importance of the accents, the orthographic value of the seven principal vowel signs, the grammatical accuracy resulting from them as well as from the distinction between Qāmeṣ, Pataḥ, Ṣērē and Sēgōl. They influence the meaning of grammatical forms and assist in distinguishing between past and future tenses e.g., ‏שַׁמתִּי‎ and ‏ושַׁמְתִּי‎ and ‏וַאֲבָרְכֵהוּ‎ and ‏וְאַבָרְכֵהוּ‎. (Isaiah 51:2, and Genesis 27:33); or between a verb and an adjective, e.g. ‏חָכַם and ‏חָכָם; between the interrogative Hē and the article, as in ‏הָעוֹלָה הִיא לִמָעְלָה ‎(Ecclesiastes 3:21), and other cases. The euphony and structure of speech is increased by the sequence of two vowelless consonants, which enables a whole congregation to read Hebrew simultaneously without mistakes. Other rules apply to the musical accents. For the vowel sounds are divided in Hebrew into three classes, viz. U-sound, A-sound, and I-sound; or in another division: great U-sound, or Qāmeṣ, medium U-sound, or Ḥōlem; little U-sound, or Shūreq; great A-sound, or Pataḥ; little A-sound or Sēgōl; great I-sound or Sērē; little I-sound, or Ḥīreq. Shewā is sounded with all these [vowels] under certain conditions. It is vowel absolute, because any addition would require a vowelless consonant to follow. Qāmeṣ is followed by a long closed syllable, but not by dāgēsh in the first form Dagēsh can only follow, if demanded by the exigencies of the second or third forms, the syllable being long, by one of the vowel letters alef or hē, as in ‏ברא‎ and ‏קנה‎. A syllable of this kind can also end in a vowelless consonant, as in ‏קאם‎ (Hosea 10:14). Ḥōlem also can be followed by a vowel letter which is wāw or alef as in ‏לא‎ and ‏לו‎, or a syllable of this kind can be closed by a consonant as ‏שׁור‎ and ‏שׂמׂאל‎. The vowel letters after Ṣērē are alef or yōd as in ‏יוצא‎ and ‏יוצאי‎. Hē, however, only in the second form, but not in the first. Shūreq is free for all three forms. It can be followed by a vowel letter, or dāgēsh, or vowelless consonant. Its long vowel is expressed by wāw only as, ‏לו‎, ‏ללון‎ and ‏לֻקח‎. Ḥīreq follows the rule of Shūreq as in ‏לין‎, ‏לי‎ and ‏לבי‎. Pataḥ, and Sēgōl are not followed by a vowel letter in the first form, but are lengthened by the second form, either for the sake of emphasis, or on account of the accent, or in the pause at the end of a sentence. The rules of the first form are obtained by considering the formation of each word separately, without any relation to the construction of the sentence with its variety of combination and separation, and long and short words. Then are obtained the seven principal vowels in their original, unchanged form and the simple Shewā without qa’yā. The second form deals with euphony in the construction of sentences. Occasionally elements of the first form are altered to please the second. The third form concerns the accents, and sometimes reacts on both preceding ones. In the first form three consecutive vowels without an intervening consonant or dāgesh are possible, but three, or more, short vowels may follow each other as in Arabic. This, however, is impossible in the second form. As soon as three vowels follow each other in the first form, the second one lengthens one of them to the quantity of a long vowel as in ‏משבָני‎, ‏לשבֵני‎, ‏רצפת‎ (Psalms 21:12; Esther 1:6). For Hebrew does not allow three consecutive vowels, except when a consonant is either repeated as in ‏שררך‎ (Song of Songs 7:3), or in the case of gutturals as in ‏נהרי‎ and ‏נחלי‎, the reader being at liberty to read [the first syllable] long or short. In the same way the first form allows the sequence of two long closed syllables. The second form, however, to prevent clumsiness of speech, shortens one long syllable as in ‏שמתי‎ and ‏ושמתי‎. It is obvious that the pronunciation of ‏פעל‎ and similar forms is contrary to its vocalisation, the second syllable being lengthened in spite of the Pataḥ, whilst the first is read short in spite of the Qāmeṣ. The heightening of the second syllable is due to the tone, but not to make it slightly longer. Words as ‏אמר-לי‎ and ‏עשה-לי‎ (Genesis 20:5; Genesis 21:6) remain therefore in the first form, because the smaller word has the tone. We also find ‏פָעָל‎ with two Qāmeṣ though in the past tense. The cause of this is to be found in the athnaḥ or sōf pāsūq, and we say that this is possible in the second form on account of the pause. We follow this up till we find even ‏פָעָל‎ with two Qāmeṣ and zāqēf. The reason of this we find in a virtual pause, the word being entitled to athnaḥ or sōf pāsūq, but other cogent reasons made athnaḥ and sōf pāsūq in this case impossible. On the other hand we find these two accents with two pataḥs, however strange this may be, e.g. ‏ויאמַר‎, ‏וזקנתי‎, ‏ותשברנה‎, ‏וַיִּלַךָ‎. The reason of pataḥ in ‏ויאמר‎ is found in examining its meaning, as it cannot stand in pause, and is necessarily connected with the following complement of the sentence There are only a few exceptions as ‏כאשר אָמָר‎, (Genesis 21:1), because the verb completes the sentence logically, and can take Qāmeṣ because of the pause. As regards, however, ‏וילך‎ and ‏ותשברנה‎, they should originally be ‏ויֵלֵך‎ and ‏ותשבֵרנה‎; but the transformation of the I-sound with great Pataḥ, without any intermediate element, was too awkward, and therefore Pataḥ stepped in. The form ‏זקנתי‎ belongs probably to the same class, because the root is ‏זָקֵן‎, the Ṣērē being changed into Pataḥ at the end of a sentence. We marvel why the ‏פֶעֶל‎ forms have the accent on the first syllable which is read long, although it has Sēgōl. We must, however, consider that, if the first syllable remained short, Hebrew phonology would require the second syllable to be read long and with accent, and a slight quiescent would creep in between the second and third radicals. This would be inelegant, which is not the case in the first syllable, which must have this quiescent and has also room for it. This lengthening of the penultima corresponds to ‏פֶן עֶל‎, but not to ‏פָן עֱל‎. For when the word has athnaḥ, or sōf pāsūq, it is ‏פָעֶל‎ corresponding to ‏פָאן עֶל‎. This shows the necessity of lengthening the vowel in ‏שַמתי‎ and ‏שָמתי‎. We consider forms like ‏שער‎ and ‏נער‎ likewise strange, because the Pataḥ of the first syllable is read long. We soon discover, however, that they are ‏פֶעֶל‎ forms with Pataḥ on account of the guttural. For this reason they undergo no change in the status constructus, as do ‏נהר‎ and ‏קהל‎ (Genesis 15:18; Exodus 12:6), which are formed like ‏דָבָר‎. Then we find ‏אעשה‎, ‏יעשה‎, ‏אבנה‎ and ‏אקנה‎ with Sēgōl and vowel letters. If we consider the first instance, we find it to be a form ‏אפעל‎, ‏יפעל‎, the second radical not being long, but always forming a closed syllable with Pataḥ. We are now to read ‏אעשֶה‎ instead of Pataḥ, because no A-sound can precede a silent hē, unless it be Qāmeṣ. Qāmeṣ is long, whilst the second radical of a verb can never have a long vowel, except when read with a vowel, or when followed by Alef as in ‏אצֵא‎. It is for this reason that ‏אעשׂה‎ is read with Sēgōl which is the shortest vowel imaginable, but interchanges with Ṣērē when the second form requires to replace the one by the other at the ends of sentences. There is almost no necessity for the hē of ‏אעשה‎ except in the pause or with the accent, and is eased by dāgesh as in ‏אעשה-לך‎ and ‏אבנה-לי‎, (Exodus 33:5), in which cases the hē has no function. This is not the case [with ‏א‎] in ‏אצא‎, ‏אבא‎. In ‏בא-לי‎, there is no dāgesh, the ‏א‎ being preceded by Ṣērē and being a radical. Hē, however, is considered to be so weak that it is both graphically and phonetically omitted in ‏ויבן‎, ‏ויקן‎ and ‏ויעש‎. How could it, then, close a syllable vocalized by Ṣērē? It was, therefore, left to Sēgōl, the slightest vowel, at all events, in the first form. The second form changed it into Sērē, when standing in pause. It appears likewise strange that ‏מראה‎, ‏מעשה‎, ‏מקנה‎ and similar forms have Ṣērē in the construct state, but Sēgōl in the absolute. We should think the reverse to be correct. But if we consider that the third radical, viz. a silent Hē is treated as altogether absent, and those nouns have the forms of ‏מרא‎, ‏מעש‎, ‏מקן‎, nothing but Sēgōl will serve till some circumstances bring it out with a long vowel as in ‏מראֵה‎, ‏מעשֵה‎, ‏מראיהן‎ and ‏מעשיהן‎. Sēgōl becomes Ṣērē to take the place of [small] Pataḥ in ‏מראֵם‎ and ‏מעשׁםֵ‎. Words of the first form can be altered by the second as to the vowels, but not as to the pronunciation. The word ‏בן‎ has Sērē in the absolute state, Sēgōl in the construct. Occasionally the latter is lengthened by the tone as in ‏בן-יאיר‎ (Esther 2:5) with the Sēgōl of the first form In other cases the tone precipitates it, although it has Ṣērē according to the first form, as in ‏בן אחר‎ (Genesis 30:24). In segolate forms with the accent on the last syllable Sērē is no longer perplexing. The author of this profound science held secrets which are unknown to us. We may have discovered some by means of which he intended to stimulate our investigation as we have said above, with regard to ‏העולה היא למעלה‎. Or we might find out the rules of distinguishing between past and future, infinitive and participle of the passive voice, e.g. ‏נאסָף אל עמי‎ (Genesis 44:29), with Qāmeṣ, and כאשר נאסַף‎ (Numbers 27:13) with Pataḥ. The masoretic text vocalizes three times ‏וישהָט‎ (Levitcus 8:15, Levitcus 8:19, Levitcus 8:23), with Qāmeṣ, although syntactically speaking the words stand only virtually in pause. There are many instances that the Sēgōl after Zarqā has the force of Athnaḥ, or sōf pāsūq, or Zākēf, causing an alteration of the first form. If I wished to enlarge an the subject, the book would become too lengthy. I only desired to give thee a taste of this profound study, which is not built on hap-hazard, but on fixed rules.</p>

              <p>And God said unto Jacob: “Arise, go up to Beth-El” (Gen. 35:1). May our master teach us: How many times is a man’s “account book” (The heavenly ledger wherein man’s deeds are recorded.)  open? Thus did our masters teach us: A man’s account book is opened three times: when he journeys alone upon a highway; when he resides in a dilapidated house; when he vows and fails to fulfill. R. Aha the son of Jacob deduced the first statement from the biblical verse If harm befall him by the way (Gen. 42:3). R. Eliezer the son of R. Yosé the Galilean stated: If you should discover that a righteous man is setting out on a journey, leave even three days earlier or three days later in order to travel with him. But if you should see a wicked man setting out on a journey, leave three days earlier or three days later in order not to go with him, as it is said: Set thou a wicked man over him; and let an adversary stand at his right hand (Ps. 109:6). A righteous man, however, is accompanied by angels of peace, as it is said: For He will give his angels charge over thee (ibid. 91:11).</p>

            <summary>The word &quot;ason&quot; means mischief, evil, harm, calamity, or disaster, and is used in the context of Jacob's reluctance to let Benjamin go with his brothers to Egypt in the story of Joseph. Jacob fears that if Benjamin meets with disaster, it will bring him great sorrow. This word appears three times in the Jacob-Joseph-Benjamin story in Genesis and twice in the context of Exodus 21:22-23, making it a rare occurrence in the Hebrew Bible.</summary>

              <p>The word ason means “mischief, evil, harm, calamity, disaster.” Jacob uses it when his sons tell him that the viceroy of Egypt (Joseph) insists that they bring their youngest brother Benjamin with them when they return, if they are to be cleared of the charge of spying. With Joseph missing, Benjamin is the only son left of Jacob’s beloved wife Rachel, who died giving birth to him. Jacob initially refuses to give permission for Benjamin to leave home, saying: “If you take this one from me, too, and he meets with disaster (ason), you will send my white head down to the grave in sorrow” (Genesis 44:29). (The word appears three times in the Jacob-Joseph-Benjamin story (Genesis 42:4, 42:38, 44:29) and twice in the present context (Exodus 21:22, 23). These are the only occurrences in the Hebrew Bible.) </p>

            <summary>The term &quot;hamekusharoth&quot; in Genesis 30:41 refers to flocks where the males closely follow the females, indicating a strong desire, while &quot;atuphim&quot; are the weak ones. Nachmanides explains that &quot;hamekusharoth&quot; are male animals closely following females, similar to the bond between Yehudah and Binyamin. Ibn Ezra states that lambs born in Nissan are strong and healthy, while those born in Tishrey are weak. Ramban agrees, interpreting &quot;hamekusharoth&quot; as males closely following females due to desire, while &quot;atuphim&quot; are weak and lacking desire.</summary>

              <p>THE FLOCKS ‘HAMEKUSHAROTH.’ The correct interpretation of this expression appears to me to be that they are the flocks in which the males follow the females at all times, never leaving them due to their abundant desire, as in the expression, Seeing that his soul is ‘keshurah’ (bound up) with the lad’s soul. (Further, 44:30.)  This is also found in the language of our Sages: “a swine karuch (clinging) to a ewe;” (Bechoroth 24a.)  “clinging to her.” (Kiddushin 79b.)  And the offspring born at that time are called hakeshurim after the name of their father. But many authorities say (P’sikta Zutrata on this verse.)  that keshurim are “the strong ones” whose limbs are firmly attached to each other with a strong tie, as this is the basis of health, while atuphim (Verse 42 here.)  are “the weak ones” whose soul ‘tithataph’ (fainted) in them, (Psalms 107:5.)  and who have no desire, as in the expression, ‘ha’atuphim’ (that faint) for hunger. (Lamentations 2:19.)  Onkelos translated hamekusharoth as the early-bearing sheep, and atuphim as the late-bearing ones, for such is the fact: [the early-bearing sheep are the stronger ones, and the late-bearing ones are weaker].</p>

              </summary>
              <p>המקושרות, “the early-bearing ones,” some commentators understand the word as “the strong ones.” They believe that it refers to those whose limbs were firmly attached to each other. Such firm attachment between the various limbs is considered a sign of good health. By contrast, the עטופים (verse 42) are the ones whose health was more precarious. They were the weak ones. The word occurs in this context in Lamentations 2,19 העטופים ברעב, “the ones weakened by famine.”
    Nachmanides writes that הקשורים are the male animals which follow the females very close on their heels and never stay far away from them as they are usually in heat. A parallel expression in the Torah would be ונפשו קשורה בנפשו, the manner in which Yehudah describes the spiritual bond between his father and Binyamin. (Genesis 44,30).
    Ibn Ezra explains that in the month of Nissan, all the young lambs born to the sheep were strong and healthy, to wit מקושרות. Seeing they are so healthy and strong, they have a strong sex drive, always staying close behind the females. On the other hand, the ones born in fall, in Tishrey, are by nature weak, and Yaakov was not particularly interested in them, hence he did not bother with the aspen sticks at that time of year. At least, he refrained from doing so in order to minimize the chance of Lavan learning of his stratagem.

              <p>Yehuda tells Yosef that if Yaakov sees Binyamin does not return safely, Yaakov will die (Bereishis 44:31). This raises the question: how did Yehuda know that Yaakov would die if Binyamin did not return? Yehuda understood this from Yaakov's words, &quot;Hashem - אל שדי shall have mercy on you&quot; (Rashi explains that Yaakov used the word שדי, implying &quot;the one who said די - enough to the world, shall say enough to my suffering&quot;). Yaakov would only use such an expression if he knew it was a matter of life and death. Our forefathers were willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of future generations, understanding their own suffering was for the greater good. This explains why Yosef did not reveal his whereabouts to Yaakov, just as Yitzchak did not reveal it to Yaakov. Although a father's mercy is greater than a son's, they both learned from Hashem, who did not reveal that Yosef was alive, indicating it was best for Yaakov not to know. However, when it reached a critical point, with Yaakov himself saying he would die if Binyamin did not return, Yosef realized it was the right time to reveal the truth. Knowing that Yaakov’s life was at stake, Yosef was compelled to disclose his identity.</p>

One of them went away from me, and I said, ‘He has surely been torn to pieces.’ And I have not seen him since.

            <summary>Judah explains that he is speaking on behalf of his brothers because he guaranteed the safety of Benjamin to his father, risking being an outcast in both worlds (Rashi, Steinsaltz, Tze'enah Ure'enah). He emphasizes that he took responsibility for Benjamin and offers to be a slave in his place (Ramban, Rashbam, Sforno, Radak, Tur HaArokh). There is a discussion of the consequences of being a guarantor and the dynamics of the interaction between Judah and Joseph (Rabbeinu Bahya, Siftei Chakhamim, Tze'enah Ure'enah). Ultimately, Joseph reveals himself to his brothers, leading to a reconciliation (Tze'enah Ure'enah, Steinsaltz).</summary>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Bereshit 44:32:1-3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>כי עבדך ערב את הנער, “for your servant has guaranteed the safety of the lad.” I have undertaken to be surety for him in a manner which is irrevocable and not subject to any redemption by substitution. If I fail to honor the terms of my guarantee all my brothers will remain within the family circle whereas I will be condemned to remain outside. I will be ostracized both in this life and in the hereafter. This is the meaning of the words: “I have sinned against you for all time” (43,9). Another example in Scripture where the words כל הימים also refer to both life in the terrestrial world and life in the hereafter is found in Deut. 6,24 לטוב לנו כל הימים. When Yehudah said here וחטאתי לאבי כל הימים, this may be understood as “I have sinned against my Father in Heaven.” Yehudah included both his biological father Yaakov as well as his father in heaven in this statement. Seeing that Joseph was on record as “I am a G’d-fearing man” (42,18), Yehudah reminded him of his committing a sin against his father in heaven if he were to keep Binyamin as a slave for himself. He would also be guilty of committing a wrong in both worlds. According to Bereshit Rabbah 93,1 the words “for your servant has guaranteed the lad,” are reminiscent of what Solomon said in Proverbs 6,1: “my son if you have become surety for your friend, etc.” It is customary for the guarantor to ask the potential borrower: “do you want me to guarantee the loan for you?” Concerning such an invitation to become a surety for a second party, Solomon warns (Proverbs 6,2) “you are trapped by the words of your mouth.” The guarantor usually agreed to the lender’s request and this is why Solomon describes him as trapping himself by his words. In verse three of that chapter. Solomon warns a guarantor who is trapped by his guarantee that in order to extricate himself from his commitment he should try to use humility and plead with his friend. He should ask for an extension from the lender and should ask the borrower to release him from his guarantee. Solomon used Yehudah’s guarantee of Binyamin as the model for these verses and his advice. Having heard all this, Joseph replied: “why did you not guarantee your other brother just as you have guaranteed the safety of Binyamin?” He added that he could see in his goblet that Yehudah sold his other brother for a sum of money and caused his father a great deal of anguish so that he exclaimed: “Joseph has been torn to shreds by a wild beast.” Whereas Joseph at the time had not been guilty of a sin against Yehudah, Binyamin had proven to be a thief.  When Yehudah heard Joseph’s words he exclaimed in a loud voice: “how can I go up and the lad is not with me, etc.?” He challenged Joseph to debate the issue with him, at the same time telling his brother Naftali, the most fleet-footed one of their number, to check the number of public markets in Egypt in preparation for going to battle. Naftali came back reporting that there were twelve such market places. Yehudah undertook to destroy three of them single-handedly. Joseph warned him that Egypt was not comparable to Shechem. If they were going to destroy Egypt this would be equivalent to destroying the earth. (seeing the whole earth depended on Egypt’s grain supplies). To this Yehudah replied that Joseph had accused him and his brothers of being spies already when they came to Egypt the first time, a totally unjustified accusation. Secondly, he had accused them of looking for weak points in Egypt. Thirdly, he had accused them now of stealing the goblet. Whereas he, Yehudah, swore in the name of the Almighty G’d, Joseph, by contrast had sworn by the life of Pharaoh the pagan. It was clear that if he would draw his sword he would cause a blood-bath in Egypt.  After this outburst by Yehudah, Joseph told him that if he dared draw his sword, he, Joseph, would strangle him with it by wrapping it around his own neck. To this Yehudah replied: “if I so much as open my mouth I will swallow you.” Joseph countered: “if you open your mouth I will shut it with a rock.” Yehudah then asked: “what shall I tell my father if I return without Binyamin?” To this Joseph replied: “tell him that the rope followed the bucket” [— an allusion to Binyamin having a genetic tendency to steal. Rachel his mother had stolen the teraphim having given birth to a son who became a thief also.] Yehudah shot back that Joseph was framing them and judging them for a sin they had not committed. Joseph retorted that the only perverted justice at stake was the sale of their brother. Yehudah then said that the holy fervor which had imbued him in their fight against Shechem which was caused because of sin involving illegitimate sex was beginning to fill him now. Thereupon Joseph replied that the sin of illegitimate sex he should be thinking about was that of sleeping with his daughter-in-law Tamar. He implied that it did not take much to extinguish Yehudah’s supposedly sincere fervor. Yehudah responded shouting: “I am boiling over with fury and no one takes me seriously!” Joseph said it would be easy to cool down Yehudah’s anger. Thereupon Yehudah announced that he was about to go and paint the market places of Egypt with the blood of its people. To this Joseph replied that this was nothing new. The brothers had experience in painting their brother’s coat with blood and bringing it to their father suggesting to him that it was Joseph’s blood and that the latter had been attacked and killed by a ferocious beast. At that point all the brothers agreed to destroy Egypt. When Joseph realized this he said to himself: “I have to reveal myself to them so that they will not destroy Egypt.” At this point he said to them: “I am your brother Joseph.”</p>

              <p>By accepting to be outcast in both worlds. You might ask: Rashi said before (43:9) that “I will have sinned to you for all time” meaning in the World to Come. Why does he say here that it means, “In both worlds”? It seems [the answer is:] Here Yehudah is telling [Yoseif] what he said to his father, so it should say מעם אבי לאמר אם לא אביאנו אליך וחטאתי לך כל הימים. [Why does it say וחטאתי לאבי כל הימים?] Perforce, וחטאתי לאבי means in this world, while my father is alive. And [כל הימים means] also in the world that is completely יום, i.e., the World to Come. We need not ask: Why did Yehudah, in order to explain himself, find it necessary to say that he was liable of being an outcast in both worlds, [whereas to Yaakov he spoke only of being an outcast of the World to Come]? For the answer is: He thought Yoseif might not believe in the punishment meted out in the World to Come, so he mentioned also the punishment of this world. But Yaakov believed in the punishment meted out in the World to Come. </p>

              <p>“Your servant has pledged himself for the boy” [44:32]. Judah said: I must speak more than the other brothers because I was the guarantor for Benjamin and accepted excommunication upon myself to bring Benjamin to my father. I have put my share in the world to come in jeopardy. (Rashi, Genesis, 44:32.)  The guarantor loses his soul because he caused the one whom he guaranteed to sin. He lost physically and financially, when Judah was the guarantor for Benjamin. (Ibn Shuaib, Derashot, I: 88.)  He said, “I shall stand guilty before my father forever” [44:32]. When Judah said that he had become a guarantor for Benjamin, Joseph said. I see in my goblet that you sold your brother and why were you not the guarantor for him? You brought a sin to his father. When Judah heard this, he said to Naphtali. Find out how many markets and streets there are in the city of Egypt. Naphtali said: there are twelve markets in Egypt. Judah said: I will take three markets to destroy them and you brothers, each one take one market to destroy the people. The brothers said to him, if you will destroy Egypt, it is as if you destroyed the whole world. Judah again began to argue with Joseph. He said: first you came with accusations and said that we were spies. Then you said that we stole the goblet. Therefore, I want to swear by my father and you swore by the life of Pharaoh the evildoer. Now I will take out my sword and chop off your head. I will open my mouth and swallow you up. Joseph said: I will stop up your mouth with a stone. Judah said: the fire of the city of Shechem burns in my heart. Joseph said: the fire of your daughter-in-law, Tamar, in whose bed you lay, that is what is burning in you. Judah said: I will soon color Egypt with blood. Joseph said: you have long experience in coloring; you colored Joseph’s shirt and told your father that a wild animal had devoured Joseph. Immediately, the brothers agreed to destroy the city of Egypt. Joseph was afraid and identified himself to his brothers. (Bahya, Genesis, 44:32.)  Joseph ordered all the people to leave. Only the brothers should remain with Joseph, since he thought that the brothers would be embarrassed before the Egyptians that they had sold him. It would also be an embarrassment for Joseph that he had such brothers and would not allow the brothers to live in Egypt. He also told them to leave because there were many of Pharaoh’s ministers who would plead on behalf of Benjamin and he would not be able to deny them. Therefore, he asked everyone to leave. (Ramban, Genesis, 45:1.)  Rabbi Samuel the son of Nachmani said that Joseph was in great danger when he told all the people to leave and identified himself to his brothers. How did he not fear that they would kill him and nobody would know about it? (Bahya, Genesis, 45:1.)  The Midrash writes. Joseph said to his brothers. You told me that Benjamin’s brother died. Now I will call him, and he called out, come here Joseph. The brothers looked around in all four directions. Joseph said: why are you looking around? I am Joseph your brother. The brothers’ souls flew out from fright and they could not answer. Rabbi Johanan said: when the brothers could not respond to Joseph, how much more so when the Holy One will have the Day of Judgment for the people and will tell them their sins, they will not be able to respond out of fright. (Bahya, Genesis, 45:3.)  Toldot Yizhak asks a question. Why does Joseph have to ask, I am Joseph, is your father still alive? They had said much earlier, in a previous portion, that Jacob was still alive. The explanation is that Joseph said: I am your brother Joseph that you sold me. Joseph thought: the brothers would be afraid that I would kill them because they had sold me. Therefore, Joseph said: my father is still alive. Therefore, do not be afraid. Even the evil Esau did not want to do anything to Jacob because Isaac, his father, was still alive. He did not want to cause anguish for his father. How much more so, I will do no evil to you. Therefore, he immediately asked, is our father still alive? Therefore, do not be afraid. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 45:3–5.)  When Joseph saw that the brothers were afraid, Joseph said to his brothers, “come forward to me” [45:4]. Come here to me. I am Joseph that you sold. However, do not be afraid. The Holy One sent me to feed you. You did not send me to Egypt, but the Holy One did. You can well understand this since you sold me as a slave and the Holy One made me a lord over Egypt. The brothers approached Joseph and he showed them his circumcision, that he was their brother. (Rashi, Genesis, 45:4.)  Bahya writes. Joseph said: I am Joseph. Just as when you sold me to Egypt, I am still your brother and do not want to have dominion over you. (Bahya, Genesis, 45:4.)  Ibn Shuaib writes. “Only then were his brothers able to talk to him” [45:15]. Afterwards, the brothers spoke with him, with Joseph. They pleaded with Joseph that he should not tell Jacob that they sold him. They were afraid that he would curse them all. Jacob never knew about the sale, as we will write below in parshat Vayehi. As Ramban also writes, if Jacob had known about the sale, he would have ordered in his will and testament that Joseph should forgive his brothers. Therefore, Joseph did not send to tell Jacob about the sale, in the expectation that Jacob should not curse the brothers. Some sages say that Joseph was not supposed to say that he was sold because the ten brothers had issued a ban. From here we learn that when ten issue a ban, then one must observe the ban, even though they are not among the ten people. So writes Ibn Shuaib. (Ibn Shuaib, Derashot, I: 90.) </p>

            <summary>Judah's anxiety over Benjamin's well-being is highlighted in the Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Vayigash 4:1, as he explains his actions to Joseph. In Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Vayigash 10:3, Judah's past actions and the pain he caused his father are recounted, leading to his eventual vindication by Joseph. Finally, in Bamidbar Rabbah 13:3, Judah's humility in pleading for Benjamin is contrasted with Joseph's past pride, showcasing how humility leads to honor.</summary>

                <h4>Bamidbar Rabbah 13:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>“The one who presented…” (Numbers 7:12), that is what is written: “A man’s pride will humble him, and the lowly spirit will attain honor” (Proverbs 29:23). Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba said: “A man's pride will humble him,” this is Adam the first man. How so? When he violated the command of the Holy One blessed be He and ate from the tree, the Holy One blessed be He sought to have him repent, and He provided him with an opening. Adam did not seek to do so. That is what is written: “The Lord God said: Behold, the man [has become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now, lest] [pen]…” (Genesis 3:22). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: What is “and now”? It is, rather, that the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Even now, repent and I will accept you.’ Adam said: ‘I do not wish to do so.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: “And now,” and Adam said: ‘pen, I do not wish to do so.’ Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: When Adam emerged from judgment, he began cursing and blaspheming. “Cherubs” is stated here: “He stationed the cherubs east of the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 3:24), and “cherubs” is stated by Sennacherib: “Lord of hosts, God of  Israel, who abides over the cherubs” (Isaiah 37:16). Just as there, cursing and blaspheming, (By Sennacherib (see Isaiah 37:17).)  so, too, here, cursing and blaspheming. That is, “a man’s pride will humble him.” Because he was too haughty vis-à-vis the Holy One blessed be He to repent, He humbled him and banished him from the Garden of Eden. “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Abraham, who lowered his spirit and said: “I am dust and ashes” (Genesis 18:27). That is why the Holy One blessed be He called him: “The man greatest among the giants” (Joshua 14:15) (See the Alshikh on the verse.) ; this characterization means greater than Adam the first man.  Another matter, “a man's pride will humble him,” this is Pharaoh, who was haughty vis-à-vis Moses and said: “Who is the Lord that I will heed His voice…?” (Exodus 5:2). The Holy One blessed be He humbled him: “He hurled Pharaoh and his army [into the Red Sea]” (Psalms 136:15). “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Moses; “For when shall I entreat on your behalf…?” (Exodus 8:5), and it says: “Upon my leaving the city, I will spread my hands [to the Lord]” (Exodus 9:29). (In both of these verses, Moses tells Pharaoh that ending the plague does not depend on him; rather, he will pray to the Holy One blessed be He to end the plague in question.)   Another matter, “a man’s pride,” this is Amalek, who was haughty vis-à-vis the Holy One blessed be He, with his curses and blasphemies, as he would send the foul smell to His nose, (This is a phrase from Ezekiel 8:17; it refers to something done with the intent of insulting God.)  and he would take the male organ of Israel and cast it upward, cursing and blaspheming, saying: ‘Is this what You wanted?’ That is what is written: “And attacked you from behind [vayzanev]” (Deuteronomy 25:18); they struck them a strike on the tail [zanav]. (This is a euphemism for their male organs.)  “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Joshua, who killed him, as it is stated: “Joshua weakened Amalek and his people…” (Exodus 17:13).  Another matter, “a man’s pride will humble him,” this is Tavor and Carmel, that came from the ends of the earth, (Tavor and Carmel are mountains. See Bereshit Rabba 99:1.)  haughtily saying: ‘We are high, and upon us, the Holy One blessed be He is giving the Torah.’ “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Sinai, that humbled itself, saying: ‘I am low.’ As a result, the Holy One blessed be He rested His glory upon it. The Torah was given upon it, and it merited all this honor, just as it says: “The Lord descended upon Mount Sinai” (Exodus 19:20).  Another matter, “a man's pride will humble him,” this is Joseph, who conducted himself with superiority, as his brothers would say before him: “Your servant, our father” (Genesis 43:28), and he would keep silent. That is why he is called “bones” during his lifetime, as it is stated: “And you shall carry up my bones from here” (Genesis 50:25). “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Judah, who humbled himself before Joseph on behalf of Benjamin: “May your servant speak a matter?” (Genesis 44:18); “for your servant took responsibility for the lad” (Genesis 44:32); “now, please, your servant will remain…” (Genesis 44:33). Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen bar Rabbi said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Judah, you humbled yourself before your brother who is younger than you; as you live, when the Tabernacle will be erected and the tribes will come to present an offering, not one of them will present an offering before you, but rather they will accord you deference, and it is you who will present an offering first.’ That is what is written: “The one who presented his offering on the first day…of the tribe of Judah…”</p>

              <p>“My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or a brother?” (Genesis 44:19).  “My lord asked his servants…” – [Judah] said to him: ‘From the outset you came against us with malice. How many countries descended to Egypt to purchase food? But you did not ask [this of] any of them. Did we, perhaps, come to take our daughter, or are you planning to marry our sister? Nevertheless, we hid nothing from you.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘I see that you are a prattler. Is there among your brothers a prattler like you?’ (Why are you the only one of the brothers talking? According to Tanḥuma (Vayigash 5), Joseph claimed that he knew through divination that Judah was not the oldest of the brothers, and therefore it was even more surprising that he was doing all the talking. )  [Judah] said to him: ‘All this that you see is because I became a guarantor for him.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘Why did you not do so on behalf of your brother when you sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver pieces, and you brought anguish to your father and said to him: “Joseph was mauled”?’ (Genesis 37:33). When Judah heard this he screamed and cried in a loud voice. (Judah screamed and cried because Joseph was not giving in to his demand to release Benjamin. )  He said: “For how will I go up to my father?” (Genesis 44:34). Judah said to Naphtali: ‘Go and see how many marketplaces there are in Egypt.’ He leapt and returned and said to him: ‘Twelve.’ Judah said to his brothers: ‘I will destroy three of them, and each and every one of you take one each, “and no man will be left among them”’ (I Samuel 14:36). His brothers said to him: ‘Egypt is not like Shekhem. If you destroy Egypt you will be destroying the entire world.’   “Joseph could not restrain himself before all those standing before him, and he called: Remove every man from before me. No man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers” (Genesis 45:1).  “He raised his voice in weeping; the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard” (Genesis 45:2).  “Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live? And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him” (Genesis 45:3).  “Joseph said to his brothers: Please approach me, and they approached. He said: I am Joseph your brother whom you sold to Egypt” (Genesis 45:4).  At that moment, “Joseph could not restrain himself” (Genesis 45:1). When Joseph saw that they had come to an agreement to destroy Egypt, Joseph said to himself: ‘It is preferable that I reveal myself to them and they will not destroy Egypt.’ Joseph said to them: ‘Did you not say that this one’s brother was dead? I will call him and he will come to you.’ He was calling: ‘Joseph son of Jacob, come to me. Joseph son of Jacob come to me.’ They were looking to the four corners of the palace. He said to them: ‘What are you looking for? “I am Joseph your brother”’ (Genesis 45:4). Immediately, their souls departed, as it is stated: “His brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3). But they did not believe him until he uncovered himself and showed them his circumcision.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>(Gen. 37:35, cont.:) SO HIS FATHER WEPT FOR HIM. What is written next (in vs. 36)? BUT THE MIDIANITES SOLD HIM INTO EGYPT. The Holy One said to Judah: You have no children; therefore you do not know what the pain of children is. Now you have deceived your father and told him: Your son is dead. By your life, when you take a wife you shall bury your sons in order that you may know the pain of children. What is written next (in Gen. 38:1-10): NOW IT CAME TO PASS AT THAT TIME THAT &lt; JUDAH &gt;…. (The verses continue with the story of Judah's marriage to Shua, the birth of three sons, and the death of two of them.) It is also written (in Gen. 46:12): &lt; AND THE SONS OF JUDAH: ER, ONAN, SHELAH, PEREZ, AND ZERAH &gt;; BUT ER AND ONAN HAD DIED &lt; IN THE LAND OF CANAAN &gt;. Now all those years that Joseph had been away from his father, Jacob's mind had been against Judah. (Tanh., Gen. 11:9, specifically states in the parallel account, “It was in Jacob’s heart that Judah had killed him.” See also above.)  From where do you learn that? From Benjamin, about whom Judah said to Joseph (in Gen. 44:32): FOR YOUR SERVANT HAS BECOME SURETY FOR THE LAD. Then, as soon as he had set his mind on Benjamin and Joseph had made himself known, Judah was found to be innocent, as stated (in Is. 11:13): THEN EPHRAIM'S JEALOUSY SHALL DEPART, &lt; AND THOSE WHO HARASS JUDAH SHALL BE CUT OFF &gt;…. Therefore (in Gen. 46:28): NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM UNTO JOSEPH.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM. This text is related (to Prov. 6:1-3): MY CHILD, IF YOU HAVE BECOME SURETY FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR…. YOU ARE ENSNARED IN THE WORDS OF YOUR MOUTH…. DO THIS, THEN, MY SON, AND SAVE YOURSELF, &lt; FOR YOU HAVE COME INTO THE POWER OF YOUR NEIGHBOR. GO HUMBLE YOURSELF, AND URGE YOUR NEIGHBOR &gt;. Joseph said to &lt; Judah &gt;: Why are you multiplying words? I see that people older than you are standing here without speaking. And is not Reuben older than you? Is not Simeon also older than you? Yet none of them are speaking. But in your case, why are you multiplying words? &lt; Judah &gt; said to him: Of all these people, not one of them is anxious about &lt; Benjamin &gt; except me alone because I stood surety &lt; for him &gt;, as stated (in Gen. 43:9): I MYSELF WILL BE SURETY FOR HIM. Now I said this to my father, that, if I do not bring him to you and set him before you, I am sinning before you in two worlds, in this world and in the world to come, as stated (in Gen. 44:32): I AM GUILTY BEFORE MY FATHER FOREVER. I therefore give my life for him. Why? (Prov. 6:1, 3:) MY CHILD, IF YOU HAVE BECOME SURETY FOR YOUR NEIGHBOR … &lt; SAVE YOURSELF, FOR YOU HAVE COME UNDER THE POWER OF YOUR NEIGHBOR &gt;.</p>

            <summary>In Shemirat HaLashon, it is explained that Judah's curse from a sage was fulfilled even though he brought Benjamin back, as whatever is spoken by a man's mouth is by Divine providence. This curse caused Judah to accept excommunication upon himself due to the ban placed on revealing the sale of Joseph to Jacob. In Sha'arei Teshuvah, it is stated that King David repented before confessing, acknowledging that his sin was against God alone and not towards others, emphasizing the importance of seeking forgiveness from God for ultimate atonement. The usage of &quot;so that&quot; in Psalms and Hosea is explained as highlighting the greatness of God's forgiveness in relation to the severity of the sin.</summary>

                <h4>Sha'arei Teshuvah 1:45</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>And it is fitting for a penitent to do this before the confession, so that he can be accepted with his confession. And at the time of [his] repentance, King David, peace be upon him, did this before the confession, as it is stated (Psalms 51:6), &quot;Against You alone have I sinned, and done what is evil in Your sight; so that You are just in Your sentence, and right in Your judgment.&quot; The explanation [of this] is that I am only considered a sinner to you, and I need nothing besides your forgiveness; and if I sinned to a person, I have requested forgiveness from him and I have made amends with him. And similar to it is (Genesis 44:32), &quot;I shall stand guilty before my father forever&quot; - for this sin, I will be considered a sinner to my father forever, as he will never forgive me for it. And its translation (Onkelos), is &quot;and I will be a sinner to father.&quot; Or (alternatively) the explanation [in the verse in Psalms above] is, &quot;Against You alone have I sinned&quot; - I have not sinned to a person and I have not said extra words about him, nor have I taken anything from a person; that I should require his forgiveness and return his stolen goods. So my atonement is only dependent upon You. &quot;So that You are just in Your sentence, and right in Your judgment&quot; - in order to show Your charity and the greatness of Your forgiveness to the nations, on the day of Your speech and Your judgement at the time that You judged me. And the expression, &quot;so that,&quot; is [to mean] that the greatness of the sin is the reason to make known the greatness of Your charity in Your forgiveness. Therefore the thing is compared to the head of sin, in order that God's kindness can be revealed - as well as His charity in His forgiveness - on the day of [David's] judgement. And like it is [the usage of, so that] (in Hosea 8:4), &quot;of their silver and gold they have made themselves images, so that it will be cut off.&quot; For their making the images is the reason for the cutting off of their silver and their gold - the thing was compared, as if they made the images in order that they would be cut off. Or its explanation (in Psalms) is, because of this, You will be justified in Your word about the judgement and the repayment (meaning to say that he is justifying His judgement, may He be blessed). And likewise (in Hosea), &quot;so that it will be cut off,&quot; [can be understood] as, because of this will it be cut off. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>Another awesome thing which befell Judah: Our sags of blessed memory have said (Sotah 7b): &quot;All those years that Israel was in the desert, the bones of Judah were 'rolling around' in his casket, until Moses arose and implored mercy for him. He said… (Devarim 33:7): 'Hear, O L-rd, the voice of Judah' — at which his limbs reunited. But he was not yet brought to the Heavenly synod, at which Moses said (Ibid.): 'and to his people shall You bring him.' But he could not engage in halachic converse with the sages there, at which Moses said (Ibid.): 'Let his hands do battle for him', etc.&quot; All this befell him because he had said (Bereshith 43:9): &quot;If I do not bring him [Benjamin] to you and present him to you [alive], I shall have sinned against you all the days.&quot; __ But he did bring him! But, &quot;the curse of a sage is fulfilled even if the condition [(in this instance, bringing him back)] is fulfilled&quot; (Makkoth 11b). And we have already said that whatever issues from a man's mouth is by Divine providence, so that the L-rd's will was being enacted here. It seems to me that the explanation is as follows: It is known that they [the brothers] placed a ban on anyone who would reveal this [(the sale of Joseph)] to our father Jacob, and they included the Shechinah in this ban, wherefore the Holy Spirit [of prophecy] was removed from our father Jacob (until the end [of the episode], where it is written (Ibid. 45:27): &quot;And the spirit of Jacob their father revived,&quot; which Onkelos translates: &quot;And the Holy Spirit [again] reposed upon him.&quot;) And because of this ban it was decreed upon him [Judah] that holiness depart from him entirely, (as any man who is excommunicated), wherefore Judah was constrained to accept excommunication upon himself, as it is written: &quot;And I shall have sinned against my father all of the days.&quot;</p>

            <summary>Rashi explains that Judah and Reuben both confessed their sins, with Judah invoking a curse upon himself, leading to his bones moving in his coffin. Rabbeinu Bahya interprets the sin-offering for Hashem as atonement for reducing the moon's size. He also highlights Judah's leadership in battle and his confession of sin, which triggered Reuben's confession, leading to both finding peace.</summary>

              <p>ושעיר עזים אחד לחטאת לה', “and one male goat as a sin-offering for Hashem.” According to the plain meaning of the text he word לה' means the same as in Leviticus 16,8: “one male goat as sin-offering for Hashem.” Alternatively, the word לה' may mean “in respect of a sin committed against Hashem.” This would be a normal construction in Hebrew where the prefix ל often occurs as not meaning “for” but “against.” Examples are: Genesis 39,9 וחטאתי לאלו-הים and I would commit a sin against G’d.” Or, Genesis 44,32: וחטאתי לאבי, “and I would have committed a sin against my father.”  According to Chulin 60 (one opinion) the meaning here is the reverse of the usual, G’d commanding the offering on His own behalf, “atoning” for having reduced the moon from its original size. This is one of the mysteries of the Torah.</p>

              <p>וזאת ליהודה, “and this for Yehudah;” according to the plain meaning of the text we have to insert the word ברכה, “is the blessing” after the word וזאת “this.” He needed the blessing especially since it was this tribe who always was in the forefront in any military encounter between Israel and its enemies. This is why Moses assured Yehudah that G’d has heard his voice, i.e. his prayer for assistance.  ידיו רב לו, “his (own) hands will fight on his behalf;” he will not even need help from the other tribes. According to Rashi, Reuven and Yehudah are paired as both of them had been guilty of sins and both made public confessions. Makkot 11, referring to Yehudah having been guilty of the (conditional) oath in Genesis 44,32, where he guaranteed the safe return of Binyamin. This was something beyond his power as it needed the agreement of other parties over whom Yehudah had no control, making him guilty of uttering a vain oath. His punishment was that during all the 40 years that the Israelites were in the desert the bones in his coffin kept rolling around. Moses reasoned that the confession of Yehudah (concerning his mistake of sleeping with his daughter-in-law Tamar and almost burning her to death) was what triggered Reuven’s confession concerning his misconduct with Bilhah and that therefore he should be credited with this merit so that his bones could find rest. [Tosafot state that although Yehudah’s sleeping with Tamar had occurred after Reuven’s misconduct so that “how did his confession affect Reuven?” They answer that up until Yehudah’s public confession that Tamar was more just than he, Reuven had not confessed publicly, only privately. The letter ו which precedes the word זאת, conceptually links Reuven’s conduct and Moses’ blessing for him to that of Yehudah. Ed.]  Even though Yehudah’s bones had now come to rest, this still did not represent total forgiveness, i.e. he did not have the strength to ascend to heaven unaided, by his own strength. The reason was that the banishment he had accepted for himself in that oath we referred to covered both this life and the life in the world to come, in his own words: כל הימים, ”for all times.” This is why Moses added the words ואל עמו תביאנו, “and return him to his people.” Reuven’s public confession cleared his brothers from the suspicion that one of them might have been the one who tampered with the bed of Bilhah.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>[3] Another interpretation: &quot;And Joseph went down to Egypt.&quot; (Genesis 39:1) It is said in scriptures: &quot;He (God) has withdrawn you (Israel) from the land of the living.&quot; (Hosea 11:4) This refers to Joseph, as it is said, &quot;There were certain men who were defiled by a human corpse.&quot; (Numbers 9:6) If not for the fact that Israel had to go down to Egypt due to Joseph's story, they would have been worthy of descending to Egypt in chains, just as they descended to Babylon, as it is said, &quot;You should know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land not their own, and they will be enslaved and oppressed there.&quot; (Genesis 15:13) But because God loved them, He caused them to descend to Egypt in a pit and brought about the story of Joseph's sale so that they would descend of their own accord. Our sages say in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha that this was due to the coat of many colors that Jacob added to Joseph's clothing. His brothers were jealous of him and sold him to Egypt, and they also descended there after him, as it is said, &quot;And Israel loved Joseph and made him a coat of many colors.&quot; (Genesis 37:3) The coat of many colors had an argaman (purple) stripe that reached the palm of his hand. Alternatively, it was the coat of many strips of parchment (shetarot) that his brothers wrote on concerning him, debating which type of death to kill him with. One said burning and one said killing, as it is said, &quot;And they saw him from afar and plotted to kill him.&quot; (Genesis 37:18) The coat of many colors was stripped off of Joseph after they sold him, as it is said, &quot;And they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him.&quot; (Genesis 37:23) They debated amongst themselves who would take him and bring him to their father Jacob. Once they made their peace, Judah suggested that they sell him, and they sent him down to Egypt with his coat, as it is said, &quot;And they sent the coat of many colors and brought it to their father.&quot; (Genesis 37:32) Judah went and said to him [Joseph], &quot;Please recognize [me], and let me know [who you are].&quot; And [Joseph] said [to his brothers], etc. (Genesis 44:32-33) The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Judah, &quot;You have spoken well to your father, [when you said] 'Please recognize [me],' for you also have [a lesson] to hear, as it says [about Tamar], 'And she said, 'Please recognize [this],' etc.&quot; (Genesis 38:25). And Judah recognized [Joseph], etc. (Genesis 44:33) Jacob said to him, &quot;I know who did this to my son, a wild animal devoured him&quot; (Genesis 37:33). &quot;I know that you gave the advice,&quot; [said Jacob,] as it says, &quot;And Judah said to his brothers, 'What profit is there...'&quot; (Genesis 37:26), for no harm comes from a lion. And who is this Judah? As it says, &quot;Judah is a lion's cub&quot; (Genesis 49:9). &quot;You have torn Joseph,&quot; [said Jacob,] &quot;and ascended to the throne,&quot; as it says, &quot;A lion's cub, Judah, you have risen&quot; (Genesis 49:9). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Judah, &quot;You have no children, and you do not know the pain of having children. You deceived [your father] and said, 'A wild animal devoured [Joseph].' Now you will know what the pain of having children is.&quot; And what is written after [Jacob's rebuke]? &quot;And it was at that time that Judah went down [from his brothers]&quot; (Genesis 38:1). And this also applies in the future, &quot;A son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and a father shall not bear the iniquity of the son&quot; (Ezekiel 18:20).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>“The one who presented…” (Numbers 7:12), that is what is written: “A man’s pride will humble him, and the lowly spirit will attain honor” (Proverbs 29:23). Rabbi Tanḥuma bar Abba said: “A man's pride will humble him,” this is Adam the first man. How so? When he violated the command of the Holy One blessed be He and ate from the tree, the Holy One blessed be He sought to have him repent, and He provided him with an opening. Adam did not seek to do so. That is what is written: “The Lord God said: Behold, the man [has become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now, lest] [pen]…” (Genesis 3:22). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: What is “and now”? It is, rather, that the Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Even now, repent and I will accept you.’ Adam said: ‘I do not wish to do so.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: “And now,” and Adam said: ‘pen, I do not wish to do so.’ Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: When Adam emerged from judgment, he began cursing and blaspheming. “Cherubs” is stated here: “He stationed the cherubs east of the Garden of Eden” (Genesis 3:24), and “cherubs” is stated by Sennacherib: “Lord of hosts, God of  Israel, who abides over the cherubs” (Isaiah 37:16). Just as there, cursing and blaspheming, (By Sennacherib (see Isaiah 37:17).)  so, too, here, cursing and blaspheming. That is, “a man’s pride will humble him.” Because he was too haughty vis-à-vis the Holy One blessed be He to repent, He humbled him and banished him from the Garden of Eden. “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Abraham, who lowered his spirit and said: “I am dust and ashes” (Genesis 18:27). That is why the Holy One blessed be He called him: “The man greatest among the giants” (Joshua 14:15) (See the Alshikh on the verse.) ; this characterization means greater than Adam the first man.  Another matter, “a man's pride will humble him,” this is Pharaoh, who was haughty vis-à-vis Moses and said: “Who is the Lord that I will heed His voice…?” (Exodus 5:2). The Holy One blessed be He humbled him: “He hurled Pharaoh and his army [into the Red Sea]” (Psalms 136:15). “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Moses; “For when shall I entreat on your behalf…?” (Exodus 8:5), and it says: “Upon my leaving the city, I will spread my hands [to the Lord]” (Exodus 9:29). (In both of these verses, Moses tells Pharaoh that ending the plague does not depend on him; rather, he will pray to the Holy One blessed be He to end the plague in question.)   Another matter, “a man’s pride,” this is Amalek, who was haughty vis-à-vis the Holy One blessed be He, with his curses and blasphemies, as he would send the foul smell to His nose, (This is a phrase from Ezekiel 8:17; it refers to something done with the intent of insulting God.)  and he would take the male organ of Israel and cast it upward, cursing and blaspheming, saying: ‘Is this what You wanted?’ That is what is written: “And attacked you from behind [vayzanev]” (Deuteronomy 25:18); they struck them a strike on the tail [zanav]. (This is a euphemism for their male organs.)  “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Joshua, who killed him, as it is stated: “Joshua weakened Amalek and his people…” (Exodus 17:13).  Another matter, “a man’s pride will humble him,” this is Tavor and Carmel, that came from the ends of the earth, (Tavor and Carmel are mountains. See Bereshit Rabba 99:1.)  haughtily saying: ‘We are high, and upon us, the Holy One blessed be He is giving the Torah.’ “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Sinai, that humbled itself, saying: ‘I am low.’ As a result, the Holy One blessed be He rested His glory upon it. The Torah was given upon it, and it merited all this honor, just as it says: “The Lord descended upon Mount Sinai” (Exodus 19:20).  Another matter, “a man's pride will humble him,” this is Joseph, who conducted himself with superiority, as his brothers would say before him: “Your servant, our father” (Genesis 43:28), and he would keep silent. That is why he is called “bones” during his lifetime, as it is stated: “And you shall carry up my bones from here” (Genesis 50:25). “And the lowly spirit will attain honor,” this is Judah, who humbled himself before Joseph on behalf of Benjamin: “May your servant speak a matter?” (Genesis 44:18); “for your servant took responsibility for the lad” (Genesis 44:32); “now, please, your servant will remain…” (Genesis 44:33). Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen bar Rabbi said in the name of Rabbi Levi: The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Judah, you humbled yourself before your brother who is younger than you; as you live, when the Tabernacle will be erected and the tribes will come to present an offering, not one of them will present an offering before you, but rather they will accord you deference, and it is you who will present an offering first.’ That is what is written: “The one who presented his offering on the first day…of the tribe of Judah…”</p>

Wasn't it Benjamin who is described as a man of the right-hand side (Genesis 44:17)? However, when the tribes went down to Egypt and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack, he searched all of them, and it was found in Benjamin's possession. Judah said to him, &quot;Please, my lord, we already have a bad incident. I sold my brother, as it is written, 'Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites' (Genesis 37:27), and now you want me to bring back the same evil? I sold my brother as a slave, and now I am taking him back to be a slave. I have no standing either before my father or before the Holy One, blessed be He. I must be a slave, as I sold Joseph, my brother. It is just that I should be a slave for him. This is indicated by the phrase 'Now therefore, please let your servant remain.' God said to him, 'Judah, you have offered yourself as collateral for Benjamin; therefore, the Redeemer who will arise from you over Israel will be named after you.' This is why it is written, 'Now there was a Jewish man.</p>

(Joseph issued these edicts so that his brothers would have to come to Egypt themselves to procure food, and not send their slaves; so that they would all have to come, instead of sending just some of them; and so that he would be able to identify them (Etz Yosef).)  “He found in it a poor, wise man” – this is Judah, “and he saved the city in his wisdom” – as he said: “I will guarantee him…” (Genesis 43:9). Moreover, he said to Joseph: “Now please, let your servant remain instead of the lad…” (Genesis 44:33). (Thus, Judah saved the extended family from starvation by convincing Jacob to allow Benjamin to travel to Egypt, and he saved Benjamin from slavery by offering himself as a slave to Joseph instead.)  “But no one remembered that poor man” – the Holy One blessed be He said: You did not remember him; I remember him, as it is stated: “He sent Judah before him…” (Genesis 46:28).

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): PRAY (bi), MY LORD. By universal custom one who buys a slave and finds him to be a thief returns him. But, in the case of this person (Benjamin) who was found to be a thief, you want to acquire him as a slave! You are suspected of evil things. If you want him to serve you, I know how to serve better than he. If you want him for war, I know how to fight better than he. (Gen. 44:33:) PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD. (Gen. 44:18:) PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT SPEAK SOMETHING. R. Jeremiah ben Shema'yah has said: He told him: If I make my voice heard, a plague will come over Egypt. PLEASE LET &lt; YOUR SERVANT &gt; SPEAK. PLEASE (N') denotes nothing but Egypt.

              <p>(Gen. 44:18:) AND &lt; JUDAH &gt; SAID: PRAY, MY LORD…. FOR YOUR SERVANT HAS BECOME SURETY FOR THE LAD. When did Judah discharge his surety? In the days of Goliath. At that time, when Israel was in trouble, what is written (in I Sam. 17:16)? THEN THE PHILISTINE DREW NEAR AT DAWN AND IN THE EVENING. &lt; He was &gt; cursing and reviling. Saul began sending out a herald &lt; to proclaim &gt; (as implied in I Sam. 17:25): AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS FOR THE MAN WHO KILLS HIM THAT THE KING SHALL ENRICH HIM &lt; WITH GREAT RICHES &gt;…. Now you find that anyone who curses is liable for death, as stated (in Lev. 24:16): AND THE ONE WHO BLASPHEMES THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH … but that wicked man had been cursing (according to I Sam. 17:16): FOR FORTY DAYS. Moses said (in Deut. 7:10): AND &lt; GOD &gt; INSTANTLY REPAYS THOSE WHO HATE HIM WITH DESTRUCTION. In the case of someone wicked who performs a righteous act, the Holy One renders it unfit &lt; by giving him his reward &gt; during his life in this world in order to destroy him in the world to come; but for the righteous, he sets aside their righteous acts for the world to come. (M. Pss.94:4.)  What &lt; righteous act &gt; did this wicked man (i.e., Goliath) do for him to curse for forty days? R. Isaac and R. Levi differ. (Ruth R. 2:20.)  R. Levi said: Because his mother, Orpah ('RPH), walked four miles (Lat.: mille.)  with her mother-in-law (cf. Ruth 1:7, 14), [the Holy One repaid her for it]. So from her the Holy One raised four heroes. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 21:22): THESE FOUR WERE BORN TO THE GIANT (HRPH) OF GATH. (According to vss. 15-20, the four heroes were Ishbi-benob, Saph, Goliath, and a fourth man with twelve fingers and twelve toes.)  R. Isaac said: She walked forty paces (Lat.: passus.)  with her; therefore, the Holy One granted her her reward and gave her Goliath. (Ruth R. 2:20 states more specifically that in return for her forty paces the Holy One granted her son a forty-day reprieve.)  So he was cursing before the Holy One forty days, as stated (in I Sam. 17:16): AND HE (the Philistine) TOOK HIS STAND FOR FORTY DAYS. Jesse said to his son David: Now is the time to make good on the surety of your ancestor who became surety for Benjamin under the hand of his father, as stated (in Gen. 43:9): I MYSELF WILL BE SURETY FOR HIM. Now go and discharge him from his surety. Thus it is stated (in I Sam. 17:18): SEE ALSO TO THE WELFARE OF YOUR BROTHERS, AND TAKE THEIR TOKEN. Now THEIR TOKEN ('RBH) is nothing but a surety ('RBWT). What did David do? He went and made good on the surety by killing Goliath. The Holy One said to him: By your life, just as you have risked your life for Saul, since he is from the tribe of Benjamin, even as your ancestor Judah did for Benjamin &lt; himself &gt;, as stated (in Gen. 44:33): AND NOW PLEASE LET YOUR SERVANT REMAIN AS A SLAVE TO MY LORD INSTEAD OF THE LAD … so I am placing the Sanctuary &lt; both &gt; within your territory and within the territory of Benjamin. And where is it shown that the Sanctuary is &lt; both &gt; within the inheritance of Benjamin and within the inheritance of Judah? Where one text (Gen. 49:27) says: BENJAMIN IS A RAVENOUS WOLF; IN THE MORNING HE CONSUMES PREY, i.e., the dawn tamid (sacrifice), AND IN THE EVENING HE DIVIDES THE SPOIL, i.e., the twilight tamid; while another text (Ps. 48:3 [2]) says: BEAUTEOUS LANDSCAPE, JOY OF THE WHOLE EARTH, &lt; EVEN MOUNT ZION &gt;. By your life, moreover, when all the tribes are going into exile, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin are not going into exile along with them. Why? Because these two tribes believed in me and sanctified my name in the sea with Moses. R. Abba bar Kahana said in the name of R. Levi: When the sea was split open for Israel, there was mire in it. Now the tribe of Reuben said to the tribe of Simeon: From mud you have come and to mud you are going. Thus it is stated (in Hos. 12:1): EPHRAIM SURROUNDS ME WITH DECEIT, THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL WITH FALSE-HOOD…. What did the tribes of Judah and Benjamin do? They sanctified the name of the Holy One, as stated (in Ps. 68:28 [27]): LITTLE BENJAMIN IS THERE RULING OVER THEM, THE PRINCES OF JUDAH IN THEIR GLORY….</p>

              </summary>
              <p>&quot;To lead in melodies. It is known in Judah, God is in Israel. This is what the verse says (Hosea 5:9): 'Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of rebuke; among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure.' When the ten tribes were exiled and only the tribes of Judah and Benjamin remained, the nations of the world began to say that they are no different than other nations, as they are the guests of God. Therefore, they were not exiled. As it says: 'Among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure.' At that same moment, God became known in Judah, and His name was great in Israel. Rabbi Yehuda bar Elai said: 'When the Israelites stood at the sea, they argued with one another, one saying, &quot;I will go down first,&quot; and the other saying, &quot;I will go down first.&quot; From this, Nachshon ben Aminadav jumped into the sea, and regarding him, it is written (Psalms 69:2): &quot;Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.&quot; Moses stood in prayer, and the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: &quot;The Israelites are in distress, and you prolong your prayer? Speak to the children of Israel and let them go forward.&quot; You, therefore, lift up your rod. Therefore, Judah merited to have sovereignty in Israel, as it says (Psalms 114:2-3): &quot;Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel His dominion. The sea saw and fled.&quot; It is known in Judah, God is great in Israel, for He is great among Israel. It was said to him: &quot;When you perform a kindness for Judah, it is as if you are performing a kindness for all of Israel, as all of Israel is called by the name of Judah.&quot; Another explanation for why Judah merited sovereignty is that his disciples asked Rabbi Tarfon in the shade of the Shukei Binyamin (an area in Jerusalem) why Judah merited sovereignty. He answered them, &quot;Because he confessed regarding the incident with Tamar.&quot; They told him that Dia should atone for her immorality. He asked why, and they replied that it was because he had said, &quot;What profit is there if we kill him?&quot; (Genesis 37:26). They also told him that Dia should atone for his sale of Joseph, and he responded that it was because he had said, &quot;Please let your servant stay as a slave to my lord instead of the boy&quot; (Genesis 44:33). They then asked him about the evening pledge that he had fulfilled, and he replied, &quot;By what merit did I do it? Only because I leaped into the waves of the sea.&quot; For when all the tribes were standing and none of them would descend into the sea, one tribe would say, &quot;I will go down first,&quot; and another would say, &quot;No, I will go down first.&quot; Benjamin, however, wanted his tribe to be the first to go down. So Nachshon ben Aminadav jumped into the waves with his tribe, even though they tried to stone him, and he was saved. The verse in Psalms (68:28) states, &quot;Benjamin, the youngest, is their ruler. The leaders of Judah come with their throngs.&quot; This refers to the fact that the people of Judah wanted to stone him and were delayed, while Benjamin went ahead and was the first to descend. In this way, Nachshon merited to become a king, as it is written (Psalms 114:2), &quot;Judah became God's sanctuary, Israel His dominion.&quot; Therefore, the kingship of Israel belonged to the tribe of Judah. &quot;God is known in Judah.&quot;</p>

As we noted, Judah has “gone down” just as Joseph has been “brought down.” Joseph is about to rise to political greatness; Judah will eventually rise to moral greatness. Tamar’s deception of Judah is similar to Judah’s deception of Jacob – both involve clothes: Joseph’s blood-stained coat, Tamar’s veil. Both reach their climax with the words haker na, “please examine.” Judah forces Jacob to believe a lie. Tamar forces Judah to recognise the truth.)  We do not realise it yet, but this seems to be the moment at which he acquired the depth of character necessary for him to become the first real baal teshuva. We see this years later, when he – the man who proposed selling Joseph as a slave – becomes the man who is willing to spend the rest of his life in slavery so that his brother Benjamin can go free (Gen. 44:33). I have argued elsewhere that it is from here that we learn the principle that a penitent stands higher than even a perfectly righteous individual (Bera­khot 34b). (Jonathan Sacks, Covenant &amp; Conversation: Genesis – The Book of Beginnings(Jerusalem: Maggid, 2009), 303–314.)  Judah the penitent becomes the ancestor of Israel’s kings while Joseph, the righteous, is only a viceroy, mishneh lemelekh, second to the king.</p>

              <p>And Judah went up to him [Joseph] and said…“Your servant, my father [Jacob], said to us: ‘As you know, my wife bore me two sons. But one is gone from me, and I said, Alas! He was torn by a beast! And I have not seen him since! If you take this one [Benjamin] from me, too, and he meets with disaster, you will send my white head down to Sheol in sorrow.’…Now your servant [Judah] has pledged himself for the boy [Benjamin] to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, I shall stand guilty before my father forever.’ Therefore, please let your servant remain as a slave to my lord instead of the boy, and let the boy go back with his brothers.” Genesis 44:18–33</p>

This was a lesson to the other princes to be humble and not to introduce themselves with their title when asked who they were. A classic example is when Yehudah begs Joseph to accept him as a slave instead of his brother Binyamin, and he says ישב נא עבדך תחת הנער עבד לאדוני, “let your servant take the place of the lad as your servant, my lord.” (Genesis 44,33) We find similarly that David is described as דוד הקטן Samuel I 17,14, [although as opposed to his older brothers he had already been the king’s court musician.

The four elders add humility as a reason, comparing it to Shaul's humility in meriting kingship. However, Rebbi Tarfon ultimately concludes that Yehudah's merit came from sanctifying God's name at the sea, as the tribe of Yehudah was the first to jump in, leading to their selection as kings.</summary>

              <p>[Then] he (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said to them (i.e. his students), “I will ask [you another question].” They said to him, “Teach us our master.” He said to them, “Why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merit the kingship [of Israel]?” They said to him, “Because [Yehudah] admitted [that he impregnated] Tamar.” It happened [once] with four elders, that they were sitting in the gatehouse of Rebbi Yehoshua. [They were] Elazar Ben Matya, Chaninah Ben Chachinai, Shimon Ben Azzai, and Shimon Hateimani. And they were involved [in discussing] what Rebbi Tarfon taught to them, “Why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merit the kingship [of Israel]?” “Because [Yehudah] admitted [that he impregnated] Tamar.” They have added [another source to that explanation] on their own. “[It says in the book of Iyov], ‘… that which the wise related from their fathers and did not withhold. To them alone the earth was given…’ (Job 15:18-19)” He (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said to them (i.e. to the four elders), “Do they give reward for a transgression? But rather what is [the real] reason why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merit the kingship of Israel?” [The four elders said back to Rebbi Tarfon,] “Because he (i.e. Yehudah) saved his brother (i.e. Yosef) from death, as it is said, ‘Yehudah said to his brothers, “What benefit [will we have] if we kill our brother?”’ (Genesis 37:26) and it is written, ‘Let us go and sell him to the Ishmaelites…’ (Genesis 37:27)”8 He (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said [back] to them (i.e. the four elders), “It is enough that [the act of] saving [him] should [serve] as forgiveness for the [act of] selling [him to the Ishmaelites]. But rather what is [the real] reason why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merit the kingship of Israel?” [The four elders said back to Rebbi Tarfon,] “Because of [Yehudah’s] humility, as it is said, ‘And now your servant (i.e. Yehudah) will become a slave to my master (i.e. Yosef) instead of the boy (i.e. Binyamin).’ (Genesis 44:33) Also [the only reason that] Shaul merited the kingship [of Israel] was due to [his] humility, as it is said, ‘… may be my father will turn his attention away from the donkeys and will start to worry about us.’ (I Samuel 9:5) [Since Shaul said “us” and not “me”] he considered his servant as [important as] himself, but Shmuel did not do so, but rather [he said], ‘Your father stopped worrying about the donkeys and is worried about you, saying “What will happen to my son?”’ (I Samuel 10:2) And when he (i.e. Shaul) runs away from [accepting his newly appointed role of] leadership what does it say? ‘And they have asked God, “Is the man even here?” and God said, “Here he is hiding by the vessels.”’ (I Samuel 10:22)” He (i.e. Rebbi Tarfon) said [back] to them (i.e. the four elders), “Is not he (i.e. Yehudah) a cosigner? And in the end [it is the responsibility] of a cosigner to fulfill his pledge. But rather what is [the real] reason why did [the tribe of] Yehudah merit the kingship of Israel?” They said to him, “Teach us our master.” He said to them, “[The reason the tribe of Yehudah merited the kingship of Israel is] because they sanctified God’s name on the sea. When [all of] the tribes came and stood by the sea, this one said, ‘I will go down [into the water first]’ and this one said, ‘I will go down [into the water first].’ The tribe of Yehudah jumped up and went in first and sanctified God’s name [by doing so]. And regarding that moment it says [in Tehillim], ‘Save me God, because the water is up to my soul.’ (Psalms 69:2) And it also says, ‘When Yisrael was going out of Egypt, the children of Yakov from the nation of a foreign tongue, Yehudah was His sanctifier…’ (Psalms 114:1-2) Since Yehudah sanctified God’s name on the sea, therefore ‘…Yisrael his subjects.’ (ibid.) ”</p>

This statement is puzzling because Yehuda should have mentioned his guarantee to his father. However, Yehuda felt more pain from witnessing his father's suffering than from the risk of losing his reward in the world to come. He demonstrated this profound pain to the ruler (Yosef) to awaken his mercy for their father. Yehuda's genuine concern for his father's anguish deeply moved Yosef, who could no longer hold back his emotions. Although Yehuda's initial involvement was due to his guarantee, his progression from one level of empathy to another led him to forget his own pain entirely and focus solely on his father's. This narrative serves as a lesson for Bnei Yisrael in their relationship with their Father in Heaven, emphasizing the power of selfless devotion and empathy.</p>

            <summary>Judah expressed his willingness to be a permanent servant rather than face his father without Benjamin, as he could not bear to see Jacob's sorrow and mourning. This was to avoid suspicion of deceit, as Judah knew his father would weep constantly for Benjamin. Judah also argued that returning without Benjamin would cause Jacob such anguish that it could lead to his death, similar to the case of the woman from Tekoah in Samuel II 14:2-20. Jacob's exceptional love for Benjamin made the loss far worse if Joseph's demand were accepted.</summary>

              <p>Yehudah may also have used the argument used by the woman from Tekoah in Samuel II 14,2-20. This woman had been employed by Yoav to bring about a reconciliation between David and his son Absalom. Absalom had been exiled for killing his half-brother Amnon after the latter had raped his sister Tamar. David was very unhappy about all this, and Yoav aimed to resolve the problem. The woman from Tekoah presented a ficticious case and asked for David's judgment. The judgment involved bringing to justice the remaining son of that woman who reportedly had slain her other son. Yehudah argued that once he would return to his father without Benjamin having explained that he was quite innocent in the matter, his father, having already lost his favourite son, would certainly not bereave himself a second time by consigning Yehudah to exile; this is the reason Yehudah presented a second argument, i.e. that his father would die from heartbreak.</p>

When Pharaoh dreams of seven fat cows and seven lean cows, none of the wise men can interpret it correctly. Eventually, Joseph is brought from prison to interpret the dream, revealing seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh appoints Joseph as second in command, and Joseph prepares Egypt for the famine. When Jacob sends his sons to Egypt to buy food, Joseph tests them by placing his silver cup in Benjamin's sack.

              <p>“My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or a brother?” (Genesis 44:19).  “My lord asked his servants…” – [Judah] said to him: ‘From the outset you came against us with malice. How many countries descended to Egypt to purchase food? But you did not ask [this of] any of them. Did we, perhaps, come to take our daughter, or are you planning to marry our sister? Nevertheless, we hid nothing from you.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘I see that you are a prattler. Is there among your brothers a prattler like you?’ (Why are you the only one of the brothers talking? According to Tanḥuma (Vayigash 5), Joseph claimed that he knew through divination that Judah was not the oldest of the brothers, and therefore it was even more surprising that he was doing all the talking. )  [Judah] said to him: ‘All this that you see is because I became a guarantor for him.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘Why did you not do so on behalf of your brother when you sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver pieces, and you brought anguish to your father and said to him: “Joseph was mauled”?’ (Genesis 37:33). When Judah heard this he screamed and cried in a loud voice. (Judah screamed and cried because Joseph was not giving in to his demand to release Benjamin. )  He said: “For how will I go up to my father?” (Genesis 44:34). Judah said to Naphtali: ‘Go and see how many marketplaces there are in Egypt.’ He leapt and returned and said to him: ‘Twelve.’ Judah said to his brothers: ‘I will destroy three of them, and each and every one of you take one each, “and no man will be left among them”’ (I Samuel 14:36). His brothers said to him: ‘Egypt is not like Shekhem. If you destroy Egypt you will be destroying the entire world.’   “Joseph could not restrain himself before all those standing before him, and he called: Remove every man from before me. No man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers” (Genesis 45:1).  “He raised his voice in weeping; the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard” (Genesis 45:2).  “Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live? And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him” (Genesis 45:3).  “Joseph said to his brothers: Please approach me, and they approached. He said: I am Joseph your brother whom you sold to Egypt” (Genesis 45:4).  At that moment, “Joseph could not restrain himself” (Genesis 45:1). When Joseph saw that they had come to an agreement to destroy Egypt, Joseph said to himself: ‘It is preferable that I reveal myself to them and they will not destroy Egypt.’ Joseph said to them: ‘Did you not say that this one’s brother was dead? I will call him and he will come to you.’ He was calling: ‘Joseph son of Jacob, come to me. Joseph son of Jacob come to me.’ They were looking to the four corners of the palace. He said to them: ‘What are you looking for? “I am Joseph your brother”’ (Genesis 45:4). Immediately, their souls departed, as it is stated: “His brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3). But they did not believe him until he uncovered himself and showed them his circumcision.</p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): When Judah saw that Joseph was not appeased, he began saying to his brothers: [Why] are we standing around? We will begin with this one and wind up with Pharaoh! Now they did not know that Joseph understood their language, as stated (in Gen. 42:23): NOW THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT JOSEPH UNDERSTOOD. When Joseph saw that, he began to talk to them with supplications and with gentle language. He said to them: About this Benjamin, I want only to know who &lt; it was that &gt; advised him to steal the goblet. Did you perhaps advise him to steal the goblet? When Benjamin heard that, he said: They did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. He said to them: Swear to me. He began to swear to him. By what did he swear to him? By the separation of my brother Joseph from me, (This clause may also be translated as follows: “By the scriptural section on the separation of my brother Joseph from me (in Gen. 37:18-36).”)  I did not touch it. Now &lt; I swear &gt; neither by the launching of arrows which were sent against him, as stated (in Gen. 49:23): ARCHERS HAVE HATED HIM (Joseph); nor by the stripping with which they stripped him, as stated (in Gen. 37:23): THEY STRIPPED JOSEPH OF HIS TUNIC; nor by the throwing with which they threw him into the cistern, as stated (in Gen. 37:24): AND THEY CAST HIM INTO THE PIT; nor by the selling with which they sold him to the Ishmaelites (in vs. 28); nor by the dipping with which they dipped his tunic in the blood (in vs. 31). &lt; By none of these do I swear &gt; that they did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. Joseph said: Who will make known to me that you are swearing truthfully about your brothers? He said to him: You can know how much I love him from the names of my sons, since I set names for them on the basis of what I feared for &lt; each one &gt;. (Sot. 36b (bar); Gen. R. 93:7; Tanh., Gen. 11:40.)  He said to him: And what were the names of your sons? He said to him (in agreement with Gen. 46:21): BELA, BECHER, ASHBEL, GERA, NAAMAN, EHI, ROSH, MUPPIM, HUPPIM, AND ARD. He said to him: Why Bela (BL')? He said to him: Because my brother was swallowed up (rt.: BL') from me. Becher (BKR)? Because he was my mother's first-born (rt.: BKR). Ashbel ('ShBL)? Because my brother was captured (NShBH). Gera? Because my brother was a sojourner (ger) with &lt; merely &gt; the privileges of a transient. (Gk.: xenia, i.e., “rights of a foreigner” or “guest privileges.”)  Naaman (N'M)? Because his words were pleasing (N'M). Ehi ('HY)? Because he was my brother ('HY) from &lt; the same &gt; mother, and I had none but him. Rosh (which means &quot;head&quot;)? Because he was older than I. Muppim (MPYM)? Because he learned Torah from our father's mouth (MPY) and taught it to me. When all his brothers would return to shepherding, he would sit with my father and learn the traditions which he had received from Shem and Eber. Huppim (rt.: HPP)? Because he has been covered over (rt.: HPP) until this day. Another interpretation of Huppim: Because I did not see his wedding canopy (huppah) nor did he see my wedding canopy. Another interpretation of Huppim (rt.: HPP): Because until now I have been mourning over him and going barefoot (rt.: YHP). And Ard ('RD)? Because he brought (rt.: YRD) all of us down here. Another interpretation of ARD (from Gen. 37:35): NO, I WILL GO DOWN ('RD) MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL. Will you please not bring down ('RD) Daddy to Sheol through grief! And so Judah said (in Gen. 44:34): FOR HOW SHALL I GO UP UNTO MY FATHER &lt; IF THE LAD IS NOT WITH ME &gt;? When Joseph heard that, he was not able to suppress his compassion, as stated (in Gen. 45:1-3): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF…. AND HE WEPT ALOUD…. THEN JOSEPH SAID UNTO HIS BROTHERS: I AM JOSEPH. When he said to them: I AM {YOUR BROTHER JOSEPH} … (in vs. 3, cont.): HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE DISMAYED BECAUSE OF HIM. R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon said in the name of R. Eleazar ben Azariah: (Gen. R. 93:11.)  Now, if in the case of Joseph, when he said to his brothers: I am Joseph, they knew what they had done with him and were unable to answer him; how much the less will a creature be able to stand when the Holy One comes to dispute with each and every one of &lt; his &gt; creatures and to tell him his deeds, just as it is written (in Amos 4:13): FOR BEHOLD, THE ONE WHO FORMS THE MOUNTAINS, &lt; CREATES THE WIND, AND TELLS ONE WHAT HIS THOUGHT IS &gt; … !</p>

              <p>And in those days after Isaac's death, the Lord called a famine into all the earth. At that time ‎Pharaoh, king of Egypt, was seated upon his throne and he fell asleep that night and he ‎dreamed many dreams. And Pharaoh saw in his dream, and behold he stood by the banks of ‎the river of Egypt, which is Shichor... And as he stood there he saw, and behold, seven cows ‎fat fleshed and well favored came up out of the river, and after them came out seven cows ‎lean fleshed and ill favored. And the seven ill-favored cows did eat up the seven well favored ‎cows and their appearance was yet as bad as before. And he awoke. And he fell asleep and ‎dreamed a second time. And he saw and behold seven ears of corn came up, upon one stalk, ‎rank and good, and right after them grew up seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind. ‎And the seven thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke from ‎his dream. And in the morning when the king thought over his dreams his spirit was greatly ‎disturbed on account of his dreams. And the king hastened and issued a call unto all the ‎magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof, and they came and stood before the king. ‎And the king said unto them: I have dreamed dreams and there is no one to interpret them. ‎And they said unto the king: Relate thy dreams we pray thee, unto thy servants, that we may ‎hear them. And the king related his dreams unto them. And all of them answered and said ‎unto the king, as if with one mouth: May the king live forever! this is the interpretation of his ‎dreams: The seven fat cows that thou hast seen are seven daughters, which will be born unto ‎thee in thy last days. And the seven cows that came up after them which thou hast seen ‎swallow up the first cows are a sign that the daughters which will be born unto thee will all die ‎during the life time of the king. And what thou hast seen in thy second dream, namely, the ‎seven rank and good ears, springing up from one stalk, this is the interpretation that thou wilt ‎build unto thee seven cities in the land of Egypt in thy last days. And what thou hast seen ‎afterwards, namely, the seven blasted ears that grew up after them, and swallowed them up ‎before thine eyes, is a sign that the cities which thou shalt build shall all be destroyed in the ‎latter days during the life time of the king. And when they had spoken these words the king ‎did not incline his ears. unto their speech, nor did he quiet his heart on their account; for the ‎king in his wisdom knew well that they had not interpreted his dreams correctly. And when ‎they ceased speaking before the king, the king answered unto them saying: What are these ‎words which you have spoken unto me? Verily you have allowed lies. And falsehoods to come ‎out of your mouths, and unless you give me the correct interpretation of my dreams, all of you ‎shall be put to death.‎ And the king commanded after this, and they summoned other wise men, and they came and ‎stood before the king. And the king related unto them his dream, and they gave him the same ‎interpretation. And the anger of the king burned, and he was very wroth. And the king said ‎unto them: Verily, you have spoken lies, and your words are false hoods. And the king ‎commanded and they proclaimed throughout the whole land of Egypt, saying: It is the ‎pleasure of the king, and of his great men, that every wise man who knoweth and ‎understandeth to interpret dreams, and who will not come this day before the king, the same ‎shall be put to death. And the man that will impart the correct interpretation of his dreams he ‎will be given all that he may require of the king. And all the wise men of the land of Egypt, and ‎all the magicians, and all the sorcerers that were in the land of Egypt, and in Goshen, and in ‎Tachpanham, and in Zoan, and in the boundaries of Egypt came, and all of them stood before ‎the king. And all the governors and all the princes of the kings assembled from all the cities of ‎Egypt and they seated themselves before the king, and the king related his dreams unto the ‎wise men and his princes. And all those that were before the king were greatly astonished at ‎the vision, and all of then divided themselves in several divisions concerning the interpretation ‎of the dream. Part of them interpreted it unto him saying, seven fat cows are seven kings who ‎will rule over Egypt from the seed of the king. And the seven lean cows are seven princes who ‎will stand up against them in the latter days and destroy them; and the seven rank ears are the ‎seven great princes of Egypt who will fall in the wars of the kings by the hands of the seven ‎princes, their enemies, less powerful. And part of them interpreted the king's dream in this ‎wise, saying: The seven fat cows are the seven fortified cities of Egypt, and the seven lean ‎cows are the seven nations of the land of Canaan, who will come over the seven cities of Egypt ‎and destroy them in the latter days. And the seven rank ears, and the seven blasted ears ‎which thou hast seen in the second dream are a sign that the gov ernment of Egypt will return ‎once more unto thy seed in the latter days. And under their reign all the people of the cities of ‎Egypt will go in turn against the seven cities of Canaan, and though more powerful than them ‎selves they will destroy them and reclaim the govern ment of Egypt unto thy seed. And others ‎among them said unto the king: This is the interpretation of thy dreams: The seven fat cows ‎are seven queens which thou wilt take to wives in thy latter days, and the seven lean cows ‎signify, that all these wives will die during the life time of the king. And the seven rank ears, ‎and the seven blasted ears, which thou hast seen in thy second dream, are fourteen children, ‎who will stand up in the latter days and fight among them selves, and the seven weaker ones ‎will smite the stronger ones.‎ And still others among them said unto the king according to these words: The seven fat cows ‎are seven sons, who shall be slain in the latter days by seven sons of thy princes; and the ‎seven rank ears which thou hast seen in thy second dream are the same seven princes who ‎will be smitten by seven less powerful princes in the latter days, who will avenge on them the ‎cause of thy sons, and thus the government will once more be turned over to thy seed. And ‎the king heard all the words of these wise men, and the various interpretations of his dreams ‎none of them found favor in the eyes of the king, for the king knew in his wisdom that neither ‎of them hath spoken correctly. And this came from the Lord to pervert the words of these ‎wise men in order that Joseph be brought from the prison house to attain greatness in Egypt. ‎And when the king saw that not one among the wise men and the magicians had spoken the ‎correct words the anger of the king was exceedingly aroused and his wrath burned within him. ‎And the king commanded that all the wise men and the magicians be led away from him, and ‎all of them went away from the presence of the king in shame and contempt, and the king ‎commanded further that it be proclaimed throughout the land of Egypt that all the magicians in ‎Egypt should be slain so not one of them be left alive. And the officers of the king's guard rose ‎up and all of them drew their swords and they began smiting the magicians of Egypt and her ‎wise men. And after this Marod, the chief butler of the king, appeared and bowed down ‎before the king, and seated himself before him. And the chief butler said unto the king: May ‎the king live forever, and may his kingdom beenlarged in the land. Thou hast been angry at thy ‎servant, now two years since, and thou hast placed me into confinement, and I was ‎imprisoned for some time together with the chief baker. And there was with us in the ‎dungeon a Hebrew slave, belonging to the prince of the guards, and his name is Joseph; for his ‎master became angry with him and he placed him into the prison house, where he attended ‎upon us. And after we had been in prison for some days we dreamed dreams in the same ‎night, I and the chief baker. We dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his ‎dream. And in the morning we came to that slave and we told unto him our dreams, and he ‎interpreted them correctly, to each man according to his dream. And his interpretation was ‎fulfilled, not the least of all his words fell to the ground. And now, oh my lord and king, do not ‎slay the men of Egypt without cause! Behold the same slave is still confined in the prison ‎house of the prince of the guards, and if it please the king send for him, and let him appear ‎before thee and he will make known unto thee the correct interpretation of the dream thou ‎hast dreamed.‎ And when the king heard the words of the chief butler the king gave orders that the wise men ‎of Egypt be not slain. And the king commanded further unto his servants to bring Joseph ‎before him, and he said unto them: Go ye unto him, but do not frighten him lest he be ‎confused and unable to speak correctly. And the servants of the king went unto Joseph and ‎they took him hastily from the dungeon, and they shaved him and changed his prison ‎garments, and he came before the king. And the king was seated upon his throne in his royal ‎garments, girt with the golden Ephod, and the ornaments that were upon him sparkled, and ‎the carbuncle and the ruby and the emerald flashed, and all the precious stones that were ‎upon the head of the king were blazing, and Joseph was greatly astonished at the sight of the ‎king. And the throne upon which the king sat was covered with gold and with silver and with ‎onyx stones, and there were to it seventy steps. And it was the rule in all the land of Egypt, ‎when a man came to speak unto the king, and if he was a prince or one highly esteemed by ‎the king, that he ascended toward the king up to the thirty-first step, and the king would ‎descend to the thirty sixth step and speak unto him. And if he was of the common people, he ‎ascended to the third step, and the king descended to the fourth and spoke unto him. And it ‎was further their rule that every man who understood to speak the seventy languages, he ‎would scale the seventy steps, and while ascending he would speak until he reached the king. ‎And any man that knew not all the seventy languages was permitted to ascend the steps ‎according to the number of his languages. And it was a law in Egypt, in those days, that no man ‎could be king over them unless he knew the seventy languages. And when Joseph appeared ‎before the king he bowed down before him to the ground, and he ascended three steps, and ‎the king sat down on the fourth and he spoke unto Joseph saying: I have dreamed a dream ‎and no one can interpret it correctly. And I commanded to-day all the magicians of Egypt and ‎all the wise men came before me, and I told my dream unto them, but there was none among ‎them to interpret it correctly. And now I have heard of thee this day that thou art a wise man, ‎know ing to interpret correctly every dream. And Joseph answered Pharaoh saying: Let the ‎king relate his dream which he hath dreamed, for verily his interpretation is with God. And ‎Pharaoh related his dream unto Joseph concerning the cows and concerning the ears. And ‎when the king ceased speaking, ‎ the spirit of God in vested Joseph and he knew at once all what was to hap pen unto the king ‎in the future, and also the correct interpretation of his dream. And when Joseph spoke unto ‎the king he found grace in his eyes and the king inclined his ear and his heart unto the words of ‎Joseph. And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, let not my king believe that there are two dreams, for ‎really it is only one dream. The seven good cows and the seven good ears are seven years; and ‎the seven lean cows and the seven blasted ears are seven years likewise. The dream is one, ‎be hold there comes seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt, and there ‎shall rise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of ‎Egypt and the famine shall con sume all the inhabitants of the land. The king has dreamed but ‎one dream, and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is ‎established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass; and now I will advise thee how to save ‎thy soul and the soul of all the inhabitants of the land from the evil of the famine. Search thou ‎in all thy kingdom for a man wise and discreet, acquainted with the affairs of the state, and set ‎him over the land of Egypt. And that man whom thou will set over the land of Egypt shall ‎appoint his subordinate officers to gather in all the food of the good years that are to come ‎and lay corn in thy store houses, and this food shall be for store to the land against the seven ‎years of famine which will suffice for thee and for thy men and for all thy lands, that the land ‎perish not through the famine. And command the inhabitants of thy lands likewise, that each ‎of them gather up, from the production of his field, all sorts of food during the seven good ‎years, and to lay it up in their store houses, so that they find it during the day of the famine, to ‎be kept alive. This is the correct inter pretation of thy dream, and this is the only means of ‎saving thy soul and the souls of all thy servants. And the king answered unto Joseph and he ‎said: Who can tell and who can know whether thy words be correct: And he said unto the king: ‎This be a sign unto thee concerning the correctness of my words, and the value of my advice. ‎Behold thy wife will bear a son unto thee this day and thou wilt rejoice with him, but when this ‎child will be born unto thee, thy first born son, which hath been born two years since will die, ‎and thou wilt be comforted through the child born unto thee this day. And when Joseph had ‎finished his speech, he bowed down before the king and went away.‎ And scarcely had Joseph departed from the presence of the king when all the signs of which ‎Joseph had spoken came true. And the queen gave birth to a son on that day, and when the ‎king heard the tidings he rejoiced greatly on account of his son, and when the messenger had ‎gone away from the presence of the king, the king's servants found the first born son of the ‎king lying dead upon the ground. And there was great crying and lamenting in the king's house, ‎and the king heard and he said: What is the cause of that great weeping and lamenting which I ‎have heard in the house? And they informed the king that his first born son was dead, and he ‎knew also at the same time that all the words which Joseph had spoken were good. And the ‎king was comforted at the loss of his son through the child born unto him that day, according ‎to the words of Joseph. And after these things the king sent and he assembled all his princes ‎and subjects, and all the governors of the king's provinces, and all of them came before the ‎king, and the king spoke unto them concerning Joseph, and he said: Behold you have both ‎heard and seen everything concerning the words of this Hebrew man, and also all his signs, ‎and not the least of his words hath fallen to the ground. And now you know that his ‎interpretation of my dream is correct and that it will surely come true, do therefore consult ‎together what hath to be done in order to save the country from the famine. Investigate and ‎search ye whether there is to be found around here a man with so much wisdom and ‎knowledge in his heart and I will set him over the land. And ye have heard the advice of the ‎Hebrew man concerning this matter, to save thereby the whole land from famine, and I am ‎convinced that there is no other means of saving the land except by his advice. And they ‎answered all unto the king saying: The counsel is good which the Hebrew hath offered ‎concerning this matter. And now, oh my lord, behold all thy lands is in thy hand and ‎whatsoever pleaseth thee best do thou, and whomsoever thou choosest, and whomsoever ‎thou believest in thy wisdom to be wise enough to save the country in his wisdom he is the ‎man whom the king should appoint to have the whole land in his power. And the king said ‎unto all his officers: I have thought that forasmuch as the Lord hath made known unto this ‎Hebrew all these things there is none so discreet and wise as he is through all the land. And if it ‎seems good in your eyes, I will set him over the land, for he will deliver the country in all his ‎wisdom.‎ And all the princes answered unto the king saying, and is it not written in the laws of Egypt, ‎which should not be violated, that no man shall be the king of Egypt, nor second to the king, ‎unless he knows all the languages of the sons of man? and now, oh my lord and king, this ‎Hebrew man speaketh only the Hebrew tongue, and how can he be second to the king, who ‎does not even know our language? but send thou for him, I pray thee, and let him come ‎before thee and examine him in all matters, and as thou seest best so do. And the king said: ‎Let it be done so to-morrow, for the words you have spoken are good. And all the princes ‎went away from the presence of the king on that day. And in that night the Lord sent an angel ‎from the angels that are ministering for him, and he came unto the land of Egypt unto Joseph, ‎and the angel stood before Joseph and behold Joseph was lying on his bed in the dungeon of ‎his master's house; for he had Joseph put back into prison on account of his wife. And the ‎angel woke him up from his sleep, and Joseph arose and stood upon his feet and behold an ‎angel of the Lord was standing before him. And the angel of the Lord spoke unto Joseph and ‎he taught him all the tongues of the sons of man on that night, and he called his name ‎Jehoseph, and the angel of the Lord left him, and Joseph returned to his bed, and he was ‎greatly astonished at the vision which he had seen. And in the morning the king sent for ‎Joseph, and the servants of the king went and brought Joseph before Pharaoh. And the king ‎went unto all his princes and servants who were to sit before the king, and Joseph ascended ‎the steps of the throne, and Joseph spoke unto the king in all the tongues, speaking unto the ‎king in his going up, until he reached the king on the seventieth step, and he sat down before ‎the king. And the king rejoiced greatly over Joseph, and all the king's princes rejoiced ‎exceedingly with their king on hearing the words of Joseph. And it seemed good in the eyes of ‎the king and his princes to appoint Joseph second to the king, over the whole land of Egypt. ‎And the king spoke unto Joseph, saying: Thou hast advised me to set a wise man over the land ‎of Egypt that he might save the land from famine with his wisdom. And now forasmuch as God ‎hath shown unto thee all this, and since he hath made known unto thee all these things of ‎which thou hast spoken, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art in the whole land. And ‎thy name shall no more be called Joseph, but Zaphnath paaneah shall be thy name, and thou ‎shalt be my second, and according to thy order shall everything be done in my kingdom and at ‎thy word shall my people go out and come in, and from thy hands shall my servants and ‎princes receive their hire which is given unto them each month, and all the people of the land ‎will bow down before thee, and only on the throne will I be greater than thou.‎ And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and the king ‎dressed Joseph in royal garments, and he placed a golden crown upon his head, and a golden ‎chain around his neck. And the king made him ride in the second chariot which he had which ‎went by the side of the king's chariot, and he made him ride upon a great and powerful horse ‎of the king's horses, and to be thus con ducted through the streets of the land of Egypt. And ‎the king ordered that all those that played on musical instruments should go along with ‎Joseph, and a thousand drums, and a thousand harps, and a thousand flutes followed him. ‎And five thousand men with their flashing swords drawn in their hands marched before ‎Joseph. And twenty thousand men of the great men of the king went to the right of Joseph ‎and twenty thousand to his left, all wearing girdles of skin richly covered with gold. And all the ‎women and the maidens ascended the roofs. And they also lined the streets, joyfully cheering ‎at Joseph’s appearance and in admiration of his beauty. And all the rest of the king's people ‎went in the front and in the rear of Joseph burning frankincense and cassia and other ‎perfumeries all along the road, and they strew myrrh and aloes all over the road before ‎Joseph, and twenty men exclaimed before him with a loud voice through all the land: Have ‎you seen this man whom the king hath chosen for his second? All the affairs of the king are left ‎to his command, and whosoever will disobey his orders or fail to bow down before him the ‎same will surely die for having rebelled against the king and his second. And when those words ‎were heard all the people of Egypt bowed down to the ground before Joseph and they ‎shouted: May the king live and also his second And as the heralds approached all the people ‎bowed down amidst great rejoicing in behalf of Joseph, with drums, lutes and harps. And ‎Joseph, seated upon that beautiful horse lifted up his eyes to heaven and he exclaimed: He ‎raiseth up the poor man from the dust, from the dunghill he lifteth up the needy, oh Lord God ‎of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in thee. And Joseph marched with the servants of ‎Pharaoh and all his princes, through the entire land of Egypt, and they showed unto him all the ‎land and all the treasures of the king. And Joseph returned and he came before Pharaoh on ‎that day; and the king gave unto Joseph a possession in the land of Egypt, fields as well as ‎vineyards. And the king gave unto Joseph likewise, three thousand talents of silver and ‎thousand talents of gold and onyx stones, and bdellium and many other gifts.‎ And in the morning the king commanded all the people of Egypt to bring unto Joseph offerings ‎and gifts, and whosoever transgressed the words of the king shall die. And they erected a ‎great platform in the streets of the city, and they spread cloth over it, and whosoever brought ‎anything unto Joseph had to place it on that platform. And all the people of Egypt brought ‎their gifts to that place, one a golden earring, and one a ring, and different ornaments of gold ‎and silver and of onyx stones, and of bdellium, they cast upon the platform, every one ‎according to what he possessed. And Joseph took all these things and put them into his ‎treasures. And all the princes and governors of the king's provinces exalted Joseph, and they ‎like wise brought him many gifts when they saw that the king had selected him for his second. ‎And the king sent unto Potipheira, son of Archiron, the priest of Ou, and he took Osnath his ‎youngest daughter, and he gave her unto Joseph for wife. And the maiden was of very comely ‎appearance, a virgin whom no man ever knew; and Joseph took her for his wife. And the king ‎said unto Joseph: I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot to go out ‎or to come in, among all my people in all the land of Egypt. And Joseph was thirty years old ‎when he stood before Pharaoh, and Joseph went out from the presence of the king and he ‎was second of the king in Egypt. And the king gave unto Joseph one hundred servants to wait ‎on him in his house, and Joseph like wise sent and purchased many servants to be in the ‎house of Joseph. And then Joseph built unto himself a grand house like the palace of a king, ‎before the court of the king's residence. And in that house he made a large temple, very fine ‎in appearance, and very commodious to dwell in. Three years Joseph was in preparing these ‎things. And Joseph made unto himself a very costly throne of gold and of silver in abundance, ‎decked with onyx stones, and with bdellium, and he made upon it the likeness of the whole ‎land of Egypt, as also the likeness of the river of Egypt, which watereth all the land of Egypt. ‎Joseph dwelt securely in his house, upon the throne that he made unto himself, and the Lord ‎still increased the wisdom of Joseph. And all the inhabitants of Egypt, the servants of Pharaoh, ‎as well as the princes, loved Joseph exceedingly, for this was destined by the Lord concerning ‎Joseph. The Lord was with Joseph, and he increased continually in greatness, and his fame ‎spread throughout the earth. And Joseph had an army of warriors ready to march into the ‎field, to the number of forty thousand and six hundred men, all capable to give assistance unto ‎the king and unto Joseph against any enemy, besides he had all the princes of the king and his ‎servants and the inhabitants of Egypt beyond number. And Joseph gave unto his heroic men ‎and unto all his hosts, shields and spears and helmets and sling stones.‎ And at that time the sons of Tarshish came against all the Ishmaelites to make war with them; ‎and the sons of Tarshish subdued the Ishmaelites for many days. And the Ishmaelites were ‎few in numbers in those days, and they could not prevail against the sons of Tarshish, and they ‎were sorely grieved. And the elders of the Ishmaelites sent a written appeal unto the king of ‎Egypt, saying: We pray thee to send unto thy servants, thy princes and thy hosts to help us in ‎fighting against the sons of Tarshish, for we are greatly oppressed since many days. And ‎Pharaoh sent Joseph, with his warriors and hosts as also the warriors of the king's house. And ‎they went into the land of Havilah to the Ishmael ites to assist them against the sons of ‎Tarshish. And the sons of Ishmael fought against the sons of Tarshish, and Joseph smote the ‎Tarshishites, and he took possession of their lands, and the sons of Ishmael dwell therein even ‎unto this day. And when the land of Tarshish was subdued, all the Tarshishites fled and came ‎to the boundary of the sons of Javan, and Joseph with all his men returned into the land of ‎Egypt—not one of them was missing. And it was when the year came around, which was the ‎second year of Joseph’s reigning over Egypt, the Lord gave great plenty throughout the land ‎for seven years, according to the words of Joseph, for the Lord hath blessed all the ‎productions of the land in those days for seven years, and they ate and were exceedingly ‎satisfied. And at that time Joseph appointed his officers to collect all the food of those good ‎years, and they heaped up the corn year after year, and they placed it into Joseph’s treasuries. ‎And at all times when they gathered the food Joseph commanded that the corn be brought in ‎the ears and with it also some of the soil of the field that it be not spoilt. And Joseph did in this ‎wise year after year, and he gathered up corn in great abundance even like the sand of the ‎sea, for his treasuries were beyond number. And the inhabitants of Egypt did likewise, and ‎they gathered up abundance of food into their storehouses, from all the food of the seven ‎good years; but they did not prepare it as Joseph did it. And all the food that Joseph and all the ‎people of Egypt heaped up, was to be stored away for the seven years of famine to sustain ‎the whole land. And all the inhabitants of Egypt filled their treasuries and store houses with ‎corn for their support in the famine. And Joseph stored all the food he gathered up, into the ‎cities of Egypt, and he closed up all the stores and placed guards around them. And Osnath, ‎the daughter of Potipheira, wife of Joseph, bare unto him two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, ‎and Joseph was thirty-four years of age when he begat them.‎ And the boys grew up and they followed his ways and his instructions. They did not turn ‎neither to the right nor to the left from the path pointed out by their father. And the Lord was ‎with them and they had understanding, and they were versed in all wisdom and all the affairs ‎of the government. And all the princes of the king and the prominent inhabitants of Egypt ‎praised those boys, and they grew up amidst the sons of the king. And the seven years of ‎plenty that were throughout the land were at an end, and after them came seven years of ‎famine as Joseph had spoken, and the famine was in all the earth. And when the people of ‎Egypt saw that the famine had commenced throughout the land, they opened all their ‎storehouses of corn, for the famine grew very powerful upon them. And they found all the ‎food in their treasuries full of worms unfit for food. And the famine grew stronger in all the ‎land, and the inhabitants of Egypt came and cried out before Pharaoh, for the famine was ‎heavy upon them, and they said unto Pharaoh: Give food unto thy servants and let us not ‎starve before thine eyes, we and our children. And Pharaoh answered them saying: And why ‎are you crying unto me? Behold during the seven years of plenty Joseph hath commanded you ‎to gather up corn for the years of famine, and wherefore have you not hearkened unto his ‎voice. And the Egyptians answered unto the king: As thy soul liveth, oh our lord, whatsoever ‎Joseph hath spoken thy servants hath done. For verily thy servants hath gathered up all the ‎food of their fields, in the seven years of plenty and we hath placed it into our treasuries even ‎to this day. And when the famine grew powerful upon thy servants we opened our treasuries, ‎and behold all our food is full of worms unfit to eat. And when the king heard all that had ‎befallen the inhabitants of Egypt, the king was exceedingly afraid and terrified on account of ‎the famine, and the king answered unto the people saying: Since this has occurred unto you, ‎go ye unto Joseph and do whatsoever he will say unto you. Do not disobey his words. And all ‎the Egyptians went and came before Joseph and they said unto him: Give us food, and ‎wherefore shall we die of hunger before thee, for behold we have gathered up our produce ‎during the seven years as thou hast commanded, and we placed it into the store houses, and ‎now such and such hath happened unto us. And when Joseph heard the words of the ‎Egyptians and what had befallen them, Joseph opened the stores of his food and he sold it ‎unto the Egyptians. And the famine was upon the face of the whole earth, in the other lands ‎as well as in Egypt. And in Egypt alone was food for sale and all the inhabitants of Egypt came ‎unto Joseph to buy their food, for the famine was powerful over them and all their produce ‎had been spoilt. And Joseph sold it unto all the Egyptians day after day. And all the inhabitants ‎of the land of Canaan, and the Philistines, and those on the other side of Jordan, and the sons ‎of the east and of all the cities of the earth far and near heard that there was corn for sale in ‎Egypt, and all of them came into Egypt to purchase for the famine was heavy upon them.‎ And Joseph opened his storehouses and placed officers over them, and they sold food to all ‎comers day after day. And Joseph knew that his brothers also would come into Egypt to buy ‎food, for the famine prevailed in all the earth. And Joseph commanded his people to ‎pronounce it through all Egypt saying: It is the pleasure of the king and his second and their ‎great men that everyone wishing to buy corn in Egypt should not send his servants but his ‎sons. And any man in Egypt or Canaan that cometh from all these lands to purchase corn in ‎Egypt, and he will go and sell it in any land the same shall be put to death. For no man will be ‎allowed to buy more than to supply his household. And further, every man that cometh ‎leading two or three beasts shall die, for no man shall bring more than his own beast. And ‎Joseph placed guards in the gates of Egypt, and he commanded them, saying: Every man that ‎cometh to buy food shall not be permitted until he hath written down his name, and the ‎name of his father, and the name of his father's father, and all the names registered through ‎the day shall be forwarded unto me in the evening, that I may know their names. And Joseph ‎did all these things and he made all these laws in order to know when his brothers. should ‎come to Egypt to buy food. And day after day Joseph’s men announced these laws through ‎the land so that all the people in the country east and west and all the earth knew the laws ‎which Joseph made in Egypt. And all the people, from all the ends of the earth came to buy ‎food in Egypt, and then they went on their way. And the princes of Egypt did as Joseph had ‎commanded, and all that came into Egypt to buy food were caused by the guards to write ‎down their names and the names of their father, and the register was brought unto Joseph in ‎the evening of each day. ‎And Jacob heard after this that there was food for sale in Egypt, and he called upon his sons to go into ‎Egypt to purchase corn, for the famine was heavy upon them likewise. And he said unto them: Behold, ‎I have heard there is corn for sale in Egypt, and all the world goes thither to purchase, and now why ‎should ye seventy be better than all the people of the earth? Go ye likewise down into Egypt and ‎purchase a little food among the many that go thither.   ‎  And Jacob, their father, commanded unto them, saying: When you come to the city do not ‎enter all of you by one gate, on account of the inhabitants of the land. And the sons of Jacob ‎went forth, and they went unto Egypt and they did according to all that their father, Jacob, had ‎commanded them. But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brothers, for he ‎said: Lest, peradventure, mischief befall him on the way, like his brother. And ten only of ‎Jacob's sons went away. And while the ten sons of Jacob were going along on their way, they ‎repented of Joseph and of what they had done unto him, and they spoke unto each other ‎saying: Behold, we know that our brother Joseph went down into Egypt, and now let us search ‎for him wherever we go, and if we find him, we will take him away from his master for a ‎ransom; and if not, even by force, though we had to die on his account. And the sons of Jacob ‎agreed upon this matter, and they had decided to deliver Joseph from the hands of his ‎master. The sons of Jacob went down into Egypt. And when they approached Egypt they ‎separated from each other and they entered Egypt through ten gates. And the gatemen ‎registered their names on the same day and brought them unto Joseph in the evening. And ‎Joseph read the names handed him by the keepers of the gates, and he found that his ‎brothers had entered through ten different gates of the city. And Joseph commanded at once, ‎that it be pro claimed through all the land of Egypt, saying: All the guards of the storehouses go ‎ye forth and close up your corn stores so that only one be opened, where all the comers may ‎purchase. And all the officers of Joseph did so at that time, and they closed up all the stores ‎and only one they left open. And Joseph gave the names of his brothers in writing to the ‎officer placed over the open storehouse, and he said unto him: All those that come unto thee ‎to purchase corn ask for their names, and when men of those names come unto thee seize ‎them and send them unto me. And the sons of Jacob, when they came into the midst of the ‎city, they met again in the city to seek their brother before buying their food. And they went ‎to the walls of the harlots and they searched for Joseph in the public streets for three days. ‎For they thought Joseph might come thither, as he was of comely appearance and of fine ‎figure. And the sons of Jacob searched three days in those walls but they found him not. And ‎the man placed over the storehouse sought for the names which Joseph had given unto him, ‎but he found them not, and he sent unto Joseph saying: Three days have passed and yet the ‎men whose names thou hast given unto me did not come before me. And Joseph sent his ‎servants to search for the men in all Egypt and to bring them before Joseph. And Joseph’s ‎servants went and passed through all Egypt, but they found them not, and they went unto ‎Goshen, but they were not there. And they searched the city of Raamses, and yet they could ‎not find them.‎ And the men returned to Joseph and informed him thereof, and Joseph once more ‎dispatched sixteen of his servants to seek his brothers; and they went and dispersed ‎themselves towards the four corners of the city. And four of the servants went into the house ‎of the harlots and they found the ten men there seeking their brother. And those four men ‎took them, and they brought them before Joseph, and they bowed down before him to the ‎ground. And Joseph was seated upon his throne in his temple, robed in garments of white and ‎purple and upon his head was a large crown of gold and all the valiant men were around ‎him.And the sons of Jacob saw him, and his beautiful appearance and dignity surprised them, ‎and they once more bowed down before him to the ground, and when Joseph saw his ‎brothers he recognized them, but they recognized him not, because he was too great in their ‎eyes. And Joseph spoke unto them saying: Whence do you come? And all of them answered, ‎saying: Thy servants came from the land of Canaan to purchase food, for verily the famine is ‎heavy in all the earth, and when thy servants heard that there was food in Egypt we came ‎amongst the others to buy corn for our support. And Joseph answered unto them saying: And ‎if you have come to purchase food as ye have said, wherefore did you come through ten ‎different gates of the city? This cannot be otherwise but that you have come to spy out the ‎whole land. And they all together answered unto Joseph: Nay, my lord, we are honest men. ‎Thy servants have never been spies, but we have come to purchase food. For all of us, thy ‎servants, are the sons of one man, in the land of Canaan, and our father commanded unto us ‎saying: When you come unto the city do not enter into one gate, on account of the inhabitants ‎of the land. And Joseph answered unto them once more and he said: That is precisely what I ‎said unto you, that you have come to spy out the whole land, and, therefore, you have ‎entered ten different gates to see the nakedness of the land. And verily every one that comes ‎to purchase doth so, and he goeth his way; but ye are now three days in the land. And what ‎have ye done among the walls of the harlots, whence ye have been these three days? Verily ‎spies only will do such things. And they said unto Joseph: Far be it from our lord to speak these ‎words, for we are twelve brothers, the sons of our father, Jacob, in the land of Canaan, the ‎son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the Hebrew. And behold the youngest is this day with our ‎father, and one is not here. For he hath been lost from us, and we said: Peradventure he is in ‎this land. And we searched for him in all the land of Egypt, and we came unto the house of the ‎harlots also to seek him there. And Joseph said unto them: And have you searched for him in ‎all the earth, that there is not left another place but Egypt to seek him in?‎ ‎ And what should your brother do in the house of the harlots, even though he be in Egypt, for ‎have ye not said that you are of the sons of Isaac, the son of Abraham, and what should the ‎sons of Jacob do in the house of the harlots? And they said unto him: Because we have heard ‎that the Ishmaelites have stolen him from us, and we were informed that they had sold him ‎into Egypt. And thy servant, our brother, is of exceeding comely appearance and figure, and ‎we thought he can be nowhere else but in the house of the harlots, and therefore we went ‎thither to seek and to redeem him. And Joseph answered unto them, saying: Verily, you are ‎speaking falsehoods, and your words are lies to say of yourselves that you are the sons of ‎Abraham. As Pharaoh liveth, you are spies; therefore you went into the house of the harlots ‎that no man should know you. And Joseph said further: And supposing you find your brother ‎and his master require of you an immense ransom, would you give it for him? And they ‎answered him: If he would not deliver our brother, then we would slay him and take our ‎brother and go our ways. And Joseph said unto them: That is precisely what I have said unto ‎you, you are spies, for you have come to slay the inhabitants of the land. For verily we have ‎heard it, that two of your brothers hath slain all the inhabitants of Shechem in the land of ‎Canaan on account of your sister, and now you come to do the same thing in Egypt on account ‎of your brother. But hereby will I know that you are honest people, if you send one of your ‎brothers to take your youngest brother from your father and to bring him hither unto me. And ‎by doing this thing I will know that you are true men. Joseph called unto seventy of his most ‎valiant men and said unto them: Take these men and put them into confinement, and these ‎powerful men took the ten brothers and they seized them and kept them in prison for three ‎days. And on the third day, Joseph brought them out of the prison, and said unto them: If you ‎be true men do you this and you shall live. Let one of your brothers be bound in the house of ‎the prison, and ye go, carry corn for the famine of your houses into the land of Canaan, and ‎take your youngest brother and bring him hither unto me, and thus shall I know that you are ‎true men if you will do this thing. And Joseph withdrew from them into a chamber and wept ‎bitterly, for his compassion was aroused in their behalf. And he washed his face and returned ‎unto them. And he took Simeon from among them and ordered him to be bound. But Simeon ‎would not permit himself to be bound, and they could not do it, for Simeon was a very ‎powerful man.‎ And Joseph called unto the warriors, and seventy of the most powerful men among them ‎appeared before him with drawn swords in their hand. And the sons of Jacob were terrified ‎before them, and Joseph said unto them: Seize ye upon this man, and confine him in the ‎prison house until his brothers shall return unto him. And Joseph’s men hastened, and all of ‎them seized Simeon to bind him. And Simeon shouted at them a bitter and terrible shouting, ‎and his voice was heard to a great distance, and all the powerful men of Joseph became ‎terrified at his great shouting, and they fell down upon their faces, and they were greatly ‎afraid and fled. And all the other men which were around Joseph fled likewise for they were ‎afraid of their lives, and no one remained there but Joseph and Manasseh, his son. And when ‎Manasseh, the son of Joseph, saw Simeon’s strength his anger was greatly aroused and he ‎rose up against Simeon and Manasseh struck Simeon a heavy blow with his fist on his neck. ‎And Simeon was pacified, and Manasseh seized Simeon and he overpowered him, and he ‎bound him and brought him into the prison house. And all the sons of Jacob were greatly ‎astonished at the work of that lad. And Simeon said unto his brothers: Let no one among ye ‎think that this was the blow of an Egyptian, for it is really a blow of one of the house of our ‎father, and after this Joseph commanded that the officer set over the store house to fill the ‎vessels be called upon to fill the sacks of those men with corn as much as they could carry, and ‎to return and to place every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the ‎road, and thus they did unto them. And Joseph commanded them: Take ye heed not to ‎trespass my words, and that you bring your brother according as I have spoken unto you. And ‎when you shall have brought your brother unto me, I will know that you are true men, and you ‎may do business in the land. And I will restore your brother unto you, and you may return in ‎peace unto your father, and all together answered unto him and said: As our lord hath spoken ‎so shall we do. And they bowed down before him to the ground, and each of them lifted his ‎corn upon his ass, and they left to go unto the land of Canaan, unto their father. And when ‎they came to the inn, Levi opened his sack to give provender unto his ass, and he saw and ‎behold his money in its weight was still in his sack. And the man was greatly afraid, and he said ‎unto his brothers: My money is restored, and lo it is even in my sack. And the men were ‎greatly afraid and they said: What is this that God hath done unto us, and all of them said: ‎Where is the kindness of our Lord for our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to deliver us ‎this day into the hands of the kings of Egypt to mock us. And Judah said unto them and are we ‎not guilty, and have we not sinned against the Lord our God in having sold our brother, our ‎own flesh? And why do you say where are the mercies of God against our forefathers. Reuben ‎said unto them: And have I not said unto you, do not sin against the child, but you would not ‎listen unto me. And now God requireth his blood of us, and why do you say where are the ‎mercies of our God to our forefathers, whereas we hath sinned against the Lord.‎ And when Jacob heard the words of the infants of his sons, he wept bitterly and his ‎compassion was aroused in their behalf. And Jacob called unto his sons, and all of them came ‎unto him, and they sat down before him. And he said unto them: See ye not that your children ‎are this day crying before me: Oh give us bread and there is none, and now go ye once more ‎and buy for us a little food. And Judah answered and said unto his father: If thou wilt send the ‎lad with us, then we will go down and purchase food for thee, but if thou wilt not send him ‎along we shall not go down; for the man hath admonished us saying: You shall not see my face ‎unless your brother be with you. For the king of Egypt is great and powerful, and if we go unto ‎him without our brother, then all of us will die. Knowest thou not, and hast thou not heard it, ‎that this king is exceedingly brave and wise and there is none like him in all the earth? Behold ‎we have seen all the kings of the earth yet have we seen none like the king of Egypt. For there ‎is none greater among the kings of the earth than Abimelech, king of the Philistines, but the ‎king of Egypt is greater and mightier than he, and Abimelech could not compare with one of his ‎princes. Thou hast not seen, oh my father, his temple and his throne and his servants that ‎stand before him. Thou hast not seen this king seated upon his throne in his beauty and in the ‎dignity of royalty, in kingly garments, with a large crown of gold upon his head. Thou hast not ‎seen the glory and the grandeur which God hath bestowed upon him, for there is none like ‎him in all the earth. Thou hast not seen, oh my father, the wisdom, understanding and ‎knowledge which God has placed within his heart, nor his pleasant voice when he spoke unto ‎us. We don’t know, oh my father, who has made known unto him our names and all the ‎incidents of our lives. He has inquired even concerning thee, saying: Is your father still alive ‎and is peace with him. Thou hast not seen that all the affairs of the Egyptian government are ‎under his control without even asking Pharaoh his master. Thou hast not seen the awe and the ‎terror which he exercises over all the Egyptians, and even we, when on leaving his presence, ‎we concluded to do unto Egypt as we have done to all the cities of the Amorites, and yet, ‎though our anger was burning exceedingly concerning his words, considering us as spies, when ‎we came before him once more his fear fell upon all of us and no man will be able to speak ‎unto him a word great or small. And now, our father, do send the lad along with us, and we will ‎go down and purchase food for thee for our support that we die not of hunger.‎ And when Jacob heard the words of the infants of his sons, he wept bitterly and his ‎compassion was aroused in their behalf. And Jacob called unto his sons, and all of them came ‎unto him, and they sat down before him. And he said unto them: See ye not that your children ‎are this day crying before me: Oh give us bread and there is none, and now go ye once more ‎and buy for us a little food. And Judah answered and said unto his father: If thou wilt send the ‎lad with us, then we will go down and purchase food for thee, but if thou wilt not send him ‎along we shall not go down; for the man hath admonished us saying: You shall not see my face ‎unless your brother be with you. For the king of Egypt is great and powerful, and if we go unto ‎him without our brother, then all of us will die. Knowest thou not, and hast thou not heard it, ‎that this king is exceedingly brave and wise and there is none like him in all the earth? Behold ‎we have seen all the kings of the earth yet have we seen none like the king of Egypt. For there ‎is none greater among the kings of the earth than Abimelech, king of the Philistines, but the ‎king of Egypt is greater and mightier than he, and Abimelech could not compare with one of his ‎princes. Thou hast not seen, oh my father, his temple and his throne and his servants that ‎stand before him. Thou hast not seen this king seated upon his throne in his beauty and in the ‎dignity of royalty, in kingly garments, with a large crown of gold upon his head. Thou hast not ‎seen the glory and the grandeur which God hath bestowed upon him, for there is none like ‎him in all the earth. Thou hast not seen, oh my father, the wisdom, understanding and ‎knowledge which God has placed within his heart, nor his pleasant voice when he spoke unto ‎us. We don’t know, oh my father, who has made known unto him our names and all the ‎incidents of our lives. He has inquired even concerning thee, saying: Is your father still alive ‎and is peace with him. Thou hast not seen that all the affairs of the Egyptian government are ‎under his control without even asking Pharaoh his master. Thou hast not seen the awe and the ‎terror which he exercises over all the Egyptians, and even we, when on leaving his presence, ‎we concluded to do unto Egypt as we have done to all the cities of the Amorites, and yet, ‎though our anger was burning exceedingly concerning his words, considering us as spies, when ‎we came before him once more his fear fell upon all of us and no man will be able to speak ‎unto him a word great or small. And now, our father, do send the lad along with us, and we will ‎go down and purchase food for thee for our support that we die not of hunger. And Jacob said ‎unto them: Ye have dealt ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother. What is ‎this thing that ye have done unto me? And Judah said unto his father, Jacob, deliver thou the ‎lad into my hands, and we will go down into Egypt and buy food and return, and if we come ‎back and the lad is not with us, then let me bear the blame forever.‎ Hast thou seen all our little infants weeping before thee for bread, and there is no power in ‎thine hands to give it. And now let thy mercy be aroused in their behalf, and send our brother ‎along with us that we may go. And where are the mercies of our Lord to our forefathers in thy ‎belief that the king of Egypt will take away thy son? As the Lord liveth I shall not die in peace ‎unless I bring him and set him before thee. But pray thou to the Lord our God in our behalf, to ‎grant us grace and to give us kindness and mercy before the king of Egypt and his men, for had ‎we not tarried we should have twice since returned unto thee with thy son. And Jacob said ‎unto his sons: I trust in the Lord my God that he will deliver you and grant you grace in the eyes ‎of the king of Egypt and in the eyes of his men. And now rise ye and go down to the man and ‎carry down to him a present from whatsoever is found in the land, and God Almighty give you , ‎mercy before the man, that he may send to you Benjamin and Simeon your brother. And the ‎men rose up and they took Benjamin their brother and a rich present of the choice ‎productions of the land and double money they took in their hands likewise. And Jacob gave ‎his sons special orders concerning Benjamin, saying: Take ye heed to protect him on the road ‎on which you are going and do not separate yourselves from him neither on the road or in ‎Egypt. And Jacob rose up from his sons, and he spread out his hands and he prayed to the Lord ‎in behalf of his sons saying: Oh Lord God of heaven and God of the earth, remember unto our ‎father Abraham thy covenant established with him, remember Isaac my father and do mercy ‎with my sons; and do not deliver them into the hands of the king of Egypt. Do it, oh Lord, for ‎the sake of thy mercy, and deliver all my sons and save them from the powers of Egypt and ‎send unto them their two brothers. And all the wives of the sons of Jacob with little ones lifted ‎up their eyes to heaven and they wept and cried unto the Lord that he should deliver their ‎husbands and parents from the hands of the Egyptian king. And Jacob wrote a letter unto the ‎king of Egypt placing it into the hands of Judah and his sons, saying: From thy servant Jacob, ‎son of Isaac, son of Abraham, prince of the Lord, unto Zophnath-paaneah, the mighty and wise ‎king of Egypt, peace! It will be known unto my lord the king of Egypt, that the famine is very ‎heavy upon us in the land of Canaan, and I have sent my sons unto thee to purchase for us ‎some food for our support. And my sons came around me, and I being very old and unable to ‎see with mine eyes because they have become very heavy with age, and of weeping every ‎day continuously for my son Joseph who had been lost from before me, and I have ‎commanded my sons that on reaching Egypt they should not enter the city together by one ‎gate on account of the inhabitants of the land. And I have also commanded them to pass ‎through Egypt and to seek my son Joseph peradventure they might find him there. And my ‎sons have done so and thou hast regarded them as spies against the land.  Verily, we have heard of thee that thou art wise and exceedingly reasonable, and couldst thou ‎not see on their faces that they cannot be spies? We have also heard that thou hast ‎interpreted Pharaoh’s dream acquainting him with this famine long before its coming and thy ‎words have proven to be correct, and how couldst thou not know in thy wisdom whether my ‎sons be spies or not? And now, oh my lord and king, behold I have sent before thee my son ‎Benjamin, according as thou hast spoken unto my sons, and I beseech thee to keep thine eye ‎on him until he be returned unto me in peace with his brethren. And knowest thou not, or ‎hast thou not heard what our God hath done unto Pharaoh when he took our mother Sarah? ‎and what God hath done unto Abimelech king of the Philistines concerning her, and also what ‎our father Abraham hath done unto the five kings of Elam, all of whom he hath smitten with a ‎small number of his men, and also what my two sons Simeon and Levi have done unto the ‎eight cities of the Amorites, which they have destroyed on account of their sister Dinah! And ‎now what will they not do in behalf of Benjamin, their brother, in whom they have found ‎comfort for the loss of his brother Joseph, if they see that the hand of any people was raised ‎against him on his account? Knowest thou not, oh king of Egypt, that the power of our God is ‎with us, and that our Lord heareth our prayer at all times, and that he forsaketh us not through ‎all the days? and when my sons informed me of thy actions I have not as yet called upon the ‎Lord against thee, or else thou shouldst have perished with thy men before my son Benjamin ‎could come before thee. But I have considered that my son Simeon was in thy house and thou ‎mightst, perhaps, do well with him, therefore I have not done unto thee this thing. And now ‎behold, my son Benjamin cometh unto thee with my other sons, take thou heed of him and ‎keep thine eyes upon him and God will keep his eyes upon thee and on all thy government. ‎And now, behold, I have disclosed unto thee all that was within, my heart, and behold my sons ‎are coming unto thee with their brother. I pray thee and the face of the whole earth in their ‎behalf, and send them away with their brothers in peace. And Jacob gave this letter unto his ‎sons to deliver by the hands of Judah unto the king of Egypt. - - And the sons of Jacob arose, ‎and they took Benjamin, and all the presents, and they went away, and they came into the ‎land of Egypt and they stood before Joseph. And Joseph saw his brother Benjamin with them, ‎and Joseph bade them peace, and these men came in the house of Joseph. And Joseph ‎commanded the steward to prepare a great meal for his brothers to eat. And he did so unto ‎them. And it was at noontime, and Joseph sent unto the men to come before him with ‎Benjamin.‎ And the men informed the steward of Joseph’s house concerning the money that was ‎returned in their sacks, and he said unto them: Peace be to you, fear not. And he brought out ‎unto them their brother Simeon. And Simeon said unto his brothers: My lord the king of Egypt ‎has dealt very kindly with me; he did not continue my confinement as you have seen with your ‎eyes. For on your leaving this city he had me released and he hath shown unto me kindness in ‎his own house. And Judah took Benjamin by the hand and they came before Joseph, and they ‎bowed down before him to the ground. And the men gave their presents unto Joseph and ‎they sat down before him. And Joseph said unto them: Is there peace with you and peace ‎with your children and peace unto your aged father? And they said peace. And Judah took the ‎letter which Jacob had sent, and he put it into the hands of Joseph. And Joseph read the letter ‎and he recognized his father's hand writing and he felt like weeping. And Joseph could not ‎refrain himself, and he entered into his chamber and he wept a great weeping, and then he ‎came out again, and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, and he said: Is this ‎your brother of whom ye spoke unto me? And Benjamin came near unto Joseph, and Joseph ‎placed his hand upon his head and said unto him: God be gracious unto thee, my son And ‎when Joseph saw his brother, the son of his mother, he sought once more where to weep, ‎and he entered into his chamber and he wept there. And he washed his face and went out ‎and refrained himself and said: Set on bread. And in the hand of Joseph was a cup from which ‎he drank, and it was of silver studded with onyx stones and bdellium, in beauty exceeding. ‎And Joseph struck this cup before the eyes of his brothers when they sat down to eat with ‎him. And Joseph said unto the men: I divine by this cup that Reuben is the first born, and ‎Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun are sons of one mother. Set down ‎therefore to eat according to your birth. And he seated the others likewise according to their ‎birth. And Joseph said: I' know that this, your youngest brother, hath no brother, and I, like ‎him, have no brother, therefore let him sit down and eat with me. And Benjamin went up ‎before the face of Joseph and he seated himself upon the throne. And when the men saw ‎what Joseph did they wondered greatly at these things, and the men ate and drank with ‎Joseph at that time. And he gave them presents at that time, and Joseph gave an additional ‎present unto Benjamin. And when Manasseh and Ephraim saw the act of their father they also ‎gave their presents unto Benjamin, and Osnath gave him also a present, so that there were in ‎Benjamin’s hand five presents. And Joseph brought wine for them to drink, but they would ‎not drink it, and they said, from the day that our brother Joseph hath been lost unto us, we did ‎not drink any wine nor did we eat any delicious food. And Joseph swore and he urged them ‎exceedingly and they drank and became intoxicated with him on that day.‎ And after this Joseph turned unto his brother Benjamin to speak with him. And Benjamin was ‎still sitting upon the throne before Joseph. And Joseph said unto him: Hast thou any children? ‎And he said: Thy servant hath ten sons, and these are their names: Bela, and Becher, and ‎Ashbal, and Gera, and Naaman, and Achi, and Rosh, and Mupim, and Chupim, and Ord, and I ‎called their names after my brother whom I have not seen. And Joseph commanded and they ‎brought before him the charts of the stars whereby Joseph knew all the future things, and ‎Joseph said unto Benjamin: I have heard that the Hebrews know all things of wisdom, art thou ‎able to understand anything in this? And Benjamin said: Thy servant is acquainted with all ‎wisdom that my father taught me. And Joseph said unto Benjamin: Look then into this ‎instrument, and ascertain where thy brother Joseph is in Egypt, of whom you said he had been ‎brought down into Egypt. And Joseph looked through that instrument at the celestial map of ‎the stars, and he studied it to know where his brother was. And Benjamin divided all the land ‎of Egypt into four quarters, and he found his brother Joseph to be sitting before him upon the ‎throne, and Benjamin was greatly astonished. And Joseph saw the astonishment of his ‎brother and he said unto Benjamin: What seest thou and what astonisheth thee so. And ‎Benjamin said unto Joseph: I see through this thing, that my brother Joseph sitteth here with ‎me upon the throne. And Joseph said unto him: I am really thy brother Joseph, but do not ‎reveal this thing unto thy brothers. Behold I will send thee away with them. And when they ‎are gone, I will command to have them brought back unto the city. And I will take thee away ‎from them. And if they jeopardize their lives in fighting for your sake then I will be convinced ‎that they have repented of what they had done unto me, and I will make myself known unto ‎them. And if they abandon thee, then I will take thee, and thou shalt dwell with me, and I will ‎fight with them and then let them go without making myself known unto them. At that time ‎Joseph commanded the steward of his house to fill their sacks with food and to put every ‎man’s money into his sack, and to place the silver cup into the sack of Benjamin, and to give ‎them provision for their way. And it was done unto them so. And it was in the morning the ‎men arose early and they lifted the corn upon their asses and they went their way with ‎Benjamin and with their brother Simeon towards the land of Canaan. And when they were ‎gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward: Up, follow after the ‎men, before they are at a great distance from Egypt, and say unto them: Wherefore have ye ‎stolen the cup of my master? And Joseph’s steward rose up and followed them and he ‎overtook them, and he spoke unto them all the words of Joseph. And when they heard these ‎words their anger was greatly aroused, and they said: With whomsoever the cup of thy master ‎be found both let him die and we likewise will be slaves unto you. Then they speedily took every man his sack from the ass to the ground. And he searched their ‎sacks and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. Then they all rent their clothes and they ‎returned unto the city. And they beat Benjamin continually on the road until he came into the ‎city, and they stood before Joseph. And Judah’s anger was kindled and he said: This man hath ‎brought me back to destroy all Egypt this day. And when the men entered Joseph’s house ‎they found Joseph seated upon his throne and all his warriors stood before him to the right ‎and to the left. And Joseph said unto them: What deed is this that ye have done, to take my ‎silver cup and go your way? But I know that you have taken this cup in order to ascertain ‎thereby where your brother is in all the earth. And Judah said: What shall we say unto my lord; ‎what shall we speak, or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquities of thy ‎servants this day, therefore, this thing hath been done unto us. And Joseph rose up and ‎seized upon Benjamin and he took him from his brethren by force, and when he came into the ‎house he locked the door before them, and then Joseph commanded unto his steward and he ‎said unto them: Thus saith the king: Go ye in peace to your father, for behold I have taken, the ‎man in whose hands my cup was found. And when Judah heard the actions of Joseph toward ‎them,‎</p>

              <p>he came nigh unto Joseph and he forced the door open and he came with his brethren before ‎Joseph. And Judah said unto Joseph: Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in ‎my lord's ear and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: And Joseph said unto him: ‎Speak! And Judah spoke unto Joseph while his brethren stood before them. And Judah said ‎unto Joseph: Be hold when we first came unto my lord to purchase food, thou hast taken us ‎for spies against this land, and we have brought our brother Benjamin into thy presence. And ‎why dost thou further carry on thy mockery with us? And now I pray, may the king hearken ‎unto my words and release our brother that he go home with us to our father lest thou perish ‎this day, and all the inhabitants of Egypt. Knowest thou not what my two brothers, Simeon and ‎Levi, have done unto the city of Shechem and unto the seven cities of the Amorites on ‎account of our sister Dinah and what will they not do on account of their brother Benjamin And ‎I with my strength, greater and more powerful than both of them, will come over thee and all ‎thy land this very day if thou do not willingly release our brother. Hast thou not heard what our ‎God who hath chosen us has done unto Pharaoh on account of our mother Sarah, whom he ‎had taken away from our father? How the Lord hath smitten him and all his household with ‎terrible plagues that even to this day all the Egyptians speak to one another of that great ‎wonder. And even so will our God do unto thee on account of Benjamin whom thou takest ‎from our father this day on account of the evils which thou art bringing over us in thy land this ‎day. For our God will remember his covenant with Abraham our father and he will bring evil ‎upon thee because thou hast grieved the soul of our father this day. And do thou listen, I pray ‎thee, unto my words which I have spoken unto thee this day, and send away our brother that ‎he may go lest thou and all the people of thy lord will die by my sword, for all of you cannot ‎prevail against me.‎</p>

              <p>And Joseph answered unto Judah saying: Why dost thou open thy mouth so wide concerning ‎these words, exalting thyself over us, saying that there is great strength within 7 As Pharaoh ‎liveth, if I order my powerful men to fight against you, verily thou and thy brothers here would ‎soon find themselves in the mud. And Judah said unto Joseph: It were better for thee and thy ‎men to fear me. As the Lord liveth, if I once draw my sword I will not return it unto its scabbard ‎until I have slain all Egypt this day, and I will begin with thee and finish up with Pharaoh thy ‎lord. And Joseph answered and said unto him: Verily, not thou alone hast all the strength. I ‎myself am more powerful than thou art, and if thou drawest thy sword I will place it upon ‎thine neck and upon the neck of all those thy brothers. And Judah said unto him: Verily, if I ‎open my mouth against thee this day, I can swallow thee up, and thou wilt be forgotten from ‎the earth and be lost from thy kingdom. And Joseph answered: Verily, if thou openest thy ‎mouth I have power and strength to close it with a big rock until thou canst not utter a word. ‎Behold how many stones there are before us, and can I not take one of them and put it into ‎thy mouth and break thy jaws? And Judah said: God be a witness between us, that I have not ‎sought to war with thee from the beginning even until now, only to give us our brother to go ‎away from thee. And Joseph answered and said: As Pharaoh liveth, if all the kings of Canaan ‎were to come with you, you could not altogether take him from my hands. And now go ye ‎your ways unto your father and your brother shall be a slave unto me for robbing the house of ‎the king. And Judah said: What is it unto thee, oh king, or to thy fame? Verily the king sendeth ‎out of his house in presents or in losses abundance of silver and of gold in all the land, and ‎thou continuest to speak of thy cup which thou sayest he hath stolen from thee, while thou ‎hast placed it into the bag of our brother. Far be it from our brother Benjamin, and from the ‎seed of Abraham, to do such a thing or any other person be he king or prince or an ordinary ‎man. And now refrain thou from saying such a thing, lest thy words be heard in the land and ‎people will say: On account of a little silver the king of Egypt had quarrels and fights with these ‎men, and he hath taken away from them their brother for a slave. And Joseph answered unto ‎them: Take then this cup and go your way from me and leave your brother to be a slave, for it ‎is the judgment of a thief to be a slave. And Judah said unto him: And art thou not ashamed at ‎thy words, that we should leave with thee our brother for this cup? Surely, if thou wouldst ‎give unto us a thousand times as much as thy cup we should not leave our brother even for all ‎the silver of all mankind; verily, we should first die for his sake.‎</p>

              <p>And Joseph answered and said: And wherefore have you forsaken your brother and you have ‎sold him for twenty pieces of silver even unto this day, and why don’t you do likewise to this ‎your brother? And Judah said: The Lord did witness between me and thee that we have not ‎desired this fight, and now give us our brother that we go away from thee without trouble. ‎And Joseph answered and said: If all the kings of the land were to gather together, they could ‎not deliver your brother from my hand. And Judah said: What shall we say unto our father ‎when he seeth us and behold our brother is not with us, and his soul will grieve over him? And ‎Joseph answered and said: This is what you have to tell unto your father: The rope has ‎followed the bucket. And Judah said: And art thou a king who speaketh such things and give us ‎the wrong judgment? Woe unto the king that is thy like. And Joseph answered and said: There ‎is no wrong judgment in the words I have spoken concerning your brother Joseph, for verily, ‎you all have sold him unto the Midianites for twenty pieces of silver, and you have denied it to ‎your father saying an evil beast hath devoured him, Joseph hath been torn into pieces. And ‎Judah said: Behold the fire of Shechem is burning within my heart. I will burn all thy land with ‎fire. And Joseph answered: Verily, Tamar, thy sister-in-law who killed thy sons, she hath put ‎out the fire of Shechem. And Judah said: If I pluck out one hair from my body, all Egypt will be ‎killed with my blood. And Joseph answered unto him: Verily, such is your manner of doing, the ‎same that you did unto your brother when you sold him, and you dipped his coat into blood ‎and you brought it unto your father, that he should think an evil beast has devoured him, and ‎this is his blood.‎</p>

              <p>And when Judah heard these words he was terribly angry and his wrath burned within him. ‎And there was lying before him a stone whose weight was four hundred shekels, and while ‎Judah’s anger was burning he seized the stone with one of his hands and threw it heavenward ‎and he caught it up with his left hand. And after this he placed it under his feet and he sat ‎down upon it with his might and the stone was crumbled to dust by Judah’s strength. And ‎when Joseph saw the action of Judah he was greatly afraid, and Joseph commanded his son ‎Manasseh, and he did unto another stone what Judah had done before. And Judah said unto ‎his brothers let not the man among you think this man is an Egyptian, for being able to do such ‎a thing he must be of the family of our father. And Joseph said: Not upon you alone was ‎strength bestowed, for we also are powerful men, and why will you exalt yourself over all of ‎us? And Judah said unto Joseph: I pray thee release our brother and do not invite ruin upon ‎thy country this day. And Joseph answered unto them saying: Go ye and tell your father that ‎an evil beast hath devoured Benjamin as you have said concerning your brother Joseph. And ‎Judah conferred with Naphtali saying unto him: Go now hastily and bring me the number of all ‎the streets that are in Egypt. And Simeon said unto him: Let not this concern thee, for behold I ‎will ascend the mountain and take one of its large stones and cast it on all the people of Egypt ‎and kill all those that are in it. And Joseph heard all that his brothers had spoken in his ‎presence, for they knew not that Joseph understood them for they thought he understood ‎not the Hebrew tongue. And Joseph, hearing the words of his brethren was in great fear lest ‎they might really destroy all Egypt, and he commanded unto his son Manasseh, saying? Go ‎thou hastily and assemble all the inhabitants of Egypt and all the mighty men, and let them at ‎once appear before me on horses and on foot, with all musical instruments in their hands. And ‎Manasseh went and did so. And Naphtali had gone according to Judah’s order. And Naphtali ‎was nimble footed like a swift stag, so that he could walk upon the ears of corn and they would ‎not bend under him. And he went swiftly and he numbered the streets of Egypt and behold ‎they were twelve, and he returned hastily and told it unto Judah. And Judah said unto his ‎brothers: Put on quickly every one of you his sword and we will come over Egypt and smite ‎them all that there be not left a remnant. And behold, I will destroy with my own strength ‎three of these streets and you destroy each one. While Judah was saying these words behold ‎the inhabitants of Egypt with all their mighty men came against them all with musical ‎instruments and amid loud shouting. And their number was five hundred horsemen and ten ‎thousand footmen and four hundred men that fought only with their hands and strength ‎without swords and spears.‎</p>

              <p>And all these powerful men came with great storming and shouting, and they encircled the ‎sons of Jacob and they terrified them, and the earth trembled at that fearful noise. And the ‎sons of Jacob saw these hosts and they were greatly afraid of their lives. And Joseph did that ‎to terrify the sons of Jacob and to pacify them. And when Judah saw that his brothers were ‎afraid he said unto them: What causeth you such fear as long as the mercy of God is upon us. ‎And Judah saw all the people of Egypt around him to terrify them, but Joseph commanded ‎them saying: Touch no one of these men. And Judah drew his sword quickly and screamed a ‎loud and bitter scream. And he smote with his sword, and he jumped all over the ground, ‎continuing to scream at all the people. And the Lord impressed all the mighty men and all the ‎people with great fear of Judah and his brethren, and they all fled at the noise of Judah’s ‎screaming, and terror came over them and they fell one from the other, and great many of ‎them died as they fell. And all of them fled from before Judah and his brethren. And Judah ‎and his brethren pursued them into the house of Pharaoh and they escaped. And Judah ‎returned once more before Joseph and he roared at him like a lion, and he uttered a terrible ‎shout against him, and the shouting was heard at a great distance, even among the inhabitants ‎of Succoth, and all Egypt trembled from the noise of that shouting, and also the walls of Egypt ‎fell from the trembling of the earth. And Pharaoh fell from his throne to the ground and also ‎the pregnant women of Egypt and Goshen miscarried on hearing the noise and trembling, for ‎they were greatly terrified. And Pharaoh sent his servants, saying: What is it that is going on in ‎Egypt to-day? And they came and they informed Pharaoh of what hath happened, and he ‎wondered greatly, and he was exceedingly afraid. And his fright grew upon him, and he sent ‎word unto Joseph, saying: Thou hast brought over me the Hebrews to destroy all the land of ‎Egypt. What dost thou care for that thief whom thou hast taken for thy slave? Let him depart ‎with his brothers lest we perish through the evil they will bring over us, and I, and you, and all ‎Egypt. And if thou art not willing to do this thing and thou de lightest in those Hebrews, then ‎remove from thee all the precious things I gave unto thee and go along with them, for surely ‎they will smite all my people and destroy my whole country, for behold even in Goshen all the ‎women have miscarried for fear of their shouting. See they have done these things simply by ‎their screaming and yelling and what more can they do if they fight with their swords? Surely ‎they will destroy the whole land.

              <p>And when they came and spoke unto Joseph all the words of Pharaoh concerning him, he was ‎greatly afraid of the words of Pharaoh. And Judah and his brethren were still standing before ‎Joseph raging terribly, and all the sons of Jacob were screaming at Joseph even like the roaring ‎of the waves of the sea. And Joseph was in great fear of Pharaoh and of his brothers, and he ‎sought an opportunity to make himself known, before they destroyed all the land of Egypt. ‎And Joseph ordered Manasseh, his son, and he went and came near unto Judah, and he ‎placed his hand upon Judah’s shoulder, and Judah’s rage subsided. And Judah said once more ‎unto his brothers: Let no man among you say this is the work of an Egyptian lad, for verily that ‎is like the action of one of my father's house. And when Joseph saw that Judah’s anger was ‎silenced, he approached and spoke unto Judah in gentle words. And Joseph said unto Judah ‎Verily you have spoken the truth, and you have proven your words concerning your great ‎strength, and the Lord who hath pleasure in you may increase your peace. But tell me the ‎truth, why thou art the only one among thy brothers to rage against me, while not one among ‎the others speaketh one word? And Judah answered: Thou must know that I have pledged ‎myself for this boy, saying unto my father: If I bring him not and set him before thee then let ‎me bear the blame through all my days. And therefore have I been the foremost among my ‎brothers after I saw that thou wouldst not suffer him to go with us. And now let me find grace ‎in thine eyes and send our brother to go with us. Behold I will remain in his stead to serve thee ‎in anything thou desirest. And wherever thou shalt send me I will go to serve thee with all my ‎might. If there: be a mighty king who hath rebelled against thee, send me and thou wilt see ‎what I will do unto him and unto his land. And even if he have hosts of horsemen and on foot, ‎and an exceedingly powerful army, I will smite them all, and bring their king's head before ‎thee. Dost thou not know, and hast thou not heard of it, that our father Abraham with his ‎servant Eliezer smote all the kings of Elam and all their hosts in one night that there was not ‎left of them a remnant? And from that day on the strength of our father was given unto us ‎and our seed as an inheritance forever.‎</p>

            <summary>Yosef's testing of his brothers is a lesson about crime and repentance, as he recreates a situation where they are in control of the life and death of a son of Rahel to ensure they have changed. Once the brothers pass the test, life and covenant can continue. Judah's speech about their father's grief and his offer to remain as a slave in place of Benjamin also plays a crucial role in changing the course of events (Genesis 43:1-44:34).</summary>

              <p>Now in Egypt, the nightmare scenario has unfolded. Benjamin has been found with the viceroy’s silver cup in his possession. The official delivers his verdict. Benjamin is to be held as a slave. The other brothers can go free. At this point Judah steps forward and makes a speech that changes history. He speaks eloquently about their father’s grief at the loss of one of Rachel’s sons. If Jacob loses the other, Judah states, he will die of grief. I, says Judah, personally guaranteed his safe return. He concludes: “Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers. How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come on my father” (Gen. 44:33–34).</p>

              <p>Yosef’s testing of his brothers is masterful, not only because of the plan itself, but also because of the depth of emotion that the text evokes in its characterizations. It demonstrates how well the whole story has been integrated into the Yaakov material, for here as well as there long conversations are used to reveal complex passions. Some have questioned the morality of Yosef’s actions, seeing that the aged Yaakov might well have died while the test was progressing, without ever finding out that Yosef had survived. But that is not the point of the story. What it is trying to teach (among other things) is a lesson about crime and repentance. Only by recreating something of the original situation—the brothers are again in control of the life and death of a son of Rahel—can Yosef be sure that they have changed. Once the brothers pass the test, life and covenant can then continue.</p>

Joseph revealed himself to his brothers in private to prevent embarrassment and protect their reputation, showing mercy despite past grievances. Rabbi Chama bar Chaninah and Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman emphasize the importance of obtaining permission before entering the presence of a king, as seen in Joseph's actions in Genesis 45:1. Abraham rejects the doctrines of the body and human commission, declaring his appointment by God as the controller of external matters.

              </summary>
              <p>On the pasuk “And Yosef could no longer hold back” (Bereishit 45:1), it follows Yehuda's approach to Yosef. The term &quot;Eilav&quot; can refer to approaching Yosef, his own essence, and Hashem. Yehuda's speech did not present new arguments but clarified the truth, leading to redemption, as “truth springs up from the ground” (Tehillim 85:12). The story of Yosef and his brothers serves as a parable for Bnei Yisrael's service to Hashem. The sages say, “Woe to us for the day of Judgement... if the brothers couldn't stand before Yosef, how much more so before Hashem.” This teaches that Hashem's presence is everywhere, even in darkness (Tehillim 139:12). In times of distress, nullifying oneself to the truth, as Yehuda did by offering to be a slave in place of Binyamin, leads to the revelation of the truth. Yehuda's sacrifice prompted Yosef to reveal himself, showing that everything was good and there was nothing to fear. The phrase “And Yosef could no longer hold back” relates to the concept of capacity, as in “It’s capacity was 2000 baths” (Melachim 7:26). Hashem created the world with layers of measure. When one nullifies themselves to the level above, it causes an overflow of blessing from the higher level to the lower one. Yehuda's submission to Yosef exemplifies this. Yosef only sought Yehuda's acknowledgment of his kingship. Despite thinking Yosef was a foreigner, Yehuda, being a man of truth, accepted the reality and humbled himself. This teaches that when one nullifies their will to Hashem and admits the truth, their darkness turns into light, as the Medrash explains on the pasuk “If you provide surety for your friend.”</p>

The removal of all others was also to prevent them from hearing about the brothers' betrayal, as it would have negatively impacted their reputation. (Commentaries on Genesis 45:1:1-4)</summary>

Joseph wanted to spare his brothers the embarassment of becoming known as people who had sold their brother, hence he had to clear everyone out of the room. When the Torah mentions immediately afterwards that Joseph wept loudly when he revealed himself and all of Egypt heard about it, this is a clear indication that Joseph was not concerned that he could be overheard. He was only concerned that his brothers' part in all this should not be overheard.</p>

              <p>ולא יכול יוסף להתאפק לכל הנצבים עליו, “Joseph could no longer control his emotions from all those who stood around him.” It appears from this wording that the courtiers around Joseph became gradually more inclined to side with Yehudah in that argument, something that Joseph was not prepared to tolerate. This is why he ordered them out of his presence, calling out: “remove everyone from my presence!” Subsequently, the Torah reports: ויתן את קולו בבכי, “he raised his voice by weeping.” He broke out crying after he was left alone with the brothers, וישמעו מצרים וישמע בית פרעה, “The Egyptians heard; then this was heard in Pharaoh’s palace.” According to Tanchuma Vayigash 5 things happened somewhat differently. The words “Joseph could no longer control himself” reflect a tremendous inner conflict raging within Joseph. If the brothers were to kill him, he had no next of kin who would demand to avenge his blood. He finally decided to take a chance on the brothers killing him rather than his exposing the fact that he had been kidnapped and sold into slavery by these men. This was the consideration which prompted him to order everybody out of the room.</p>

              <p>ולא יכול, the repeated references by Yehudah to the mental anguish experienced by his aged father proved too much for Joseph to maintain his composure. It kindled his sense of compassion also towards his brothers so that he could not restrain himself from weeping. In order not to make a public spectacle of himself in front of people whom it did not directly concern, he ordered הוציאו כל איש מעלי, “remove everybody from my presence! The ones present not only left themselves but made sure that no one entered until invited. Joseph had said after all, כל איש, “everybody!” </p>

              </summary>
              <p>THEN JOSEPH COULD NOT ‘L’HITHAPEIK’ (REFRAIN HIMSELF) BEFORE ALL THEM THAT STOOD BY HIM. He could not bear that the Egyptians should stand by him witnessing how his brothers would be put to shame when he makes himself known to them. This is the language of Rashi. But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that l’hithapeik means “to bear.” The expression Before all them that stood by him, means until all that stood by him would go out, and so it was necessary that he call out that they be removed. Onkelos, however, translated l’hithapeik as meaning “to strengthen himself.” Similarly: ‘Va’ethapak” (And I forced myself) and offered the burnt-offering. (I Samuel 13:12.)  Every other form of hithapkuth in every place is likewise an expression of strengthening. The correct interpretation in my opinion is that there were present many people of Pharaoh’s house and other Egyptians, pleading with Joseph to pardon Benjamin, for their compassions were deeply stirred by Judah’s pleas, and Joseph could not overcome them all. He then called forth to his servants, “Let every strange man go out from me, because I will speak to them.” And when they had gone out, he wept aloud; and the Egyptians heard, and the people of the house of Pharaoh, (Verse 2 here.)  who had been expelled from his presence, for they were still in the outer court. It is possible that the expression, ‘hanitzavim’ (them that stood) by him, means his servants who stood before him, just as: The servant ‘hanitzav’ (that was set) over the reapers; (Ruth 3:6.)  ‘sarei hanitzavim’ (chief officers); (I Kings 5:30.)  ‘L’hithyatzeiv’ (To present themselves) before the Eternal. (Job 1:6.)  And the meaning of Vayikra (and he called) is that he raised his voice with anger and said to his servants, “Cause every man to go out from before me, except these men.” And the reason for the removal is that he expelled them from there so that they should not hear when he mentions the matter of the sale to his brothers because it would be a source of distress to them and also to himself, for the servants of Pharaoh and the Egyptians will say of them: “These are treacheous people who must not live in our land, nor tread in our palaces. They have acted treacherously against their brother, and also dealt treacherously with their father. What will they do to the king and his people?” They would also no longer believe in Joseph.</p>

              <p>Joseph could not restrain from revealing himself, but he nevertheless held back before all those standing before him so as not to embarrass his brothers publicly by disclosing to the servants and guards that were present the fact that they had sold him to Egypt. 1 And he called: Remove every man from before me. No other man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers. Another explanation for Joseph’s instructions is that his servants supported Judah’s proposal and attempted to convince Joseph to accept it, as the lost goblet had been found. Furthermore, Judah’s noble offer had left a profound impression on them. Joseph therefore requested that they exit the room. 2</p>

              <p>ולא יכול יוסף להתאפק לכל הנצבים, “and Joseph could no longer restrain himself in the presence of all the courtiers around him.” According to Rashi what bothered Joseph was that all the Egyptians would become privy to matters which were private between him and his brothers. He did not want to shame his brothers publicly when he would reveal himself to them, and unavoidably their part in his having been brought to Egypt in the first place would come to light.
    Nachmanides makes the point that whenever the expression התאפקות occurs it denotes the strength of character of the person so described. The people surrounding Joseph had been so moved by Yehudah’s words that they appealed to Joseph to respond by releasing him. The pressure became so great that even steadfast Joseph could no longer withstand it. He therefore ordered everybody out of the hall in order to continue the dialogue with the brothers (Yehudah) in private. A soon as the Egyptians who had been present left the hall, Joseph broke out in tears, and weeping, something which the Egyptians now outside could not help overhearing. The meaning of the word ויקרא in our verse is not a simple ”reading” or instruction, without the subject raising his voice especially, but Joseph raised his voice angrily in ordering all the Egyptians surrounding him out into the courtyard.

              <p>[3] Another interpretation:&quot;And El Shaddai did not need to say 'grant you mercy' but rather 'grant you mercy before the king,' or 'before the ruler,' just as it is written, 'and Joseph was the ruler, etc.'&quot; (Genesis 42:6) Why does it say &quot;before the man&quot;? It could have just said to give you mercy before the king, or before the ruler, as it is written &quot;and Joseph was the ruler, etc.&quot; (Genesis 42:6). And why did his mother call him by his name Joseph, as it is written &quot;And she called his name Joseph&quot; (Genesis 30:24), while Pharaoh called him Zaphenath-paneah [&quot;treasury of the glorious rest&quot;] (Genesis 41:45) and the Egyptians called him Avrech [father in wisdom.] (Genesis 41:43)? Jacob omitted all of these names and only said &quot;And El Shaddai, etc.&quot; before the man. Why, when his father sent him to his brothers, did the angel who was assigned by God to watch over him find him wandering and ask him what he was looking for? As it is written &quot;And a man found him, and behold he was wandering in the field&quot; (Genesis 37:15), and he said to him &quot;What are you looking for?&quot; and he answered &quot;I am looking for my brothers.&quot; Once he arrived there, they threw him into a pit, then took off his coat, and then sold him four times, as it is written &quot;Thus says the Lord: For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away&quot; (Amos 2:6). And when the tribes went down to Egypt, as soon as he saw them, he had compassion on them.&quot; As it is written, &quot;And Joseph recognized them&quot; (Genesis 42:8). &quot;And he turned himself away from them and wept&quot; (Genesis 42:24). Immediately, the angel descended and appeared to Joseph in the form of a man, and he said to him, &quot;Why do you have mercy on these people? Don't you know how much they have troubled you? They threw you into a pit and sold you four times. He began to accuse them and said to Joseph, &quot;Immediately he revealed himself to them&quot; (Genesis 45:1). He said to them, &quot;Don't you know that I am a magician? I take the cup, smell it, and make myself a magician. He said to them, &quot;I know that you are spies, but if you are honest, then you are finished.&quot; (Genesis 42:19). When they came to Jacob and said to him, &quot;What do you think the king of Egypt said to us? He is not merciful to us.&quot; Only one person knows where he sent us from, and he stands and accuses us before him, as it is written, &quot;The man said, 'Your servant, our lord, has asked us about our family'&quot; (Genesis 43:7). For the man said, &quot;You are spies&quot; (Genesis 42:14). He said to them, &quot;There is a man who accuses you, so be kind to him, as it is written, 'And Almighty God will give you mercy before the man' (Genesis 43:14), and not only before this man, but before all nations, as it is written, 'give them compassion before those who carried them captive.'

              <p>“My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or a brother?” (Genesis 44:19).  “My lord asked his servants…” – [Judah] said to him: ‘From the outset you came against us with malice. How many countries descended to Egypt to purchase food? But you did not ask [this of] any of them. Did we, perhaps, come to take our daughter, or are you planning to marry our sister? Nevertheless, we hid nothing from you.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘I see that you are a prattler. Is there among your brothers a prattler like you?’ (Why are you the only one of the brothers talking? According to Tanḥuma (Vayigash 5), Joseph claimed that he knew through divination that Judah was not the oldest of the brothers, and therefore it was even more surprising that he was doing all the talking. )  [Judah] said to him: ‘All this that you see is because I became a guarantor for him.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘Why did you not do so on behalf of your brother when you sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver pieces, and you brought anguish to your father and said to him: “Joseph was mauled”?’ (Genesis 37:33). When Judah heard this he screamed and cried in a loud voice. (Judah screamed and cried because Joseph was not giving in to his demand to release Benjamin. )  He said: “For how will I go up to my father?” (Genesis 44:34). Judah said to Naphtali: ‘Go and see how many marketplaces there are in Egypt.’ He leapt and returned and said to him: ‘Twelve.’ Judah said to his brothers: ‘I will destroy three of them, and each and every one of you take one each, “and no man will be left among them”’ (I Samuel 14:36). His brothers said to him: ‘Egypt is not like Shekhem. If you destroy Egypt you will be destroying the entire world.’   “Joseph could not restrain himself before all those standing before him, and he called: Remove every man from before me. No man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers” (Genesis 45:1).  “He raised his voice in weeping; the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard” (Genesis 45:2).  “Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live? And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him” (Genesis 45:3).  “Joseph said to his brothers: Please approach me, and they approached. He said: I am Joseph your brother whom you sold to Egypt” (Genesis 45:4).  At that moment, “Joseph could not restrain himself” (Genesis 45:1). When Joseph saw that they had come to an agreement to destroy Egypt, Joseph said to himself: ‘It is preferable that I reveal myself to them and they will not destroy Egypt.’ Joseph said to them: ‘Did you not say that this one’s brother was dead? I will call him and he will come to you.’ He was calling: ‘Joseph son of Jacob, come to me. Joseph son of Jacob come to me.’ They were looking to the four corners of the palace. He said to them: ‘What are you looking for? “I am Joseph your brother”’ (Genesis 45:4). Immediately, their souls departed, as it is stated: “His brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3). But they did not believe him until he uncovered himself and showed them his circumcision.</p>

              <p>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: In all the matters that you read that Judah spoke to Joseph in the presence of his brothers until you reach: “Joseph could not restrain himself,” there is conciliation for Joseph, conciliation for his brothers and conciliation for Benjamin. Conciliation for Joseph, saying: See how he is giving his life for the sake of Rachel’s sons. (Joseph saw how Judah was willing to give his life for Benjamin, whereas earlier he had been one of the initiators when the brothers sold him. This showed that Judah had repented. )  Conciliation for his brothers, saying: See how he is giving his life for his brother’s sake. (Thus, Judah was reconciled with his brothers, who had demoted him from his position of leadership after the sale of Joseph (Etz Yosef; see Bereshit Rabba 42:3). )  Conciliation for Benjamin, he said to him: ‘Just as I am giving my life for your sake, so I am willing to give my life for your brother’s sake.’ (Benjamin had suspected his brothers in the disappearance of Joseph, but was conciliated through this process. )   “Joseph could not restrain himself…” – Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina said: Joseph did not act properly, (It was unwise for him to be alone with his brothers.)  as had one of them kicked him, he would have immediately died. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: He acted appropriately and properly. He was aware of his brothers’ righteousness. He said: ‘God forbid, my brothers are not suspected of bloodshed.’</p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM. This text is related (to Job 41:8 [16]): ONE IS SO NEAR TO THE OTHER THAT NO AIR CAN COME BETWEEN THEM. This refers to Judah and Joseph, for in whatever Joseph prided himself, Judah came and vanquished, as stated (in Gen. 45:1): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF. To what were they comparable? (Tanh., Gen. 11:3.)  To a bull that went out; and, when all the beasts fled from him, he kicked (rt.: B'T) at one and gored at another. Then came the lion, but he did not stand up to him. Rather, when the lion appeared and sought out the bull, he was not to be found. So Joseph is likened to the bull, as stated (in Deut. 33:17): LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY. The tribes also have been likened to beasts, and Joseph was priding himself as being over them and despising (rt.: B'T) them. (According to Gen. 42:7) HE BECAME A STRANGER TO THEM. Then goring at a particular one, (according to Gen. 42:24) HE TOOK SIMON FROM THEM. He acted so only until the lion came, &lt; for &gt; (according to Gen. 49:24) JUDAH IS A LION'S WHELP. He sought him out as the bull, but he was not to be found. Rather (according to Gen. 45:1): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF. Why? (Prov. 30:30:) THE LION IS THE MIGHTIEST AMONG THE BEASTS, AND RETREATS BEFORE NONE, even because it is written of him (in Gen. 47:12): AND &lt; JOSEPH &gt; SUSTAINED &lt; HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS &gt;. (One would expect some saying about Judah. Buber’s note here suggests that SUSTAINED be read as two words, apart from the biblical context, and interpreted as “All in all,” i.e., the lion is “all in all” in the world of beasts. Cf. Tanh., Gen. 11:3: “Who has stood facing a bull? The lion, as stated (Gen. 44:18): THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM.”)  Also in the world to come a fighting Messiah is going to arise from Joseph, but a Messiah who is to arise from Judah will be stronger than he, as stated (in Zech. 10:6): I WILL STRENGTHEN THE HOUSE OF JUDAH, &lt; BUT THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH I WILL SAVE &gt;.</p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): When Judah saw that Joseph was not appeased, he began saying to his brothers: [Why] are we standing around? We will begin with this one and wind up with Pharaoh! Now they did not know that Joseph understood their language, as stated (in Gen. 42:23): NOW THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT JOSEPH UNDERSTOOD. When Joseph saw that, he began to talk to them with supplications and with gentle language. He said to them: About this Benjamin, I want only to know who &lt; it was that &gt; advised him to steal the goblet. Did you perhaps advise him to steal the goblet? When Benjamin heard that, he said: They did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. He said to them: Swear to me. He began to swear to him. By what did he swear to him? By the separation of my brother Joseph from me, (This clause may also be translated as follows: “By the scriptural section on the separation of my brother Joseph from me (in Gen. 37:18-36).”)  I did not touch it. Now &lt; I swear &gt; neither by the launching of arrows which were sent against him, as stated (in Gen. 49:23): ARCHERS HAVE HATED HIM (Joseph); nor by the stripping with which they stripped him, as stated (in Gen. 37:23): THEY STRIPPED JOSEPH OF HIS TUNIC; nor by the throwing with which they threw him into the cistern, as stated (in Gen. 37:24): AND THEY CAST HIM INTO THE PIT; nor by the selling with which they sold him to the Ishmaelites (in vs. 28); nor by the dipping with which they dipped his tunic in the blood (in vs. 31). &lt; By none of these do I swear &gt; that they did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. Joseph said: Who will make known to me that you are swearing truthfully about your brothers? He said to him: You can know how much I love him from the names of my sons, since I set names for them on the basis of what I feared for &lt; each one &gt;. (Sot. 36b (bar); Gen. R. 93:7; Tanh., Gen. 11:40.)  He said to him: And what were the names of your sons? He said to him (in agreement with Gen. 46:21): BELA, BECHER, ASHBEL, GERA, NAAMAN, EHI, ROSH, MUPPIM, HUPPIM, AND ARD. He said to him: Why Bela (BL')? He said to him: Because my brother was swallowed up (rt.: BL') from me. Becher (BKR)? Because he was my mother's first-born (rt.: BKR). Ashbel ('ShBL)? Because my brother was captured (NShBH). Gera? Because my brother was a sojourner (ger) with &lt; merely &gt; the privileges of a transient. (Gk.: xenia, i.e., “rights of a foreigner” or “guest privileges.”)  Naaman (N'M)? Because his words were pleasing (N'M). Ehi ('HY)? Because he was my brother ('HY) from &lt; the same &gt; mother, and I had none but him. Rosh (which means &quot;head&quot;)? Because he was older than I. Muppim (MPYM)? Because he learned Torah from our father's mouth (MPY) and taught it to me. When all his brothers would return to shepherding, he would sit with my father and learn the traditions which he had received from Shem and Eber. Huppim (rt.: HPP)? Because he has been covered over (rt.: HPP) until this day. Another interpretation of Huppim: Because I did not see his wedding canopy (huppah) nor did he see my wedding canopy. Another interpretation of Huppim (rt.: HPP): Because until now I have been mourning over him and going barefoot (rt.: YHP). And Ard ('RD)? Because he brought (rt.: YRD) all of us down here. Another interpretation of ARD (from Gen. 37:35): NO, I WILL GO DOWN ('RD) MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL. Will you please not bring down ('RD) Daddy to Sheol through grief! And so Judah said (in Gen. 44:34): FOR HOW SHALL I GO UP UNTO MY FATHER &lt; IF THE LAD IS NOT WITH ME &gt;? When Joseph heard that, he was not able to suppress his compassion, as stated (in Gen. 45:1-3): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF…. AND HE WEPT ALOUD…. THEN JOSEPH SAID UNTO HIS BROTHERS: I AM JOSEPH. When he said to them: I AM {YOUR BROTHER JOSEPH} … (in vs. 3, cont.): HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE DISMAYED BECAUSE OF HIM. R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon said in the name of R. Eleazar ben Azariah: (Gen. R. 93:11.)  Now, if in the case of Joseph, when he said to his brothers: I am Joseph, they knew what they had done with him and were unable to answer him; how much the less will a creature be able to stand when the Holy One comes to dispute with each and every one of &lt; his &gt; creatures and to tell him his deeds, just as it is written (in Amos 4:13): FOR BEHOLD, THE ONE WHO FORMS THE MOUNTAINS, &lt; CREATES THE WIND, AND TELLS ONE WHAT HIS THOUGHT IS &gt; … !</p>

Why did he say: Cause every man to go out from me (Gen. 45:1)? Joseph had said to himself: “I would rather die than shame my brothers before the Egyptians.”</p>

              <p>And Joseph answered and said: Thou art speaking the truth and there is no false hood in thy ‎mouth, for it hath been told unto us that the Hebrews are possessed of great strength, and ‎that the Lord their God hath great pleasure in them, and that no one can stand against them. ‎And on this I will agree to release your brother, if thou wilt agree to bring into my presence his ‎brother the son of his mother of whom ye have said he went away from you into Egypt. And if ‎you bring unto me his brother, I will take him as a substitute for not one among you has ‎pledged himself for him unto your father. And when he shall be brought before me I will send ‎away with you thy brother for whom thou art pledged. And when Joseph spoke these words ‎Judah’s wrath was kindled against him, and his eyes filled with blood for anger, and he said ‎unto his brothers: Behold this man seeketh this day his own destruction and the destruction of ‎all Egypt. And Simeon answered unto Joseph saying: And did we not tell unto thee at the ‎outset that we know not the place whither he went, nor do we know whether he be dead or ‎alive, and wherefore does my lord demand of us such a thing? And when Joseph looked at ‎Judah’s countenance he saw that his wrath began once more to kindle within him. And Joseph ‎said unto his brothers: Verily you have said that your brother was dead or lost, now therefore, ‎if I should call him and he should appear in our presence would you give him unto me as a ‎ransom for his brother? And Joseph called out with a loud voice: Joseph 1 oh, Joseph! come ‎this day into my presence and appear before thy brethren and sit before them, and when ‎Joseph had spoken these words his brothers looked around themselves each one in a ‎different direction to see whither Joseph was to come before them. And when Joseph saw ‎their actions he said unto them: Why do ye look around here and there, I am your brother ‎Joseph whom you have sold into Egypt? Now, therefore, be not grieved nor angry with ‎yourselves that ye sold me hither; for God did send me before you to pre serve life. And his ‎brothers were greatly afraid of him on hearing his words, and Judah especially was exceedingly ‎terrified. And Benjamin, who was in a chamber when he heard the words of Joseph, he ran at ‎Joseph and embraced him, and he fell upon his neck and they wept. And when the brothers of ‎Joseph saw that Benjamin hath fallen upon the neck of his brother and wept with him, they ‎also fell upon Joseph and they embraced him and they wept a great weeping with Joseph. And ‎the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying: Those men are Joseph’s brothers, and ‎it pleased Pharaoh greatly, for he was afraid of them, lest they turn Egypt into ruin. And ‎Pharaoh sent his servant unto Joseph, to wish him joy on account of his brothers. And all the ‎princes of the army and of the hosts that were in Egypt, came to rejoice with Joseph, and all ‎Egypt rejoiced exceedingly about the brothers of Joseph. And Pharaoh sent his servant unto ‎Joseph saying: Tell unto thy brothers and bring down all that they have and let them come ‎unto me and I will allow them to dwell in the best part of Egypt. And they did so.‎</p>

            <summary>In Genesis 45:1, Rabbi Chama bar Chaninah and Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman have differing opinions on Joseph's actions in revealing himself to his brothers. The bells on the High Priest's robe serve the purpose of announcing his approach before entering the Sanctuary, similar to Joseph's instruction to remove everyone before revealing himself to his brothers in Genesis 45:1. This is to emphasize the importance of obtaining permission before entering the presence of a king, as failure to do so could result in death, as seen in Esther 4:11. The robe of the High Priest must be constructed in a way that it cannot be torn, as Satan is jealous of the High Priest's stature and may try to pull him down.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>The reason for the bells on the rim of the robe of the High Priest is specifically spelled out in the Torah. His voice (approach) should be heard when he entered the Sanctuary. This was in the nature of securing permission before entering the Sanctuary. Anyone entering suddenly, i.e. unannounced, was guilty of death. We know of something similar in the palace of Ahasverus (Esther 4,11). I shall explain this in greater detail when I deal with Leviticus 16,17: &quot;No one is to be in the Tent of Meeting when Aaron enters to obtain atonement in the Sanctuary.&quot; This is why the Torah commanded that he had to announce his arrival. It is not unlike the time Joseph revealed himself to his brothers. He had instructed that everyone present in the palace had to be removed first, except for himself and his brothers (Genesis 45,1). Service to the King has to be performed with no one else present. When one leaves the king one must also be granted permission so that the king's servants will know when to re-enter the king's presence. An additional dimension which is important when dealing with the presence before the King of Kings is that unless permission has been obtained both before entering and before leaving, G–d's angels are apt to kill the person who acts without permission. The Torah warns Aaron so that we may appreciate that if even a person of the exalted stature of Aaron is subject to such restrictions, anyone on a lower level does not even have to be warned specifically. When the Torah adds the words לפני ה', in 28,39, it adds stature to Aaron who is compared to an angel of the Lord of Hosts. According to our sages the reason there must not be a tear in the robe (28,31), i.e. that it should be constructed in such a way that it is not liable to be torn, is because Satan is jealous of the High Priests's stature and tries to pull him by his robe as warriors do.</p>

Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachman says that Joseph acted prudently. He was well aware of the righteousness of his brothers and did not suspect them of being or becoming guilty of bloodshed. He was certain that the brothers would not even kill an Egyptian who had framed them (they considered him an Egyptian). He certainly did not suspect them of wanting to kill their own brother who was a צדיק, a pillar of the elitist society of the world! </p>

            <summary>Sforno explains that the men appeared as if waiting to speak to Abraham in Genesis 18:2, similar to how people are described as waiting to speak to someone in Genesis 45:1. Ibn Ezra uses the term &quot;refrain himself&quot; in Isaiah 42:14, Isaiah 57:5, and Isaiah 63:15, drawing parallels to Genesis 45:1. Rashi compares Job 1:12 to Genesis 45:1, where people are described as standing around someone. Da'at Zekenim connects Numbers 21:14 to Genesis 45:1, emphasizing the importance of specific word choices in the text. Chizkuni also links Numbers 21:17 to Genesis 45:1, highlighting the significance of unique word constructions in the Bible. Rabbi Samuel the son of Nachmani questions Joseph's actions in Genesis 45:1, suggesting that he did not fear being killed by his brothers due to a sacred oath.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>The expression: את והב (verse 14) is to be understood as being a single word, just as the word אתיהב, where the letter ו has been exchanged for the letter א. We have a parallel for this in Genesis 45,1 where Joseph is described as misrepresenting himself with the word: בהתודע, a word from the root ידע. Another example of such an unusual construction is found in Genesis 27,29, where Yitzchok in his blessing to Yaakov is quoted as saying: הוה גביר לאחיך, “be senior over your brothers.” We would have expected the word: היה instead of הוה. It, i.e. the word והב is intended as an alternative to נתינה as in “gift,” as in Numbers 26,62, כי לא נתן להם נחלה, “for no ancestral piece of land had been given to to them.” The Targumim, translators into Aramaic, render the word נתן there as אתיהב. Here where we hear about the defeat of the King of Moav against Sichon of the Emorites, the words ואת והב בסופה, mean that that king at the end of that war had had to cede lands to the victor. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>וירא יעקב כי יש שר ב מצרים, “Yaakov ‘saw’ that there was grain-trading in Egypt;” this is what Solomon had in mind when he said in Proverbs 20,12: אוזן שומעת ועין רואה ה' עשה גם שניהם, “the ear that hears, and the eye that sees, the Lord has made them both.” What prompted Solomon to make such a banal sounding statement? Did G–d not make the whole body? Why did he single out the ear and the eye? The answer is that all parts of the body, in due course, will have to give an accounting for their activities while they were alive on earth, except the ear and the eye. What is the reason for this? The eye sees things which are not good for it to see, and so does the ear hear things which are not good for it to hear. [involuntary perceptions. Ed.] This is not true of the other organs or limbs. You choose what the mouth eats, etc., you choose where your legs are to take you, etc. Rabbi said that the words: וירא יעקב, “Yaakov saw,” although he was an old man sitting hundreds of miles away, what his ten sons who were going in and out and meeting all kinds of people, did not see. All this was although both Yaakov and Joseph had been blessed with the spirit of prophecy. Joseph was only a distance of 4 or 5 days travel away from them, and when they searched for him they did not find him. Furthermore, why did Joseph not communicate with his father during all these years which would have spared his father a great deal of grief? The answer is that they all had sworn a sacred oath not to reveal to their father that he was in Egypt. They had made G–d a partner to their oath, so that He too could not reveal their secret to him. All this can be proved from Scripture, when before revealing himself to his brothers (Genesis 45,1) he commanded that all the people around him remove themselves before he would have that conversation with his brothers. He did not want that anyone would ever hear about that oath which had now expired. Other commentators offer a different reason for why Joseph had not communicated with his father for 22 years. As long as he had been a slave (13 years) he did not want to increase his father’s grief by informing him of his sorry condition. If he were to end a message that in the meantime he had become a king, his father would not believe him; he was right as his father did not even believe this when all his sons told that they had seen it with their own eyes. (Genesis 45,26) In addition, he was afraid that if his father were to leak his new found knowledge to someone, the brothers would each flee in all directions out of fear of his vengeance. As a result, his father would experience additional grief. This is why he waited until the time would be ripe for him to reveal himself, so that he would first reveal himself to his brothers before informing his father of his survival and the good fortune which had befallen him.</p>

              <p>את והב בסופה, “the word: “vahav, “ is one word, the letter ו at the beginning is not a conjunctive or prefix. It is similar to Genesis 45,1, where Joseph reveals his true identity to his brothers and we read: בהתודע יוסף, “when Joseph revealed himself.” That word should really have been ואתודע. Here too, the correct word should have been אתיהב למלך מואב בסופה וסערה, meaning that the King of Moav had been defeated by Sichon in battle when he lost this part of his land right up to the banks of the river Arnon.</p>

              <p>The sequence of events leading to the murder of Amnon is telling. In a move that suggests elements of the opening of the Yosef story in Genesis, a father sends his son into a situation of certain conflict (note too Amnon’s “Have everyone go out from me” in v.9, recalling the moment before Yosef reveals himself to his brothers in Gen. 45:1, and the mention of Tamar’s “ornamented tunic,” a phrase used to describe Yosef’s famous article of clothing in Gen. 37:3). The fact that the king at first believes the rumor that all of his sons have been murdered (vv.30-31) is perhaps indicative of a suddenly fragile state of mind. The first part of God’s recent statement of punishment for David’s crimes, “So-now— / the sword shall not depart from your house for the ages” (12:10), has received its first fulfillment.</p>

            <summary>Moral imperfections can decrease the level of prophetic inspiration, with certain vices causing prophecy to be entirely withdrawn. Examples include anger causing Elisha to lose prophecy until he calmed down, and grief causing Jacob to lose the Holy Spirit until he received good news. The sages also state that prophecy does not rest upon the idle or the sad, but upon the joyous. (Eight Chapters 7:5)</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>Thou must not be surprised to learn, however, that a few moral imperfections lessen the degree of prophetic inspiration; in fact, we find that some moral vices cause prophecy to be entirely withdrawn. Thus, for instance, wrath may do this, as our Rabbis say, &quot;If a prophet becomes enraged, the spirit of prophecy departs from him&quot;. (Pesaḥim 66 b. Cf. Moreh, II, 36 (end))  They adduce proof for this from the case of Elisha, from whom, when he became enraged, prophecy departed, until his wrath had subsided, at which he exclaimed, &quot;And now bring me a musician!&quot; (II K. III, 15. See Pesaḥim 117 a.)   Grief and anxiety may also cause a cessation of prophecy, as in the case of the patriarch Jacob who, during the days when he mourned for Joseph, was deprived of the Holy Spirit, until he received the news that his son lived, whereupon Scripture says, &quot;The spirit of Jacob, their father, revived&quot;, (Gen. XLV, 27.)  which the Targum (M. attached a great deal of importance to the Targum of Onkelos in the elucidation of many biblical passages, and refers to it many times in the Moreh. In Moreh, I, 27, he speaks of Onkelos, the proselyte, as being thoroughly acquainted with the Hebrew and Chaldaic languages. See Frankel, Hodegetik, p. 322, and Bacher, Die Bibelexegese Moses Maimunis, pp. 38-42.)  renders, &quot;And the spirit of prophecy descended upon their father, Jacob&quot;. The sages, moreover, say, &quot;The spirit of prophecy rests not upon the idle, nor upon the sad, but upon the joyous&quot;. (Shabbat, 30 b; Pesaḥim, loc. cit.: שאין השכינה שורה לא מתוך עצלות ולא מתוך עצבות ולא מתוך שחוק ולא מתוך קלות ראש לא מתוך דברים בטלים אלא מתוך דבר שמחה של מצוה. Cf. Moreh, II, 36 (end).) </p>

            <summary>In Bereshit Rabbah 93:10, it is discussed how Joseph's brothers could not withstand his rebuke, similar to how Bilam could not withstand the rebuke of his donkey. In 93:11, it is emphasized that if Joseph's brothers could not withstand his rebuke, then all flesh and blood people will be unable to stand before God on the Day of Judgment. In 93:12, it is explained that Joseph saw through Divine Spirit the fate of the Temples in Benjamin and Joseph's portions, and it is noted that weeping will be the means of redemption for Israel. Finally, in 93:8, it is recounted how Judah pleaded with Joseph to release Benjamin, offering himself as a guarantor, and Joseph ultimately revealed himself to his brothers to prevent them from destroying Egypt.</summary>

              <p>“He raised his voice in weeping…. And his brothers could not answer him” – Abba Kohen Bardela said: Woe unto us from the Day of Judgment; woe unto us from the day of rebuke. Bilam, the wise man of the idolaters, could not withstand the rebuke of his donkey. That is what is written: “Have I been in the habit of doing so to you? He said: No” (Numbers 22:30). Joseph was the youngest of the tribes and they were unable to withstand his rebuke. That is what it is written: “And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him.” When the Holy One blessed be He will come and rebuke each and every one according to his status, as it is stated: “I would reprove you and set it before your eyes” (Psalms 50:21), all the more so.   “Please approach me, and they approached” – he showed them the circumcision. “I am Joseph.”  “And now, it was not you that sent me here, but God. He made me into a father to Pharaoh, and into a lord for all his house, and ruler over the entire land of Egypt” (Genesis 45:8).  “And now it was not you that sent…He made me into a father to Pharaoh, [and into a lord [uladon] for all his house, and ruler [umoshel] over…]” – a patron to the king, “uladon” – a lord; umoshel – a ruler.   “Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him: So said your son Joseph: God has made me lord for all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry” (Genesis 45:9).  “Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him” – do not miss the opportunity.   “And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that is speaking to you” (Genesis 45:12).  “That it is my mouth that is speaking to you” – in the sacred tongue.</p>

Rather, Rabbu Elazar ben Pedat said: Joseph saw through the Divine Spirit that two Temples were destined to be built in Benjamin’s portion and were destined to be destroyed. “And Benjamin wept upon his neck” – he saw that the Tabernacle in Shilo was destined to be fashioned in Joseph’s portion and was destined to be destroyed.  “He raised his voice in weeping” (Genesis 45:2) – just as Joseph placated his brothers only through weeping, so, the Holy One blessed be He will redeem Israel only through weeping, as it is stated: “They will come with weeping, and with supplications I will lead them” (Jeremiah 31:9).</p>

              <p>“My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or a brother?” (Genesis 44:19).  “My lord asked his servants…” – [Judah] said to him: ‘From the outset you came against us with malice. How many countries descended to Egypt to purchase food? But you did not ask [this of] any of them. Did we, perhaps, come to take our daughter, or are you planning to marry our sister? Nevertheless, we hid nothing from you.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘I see that you are a prattler. Is there among your brothers a prattler like you?’ (Why are you the only one of the brothers talking? According to Tanḥuma (Vayigash 5), Joseph claimed that he knew through divination that Judah was not the oldest of the brothers, and therefore it was even more surprising that he was doing all the talking. )  [Judah] said to him: ‘All this that you see is because I became a guarantor for him.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘Why did you not do so on behalf of your brother when you sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver pieces, and you brought anguish to your father and said to him: “Joseph was mauled”?’ (Genesis 37:33). When Judah heard this he screamed and cried in a loud voice. (Judah screamed and cried because Joseph was not giving in to his demand to release Benjamin. )  He said: “For how will I go up to my father?” (Genesis 44:34). Judah said to Naphtali: ‘Go and see how many marketplaces there are in Egypt.’ He leapt and returned and said to him: ‘Twelve.’ Judah said to his brothers: ‘I will destroy three of them, and each and every one of you take one each, “and no man will be left among them”’ (I Samuel 14:36). His brothers said to him: ‘Egypt is not like Shekhem. If you destroy Egypt you will be destroying the entire world.’   “Joseph could not restrain himself before all those standing before him, and he called: Remove every man from before me. No man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers” (Genesis 45:1).  “He raised his voice in weeping; the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard” (Genesis 45:2).  “Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live? And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him” (Genesis 45:3).  “Joseph said to his brothers: Please approach me, and they approached. He said: I am Joseph your brother whom you sold to Egypt” (Genesis 45:4).  At that moment, “Joseph could not restrain himself” (Genesis 45:1). When Joseph saw that they had come to an agreement to destroy Egypt, Joseph said to himself: ‘It is preferable that I reveal myself to them and they will not destroy Egypt.’ Joseph said to them: ‘Did you not say that this one’s brother was dead? I will call him and he will come to you.’ He was calling: ‘Joseph son of Jacob, come to me. Joseph son of Jacob come to me.’ They were looking to the four corners of the palace. He said to them: ‘What are you looking for? “I am Joseph your brother”’ (Genesis 45:4). Immediately, their souls departed, as it is stated: “His brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3). But they did not believe him until he uncovered himself and showed them his circumcision.</p>

          </summary>
          <details>
            <summary>The law that a priest who performs his duties in the Sanctuary without all the appropriate garments is guilty of the death penalty at the hands of heaven applies equally to the High Priest and ordinary priests. The death penalty for priests not wearing trousers when performing their service in the Temple is derived from a different verse in the Talmud. The death penalty mentioned in connection with the robe refers specifically to the ornamental pendants at the lower rim of the robe, symbolizing the glory and splendor of the High Priest. The pealing of the bells at the rim of the robe announces the High Priest's approach to the Sanctuary, similar to how a commoner would be announced before entering the presence of a king. The audible approach of the High Priest is necessary to ensure that no other human or angel is present in the Sanctuary during his atonement ritual.</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>
                <h4>Tur HaArokh, Exodus 28:43:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>והיו על אהרן ועל בניו..... ולא ישאו עון ומתו, “they shall be on Aaron and his sons…..so that they shall not bear a sin and die.” According to Rashi this verse is the source of the law that a priest who performs his duties in the Sanctuary without all the appropriate garments is guilty of the death penalty at the hands of heaven. This law applies equally to the High Priest and to the ordinary priest.
    Nachmanides (on 28,35) queries Rashi’s comment by writing that if this were indeed so, the Torah should have written this verse much earlier immediately after all the priestly garments have been listed. Why would such a statement be made when only three of the eight garments have been listed as yet? Furthermore, our verse continues: ובצאתו ולא ימות, “when he leaves the Sanctuary he will not die,” something that has no longer anything to do with any shortcoming in the procedure of doing the sacrificial service, and still the Torah mentions the word “death. He concludes therefore that the death penalty applies only to priests not wearing trousers when performing their service in the Temple. This raises the question whence does the Talmud derive the death penalty for priests who perform their service while not wearing their other special garments? (compare Zevachim 18) The Talmud derives it from a different verse. What is clear from the discussion in the Talmud there is that there is no difference which of the priestly garments the priest omitted to wear when it comes to his being guilty of death. 
    The death penalty mentioned in connection with the robe, מעיל, referred only to the ornamental pendants at the lower rim of that robe, the bells and the pomegranates. The reason that the Torah repeated mention of the death penalty in that instance is that seeing that these ornamental pendants did not serve any visible purpose, one might consider them as not essential if unaware that the failure to append them put the life of the High Priest at risk. Moreover, seeing that ordinary Royalty are not known to wear garments with these kinds of ornaments, one might not comprehend how these ornaments symbolized the כבוד ותפארת, the glory and splendour which are the purported effect these garments have on the people seeing the wearer dressed in them.
    The pealing of the bells at the rim of the robe announce that the High Priest is approaching the Sanctuary. It is as if to announce that he has been granted an audience with the Shechinah, similar to the commoner who is granted an audience by a king of flesh and blood, who would not dare to enter the King’s chambers without first being announced. Were he to do so, he too would put his life at risk, as he would be perceived by the king’s guards as planning to assassinate their ruler or otherwise harm him or insult him.
    In the Talmud Yerushalmi, the sages see an allusion in the line (Leviticus 16,17) וכל אדם לא יהיה באהל מועד, “no other human being is to be in the Sanctuary when the High Priest enters there in order to obtain atonement, etc.,” as including the angels. This is why the approach of the High Priest must be audible. [I assume that the Yerushalmi that author has in mind is in Yuma 5,2 where it is recounted that for the 40 years that the High Priest Shimon Hatzadik officiated on the Day of Atonement, he would see an angel with a face like a human being accompanying him to the Holy of Holies, except for the last time when he entered there. He told his friends that he would die during that year, something he gathered from the fact that on that occasion this angel did not materialize. Ed.] Joseph ordered that every person other than his brothers be removed from his chambers before he revealed himself to them. Similarly, during intimate audiences granted by kings, only the immediately concerned party is permitted to be closeted with the King. [Incidentally, this enabled the judge Ehud to kill King Eglon of Moav. Ed. (compare Genesis 45,2, and Judges 3,20)

Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers, causing fear and shame, with the brothers astonished by his sudden appearance as a powerful ruler and scared of potential retaliation for selling him into slavery. The text discusses the gradual revelation of the Divine Presence to Israel, comparing it to how Joseph revealed himself to his brothers little by little, emphasizing the importance of righteousness and meekness in seeking protection. Yosef feared his father had rejected him, but after revealing himself to his brothers, he realized his father still loved and grieved for him, leading him to inquire about his father's well-being before anything else.</summary>

              <p>העוד אבי חי “is my father still alive?” Joseph’s very first words concerned the well being of his father and the concern if he was still alive.  ולא יכלו אחיו לענות אותו כי נבהלו מפניו, “his brothers were not able to answer him as they had become frightened of him.” They were dumbstruck realizing that they had sold him into slavery and now he wielded the authority of a king. They were also scared that he would take revenge on them now. The expression נבהלו occurs in that sense in Isaiah 13,8 ונבהלו צירים וחבלים יאחזון, “And, overcome by terror, they shall be seized by pangs and throes.” According to Tanchuma Vayigash 5 Joseph said to them: “did you not say: ‘this one’s brother is dead?’ I shall call upon him now and he will come to me.” Thereupon he started calling: “Joseph, son of Yaakov, come to me!.” The brothers looked at each of the four corners of the room and nothing happened. Then Joseph said: “what are you looking for, I am your brother Joseph!” When the brothers heard that they lost consciousness. This is why they could not answer him. Rabbi Yochanan used this experience of Joseph’s brothers to exclaim “woe to us on the day of our death, woe to us when we will be called upon to answer for our sins.” If the brothers were so stricken when they heard Joseph reveal himself to his them, how much more will we be frightened when we stand before G’d to be judged! This is what is meant by the verse in Isaiah 10,3: “What will you do on the day of punishment, when the calamity comes from afar?” Another verse on the same theme is found in Maleachi 3,2: “But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can hold out when he appears?”</p>

              <p>Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph, and then immediately asked: Does my father still live? And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him. Joseph, of course, knew who they were the entire time, but the brothers were overcome by confusion and fear over the sudden revelation. Until now, they considered Joseph to be lost, even if they may have dreamt that one day they would discover him as a slave somewhere and possibly even free him. However, now he is present before them as an eminent personality, their apparent antagonist, the ruler in whose hands their fate rests.</p>

              <p>העוד אבי חי?, “is my father still alive?” Even though he had asked them the same question already in 43,27 and the brothers had answered in the affirmative, his question now concerned the state of his health, not the mere fact that Yaakov was still alive. The word חי therefore has to be equated with בריא, healthy.     It is also possible that he did not really ask this question in order to receive additional information, but merely to have an opening to speak to the brothers, instead of as until now, about “your father,” but about “my father,” i.e. their common father. This was a ploy to establish close personal contact with his brothers. </p>

(Joseph and Judah became angry with one another. )  “They saw it and were astonished” (Psalms 48:6) – “The men wondered to one another” (Genesis 43:33). “They were terrified; they hastened” (Psalms 48:6) – “[Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live?] And his brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3). “A fearful trembling seized them there” (Psalms 45:6) – these are the tribes. They said: ‘Kings are contending with one another; of what concern is it to us? (The other brothers felt it was not their place to intervene in the confrontation between Joseph and Judah. )  It is appropriate for a king to contend with a king.’   “Judah approached him” – “One approaches another” (Job 41:8) – this is Judah and Joseph. “Not even a breath comes between them” (Job 41:8) – these are the tribes.

              <p>“My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or a brother?” (Genesis 44:19).  “My lord asked his servants…” – [Judah] said to him: ‘From the outset you came against us with malice. How many countries descended to Egypt to purchase food? But you did not ask [this of] any of them. Did we, perhaps, come to take our daughter, or are you planning to marry our sister? Nevertheless, we hid nothing from you.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘I see that you are a prattler. Is there among your brothers a prattler like you?’ (Why are you the only one of the brothers talking? According to Tanḥuma (Vayigash 5), Joseph claimed that he knew through divination that Judah was not the oldest of the brothers, and therefore it was even more surprising that he was doing all the talking. )  [Judah] said to him: ‘All this that you see is because I became a guarantor for him.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘Why did you not do so on behalf of your brother when you sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver pieces, and you brought anguish to your father and said to him: “Joseph was mauled”?’ (Genesis 37:33). When Judah heard this he screamed and cried in a loud voice. (Judah screamed and cried because Joseph was not giving in to his demand to release Benjamin. )  He said: “For how will I go up to my father?” (Genesis 44:34). Judah said to Naphtali: ‘Go and see how many marketplaces there are in Egypt.’ He leapt and returned and said to him: ‘Twelve.’ Judah said to his brothers: ‘I will destroy three of them, and each and every one of you take one each, “and no man will be left among them”’ (I Samuel 14:36). His brothers said to him: ‘Egypt is not like Shekhem. If you destroy Egypt you will be destroying the entire world.’   “Joseph could not restrain himself before all those standing before him, and he called: Remove every man from before me. No man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers” (Genesis 45:1).  “He raised his voice in weeping; the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard” (Genesis 45:2).  “Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live? And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him” (Genesis 45:3).  “Joseph said to his brothers: Please approach me, and they approached. He said: I am Joseph your brother whom you sold to Egypt” (Genesis 45:4).  At that moment, “Joseph could not restrain himself” (Genesis 45:1). When Joseph saw that they had come to an agreement to destroy Egypt, Joseph said to himself: ‘It is preferable that I reveal myself to them and they will not destroy Egypt.’ Joseph said to them: ‘Did you not say that this one’s brother was dead? I will call him and he will come to you.’ He was calling: ‘Joseph son of Jacob, come to me. Joseph son of Jacob come to me.’ They were looking to the four corners of the palace. He said to them: ‘What are you looking for? “I am Joseph your brother”’ (Genesis 45:4). Immediately, their souls departed, as it is stated: “His brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3). But they did not believe him until he uncovered himself and showed them his circumcision.</p>

              <p>When R.

R. Huna would weep and say: &quot;A slave who is invited to eat from his master's table, shall be debarred from seeing him, as it is said (Is. 1, 11) Or what serveth Me the multitude of your sacrifices?&quot; When R. Elasar came to this verse (Gen. 45, 3) And his brothers could not answer him, because they were terrified at his presence, he wept and said: &quot;If this is the result of a human being's admonition, how much the more will it be of the Holy One, praised be He!&quot; R. Elazar cried also when he came to the verse (I Sam. 28, 15) And Samuel said to Saul: 'Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?' If Samuel the prophet was afraid of the judgment, how much the more ought we be afraid of it! How shall this be interpreted? It is written (Ib. ib. 12) And the woman said unto Saul: 'Divine being have I seen (Olim) ascending out of the earth.' Olim is plural. Hence they were two. One was Samuel and the other was Moses whom Samuel brought, for he said: &quot;Perhaps I am called before the Divine Judgment, so he said to Moses come and testify in my behalf that there is not a thing written in thy Torah which I did not fulfill.&quot; When he came to the following verse (Lam. 3, 29) That he put his mouth in the dust, perhaps there still is hope. R. Ami used to cry. He said: &quot;After so much had been done, nevertheless it is said, perhaps.&quot; R. Ami used to cry when he came to the following verse (Zeph. 2, 3) See ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, who have fulfilled the ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness; perhaps ye will be protected on the day of the Lord's anger. He said: &quot;After so much will have been done, still it will be perhaps.&quot; When he came to the following passage, R. Assi used to cry (Amos 5, 15) Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice firmly in the gate; perhaps the Lord, the God of hosts shall be gracious unto the remnants of Joseph. He said: &quot;After so much will have been done, it will still be perhaps.&quot; </p>

              <p>Another Interpretation (of Is. 35:1): THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD. For what reason was this written? To teach you that when the Holy One revealed his Divine Presence over Israel, he {was not revealed } [did not reveal] all his bounty to them on one occasion, because they would not have been able to persevere in this bounty; for if he had revealed his bounty to them at one time, they would all have died. See what is written (in Is. 64:3 [4]): FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL THEY HAVE NOT HEARD, NOR HAS AN EAR PERCEIVED, NOR HAS AN EYE SEEN . Go and learn from Joseph; for when he made himself known to his brothers after so many years,  Joseph said to them (in Gen. 45:3): I AM {YOUR BROTHER} JOSEPH …, HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM; FOR THEY WERE DISMAYED BECAUSE OF HIM. How much the more  at  the Holy One! What did the Holy One do for them instead? He revealed himself to them little by little. At the beginning, he made the mountains glad, as stated (in Is. 35:1): THE WILDERNESS AND THE ARID LAND SHALL BE GLAD. Then after that (ibid.): THE STEPPES SHALL REJOICE. THEN AFTER THAT (in vs. 2): IT SHALL BLOOM ABUNDANTLY. Then after that (ibid.): THE GLORY OF LEBANON {SHALL COME UNTO YOU} [HAS BEEN GIVEN TO IT]. Then after that (ibid.): THEY SHALL SEE THE GLORY OF THE LORD, THE SPLENDOR OF OUR GOD. For that reason David said (in Ps. 102:17 [16]): FOR THE LORD HAS BUILD UP ZION; HE HAS APPEARED IN HIS GLORY. It also says (in Is. 52:8): FOR EYE TO EYE THEY WILL SEE THE RETURN OF THE LORD TO ZION. [Moreover, it says] (in Is. 25:9): IN THAT DAY THEY SHALL SAY: SEE, THIS IS OUR GOD; WE WAITED FOR HIM, AND HE DELIVERED US. THIS IS THE LORD; WE WAITED FOR HIM.

              </summary>
              <p>(Deut. 1:1:) “These are the words (elleh hadevarim).” May the name [of the Holy One, blessed be He,] be blessed and may His memory be exalted. All the miracles that he did for Israel in the wilderness, He is likewise going to do in Zion. It is written concerning the wilderness (ibid.), “These are the words;” and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 42:16), “I will turn darkness before them into light and rough places into level ground. These things (elleh hadevarim) I will do, and I will not forsake them.” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 20:15), “Now all the people saw the thunderings (qol in the plural)”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Jer. 33:11), “The sound (qol) of joy and the sound (qol) of gladness, [the voice (qol) of the bridegroom and the voice (qol) of the bride].” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Ps. 68:9), “The earth quaked”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Hag. 2:6), “I will cause the heavens and the earth to quake.” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Exod. 13:21), “And the Lord went before them by day”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 52:12), “for the Lord shall go before you.” It is written concerning the wilderness (in Deut. 30:9), “for the Lord shall be glad over you again”; and it is written concerning Zion (in Is. 65:19), “I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people.” [Also (according to Is. 35:1),] “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” What did Isaiah see to say this? It is simply that, when Israel transgressed the Torah, Hosea arose and said (in Hos. 2:5), “I will make her like a wilderness and render her like an arid land.” For that reason Isaiah has said (in Is. 35:1), “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” Now all the consolations of which Isaiah spoke are double, because (according to Is. 40:2) “she (i.e., Jerusalem) has received from the hand of the Lord double for all her sins.” (Lam. R. 1:22.)  So for that reason the consolations are double (in vs. 1) “Comfort, O comfort My people.” [Similarly (in Is. 51:12),] “I, I am the one who comforts you.” [Also (in Is. 51:9),] “Awake, awake.” [Also (in Is. 51:17),] “Rouse yourself, rouse yourself!” [Also] (in Is. 61:10),] “I will be glad with rejoicing.” [Also] (in Is. 35:2),] “It shall blossom with blossoms.” Another interpretation (of Is. 35:1), “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” For what reason was this written? To teach you that when the Holy One, blessed be He, reveals His Divine Presence over Israel, He does not reveal it all to them on one occasion, because they would not have been able to persevere in this bounty all at once; for if He had revealed His bounty to them at one time, they would all have died. See what is written (in Is. 64:3), “From time immemorial they have not heard, nor has an ear perceived, nor has an eye seen a God besides you, who works for those who wait for him.” Go and learn from Joseph; for when he made himself known to his brothers after so many years, [when] Joseph said to them (in Gen. 45:3), “I am Joseph,” they all died, “and they could not answer him; [for they were dismayed because of him].” How much the more [would Israel be dismayed] at [a sudden revelation of] the Holy One, blessed be He! So what does the Holy One, blessed be He, do for them instead? He reveals himself to them little by little. At the beginning, He makes the mountains glad, as stated (in Is. 35:1), “The wilderness and the arid land shall be glad.” Then after that (ibid.), “the steppes shall rejoice […].” Then after that (in vs. 2), “It shall bloom abundantly.” Then after that (ibid.), “the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it.” Then after that (ibid.), “they shall see the glory of the Lord, the splendor of our God.” For that reason David said (in Ps. 102:17), “For the Lord has built up Zion; He has appeared in His glory.” It also says (in Is. 52:8), “for eye to eye they will see the return of the Lord to Zion.” And it also says (in Is. 25:9), “In that day they shall say, ‘See, this is our God; we waited for Him, and He delivered us; [this is the Lord; we waited for Him, let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.’”</p>

              <p>ולא יכלו אחיו לענות אותו . We find in Bereshit Rabbah (93,10), that this verse teaches us how impossible it is to confront those who admonish us. Bileam, the wisest of the Gentiles, could not justify himself before his ass (Numbers 22,30), and Joseph, the youngest of the brothers, silenced his older brothers when he confronted them with admonitions. In due course, G–d will admonish each one of us individually (Psalms 50,21 &quot;I shall censure you and confront you with charges&quot;). The Zohar comments at length on 43,18, describing the brothers' fear when escorted to Joseph's private residence (Sullam edition Miketz page 53). &quot;Woe to those who neither know nor bother to study the Torah. G–d will demand an accounting from them. Body and soul will both have to answer for their deeds before they are finally separated.&quot;</p>

This explains why after revealing himself to his brothers, Yosef’s first thought is not about Yehuda or Binyamin, but about Yaakov.

              <p>On the pasuk (Bereishit 45:3-4), “And his brothers could not answer him because they were afraid of him...I am Yosef your brother whom you sold to Mitzrayim,” there is a difficulty. If Yosef was trying to console them, why did he mention the sale, which would embarrass them more? However, there was a deeper consolation here. The brothers definitely felt Yosef's holiness, as indicated by their fear of his countenance. Yosef was telling them that he reached this high level of righteousness because they sold him to Mitzrayim. This realization alleviated their guilt, as they thought he would have been greater had he stayed with their father, but this was not the case at all. It then says, “and the brothers spoke to him,” contrasting their initial inability to speak to him peacefully. Now, they could converse with him, free from jealousy. In truth, one cannot be jealous of someone who has perfected their unique role and place, as everyone has a specific place designed for them, making jealousy irrelevant. However, until the tzadik has fully perfected himself, jealousy is possible. In the future, when everyone has corrected themselves and is in their proper place, there will be no jealousy. This is as it says in Yeshaya 11:13, “Then Ephraim’s envy shall cease and Yehuda’s harassment shall end; Ephraim shall not envy Yehuda, and Yehuda shall not harass Ephraim.”</p>

              <p>גשו נא אלי “please come closer to me.” He told them about the subject of how he had been sold, in a whisper, so that bystanders could not hear him. A different exegesis of these words: they were asked to approach him as they could do so; he, Joseph, being only one, could not come closer to some of them without at the same time distancing himself from some others. Besides, he was not concerned about his dignity but more about theirs. According to Rashi, he asked them to come near, so that he could show them, and them only, that he had been circumcised. There was no chance that this could have been misinterpreted as causing the brothers to believe that he was a Yishmaelite, who also perform the rite of circumcision on themselves, as they only performed this rite at the age of 13, as had their forefather Yishmael, and who leave a membrane around the glans untouched as distinct from the Hebrews who through being circumcised at an early age remove it when the fact that it has been removed remains clearly visible. Even though, according to Rashi, the Egyptians at that time also had been circumcised by a decree from Joseph, but this was done primarily by the poor who needed to purchase grain from him, but since Joseph was wealthy, the only reason why he was circumcised would be because he was a Hebrew. Another exegesis, since the brothers did not know that the Egyptians had been circumcised by Joseph, this mark would identify him as a Hebrew beyond doubt.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>גשו נא אלי, ויגשו, “please come physically closer to me; they did so.” Seeing that prior to this Joseph had ordered everybody in the hall with them to leave the hall, (45,1) and the Egyptians outside now trying very hard to listen to what went on inside, Joseph now tried to put more physical distance between them and himself and the brothers. He did not mind them to hear him ask the brothers: “is my father still alive?” He did not want them to hear the words: “you have sold me,” however, in order not to embarrass them publicly, and because he intended to settle Yaakov’s whole family in Egypt. If his employees had heard him refer to this, they would have objected to such wicked people settling in Egypt. They would conclude that if these people had been capable of selling their own brother, how much worse would they deal with Egyptian neighbours that were not related to them by blood? This is why he asked them to step closer so that the balance of the conversation could be conducted in whispers. An alternate interpretation: first Joseph told his brothers that he was their brother; next he asked if his father was still alive; He did not want to raise the subject of their having sold him in the presence of his brother Binyamin who had been unaware of that. He knew that this would greatly embarrass his brothers, and that Binyamin upon hearing of this would surely report it to their father. He therefore motioned the brothers to move over so that he could continue the conversation where Binyamin could not overhear it. [This editor cannot believe that Binyamin was in the same hall, as surely he had been taken into custody after the goblet had been found in his sack. He only released him in verse 13 when he instructed the brothers to return forthwith to the land of Canaan. Ed.]

              <p>Yosef said &quot;גשו נא אלי&quot;-&quot;come close to me&quot;. He showed them that he was circumcised. By doing this he wanted to show them his righteousness - that even though he was among people who were indulged with forbidden marriages, he didn't do the same. We find that it says in Tehillim &quot;שישראל נגאלו ממצרים בזכות ד' דברים&quot;- &quot;that Bnei Yisrael got redeemed from Mitzrayim in the merit of 4 things&quot; (1) they didn't change their clothes (2) they didn't change their names (3) they didn't speak Loshon Hara (4) they didn't intermarry.           So too, here, Yosef let his brothers know in which merits they would be taken out of the future Galus and he is hinting to them that he is complete in all of those 4 matters. He didn't change his name, as he said: &quot;I am Yosef&quot;. He didn't change his language, as he spoke to them in Loshon Hakodesh. He didn't intermarry, as he showed them that he was circumcised. He didn't speak Loshon Hara, as he said &quot;come close to me &quot;- because he didn't want Benyamin to hear about the selling and he didn't tell his father anything either. Yosef is also hinting to them that because of their sin of selling him, their children will be strangers. Like it says: &quot;and now dont be sad&quot;, meaning, specifically NOW because in the future you will be sad. Therefore Yosef is also hinting to them about the Geula and the things that will bring the Geula. Some say that he is hinting to the ten killed leaders, that in the future they will be sad over the selling.</p>

He said: &quot;I am Joseph your brother, does my father still live, etc.?&quot; in order to dispel their fear of him. He stressed the word your brother in that sentence. In the next sentence, after he had formed the impression that they did not believe him, he stressed the words your brother whom you have sold, indicating that even at the time they had sold him he had not ceased feeling like a brother towards them. He added the words &quot;whom you have sold to Egypt&quot; as proof that it was he, Joseph, for not even a prophet could have knowledge of that fact except he himself (compare Yalkut Shimoni 142).</p>

Perhaps he saw them moving back, so he said, “Come near.” The answer is: Rashi infers this because it is written גשו אלי rather than קרבו אלי, and גשו means coming close. Why did they have to come so near to him? Perforce, because he showed them the circumcision. We need not ask: How does Rashi know that he saw them recoiling backwards? Perhaps he said “come close” only to show them the circumcision. For [the answer is:] If so, why did he say, “Please?” It is understandable if he saw them recoiling backwards, and he said “please” in order to speak to them tenderly so they would not feel ashamed. But if they stayed in place, why did he say “please” to them, using an expression of pleading?</p>

    It is also possible that he did not want to remind them aloud of the fact that they had sold him, and therefore he made them approach him closely so that he could whisper to them. He did not want the people in the courtyard to overhear this part of their conversation.
    According to Rashi, the reason he wanted them to approach him closely was to show them that he was circumcised, just like them, to prove that he was who he had just said that he was. I do not think this would have proved anything as all the male descendants of Yishmael were also in the habit of performing circumcision on themselves, albeit at the age of 13. Moreover, according to the Midrash, the Egyptians had adopted the rite of circumcision at the advice of Joseph.

How many countries descended to Egypt to purchase food? But you did not ask [this of] any of them. Did we, perhaps, come to take our daughter, or are you planning to marry our sister? Nevertheless, we hid nothing from you.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘I see that you are a prattler. Is there among your brothers a prattler like you?’ (Why are you the only one of the brothers talking? According to Tanḥuma (Vayigash 5), Joseph claimed that he knew through divination that Judah was not the oldest of the brothers, and therefore it was even more surprising that he was doing all the talking. )  [Judah] said to him: ‘All this that you see is because I became a guarantor for him.’ [Joseph] said to him: ‘Why did you not do so on behalf of your brother when you sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver pieces, and you brought anguish to your father and said to him: “Joseph was mauled”?’ (Genesis 37:33). When Judah heard this he screamed and cried in a loud voice. (Judah screamed and cried because Joseph was not giving in to his demand to release Benjamin. )  He said: “For how will I go up to my father?” (Genesis 44:34). Judah said to Naphtali: ‘Go and see how many marketplaces there are in Egypt.’ He leapt and returned and said to him: ‘Twelve.’ Judah said to his brothers: ‘I will destroy three of them, and each and every one of you take one each, “and no man will be left among them”’ (I Samuel 14:36). His brothers said to him: ‘Egypt is not like Shekhem. If you destroy Egypt you will be destroying the entire world.’   “Joseph could not restrain himself before all those standing before him, and he called: Remove every man from before me. No man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers” (Genesis 45:1).  “He raised his voice in weeping; the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard” (Genesis 45:2).  “Joseph said to his brothers: I am Joseph; does my father still live? And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him” (Genesis 45:3).  “Joseph said to his brothers: Please approach me, and they approached. He said: I am Joseph your brother whom you sold to Egypt” (Genesis 45:4).  At that moment, “Joseph could not restrain himself” (Genesis 45:1). When Joseph saw that they had come to an agreement to destroy Egypt, Joseph said to himself: ‘It is preferable that I reveal myself to them and they will not destroy Egypt.’ Joseph said to them: ‘Did you not say that this one’s brother was dead? I will call him and he will come to you.’ He was calling: ‘Joseph son of Jacob, come to me. Joseph son of Jacob come to me.’ They were looking to the four corners of the palace. He said to them: ‘What are you looking for? “I am Joseph your brother”’ (Genesis 45:4). Immediately, their souls departed, as it is stated: “His brothers could not [answer him because they were alarmed before him]” (Genesis 45:3). But they did not believe him until he uncovered himself and showed them his circumcision.</p>

When Joseph mentioned a second time that G–d had sent him ahead in 45,7, he phrased it thus: לשום לכם שארית בארץ ולהחיות לכם לפלטה גדולה, &quot;To provide refuge for you in the land, and to keep you alive for a great rescue.&quot; At first glance these words seem totally superfluous; שארית refers to something insignificant, whereas פלטה גדולה alludes to something major. Actually, Joseph alluded to two separate missions which he had been entrusted with in order to establish the kingdom of Yehudah. The first, a minor mission, was to establish a base for a kingdom of Yehudah in this world, i.e. the Exodus from Egypt, whereas the more important mission was that he would prepare the ground for the Messianic kingdom of David, i.e. play the role of the משיח בן יוסף. He explained that the Messiah ben Joseph would be slain as a martyr on behalf of the people of Israel, and that following his death the enduring kingdom of David-Messiah would arise.

And also, there is one who says Madanim [מדנים] and Midaynim [מדיינים], [called this] for the name of the cargo that they carry, such as in Iyov 38:31 &quot;Can you bind the cords [ma'adnot; מַעֲדַנּוֹת] of the Pleiades?&quot;, or I Samuel 15:32 &quot;And Agag came to him in chains [ma'adnot; מַעֲדַנּוֹת]&quot;. And sometimes the ayin is omitted, for it's usual to omit the letters alef, chet, hey and ayin. For example, &quot;and laid in wait [vayarev, וַיָּרֶב] in a valley&quot; (I Samuel 15:5), which is like vaye'arev ויארב. And so too is explained &quot;sitters on couches [midin, מִדִּין]&quot; (Shoftim 5:10), that it's like on the cargo which is bound. And all of this isn't worth anything to me, but it was one people, as I have explained, just as they call us sometimes Yehudim and sometimes Yisra'elim and sometimes Yeshurun. And the truth is that his brothers sold him, as he said to them &quot;that have sold me here&quot; (Bereishit 45:4), and [the merchants?] caused them to swear, as I have explained, and made from them great profit, like a man who sells his field because of its poor quality, for they would give of their own that someone would distance it from them, for in they end they hated him with a hatred.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויעברו אנשים מדינים סוחרים, וימשכו, “Midianite men, merchants, passed by and pulled Joseph (out of the pit).” According to the plain meaning of the text the passing Midianites pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him, not the brothers. According to this interpretation, Joseph saying to the brothers in Genesis 45,4 “I am Joseph whom you have sold to Egypt,” has to refer to the fact that the brothers dumped him in the pit as a result of which he was eventually sold to Egypt. This would be supported by the fact that at that time he said מצרימה, i.e. in the direction of Egypt, as opposed to למצרים, which would have meant: “to Egypt.” He referred to a process which eventually brought him to Egypt after he had been traded from master to master. In that event the sin attributed to the brothers by the Romans (who punished Jewish scholars over 1200 years later) would have been an indirect sin at best. They were punished for being the cause which triggered Joseph’s eventually winding up in Egypt as a slave. The Romans felt that leading citizens of the Jewish people should pay for this indirect sale of Joseph by the brothers. They considered it murder seeing that if the Ishmaelites or Midianites had not come along Joseph would have died in that pit. The principle of prominent people being considered guilty of murder even if it was not by laying an actual hand of the victim is reflected in the Bible by the case of David who ordered his commander-in-chief Yoav to place Bat Sheva’s husband Uriah in such an exposed position at the front against the Bney Ammon that he was almost certain to be killed. He instructed Yoav to ensure that Uriah would be killed by withdrawing the support of his comrades-in-arms from Uriah. As a result, Uriah was killed. by the Ammonites, and the Bible (the prophet Natan in Samuel II 12,9) accused David outright of having murdered Uriah though he had not laid a hand on him. The only difference between murdering someone with one’s own hands and between contriving his certain death in another fashion is the culpability before a human tribunal. The sin vis-a-vis G’d is the same (compare Kidushin 43)</p>

                <h4>Rashbam on Genesis 37:28:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>ויעברו אנשים מדינים, while the brothers had been sitting down to consume their meal, having distanced themselves somewhat from the pit into which they had thrown Joseph in order not to be guilty of “eating while spilling blood,” they were waiting for the Ishmaelites whom they had seen in the distance, to arrive. During this period the Midianites, coming from a different direction had passed there, saw Joseph in the pit, pulled him up, and proceeded to sell him to the Ishmaelites. One may assume that the brothers had no knowledge of this. Even though the Torah appears to attribute the sale of Joseph to the Ishmaelites to the brothers, (based on Joseph accusing them of having sold him to Egypt, 45,4) we would have to say that because of their having been instrumental in bringing about that sale they are considered as if having assisted in that sale. This appears to me the deeper meaning of the plain meaning of the text both here and in chapter 45. The line describing the Midianites passing that way is described as something totally coincidental, having nothing to do with what the brothers had planned to do with Joseph. Even if the Torah says:וימכרו (את) יוסף לישמעאלים, this sounds as if the brothers did the selling. It is also possible that the brothers noting the Midianites suddenly materialising out of nowhere, instructed them to pull Joseph out of the pit after which they themselves sold him to the Ishmaelites.</p>

                <h4>Tur HaArokh, Genesis 37:25:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>והנה אורחת ישמעאלים, ”and here there was a caravan of Ishmaelites, etc.” Nachmanides explains that when the brothers looked around they saw a group of people and camels in the distance whom they immediately identified as Ishmaelites, though they were still quite distant. They knew that these Ishmaelites were headed for Egypt as it was their custom to bring these various spices named in our verse to Egypt. This is why Yehudah said that seeing these people come from a distant land and are headed for a distant land, they could sell Joseph to them and this matter would never become known. When these people drew near, they realized that they were not the people whom they had thought them to be, but that they were merchants who traveled these regions all the time. These merchants had bought the spices from the Ishmaelites and had rented camels from them. They sold Joseph to these merchants, who bought him to trade him off, just as they traded their other merchandise. The caravan of Ishmaelites they had espied earlier were in the business of renting out camels, never buying merchandise for their own consumption. This is the meaning of the words: מיד הישמעאלים אשר הורידוהו שמה, “from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down to Egypt.” (39,1) Joseph was under the control of the Ishmaelites, although he was owned by the Midianites, prior to his sale to Potiphar. 
    The style of the whole paragraph i.e. the repetition of the events related therein, must be understood as once described from the Ishmaelties’ perspective, and once from the Midianites’ perspective. We encounter something of a similar nature at the very end of the Torah (Deuteronomy 34,12) ולכל היד החזקה וכל המורא הגדול אשר עשה משה לעיני כל ישראל, where all the miracles performed by Moses are attributed to him, whereas previously in Deuteronomy 11,3 all of these miracles are attributed to G’d Himself.”
    Ibn Ezra (on verse 28) says that the Midianites are called here Ishmaelites, as they are in Judges 8,24, [although Gideon had been fighting the 5 Kings of the Midianites. Ed] seeing that their founding mother was Hagar. [if she was identical with Keturah. Ed.] 
    Rash’bam writes that the brothers did not sell Joseph at all, but they sat down to eat, and while they were eating they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites in the distance. They then decided that after they would have completed their meal they would sell Joseph to these Ishmaelites. Before being able to do so, the Midianites arrived on the scene (the brothers not being within earshot of Joseph’s cries for mercy) and pulled Joseph out of the pit. They proceeded to sell him to the Ishmaelites. As to Joseph saying to his brothers in Genesis 45,4: “I am your brother whom you have sold to Egypt,” Joseph simply blamed what the brothers had done to him for his having been sold to Egypt. 
    Some commentators interpret the word ומדנים as not referring to Midianites, but as being a derivative of the word מדון, strife as in ריב ומדון, Chabakuk, 1,3 where it describes strife and contention. The Torah meant that the strife and contention between the brothers ultimately resulted in Joseph being sold to Egypt.
 Yet another view expressed by some commentators is that the brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites, but they were afraid of raising him from the pit as they themselves might be bitten by the snakes; they therefore waited until the Midianites had raised him from the pit, as the Midianites were snake charmers and could safely venture into the pit. We know about all this from the Midianites who brought their charms with them when they visited Bileam as part of the delegation from Balak. (Numbers chapter 22) Joseph wound up being owned jointly by the Midianites and the Ishmaelites
    Some commentators say that the Ishmaelites sold Joseph to Potiphar who had accused them of having kidnapped him. The Midianites guaranteed to Potiphar that Joseph was theirs to sell, and had not been kidnapped. This is why the Torah attributes the actual sale to the Midianites who acted as guarantors for the validity of the sale. The Ishmaelites are also described as selling him, as 1) they had physical possession of him, and 2) they had paid 20 silver pieces for him to the brothers. The reason why so little money changed hands was that Joseph, because of his traumatic experience in the pit, no longer looked nearly as handsome as he had before his trauma.

              <p>[9] &quot;If they say, 'Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause'&quot; - These are the brothers of Joseph, who were lurking and saying, 'When will the end come, and we will kill him?' And when he came to them, they began to say to one another, 'This is the hour; this is the season,' and the Divine Presence (Shechinah) was jesting and saying, 'Woe to them for the blood of this righteous one.' Therefore, it is said, &quot;We will lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.&quot; And of them all, none wanted to save him except Reuben, as it is said, &quot;Reuben heard, and he saved him from their hand.&quot; He said to them, 'Come, and I will give you advice,' They said to him, 'What advice are you giving us?' He said to them, 'Let us throw him into the pit while he is alive, and our hand will not be upon him,' From where [do we learn this]? As it is stated: (Proverbs 1:12): &quot;We will swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole, as those that go down into the pit&quot; - that he went down to the pit in his innocence, and he did not know what they were going to do to him. Rabbi Levi ben Zavdai said: &quot;Who lowered [Joseph] into the pit from among all his brothers? You must say it was Simeon and Levi, as it is said (Genesis 49:6), 'Into their council let my soul not enter.' But Reuben intended to save him and return him to his father, as it is said (Genesis 37:22), 'That he might save him from their hand, to restore him to his father.' (Genesis 37:29): 'And Reuben returned to the pit' - where was he? Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Nehemiah [disagreed]: Rabbi Judah said, 'The burden of the household was thrust upon him, and as soon as he was free from his burden, he came and looked into the pit and did not find him. This is the meaning of &quot;And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph was not in the pit, and he tore his clothes.&quot;' Rabbi Nehemiah said, 'He was occupied in his sackcloth and fasting over the incident that occurred, and he did not turn [from it], and as soon as he was free from his sackcloth and fasting, he came and looked into the pit and did not find him, as it says &quot;And Reuben returned to the pit, etc.&quot; ' Not only that, but once they sold him, the Divine Presence (Shechinah) mocked them and said to them (Isaiah 55:8), 'For my thoughts are not your thoughts, etc.,' not with the thought that you think, 'nor your ways my ways,' and not in the way that you say, for if there were not a decree from before Me, your counsel would be nothing. (Proverbs 1:13): 'All precious substance shall we find, our houses shall be filled with spoil' - this is the sale of Joseph, who was a precious son to his father, as it is said (Genesis 37:3), 'For he was the son of his old age,' he was found to sustain them, as it is written (Genesis 45:5), 'For God sent me before you to preserve life.' 'Our houses shall be filled with spoil' - that they filled their houses with silver and gold from Joseph's treasures. Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said: The ten martyrs were drawn [to their deaths] only by the sin of selling Joseph. Rabbi Avin said: You must say that ten were exacted from every generation, and still, that sin persists. (Proverbs 1:14): 'Your lot shall be cast among us' - when Joseph sat down, he took the key and was calling out: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun - they are sons of one mother, let them come and sit; Dan and Naphtali - they are sons of one mother, let them come and sit; Gad and Asher - they are sons of one mother, let them come and sit; and he went back and hit with the key and said: Benjamin is an orphan, and I am an orphan, it is fitting for an orphan to sit with an orphan, 'One purse shall be ours' - for they all ate at one table at the banquet. How did he do it? He gave each one one portion, and to Benjamin five portions, how? He took his portion, and Benjamin's portion, and Ephraim's portion, and Manasseh's portion, and the portion of Asenath, Joseph's wife, and gave it to Benjamin, as it is said (Genesis 43:34): 'And he took and sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs, and they drank and were merry with him.' Rabbi Shmuelai said in the name of Rabbi Isaac from Magdala: From the day that Joseph separated from his brothers he did not taste the taste of wine until that day, as it is written (Genesis 49:26), 'And the crown of the head of his brothers' Nazirite.' Rabbi Yosei bar Hanina said: They also did not taste the taste of wine, as it is said, 'And they drank and were merry with him.' Another explanation, 'Your lot shall be cast among us' - this is the Torah, which was the lot of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and given to Israel; 'One purse shall be ours' - at the time when they stood at Mount Sinai and said (Exodus 24:7), 'All that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will hear.'&quot;</p>

            <summary>Joseph's actions in forgiving his brothers and comforting them, as well as his discretion in not revealing their actions to their father, demonstrate the importance of guarding one's tongue and deeds. When Joseph told his brothers &quot;And now do not grieve,&quot; he was indicating that his current actions would not cause distress, but that there may be future actions that would. This is related to the concept of the משיח בן יוסף, hinting at a time when the sin of selling Joseph would be visited upon the brothers' descendants.</summary>

              <p>What Joseph does towards his brothers is different. When he first reveals himself to them, he says, “And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you” (Gen. 45:5). This sounds like forgiveness, but, as this parasha makes clear, it is not necessarily so. The word “forgiveness” is not used. And the brothers may well have assumed that, as in the case of Esau, Joseph intended to take revenge but not during the lifetime of their father. That is what provokes the drama at the end of this parasha: When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?” So they sent word to Joseph, saying,</p>

The narrative in the Torah, such as the story of Joseph, conveys deeper truths rather than just historical accuracy, with the overarching message being that God is behind the scenes ensuring events occur according to His plan (Covenant and Conversation Family Edition, Vayeshev, I; The Angel Who Did Not Know He Was an Angel 43, 47).

              <p>Our belief is that God manages all the details necessary to deliver His desired outcome. This story has so many moving parts and small details, each one noteworthy, to deliver the final outcome. One of the core messages of this narrative is just that – to remember that God plays a role in our lives on a daily basis even if we don’t realise it at the time. This is the message that Yosef gives his brothers at the conclusion of the story (Bereshit 45:5).</p>

              <p>AROUND THE SHABBAT TABLE Narrative in the Torah is not about historical truth. That is not to say that it is not necessarily historically accurate, but conveying historical details is not the main aim of narrative in the Torah. Narrative delivers other truths. The Torah could have told the story of Yosef in a more direct, less complex way. Not all the details were necessary to arrive at the end of the story. But the Torah does not waste words. There is a message in all the details. One of the main and overarching messages is that God is behind the scenes making sure that events occur and destinations are reached according to His plan. This was in fact the message Yosef delivered to his brothers at the end of the story in Bereshit 45:5: “Now, do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here. There was a reason that God sent me ahead of you.” God has a larger plan, and all the details in our lives happen to achieve that divine plan.</p>

              <p>“From the ground, which the Lord cursed” – there were ten periods of famine that came to the world: One in the days of Adam the first man, as it is stated: “Cursed is the ground on your account” (Genesis 3:17); one in the days of Lemekh, as it is stated: “From the ground, which the Lord cursed”; one in the days of Abraham – “there was a famine in the land” (Genesis 12:10); one in the days of Isaac, as it is stated: “There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine” (Genesis 26:1); one in the days of Jacob, as it is stated: “For these two years, the famine” (Genesis 45:6); one in the days when the judges judged, as it is stated: “It was in the days when the judges judged; there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1); one in the days of David, as it is stated: “There was a famine in the days of David for three years” (II Samuel 21:1); one in the days of Elijah, as it is stated: “As the Lord, God of Israel, before whom I stand, lives, there will be dew and rain during these years only by my word” (I Kings 17:1); one in the days of Elisha, as it is stated: “There was a great famine in Samaria” (II Kings 6:25); and there is one that circulates and comes periodically to the world. And [there will be] one more in the future, as it is stated: “Not a famine for bread, and not a thirst for water, but rather, to hear the words of the Lord” (Amos 8:11).  Rabbi Huna and Rabbi Yirmeya in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak: In reality, it [David’s famine] should not have occurred in the days of David, but rather, in the days of Saul. (The reason underlying the famine was relevant to Saul, not David (II Samuel 21:1).)  However, because Saul was the shoot of a sycamore, (Easily broken, unable to withstand it, due to his lack of merit.)  the Holy One blessed be He postponed it and brought it about in the days of David. They say a parable: Shilo sinned, but Yoḥana pays?! That is astonishing! Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great said: This is analogous to a glazier who had in his hand a basket filled with goblets and cut glass. When he would wish to hang his basket, he would [first] bring a peg, affix it, and suspend himself from it, and only then would he hang his basket. That is why they did not come in the days of downtrodden people, but rather, in the days of powerful people, who are able to withstand them. Rabbi Berekhya would cite this verse in their regard: “He gives strength to the weary” (Isaiah 40:29).  Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: There were two [famines] that occurred in the days of Abraham. Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: One was in the days of Lemekh, and one in the days of Abraham.  The famine that came in the days of Elijah was a famine of drought; one year produced [crops], and one year did not produce. The famine that came in the days of Elisha was a famine of panic, as it is stated: “Until the head of a donkey was sold for eighty silver pieces” (II Kings 6:25). The famine that was in the days that the judges judged, Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Dosa: For the price for which one used to purchase forty-two se’a, they could purchase [only] forty-one. (According to a different reading: the price for which one used to purchase two se’a, they could purchase [only] one.)  But is it not taught: A person should not depart and go outside the Land of Israel unless two se’a  of wheat sells for one sela? (Double the ordinary price of wheat, which was four se’a for a sela (Pe’a 8:7).)  Rabbi Shimon said: That is only when he does not find any [wheat] to buy, but if he can find to buy, even if it is one se’a for a sela, one should not depart and go outside the Land of Israel. But Elimelekh did depart, therefore, he was punished.</p>

One during the days of Adam the first man – “accursed is the ground because of you” (Genesis 3:17); one during the days of Lemekh – “from the ground that the Lord had cursed” (Genesis 5:29); one during the days of Abraham – “there was famine in the land and Abram descended to Egypt” (Genesis 12:10); one during the days of Isaac: “there was a famine in the land”; one during the days of Jacob – “for these two years there has been famine” (Genesis 45:6); one during the days when the judges judged – “It was in the days when the judges judged, there was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1); one during the days of Elijah, as it is stated: “As the Lord God of Israel [lives…there will not be dew or rain these years, except by my word]” (I Kings 17:1); one during the days of David – “there was a famine during the days of David” (II Samuel 21:1); one during the days of Elisha – “there was a great famine in Samaria” (II Kings 6:25); and one that is progressing and coming to the world and one in the future, as it is stated: “I will send famine in the land, not famine for bread, not thirst for water…” (Amos 8:11).  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The primary brunt of them was during the days of David, but it would have been appropriate for them to have been during the days of Saul, but because Saul was an offshoot of a sycamore tree (The sycamore tree is frail.)  the Holy One blessed be He transferred it and brought it during the days of David. Shila sinned and Yoḥana is punished? (The phrase means how can one person sin and another be punished.)  Rabbi Ḥiyya Rabba said: This is analogous to a glazier who had a basket filled with cut, ornate glassware. When he sought to hang his basket, he would bring a peg, implant it into the wall, and then hang his basket. Therefore, all of them did not befall lowly people, (Major catastrophes did not befall people who would not be able to withstand them. They befell mighty people, who could withstand them.)  but rather, mighty people. Rabbi Berekhya would read in their regard: (Regarding David’s generation.)  “He gives strength to the weary” (Isaiah 40:29).  Rabbi Ḥelbo said: Two [famines] came during the days of Abraham. Rabbi Aḥa said: One during the days of Abraham and one during the days of Lemekh.  The famine that came during the days of Elijah was a famine of drought; one year it produced and one year it did not produce. (There was a small amount of rain, and there was some produce (See Mishna Avot 5:8).)  The famine that came during the days of Elisha was one of panic – “until the head of a donkey was sold for eighty silver pieces” (II Kings 6:25). The famine that was during the days that the judges judged – Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: Forty-one se’a were sold for the price of forty-two se’a. But was it not taught: A person may not leave the Land of Israel unless two se’a of wheat go for one sela. Rabbi Shimon said: When? It is at a time that one cannot find any to acquire, but if he can find any to acquire, even if it is one se’a for a sela, he may not leave the Land of Israel. Because Elimelekh left the Land of Israel, he was punished that he and his sons died.</p>

              <p>“There was a famine in the land.” Ten famines came to the world. One during the days of Adam; one during the days of Lemekh; one during the days of Abraham; one during the days of Isaac; one during the days of Jacob; one during the days of Elijah; one during the days of Elisha; one during the days of David; one during the days when the judges judged; and one that is yet progressing and coming to the world. One during the days of Adam, as it is stated: “Accursed is the ground because of you” (Genesis 3:17); one during the days of Lemekh, as it is stated: “From the ground that the Lord had cursed” (Genesis 5:29); one during the days of Abraham, as it is stated: “There was famine in the land and Abram descended to Egypt” (Genesis 12:10); one during the days of Isaac: “There was a famine in the land, beside the first famine” (Genesis 26:1); one during the days of Jacob, as it is stated: “For these two years there has been famine in the land” (Genesis 45:6); one during the days of Elijah, as it is stated: “There will not be dew or rain these years, except by my word” (I Kings 17:1); one during the days of Elisha, as it is stated: “There was a great famine in Samaria” (II Kings 6:25); one during the days of David, as it is stated: “There was a famine during the days of David, three years” (II Samuel 21:1); one during the days when the judges judged, as it is stated: “There was a famine in the land” (Ruth 1:1); and one that is advancing upon the world, as it is written: “I will send famine in the land, not famine for bread, not thirst for water” (Amos 8:11). Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: It would have been appropriate for the main manifestation of them (The years of famine during the days of David.)  to have been during the days of Saul, and it was not appropriate for them to have been during the days of David. [But] because Saul was an offshoot of a sycamore tree, (The sycamore tree is frail.)  and would have been unable to withstand it, the Holy One blessed be He transferred it and brought it to David, who is the offshoot of an olive tree (The olive tree is sturdy.)  and [he] was able to withstand it. A parable says: Shila sinned and Yoḥana (Generic names of that period.)  pays for it? So, all of them did not come upon lowly people, but rather upon mighty people who could withstand them. Rabbi Ḥiyya in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar: [It is analogous] to a glazier who had a basket filled with cups of cut glass. When he sought to hang his basket, he would bring a peg, hammer it [into the wall,] and then hang his basket. So, all of them did not come upon lowly people, but rather to mighty people. Rabbi Berekhya would read in reference to them: (David’s generation.)  “He gives strength to the weary” (Isaiah 40:29). Rabbi Berekhya in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: Two [famines] (That of Lemekh occurred while Adam was still alive.)  came during the days of Adam. (In the parallel text of this midrash found in Bereishit Rabba 25:3 it says ‘Abraham’ instead of ‘Adam.’)  Rav Huna in the name of Rav Aḥa: One was during the days of Abraham, and one was during the days of Lemekh. The famine that was during the days of Elijah was due to a drought. One year it produced [a harvest] and the other year it did not produce. But the famine during the days of Elisha was due to [economic] panic, as it is stated: “Until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty of silver” (II Kings 6:25). [Regarding] the famine that came during the days that the judges judged, Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Dosa: They were forty-two se’a (A measure of dry volume roughly equivalent to 8 liters.)  and they became forty-one se’a. (The reference is to the amount of produce that could be purchased for one sela. Some commentators suggest that the text should be read: they were [sold] at a rate of two se’a [per sela] and became one se’a [per sela]. See Etz Yosef.)  But is it not taught: A person may not depart to outside the Land of Israel until two se’a (Of wheat.)  are bought for a shekel? (The reference is to the biblical shekel, which is the equivalent of the rabbinic sela.)  Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: When is that so? It is when one cannot find anything [else] to buy. But if he can find [other food] to buy, even [at] one se’a for a shekel, a Jew may not leave the Land of Israel. (Elimelekh was punished because his decision to leave the Land of Israel was not justified.)  But is it not taught: During a time of pestilence, a time of war, gather everyone inside, but during a time of famine, scatter? Why was Elimelekh punished? It is because he sank the hearts of Israel. [It is analogous] to a prominent person who lived in a province, and the residents of the province would depend upon him, and would say that if drought years would come, he could provide food for the province for ten years. When a drought year came, his maidservant went out, and went into the market with her basket in her hand. The residents of the province said: This is the one who we relied upon, that if there would be a drought he could support us for ten years? His maidservant is standing in the market with her basket in her hand! So, Elimelekh was one of the prominent residents of the province, and one of the leaders of the generation. When the years of famine arrived, he said: ‘Now, all Israel will come around to my door, this one with his basket and that one with his basket.’ He arose and fled from them; that is what is written: “A man of Bethlehem of Judah went.”</p>

Similarly, Jacob's family also went to Egypt during a famine and were separated from their wives, experiencing oppression until they were eventually liberated after the Egyptians were afflicted with plagues. This pattern of events was foretold by G–d to Abraham, indicating that the experiences of the patriarchs foreshadowed those of their descendants.

              <p>On the verse &quot;There was famine in the land&quot; (12,10), Nachmanides writes as follows: Abraham descended to Egypt on account of the famine, in order to spend some time there to keep alive during the drought, and the Egyptians oppressed him by robbing him of his wife. G–d took revenge on them by striking them with great afflictions and G–d led Abraham out from there with livestock, silver and gold. Pharaoh even ordered his men to make sure that Abraham would depart. Abraham's experience was repeated when Jacob and family descended to Egypt to escape the famine in Canaan, when they were eventually oppressed and the Egyptians separated them from their wives. The Israelites were eventually liberated but only after the Egyptians had been smitten with many plagues. Everything that their patriarch Abraham experienced, his descendants experienced on a national scale. The whole matter is explained by Rabbi Pinchas in the name of Rabbi Oshiyah in Bereshit Rabbah 40,6 who has G–d tell Abraham that he should pave the way for his descendants, and that as a result you find that Abraham's experiences foreshadowed those of his descendants. Example: Abraham experienced famine and moved to Egypt; Joseph told his father Israel that there would be five more years of famine (Genesis 45,6).</p>

              <p>בטרם תבוא שנת הרעב, “before the year of famine arrived.” The Talmud in tractate Taanit folio 11 teaches that from this verse we learn that during a famine man and his wife are not to cohabit [so as not to add more hungry mouths at that time. Ed.] In light of this it is difficult to understand how Levi could have sired Yocheved during those years as we have been told that she was born when her mother entered Egypt on her way there with Yaakov’s family. (Compare Genesis 45,6) Rabbi Yehudah hachassid, opined that the prohibition of cohabiting with one’s wife during periods of famine is valid only for a prophet who has been told by G–d directly that there was going to be such a famine. Joseph was such a prophet who had been inspired by G–d to advise Pharaoh of future events. Levi who did not have any direct knowledge concerning the origin of this famine, and who had caused it, was therefore not obliged to abstain from the commandment to be fruitful and to multiply. According to a different interpretation, the brothers Levi and Joseph took different sides in an argument aired in the Talmud, tractate Yevamot folio 61 concerning that if the commandment to be fruitful has already been fulfilled if one has fathered two sons. A second opinion holds that until one has sired both a son and a daughter, one cannot claim to have fulfilled the commandment. Since Levi at this time had not yet sired a daughter, he had felt entitled to maintain normal family relations with his wife. Joseph had already sired two sons, and he held that thereby he had fulfilled the commandment.</p>

              <p>ויהי רעב בארץ וירד אברם, “there was a famine in the land and Avram descended, etc.” Our sages (Tanchuma Lech Lecha 9) told us that what happened to the patriarchs and is reported in the Torah serves as a preview of what would happen to their descendants in the future. Everything which happened in this passage foreshadowed what happened to the Israelites in Egypt during their exile hundreds of years later. The Egyptians took Avram’s wife from him and G-d punished them with great plagues and He allowed Avram to leave the land of Egypt with both livestock and silver and gold in great quantities. Pharaoh even ordered a guard of honour to accompany Avram out of his country. History repeated itself during the exile and subsequent Exodus of the Jewish people. This is what we read in Bereshit Rabbah 40,8 “whatever happened to Avraham happened to the Israelites. In connection with Avram, the Torah says: ‘there was a famine in the land, whereas we find in Genesis 45,6 that Joseph speaks to his brothers about two years of famine which had already passed at that time. We read in connection with Avram: “the woman was taken to the house of Pharaoh,” whereas in connection with the Israelites in Egypt the decree to kill the male babies meant that the women were taken as slaves by the Egyptians (practical meaning of Exodus 1,22 ‘let every daughter live.’) In connection with Avram we read (12,17) “G-d brought great plagues on the house of Pharaoh and his servants on account of Sarai, Avram’s wife.” In connection with the Israelites in Egypt the Torah writes: “I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh (Exodus 11,1). We read in connection with Avram that he was called in to Pharaoh (12,18-19) and told “take your wife and leave!” In connection with the Israelites, (Exodus 12,31) Moses and Aaron were called in to Pharaoh and told to leave the country with all their belongings. There are several more quotations in that Midrash showing the similarity of what Avram and the Israelites experienced in Egypt.</p>

              <p>You will find that the number seven appears three times each in connection with both the cows and the ears of corn. Once it appears in the Torah’s report of Pharaoh’s dream, once in the dream as related by Pharaoh, and the third time when Joseph refers to this number when he interprets the dream. When you multiply the number 14 (seven cows plus seven ears of corn) you get the number 14. When you multiply this number by three you get 42, [an allusion to the numerical value of one of the names of G’d, the first 42 letters in the Book of Genesis until the letter ב in ובוהו — Ed.] None of the numbers “seven” mentioned in our passage went to waste, every one of them became historically relevant as pointed out by Ezekiel 29, 10-11: “Assuredly I will deal with you and your channels, and I will reduce the land of Egypt to utter ruin and desolation; from Migdol to Syene all the way to the border with Nubia. No foot of man shall traverse it; it shall remain uninhabited for forty years.” The first two of these forty years occurred during the time of Joseph before Yaakov came to Egypt. The remaining forty years of the prophecy Pharaoh dreamt occurred later on in Egyptian history.</p>

              <p>ויהי מקץ שנתים ימים פרעה חולם והנה עומד על היאור, “It was at the end of two years and Pharaoh was dreaming that he was standing above the river (Nile).” The words שנתים ימים mean two years (not two days). These years were counted from the time Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh’s two courtiers who were imprisoned with him. On this occasion Pharaoh had a dream. Our sages said that Joseph’s stay in jail had been extended as we mentioned in our commentary on 39,5. This was due to the two words והזכרתני והוצאתני which Joseph permitted himself to say to the Chief of the butlers. We pointed out that these words did not mean that he did not trust in G’d but that he wanted to exploit his relationship to the Chief of the butlers to make him the instrument of G’d for his freedom.  Seeing that the Torah speaks of שנתים, “two years,” what was the need to add the words ימים, “days?” When the Torah wanted to tell us that there had been two years of famine it wrote כי זה שנתים הרעב, “for these last two years which have been famine,” (Genesis 45,6), it did not bother to add the words ימים. The point the Torah wanted us to know here by adding the word ימים is that it was precisely two years to the day after Joseph had interpreted the dreams in jail that Pharaoh dreamt his dream of the cows and the ears of corn.</p>

              <p>AND THERE WAS A FAMINE IN THE LAND. Now Abraham went down to Egypt on account of the famine to dwell there in order to keep himself alive in the days of the drought, but the Egyptians oppressed him for no reason [and attempted] to take his wife. The Holy One, blessed be He, avenged their cause with great plagues, and brought him forth from there with cattle, with silver, and with gold, (Genesis 13:2.)  and Pharaoh even commanded his men to escort them from the land. (Verse 20 here.)  He thereby alluded to Abraham that his children would go down to Egypt on account of the famine to dwell there in the land, and the Egyptians would do them evil and take the women (Shemoth Rabbah 1:22. See also following note.)  from them, just as Pharaoh said, And every daughter ye shall save alive, (Exodus 1:22. They were to be saved alive for unchaste purposes.)  but the Holy One, blessed be He, would avenge their cause with great plagues until He would bring them forth with silver and gold, sheep and oxen, very rich in cattle, with the Egyptians pressuring to send them out of the land. (Ibid., 12:33.)  Nothing was lacking in all the events that happened to the patriarch that would not occur to the children. The Rabbis have explained this subject in Bereshith Rabbah: (40:8.)  “Rabbi Pinchas said in the name of Rabbi Oshaya that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Abraham, ‘Go forth and tread out a path for your children!’ Thus you find that whatever is written concerning Abraham is also written concerning his children. In connection with Abraham it is written, And there was a famine in the land; in connection with Israel, it is written For these two years hath the famine been in the land.” (Genesis 45:6.)  Know that Abraham our father unintentionally committed a great sin by bringing his righteous wife to a stumbling-block of sin on account of his fear for his life. He should have trusted that G-d would save him and his wife and all his belongings for G-d surely has the power to help and to save. His leaving the Land, concerning which he had been commanded from the beginning, on account of the famine, was also a sin he committed, for in famine G-d would redeem him from death. (See Job 5:20.)  It was because of this deed that the exile in the land of Egypt at the hand of Pharaoh was decreed for his children. (See my Hebrew commentary, pp. 79-80, for sources and differing opinions on the view of Ramban expressed in this paragraph.)  In the place of justice, there is wickedness (See Ecclesiastes 3:16.)  and sin.</p>

              <p>AND BEHOLD, THERE CAME UP OUT OF THE RIVER. Since the land of Egypt is irrigated by the river, and it is from the river that abundance or famine befalls them, the king saw the cows coming up out of the river. The cows symbolize plowing, and the ears of corn symbolize the harvest, just as Joseph said, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest. (Genesis 45:6. Thus it is obvious that Joseph understood the characters in the dreams — i.e. the cows and the ears of corn — as symbolizing plowing and harvesting.)  He saw that the river rose only slightly and there would thus be no plowing, and the little which will be planted in moist places, a wind blowing from the east, a wind from the Eternal (Hosea 13:15.)  would burn them, even as he saw the ears of corn parched with the east wind. (Verse 6 here.)  It would appear to be implied in the verses that the abundance was only in the land of Egypt, even as it said, Seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt; (Verse 29 here.)  likewise the verse, And he stored up all the food of the seven years which was in the land of Egypt. (Verse 48 here.)  But the famine, on the other hand, was in all the lands. And so did Joseph interpret it when he said, And there shall arise after them seven years of famine, (Verse 30 here.)  and did not mention the land of Egypt. It was for this reason that in the other countries they were unable to store up food even if they had heard about it, as they undoubtedly did, for the matter was well known throughout their lands. Perhaps this was alluded to in the dream since with respect to the fat cows, it mentions, And they fed in the reed-grass, for it was there in Egypt that they fed and stood, but the lean ones, after they consumed the fat ones, walked to and fro through the earth, (Zechariah 6:7.)  and Pharaoh did not know where they had gone.</p>

Now although Joseph had said, And there are yet five years when there will be no plowing and sowing, (Above, 45:6.)  as soon as Jacob came to Egypt a blessing came with his arrival, and they began to sow and the famine came to an end. And thus we read in the Tosephta of Tractate Sotah. (10:9. Tosephta means “addition.” This is a collection of Tannaitic teachings compiled by Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshayah soon after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi.)  Thus the language of Rashi. And it is similarly mentioned in Bereshith Rabbah: (89:11.)  “Rabbi Yosei the son of Rabbi Chanina said that the famine lasted for two years, for when our father Jacob went down to Egypt the famine ceased. When did it return? In the days of Ezekiel, etc.” But if so, then Joseph’s words regarding his interpretation of [Pharaoh’s dream which predicted the seven years of famine] were not fulfilled, and would thus cause people to doubt his wisdom! Perhaps we shall say that the famine continued in the land of Canaan as Joseph had said, but in Egypt our father Jacob went down to the river in the presence of Pharaoh and all of Egypt, whereupon all his people saw that the waters in the Nile rose as he approached it, and thus they knew that G-d’s blessing was due to the prophet’s arrival. In that case, the verse stating, And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to the want of their little children, (Verse 12 here.)  applies to the remainder of the seven years and for as long as his father lived, (According to the Tur’s version of Ramban, this passage reads: “applies to the years of plenty of his father’s entire lifespan.”)  for even after his father’s death, Joseph said, I will sustain you and your little ones. (Further, 50:21.)  Yet, with all this, I wonder: for if so, then Pharaoh’s dream was not true since it only revealed the decree to him but not what would ultimately become of those seven years! Now I have seen there in the Tosephta of Tractate Sotah: (10:9. Tosephta means “addition.” This is a collection of Tannaitic teachings compiled by Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshayah soon after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi.)  “Rabbi Yosei said that as soon as our father Jacob died, the famine reverted to its former condition, etc.” We have further been taught in the Sifre: (Sifre Eikev, 38.)  “And Jacob blessed Pharaoh. (Verse 10 here.)  How did he bless him? [His blessing was] that the years of famine should cease. Nevertheless they were completed after Jacob’s death, as it is said, Now therefore fear ye not; I will sustain you. (Further, 50:21.)  Now just as ‘sustaining’ mentioned above (Above, 45:11. And there I will sustain thee, for there are yet five years of famine.)  by Scripture refers to years of famine, so also ‘sustaining’ mentioned here (Further, 50:21.)  refers to years of famine. Rabbi Shimon says, ‘It is not a sanctification of G-d’s Name for the words of the righteous to be effective as long as they live, and then to be removed after their death.’ Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Shimon said, ‘I accept the opinion of Rabbi Yosei rather than that of my father, for it is indeed a sanctification of G-d’s Name for there to be a blessing in the world for the period that the righteous are in the world, and for the blessing to remove from the world when they leave.’” Thus far the text of the Tosephta. Thus the remaining five years of the famine were completed. The opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra is that these two years, [recounted in Verses 14-20, during which the Egyptians gave their money and cattle to Joseph in exchange for food], occurred after Jacob had come to Egypt, [and since there were two years of famine before he came to Egypt, this accounts for four of the seven years of famine]. And Ibn Ezra wrote as follows: “We find in homiletic texts of the Rabbis that the famine was removed by the merit of Jacob. It is also possible that there were three more years of famine, but that they were not as severe as the first four years which had passed.” But Ibn Ezra’s words are not at all correct. The account of the dream and its interpretation make all seven years alike, and, had it been as he said, Scripture would have mentioned the different nature of these three last years. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan during a period of five years, and he brought it to Pharaoh, for how is it possible for the money and cattle to be exhausted in one year? Rather, the money sufficed them for the entire five years, as is the usual way of the world. (In a time of famine, people conserve money and make it last for a long period of time.)  Now since nothing was initiated, and no change of any kind occurred during all these years, Scripture relates nothing about them except, And Joseph gathered up all the money, etc. (Verse 14 here.)  When the money was exhausted, Scripture relates that they came to Joseph — this was in the sixth year of the famine — and he gave them bread in exchange for their cattle. He fed them with bread only to the extent of sustaining them, but not to satiety. And when that year was ended, (Verse 18 here.)  in which he had vowed to them that he would feed them with bread in exchange for their cattle—which was the sixth year—they came unto him the second year, [i.e., the year following the sixth year of famine being discussed], and they told him that he should purchase them and their land for the bread which he will feed them during that seventh year, and since the land will then belong to Pharaoh, he should give them seed so that the land will not be desolate, for they knew that when the seven years of famine will be completed, they will have planting and reaping. The verse stating, And Joseph sustained his father…with bread, according to the want of their little ones, (Verse 12 here.)  thus means that he furnished them with bread sufficient for their needs during the famine, as the expression, according to the want of their little ones, indicates.</p>

This indicates that Jacob should have then been at least a hundred and seven years old when Joseph was thirty. Add the seven years of plenty and the two of famine, and this would then indicate that Jacob should have been a hundred and sixteen years old when he arrived in Egypt in the second year of the famine.</p>

            <summary>The commentary on the story of Joseph and his brothers raises several questions regarding their actions and motivations, including why they treated Joseph poorly despite being superior individuals, why they did not kill him outright, and why they were seemingly rewarded for their misdeeds.

                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 28:1:17</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Some problems in the text of our story: 1) Since the brothers were all superior people who would neither ruin their father's old age nor heap guilt upon themselves, why did they treat Joseph as they did? This is especially puzzling since we know from Gittin 52, that dreams as a way of foretelling future events may be discounted, disregarded even? 2) Since the brothers appear to have feared that Joseph would rule over them, why did they reverse their intention and allowed Joseph to live? Surely this kept the chance of his dreams coming true alive? 3) Why did the brothers have to resort to subterfuge to get rid of Joseph? Why did they not simply kill him and bury him? Why did they so readily consent to changes in plan, such as Reuben's suggestion to throw him into the pit, and Yehudah's suggestion to sell him to the caravan of Midianites? From their entire behavior, it seems they wanted to avoid bloodshed and were only afraid of what Joseph could do to them if he remained alive and free at the same time. 4) Why did the Torah not report explicitly how the brothers were punished for their treatment of Joseph? In fact, it appears that they had heavenly assistance in carrying out their plan (Bereshit Rabbah 84). They appear to have been beneficiaries of their misdeed, getting the V.I.P. treatment in Egypt during the famine in later years, ensuring their own and their families' survival and well being. We seem to find here a classic case of the chote veniskar, the sinner who is rewarded for his sin. All these arguments lead one to believe that their actions might have been involuntary, pre-ordained and therefore not culpable, if we had not already explained previously that this was not the case. 5) If Joseph's reports to his father about his brothers' wrongdoing had been factual, he should have received a reward for alerting his father to actions which their father would not have been able to correct unless someone had told him about them. Why was he punished for this? If, on the other hand, his reports were not factual, the Torah should have written, &quot;He made up evil reports,&quot; not &quot;He brought home evil reports&quot; (37,2)! 6) Hatred by the brothers is mentioned three times. We hear the word &quot;jealousy&quot; only in connection with the second dream, when there is no mention of the word &quot;hatred.&quot; Why is this? Why are the words &quot;to rule&quot; and &quot;to reign&quot; used separately? What is the difference between them? 7) What prompted Jacob to send out Joseph to check on the welfare of the brothers on this of all days? Why did Joseph get lost? Why did the man whom he encountered tell Joseph about his brothers' plans to relocate? 8) Why did the brothers select a wild beast as their alibi instead of claiming that robbers had killed Joseph and that they had buried his remains? Why did Jacob not send a search party to find Joesph's bones to bury what was left? 9) What had been in Reuben's mind when he said &quot;Do not shed blood?&quot; His plan too would have resulted in Joseph's blood being spilled. Why did he say in his brothers' presence, &quot;What will happen to me since the lad is gone!&quot; Surely, this statement revealed to the brothers that he had intended to rescue Joseph? What is Rashi trying to say when he writes, &quot;The holy spirit spoke here?&quot; Even Yehudah's advice allowed for the chance of Joseph surviving and ultimately revenging himself. Why the confusing statements about the Midianites and the Ishmaelites? 10) Why did Jacob refuse to be comforted (see Moed Katan 27, that one must not grieve for the dead excessively)? The statement should have read, &quot;Jacob was unable to accept comfort.&quot; 11) Why is the sequence of the story interrupted by the affairs of Yehudah and Tamar? Why does the Torah have to tell us the name of Yehudah's first father-in -law? What do the names of his three sons denote, and why are we interested in reading about Yehudah's whereabouts at the time Sheylah was born? 12) Since Yehudah's two older sons seem to have died for sins that gentiles are not culpable for, namely the deliberate wasting of semen, how could they have been guilty of the death penalty not even having been aware that there was a prohibition? What did Onan mean by saying that the issue would not be his? 13) Why did Yehudah delay marrying off Sheylah seeing that the reason he gave, &quot;Maybe he will die too,” would apply for the remainder of his entire life? 14) How did Tamar know that Yehudah would want relations with her even if he did encounter her at a place where harlots customarily stationed themselves? Having encountered him, why did she set such a high price on her favors that she endangered her whole plan? Why did she become pregnant with twins? Why does the Torah give such a detailed report about the strange behavior of the infants during their birth? 15) What do our sages in Sotah 7 mean when they heap praise on Yehudah for his honesty in saying, &quot;She is more righteous than I&quot; i.e. that he publicly confessed without considering that by doing so he degraded himself in public? Either a harlot had been permitted for a man to lie with before the Torah had been given, or he could have married her as a partner in a levirate marriage. In either case, what was the great admission he made? How did he expose himself to public disgrace by admitting to conduct which was perfectly legal? If on the other hand, Tamar was legally as out of bounds to him at that time as she would be after the Torah legislation had been revealed to the Jewish people, he had committed a shameful act by living knowingly with a harlot, or he had engaged unknowingly in a forbidden incestuous relationship with his daughter-in-law, and a continuation of such relations was certainly out of the question? Besides, who had appointed Yehudah both judge and jury in the case of his daughter-in-law, that he had the right to execute her? Since when does a judge preside over a case in which he has a personal interest? 16) It is strange that Potiphar's wife should make a public issue of her involvement with Joseph, a revelation which would reflect discredit upon her regardless of the appearance of her having been wronged. She could have waited for Joseph to weaken at a later date. Why did Joseph leave his clothing behind when he ran out of the house? </p>

            <summary>The Midrash BeChiddush on Pesach Haggadah emphasizes the importance of telling the story of the Exodus from Egypt as a commandment to contemplate God's wonders and power, as well as to remember the covenant with Abraham and the suffering of the Israelites in Egypt. Pharaoh's stubbornness in refusing to free the Israelites is explained through his miscalculation of the four hundred years of slavery, leading to God's intervention due to the outcry of the people. Remembering the Exodus is seen as a way to arouse God's supernal power and compassion, with the Zohar stating that those who rejoice in the story will also rejoice in the Shechinah in the world to come.</summary>

                <h4>Midrash BeChiddush on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, We Were Slaves in Egypt 2:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(V’afilu) “Even if we are wise ... .it is a commandment to tell the story of the Exodus from Egypt:” For this story is not like the stories of Roman wars or other wars which took place around the world. It is forbidden to incline one’s ear to listen to them since they are vain matters. It is a commandment to speak of the war which God waged against Egypt so that it will remain in one’s consciousness as a matter to contemplate.  When one thinks about the Exodus, one wonders, how is it possible that Pharaoh was so lacking in common sense that he rebelled against God and was so stubborn in his denial of God so many times? And how could God forgo His honor, sending Pharaoh the message, “Let My people go,” when he could have told Moses, “Gather the Jews who are in Egypt and take them out?” And if a person wished to show God’s power, there are many ways that he could have done so! Similar to these questions, a person could derive from these supernal matters and discussions that there are many new ideas to be derived. Also, one would see how Pharaoh in his wisdom could do these things as we shall explain, with the help of God. Pharoah should have concluded that God is faithful to His covenant and keeps His word. Pharaoh’s error was that he thought, ‘God already said to Abraham, “They shall be enslaved and afflicted for four hundred years.” (He reasoned),’ It is impossible that they already began (this count) from the Covenant of the Pieces (According to the Torah, the Covenant of the Pieces or Covenant Between the Parts in Genesis, Chapter 15 was an event in which God revealed himself to Abraham and made a covenant with him. God announced to Abraham that his descendants would be enslaved in Egypt but would eventually inherit the Land of Israel.)   for thirty years would pass before the birth of Isaac. (If I understand this correctly, the Brit bein habetarim, the Covenant of the Pieces was made thirty years before the birth of Isaac. Some people count the four hundred years from Isaac’s birth. However the Covenant predicts that the people would be enslaved and afflicted by another people for four hundred years - so the count could not be until the Israelites went down to Egypt with Jacob. That would mean that they were only in Egypt 215 years. Pharaoh erred in thinking that they had not completed the full four hundred years and so he was not obligated to free them.)  The Covenant of the Pieces also had to refer to a time when they were enslaved and afflicted. Therefore, Pharaoh didn’t believe Moses and stubbornly refused to free Israel. Pharaoh said: ‘Joseph said to his brothers, “God sent me before you…” (Genesis 45:7 God has sent me ahead of you to ensure your survival on earth, and to save your lives in an extraordinary deliverance.)  Your God sent you to be enslaved by me, and now you are coming to me and saying in the name of your God that I should send you forth? You haven’t completed the four hundred years of slavery, yet!’  (U’b’emet) Actually Pharaoh was correct (in his calculations) but the outcry of the people of Israel caused God to subvert the original judgment. There are other reasons which we shall mention. That is why we are obligated to tell the story of the Exodus. Even if one offers nothing new in telling the story, this should not prevent one from doing so because whenever one mentions God’s wonders it arouses God’s supernal power above and renews goodness. This is the implication of the expression, kol hamarbeh lisaper, instead of saying kol hamoseef, or kol hamisaper bitziyat mitzrayim,  (Kol hamarbeh lisaper - one who speaks at length, as opposed to kol hamoseef, - one who adds, or, kol hamisaper bitziyat mitzrayim - one who tells the story of the Exodus from Egypt.)  implying that even if his words seem excessive and repetitive, it should not prevent him from this effort. This is what the sages state in Midrash Tehilim (Tilin), Ps. 70 say: “(For the leader. Of David, Lehazkir. Hasten O Lord to save me!” (See Psalm 70:1-2 The meaning of the word Lihazkir in this context is not clear. In the 1917 JPS translation “To make a memorial. The parenthesis at the beginning of this quote does not appear in Rabbi Foa’s quotation but it does appear in the Midrash.) ) That which is stated in Scripture, “For though I sowed them among the nations, (in distant places they shall remember me)...” (Note that he quotes the verse from Zechariah incorrectly)  that is, as a reward for remembering me, I shall remember them. And for every time you remember me, my heart yearns for you, as is stated in Scripture, “That is why My heart yearns for him.” (Jer. 31:20) He appointed Levites to minister before the Ark of Adonai, to invoke (to remember), to praise…” (I Chr. 16:4) What did they remember? It is a remembrance of the wonders that God performed for them at all times. God only redeemed me to save me so that I could recall His wonders. David said, ‘If so “I remember him, as it states, “For the leader Of David, lehazkir.’” Thus, they decreed remembering the Exodus each day; possibly God will have mercy on us and redeem us.” (Zech. 10:9) (See Midrash Tehillim Psalm 70 which Foa quotes at length - however it appears that his version of the text is incorrect - I have based the translation on the original version of the text in MT. למנצח לדוד להזכיר. אלקים להצילני. זה שאמר הכתוב (זכריה י ט) ואזרעם בעמים. ובשכר שמזכירים אותי בכל פעם אני מזכיר אותם בכל זמן שאתם מזכירים אותי מעי הומים עליכם שנאמר (ירמיה לא יט) הבן יקיר לי אפרים וגו' המו מעי לו. (דברי הימים-א טז ד) ויתן לפני ארון ברית ה' וגו' להזכיר ולהודות. ומה היו מזכירין (שם יב) זכרו נפלאותיו אשר עשה זכרו נפלאותיו שעשה עמכם בכל עת ולא גאל את ישראל ועשה עמהם אלא בשביל שיהיו מזכירים נפלאותיו. אמר דוד אם כן אני מזכירו למנצח לדוד להזכיר אלקים להצילני.)  This is especially true during this season. We arouse God’s compassion since, “In Nissan Israel was redeemed and in Nissan they will be redeemed. By adding to the memories of wonders it is as if we are adding to the power of God’s might (koah gevurotav) above. Thus, it is written in the Zohar, Parshat Bo, “Thus we have established: a people who speaks about the Exodus from Egypt, and rejoices in that story - in the future they will rejoice in the Shechinah in the world to come, which is the greatest joy of all. For they are like a person who rejoices in his/her Master, and the Holy One of Blessing rejoices in this story. At that time [when the story of the Exodus is told], the Holy One gathers together all of the heavenly hosts and says to them: &quot;Go and listen to the telling of My praises, for right now my children are speaking and rejoicing in My salvation.&quot; Immediately, they all gather and unite themselves with the people of Israel, and listen to their story of praise. For when [Israel] rejoices in the joy of their Master's salvation, the [heavenly hosts] give thanks to the Holy One of blessing for all of these miracles and feats, and they give thanks to God for the holy nation that God has on the earth who rejoice in the joy of their Master's salvation. At that time, strength and power are increased on high; and in their telling of the story, Israel grants strength to their Master.``  ( Zohar Volume 2, Parshat Bo 42b Translation taken from Sefaria) </p>

        <summary>Joseph's rise to power in Egypt was orchestrated by God as part of a larger divine plan, leading him to forgive his brothers and understand their actions as part of God's design. The text explores the consequences of man's freewill being ascribed to God, Jacob's blessings and burial request, Joseph's objections to blessing placement, and the impact of Joseph's rebuke on his brothers. The Midrash emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and divine retribution, drawing parallels between Joseph's actions and those of his descendants. Joseph reassures his brothers that his presence in Egypt was God's will to save lives during a famine, highlighting his role as a connector between generations. In Isaiah 22:15, God instructs the prophet to confront Shebna, the steward in charge of the palace. The Targum also emphasizes that Joseph's leadership in Egypt was part of God's plan, not his brothers'.</summary>

              <p>ועתה, לא אתם שלחתם אותי הנה, &quot;Now, you did not send me here, etc.&quot; Joseph explained why he told the brothers not to worry that he still hated them for what they had done to him and how cruelly they had treated him. He implied that it was true that at the time he certainly had not understood why they could have harboured so much resentment against him; he had had reason to hate them for that; ועתה, now, things had become clear.</p>

              <p>Perhaps this consideration enabled the brothers to face their father who would now have to become aware that it was the brothers who had caused him to mourn the loss of Joseph all these years. In view of the outcome, the brothers did not even need to feel shame when they faced their father. It is quite unlikely that once Jacob had become aware that Joseph was the ruler in Egypt that he should not have made every effort to find out how Joseph came to be in Egypt and what happened to cause his striped coat to become blood-drenched at the time. The only argument that would reconcile Jacob and his sons with what had happened was that it had become evident that G'd's plan had been executed step by step. There was no point in second-guessing why and how G'd had brought all this about. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 86,1 have already said that Jacob had originally been meant to descend to Egypt in chains, but that the sale of Joseph enabled him to arrive in Egypt in style, i.e. riding in Pharaoh's chariot.</p>

                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 32:1:12</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(1) The seventeen years in Egypt were also part of the years under the special Providence of G-d; although Joseph did provide for his father, he did so as an instrument of G-d’s Providence, as he had said himself, &quot;Not you have sent me here, but G-d.&quot; The line, &quot;Who has been my shepherd until this day,&quot; refers to G-d’s Providence during those last seventeen years. The word hazeh, this, equals seventeen in numerical value. (2) &quot;Do not bury me in Egypt!&quot; Since we have pointed out earlier that during one's lifetime an ever increasing bond is forged between body and soul, and that this bond is not completely dissolved at death, but takes twelve months until it is completely severed, Jacob did not want the remains of his soul to be connected with Egypt for any part of this period. Compare Shabbat 152, &quot;The soul ascends and descends during the twelve months after the body ceases to function.&quot; The importance of the place of burial and how it facilitates the ascent of the acquired spiritual qualities of man, has been discussed in Chapter twenty-two. Jacob did not even want to be interred in Egypt temporarily, being afraid that re-interment would be postponed indefinitely; therefore, he said, &quot;As soon as I die, I want to lie with my fathers; carry me out of Egypt and bury me in my father's grave.&quot; By replying, &quot;I will do as you say,&quot; Joseph implied that his father's wish was more compelling than any oath. Jacob insisted on an oath however, to enable Joseph to tell Pharaoh that he had sworn an oath, should the latter make any difficulties. The fact that Joseph had to tell Pharaoh, &quot;My father has made me swear an oath&quot; shows that Jacob's fears were well founded. When Jacob recalled the vision he had had at Looz, he tells Joseph that he had learned two things on that occasion. Firstly, that there is a connection between the blessing and residence in the land of Israel. Secondly, that at least part of that blessing applied to him personally, not only to his future issue (vayevarech oti, He blessed me). Therefore, the promise of possession of the land applied only to the future. For this reason, Jacob starts once more &quot;He said to me&quot; as a separate communication from G-d (48,34). Jacob realized that the meaning of the second part of the blessing was that just as his children would remain &quot;alive,&quot; so would he remain &quot;alive,&quot; which is part of the meaning of our sages' statement that &quot;Jacob did not die.&quot; (4) On that occasion, at Bet El, we find that G-d blessed Jacob by saying, &quot;Nation and community of nations will stem from you&quot; (35,9-13). Apparently, this referred to children as yet unborn. Since only Benjamin had not been born yet at that time, Jacob was entitled to apply the second part of that blessing to himself having been promised more children. Joseph's two sons therefore could rightfully be considered as belonging to Jacob. Although they had been born in Egypt, the promise to Jacob had been made while he was in the land of Israel. Future events which dictated that the tribe of Levi would be separated into a separate unit with special functions, thus depriving the encampment of the children of Israel of one of their twelve armies, necessitated that Levi be replaced. Since Jacob allocated a double portion to the firstborn in the inheritance, he thus appointed Menashe and Ephrayim to represent the share of Joseph. Jacob did not discuss future children of Joseph then, but the words &quot;And your offspring,&quot; refer to his grandchildren and his great grandchildren. We find the latter being counted as heads of tribal families in Numbers Chapter twenty-six. This shows that Menashe and Ephrayim, though belonging to a later generation, are given the same status as Reuben and Shimon. There cannot, therefore, be a question of non-fulfilment of a promise of future children for Joseph. (5) The fact that Rachel died almost immediately after Jacob had received that blessing, made it clear to him that this blessing could not have referred to his having any more children. The line, &quot;When I came from Padan Aram, Rachel died etc.,&quot; is introduced as justification for appointing Menashe and Ephrayim as sons in the forthcoming distribution of the land of Israel. (6) Jacob saw a number of people around his bedside, not recognizing them. The Torah reports that they were Joseph's sons, but Jacob had not realized this until told by Joseph &quot;these are my sons,” the ones born to him in Egypt, prior to Jacob's arrival. He had now brought them so that they could receive the blessing discussed previously. Jacob asked that they come closer so that perhaps he could recognize them despite his failing eyesight. The kissing and embracing substituted for his inability to see, just as in the case of his father Isaac, when Jacob had received the blessing (Genesis Chapter 27). Jacob expressed his satisfaction at having been granted not only reunion with his son Joseph, but at having seen his children also. When Joseph saw his father like this, in a happy frame of mind, he removed the children from his father's knees to position them so that they could receive the blessing in order of their seniority. (7) After Joseph had already heard his father give Ephrayim precedence when he compared his position to that of Reuben, although Ephrayim was the younger, Joseph, thinking his father had erred, placed Ephrayim on his right side. When, despite the way Joseph had positioned the children, Jacob crossed his hands, it became clear that Jacob could not have erred previously when he mentioned Ephrayim ahead of Menashe. The words of the Torah &quot;And he was the younger,&quot; in describing Ephrayim, are not to be understood as &quot;although he was the younger,&quot; but rather as &quot;because he was the younger.&quot; It is clear that G-d did not intend for Jacob's left hand to come to rest on the head of Ephrayim. Jacob was presumably inspired by the order in which G-d had blessed him at Looz &quot;be fruitful and multiply; the &quot;be fruiful&quot; came first. Since the name &quot;Ephrayim&quot; is derived from the same root as the word &quot;fruitful,&quot; Jacob took this as his cue. The fact that the right hand represents the more important activities and achievements is well known and already documented in Proverbs 3,16, &quot;Long life from its right, wealth and honor from its left.&quot; The word sikel seems the same as we find in connection with Achitofel (Samuel II 15,31), &quot;Please make foolish the advice of Achitofel.&quot; It does not seem to matter whether the word is spelled with the letter sin or samech. The Torah tells us that the fact that he crossed his hands indicated that Jacob himself had not known who the firstborn was. He blessed Joseph.&quot; Being blessed in the name of G-d is a three-stage process: 1) The wish for successful spiritual development. 2) The wish for the material blessings which enable one to devote oneself to one's spiritual progress. 3) Protection against negative influences that stand in the way of one's achieving one's spiritual objectives. (8) Concerning the first portion of the blessing, Jacob said, &quot;The G-d before whom my fathers have walked.&quot; Concerning the second portion of the blessing, he said, &quot;The G-d who has been my shepherd.&quot; Concerning the third portion of the blessing, he said, &quot;The angel who has acted as my redeemer etc.&quot; The line, &quot;May my name be proclaimed through them in the name of my fathers,&quot; is confirmation that Ephrayim and Menashe are going to be treated like the other tribes. (9+10) &quot;My name will attach to them.&quot; Joseph's objections were not based on begrudging Ephrayim the blessing; rather, he believed his father had erred in placing his right hand on Ephrayim, and that if so, the blessings might not be fulfilled since they had been given based on a mistaken premise. He felt that just as his father had remained unaware of what the brothers had done to him, so he might be unaware now as to which of the sons standing in front of him was the firstborn. Jacob's answer, stressing twice, &quot;I know, my son, I know,&quot; reassures Joseph on both counts, tells him that his father is well aware of what the brothers had done to him. He also tells him that he is aware that Menashe would become a tribe on account of his being the firstborn, however the younger one would achieve even greater status, though not at the expense of the older one. (3) Apparently, Joseph was mollified, and when Jacob said, &quot;With you Israel will bless,&quot; this indicates that Joseph joined in that blessing. Jacob's saying to Joseph, &quot;I will give you one Shechem additional to your brothers,&quot; refers to the city that had been conquered by Shimon and Levi. When the Almighty gives territory to Israel, no one can claim it as his own, since they have not conquered it. Shechem, however, had not been given, but had been conquered. It, therefore, became the property of the conqueror and his to dispose of as he saw fit, seeing it was not part of the land promised to the children of Israel as a whole, as a gift from G-d. When David mourned Saul, he mourned the fact that it had become necessary to fight against Israel's enemies militarily, i.e. &quot;to teach the sons of Yehudah the use of the bow&quot; (Samuel II 1,18). This need had first manifested itself when Israel had been attacked by Amalek, and Moses had to tell Joshua to go and select fighting men. When at the end of that episode, the victory is described as, &quot;He weakened Amalek by the sword;&quot; the reference is to all conquests based on merely military superiority. Human conquest, by definition, is &quot;weak,&quot; as compared to territory that is acquired by the direct intervention of Providence on our behalf. </p>

Bilam, the wise man of the idolaters, could not withstand the rebuke of his donkey. That is what is written: “Have I been in the habit of doing so to you? He said: No” (Numbers 22:30). Joseph was the youngest of the tribes and they were unable to withstand his rebuke. That is what it is written: “And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him.” When the Holy One blessed be He will come and rebuke each and every one according to his status, as it is stated: “I would reprove you and set it before your eyes” (Psalms 50:21), all the more so.   “Please approach me, and they approached” – he showed them the circumcision. “I am Joseph.”  “And now, it was not you that sent me here, but God. He made me into a father to Pharaoh, and into a lord for all his house, and ruler over the entire land of Egypt” (Genesis 45:8).  “And now it was not you that sent…He made me into a father to Pharaoh, [and into a lord [uladon] for all his house, and ruler [umoshel] over…]” – a patron to the king, “uladon” – a lord; umoshel – a ruler.   “Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him: So said your son Joseph: God has made me lord for all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry” (Genesis 45:9).  “Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him” – do not miss the opportunity.   “And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that is speaking to you” (Genesis 45:12).  “That it is my mouth that is speaking to you” – in the sacred tongue.</p>

This is a legal judgment derived from the full texts written in the Torah, which emerged from Jerusalem during the Sabbatical year and ascended to Rome, and the scrolls were stored in the synagogue of Asvyros. &quot;And God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good&quot; (Genesis 1:31). &quot;For a man and his wife, leather tunics&quot; (Genesis 3:21). &quot;I will descend now and see their outcry&quot; (Genesis 18:21). &quot;The Lord who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth&quot; (Genesis 24:7). &quot;And he sold his birthright&quot; (Genesis 25:33). &quot;Behold, now, I am old; I do not know the day of my death&quot; (Genesis 27:2). &quot;The fragrance of a field that the Lord has blessed&quot; (Genesis 27:27). &quot;And Oholibamah bore Jeush&quot; (Genesis 36:5). &quot;Eliphaz, the son of Esau&quot; (Genesis 36:10). &quot;These were the sons of Oholibamah, the wife of Esau&quot; (Genesis 36:14). &quot;They arose and went down to Egypt&quot; (Genesis 43:15). &quot;And I buried her there on the way&quot; (Genesis 48:7).And he has made me a father to Pharaoh.&quot; And here are the names that came down to Egypt (Genesis 46:8). &quot;So shall you say to the children of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel&quot; (Exodus 19:3). &quot;The children of Israel journeyed from Rameses&quot; (Exodus 12:37). &quot;For it is a sign between Me&quot; (Exodus 31:13). &quot;Five for the planks on one side&quot; (Exodus 26:27). &quot;We have no barricade against it.&quot; &quot;And the priest shall take from its blood&quot; (Leviticus 4:34), for if it is a lamb. &quot;And when the zav becomes purified with living water&quot; (Leviticus 15:13). &quot;One lamb of the first year without blemish&quot; (Leviticus 14:10). &quot;All who come to join the ranks must be counted in their census&quot; (Numbers 4:3). &quot;From the first of your dough, you shall give&quot; (Numbers 15:20). &quot;Avenge the vengeance of the children of Israel&quot; (Numbers 31:2). &quot;And they came to Moses and to the congregation of the children of Israel&quot; (Numbers 12:1). &quot;The heads of the families of the house of Joseph approached&quot; (Numbers 36:1). &quot;But I have not the power to go up&quot; (Deuteronomy 1:26). &quot;And they shall inherit it, they and all the people of the land&quot; (Numbers 32:22). &quot;To give us into the hands of the Amorites&quot; (Deuteronomy 1:27). &quot;Nor take a mother upon her young&quot; (Deuteronomy 22:6). &quot;Brimstone and salt burning&quot; (Deuteronomy 29:22). &quot;Like the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah&quot; (Deuteronomy 29:22). &quot;I said, I would scatter them&quot; (Deuteronomy 32:26).

Rather, He withholds His anger, but [later] collects His due. He said to the tribes: ‘You sold your brother while eating and drinking.

              <p>&quot;The arrogance of the wicked kindles the poor. This refers to Lot who was caught with the people of Sodom. The tribes thought they had devised a plan, but they were caught in their own schemes. Rabbi Yudan said: The one who says 'the merciful One will forgive' is not forgiven until he appeases his friend. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the tribes: You sold your brother for food and drink, as it says, 'And they sat down to eat bread' (Genesis 37:25). Behold, your children will be sold in Shushan during a feast, as it says, 'And the king and Haman sat down to drink' (Esther 3:15). Rabbi Yissachar said: What if Joseph had not forgiven his brothers, as it says, 'It was not you who sent me here, but God' (Genesis 45:8)? See how this is corrected for them! He who does not forgive his friend, even for a minor offense, is guilty of many sins. Rabbi Chanin said: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the tribes: You said, 'Let us sell Joseph as a slave.' By your lives, you will be called slaves every year. Rabbi Pinchas said in the name of Rabbi Hosea: The tribes caused their father's coat to be torn, and they were punished in Egypt, as it says, 'And they tore their clothes' (Genesis 44:13). Joseph caused the tribes to tear their clothes, and his descendant, Joshua, was punished, as it says, 'And Joshua tore his clothes' (Joshua 7:6).&quot;</p>

            <summary>Joseph reassures his brothers, who sold him into Egypt, that it was God's plan for him to be there to save lives during a famine, emphasizing that it was not their doing but rather God's will (Gen. 45:4-8). Joseph is seen as a father figure to Pharaoh and all of Egypt, bridging the transition from the era of the Patriarchs to the birth of Israel as a nation (Gen. 45:8). Joseph's role as a connector between generations is highlighted, as he is considered both an av (father) and a ben (son), symbolizing the passing on of wisdom and the secret formula for redemption (Exodus 3:18).</summary>

              <p>And you shall be joyful That in the merit of this, the Omnipresent will make you joyful. And our teachers explained (Pesachim 36b, Bikkurim 1:6) that at the time of joy - from Atzeret [Shavuot] until Chag [Sukkot] - one brings and reads. For that is the time of picking fruit, and people are joyful. From thence onwards, one brings and does not read. And a ger brings and does not read, because they cannot say &quot;fruit of the land You gave me&quot; (Devarim 26:10) &quot;that God swore to our ancestors&quot; (Devarim 26:3) - for they do not have a portion in the Land. And in Masechet Bikkurim (1:4) they say, Since they cannot say &quot;to our ancestors&quot; - and so in prayer, since in prayer our teachers relied on the Talmud Yerushalmi [Bikkurim 1:4 (2:2)] that they bring stories that gerim said in prayer &quot;God of our ancestors&quot;. This is because &quot;our ancestors&quot; [אבותינו avoteinu] is the language of &quot;our great ones&quot; [גדולינו gedoleinu], like &quot;And He has set me as a father to Paroh and as a master to all his house&quot; (Bereishit 45:8), and so too &quot;he was the father of all those who play the lyre and the pipe&quot;  (Bereishit 4:21), which is translated (Targum Onkelos on Bereishit 4:21) &quot;their teacher&quot; [רבהון rabhon]. And so &quot;father of many nations&quot; (Bereishit 17:4) - prince and master of the whole world. And thus the geirim are accustomed to say &quot;God of our ancestors&quot; in prayer, and this is primary.</p>

              <p>... And in truth, the greatness of the righteousness of his heart with God prevented him from fulfilling the commandment of honoring his father (and to tell his father that he was alive); in the same way that all of his behavior towards his brothers at this time - even though at first glance it appears as one who is taking vengeance upon them... in truth [was] only because of his righteousness, to not do anything against the will of his Maker. For so was the decree from the Most High which He showed him in a prophetic dream - &quot;and they bowed down to my sheave&quot; (Genesis 37:7). And he did it with great wisdom and deep counsel that they would not fulfill these bowings and this submission in front of him, while knowing that he was Joseph - as this would have been a great embarrassment for them. Surely to save them from this, he made great efforts that they should fulfill [the dream] without knowing that he was the one to whom they were bowing. [This is] as the verse testifies - &quot;And Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamt about them&quot; (42:9), as explained there. Likewise was Joseph concerned in his heart about informing his father at the beginning of his being brought up, that he was alive and was the ruler of the country, lest the decree of the Most High about the bowings of the sheaves and the eleven stars be nullified. Behold it is for this reason - even though he was personally yearning to honor his father with the good news - that he nevertheless needed to strain with great strength  to nullify the commandment of honoring his father (in the same was as there is no room for the commandment of honoring one's father if, through it, he nullifies one of the commandments of the Lord)... Behold, in order to fulfill the will of his Maker, he was obligated to forget the honor of his father from his heart, even though he found himself obligated to honor him every instant... Hence he called his son, Menasseh, &quot;as the Lord made me forget...&quot; - He is the one who assisted me that I not think about the honor of my father, as if he was forgotten from my heart. And most of the usage of forgetting is just about not putting one's attention to something; in that it is not [sufficiently] important in his eyes to put his mind to it (hence, he &quot;puts it to the side&quot;). And he said, &quot;all of my father's house,&quot; to include all those connected with his father, as they were all equally good in his eyes. And he did not have a grudge in his heart about what they did to him; as he said to them afterwards (Genesis 45:8), &quot;It is not you that sent me here, but rather God.&quot; And [about] that which he said, &quot;all of my toil&quot; - his intention was not that with the status of being raised up, he forgot all of the heartaches which he had before his entering into all of this honor. For in fact his intention even at the time of his toil when he had the status of a slave - even though he was forced to be involved in things that were unnatural for him - [was that] this toil was not a strain and a burden upon him; as he accepted it with a joyful heart and gave thanks to Him, may He be blessed, that He helped him spiritually that he should not think of it as a strain, but rather to do it with a good heart. So all of the great toil was as removed and forgotten [even] in its time...</p>

              <p>I am your brother, Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt. And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life…God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for you many survivors. So it was not you who sent me here, but God. (Gen. 45:4–8)</p>

              <p>In his focus on ĥen, on relationship and connection, Joseph played a unique role within Am Yisrael. He was the liminal figure, connecting the age of the Patriarchs to the birth of Israel as a nation. Joseph was the only one of the sons of Jacob who was also considered an av, or patriarch-prototype. This leitmotif was repeated throughout Joseph’s story. Jacob blessed him as the even Yisrael (rock of Israel), and Onkelos parsed the phrase to imply qualities of both “av” and “ben.” Although he was followed years later by a younger brother, Benjamin, Joseph was considered Jacob’s ben zekunim – not “son of old age,” but “repository of accumulated wisdom,” (BR 84:8; Onkelos, Genesis 37:3.)  Jacob’s extension to the next generation. Joseph was called “avrekh” by the Egyptians, understood by Rashi to be a composite word meaning “av” (father) in wisdom, despite being “rakh” (young). (Rashi, Genesis 41:43.)  Joseph indeed referred to himself as a “father” to Pharaoh (Genesis 45:8.)  – this in contrast to the numerous references to his na’arut (youth). Joseph, the child of ĥen, was the connecting point: he was both an av and a ben, spanning both eras, closing the book of Fathers (Genesis) and opening the book of the Sons (Exodus). Joseph alone was entrusted with passing on the secret formula “pakod yifkod etkhem,” the signal for movement away from the past and toward the future redemption. (ShR 3:11; Ramban, Exodus 3:18.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>[2] And so all the righteous suffered in their youth and ultimately found comfort. Abraham suffered greatly in his youth, was thrown into a fiery furnace, and was cast out of his father's house. Sixteen kings came against him, and his wife was taken from him by both Pharaoh and Abimelech. He was tested with his only son, Isaac, but in the end found peace, as it says &quot;And Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things&quot; (Genesis 24:1). Isaac also suffered greatly in his youth, as Ishmael took an arrow and tried to kill him. It says, &quot;And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac&quot; (Genesis 21:9). &quot;Playing&quot; means he took an arrow and tried to kill him. Furthermore, his father Abraham was going to slaughter him, and then famine came, as it says, &quot;Now there was a famine in the land&quot; (Genesis 26:1). Isaac went to Abimelech and became the target of jealousy, as it says, &quot;And the Philistines envied him&quot; (Genesis 26:14). They told him to leave, and he went and settled in Gerar, where he disputed with the shepherds. But ultimately he found comfort, as it says, &quot;Therefore he called it Rehoboth, for he said, 'For now the Lord has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land'&quot; (Genesis 26:22). Similarly, Jacob suffered greatly, as Esau pursued him, and he was enslaved by his sons. He was pursued by Laban and punished through his daughter. His son was sold, and in the end he found peace, as it says, &quot;And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years&quot; (Genesis 47:28). Joseph was deeply pained when his brothers despised him, threw him into a pit, sold him into slavery, and he was imprisoned. As it is written, &quot;They afflicted his feet with shackles; iron pierced his soul until his word came to pass and God's word proved him true&quot; (Psalms 105:18-19). Joseph remained silent, as it is written, &quot;He sits alone in silence&quot; (Lamentations 3:28). In the end, he was redeemed, as it is written, &quot;He will not abandon forever, for He desires to show kindness&quot; (Lamentations 3:31). And it is written at the end, &quot;Hurry and go up to my father&quot; (Genesis 45:9).</p>

              <p>“He raised his voice in weeping…. And his brothers could not answer him” – Abba Kohen Bardela said: Woe unto us from the Day of Judgment; woe unto us from the day of rebuke. Bilam, the wise man of the idolaters, could not withstand the rebuke of his donkey. That is what is written: “Have I been in the habit of doing so to you? He said: No” (Numbers 22:30). Joseph was the youngest of the tribes and they were unable to withstand his rebuke. That is what it is written: “And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him.” When the Holy One blessed be He will come and rebuke each and every one according to his status, as it is stated: “I would reprove you and set it before your eyes” (Psalms 50:21), all the more so.   “Please approach me, and they approached” – he showed them the circumcision. “I am Joseph.”  “And now, it was not you that sent me here, but God. He made me into a father to Pharaoh, and into a lord for all his house, and ruler over the entire land of Egypt” (Genesis 45:8).  “And now it was not you that sent…He made me into a father to Pharaoh, [and into a lord [uladon] for all his house, and ruler [umoshel] over…]” – a patron to the king, “uladon” – a lord; umoshel – a ruler.   “Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him: So said your son Joseph: God has made me lord for all Egypt; come down to me, do not tarry” (Genesis 45:9).  “Hurry and go up to my father, and say to him” – do not miss the opportunity.   “And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that is speaking to you” (Genesis 45:12).  “That it is my mouth that is speaking to you” – in the sacred tongue.</p>

            <summary>Rabbeinu Bahya explains that the Presence of G’d, represented by the letter ה, accompanied the Israelites to Egypt, as seen in the words מצרימה and עלה. This attribute of G’d, associated with retribution, was evident in the plagues and at the sea, and would be present in all future exiles. Ramban interprets Joseph telling his brothers not to fear on their journey as a reassurance of safety due to his authority in Egypt. Simchat HaRegel discusses the Divine Providence in the Israelites' journey from idol worship to redemption, emphasizing the Shechinah's presence during their subjugation and eventual liberation, orchestrated by G’d through Joseph's rule in Egypt to prevent them from falling into deeper impurity.</summary>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Bereshit 46:4:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>A kabbalistic approach to our verse: The words: “I will go down with you,” are an allusion to the Presence of G’d, the שכינה, which would go down to Egypt with the Israelites. Our sages in Shabbat 89 and elsewhere say that G’d’s Presence descended with the Israelites. In order to hint at this, Onkelos translates the words as אנא אחות [a “physical” as opposed to a merely spiritual descent, in anthropomorphic terms, of course. Ed.], instead of as אנא אתגלי which is his usual translation for the word ירד, such as in Exodus 19,11 when applied to G’d. This is especially remarkable considering the care Onkelos takes not to apply anthropomorphic terms to G’d or His activities.  The reason the Torah writes מצרימה instead of למצרים, i.e. concluding with the letter ה, and also writing the word עלה in a form ending with the letter ה, is to provide tangible proof that G’d’s Presence, i.e. “ה,” will accompany the Israelites to Egypt. The letter ה, the last letter in the Ineffable Name, is the attribute which provided sustenance for Egypt during the years of famine.  Joseph already hinted at this attribute when he told the Egyptians in 47,23 הא לכם זרע, “here is seed for you.” In the following verse Joseph speaks of the חמישית, “fifth” or “hand” which G’d used to enact retribution from the Egyptians for abusing the Israelites during their exile there. This “hand” of G’d was in evidence when the livestock of the Egyptians was struck in Exodus 9,3, and it was the attribute the Israelites witnessed at the sea 14,31. It is also the attribute which Ezekiel mentioned when he described G’d’s anger during the destruction of Jerusalem and the Holy Temple (Ezekiel 16,43). We also find the words לא אחמול, “I shall not display pity,” five times in connection with that destruction (commencing in Ezekiel 5,11) after having described such scenes as parents eating the flesh of their children and children eating the flesh of their parents, to illustrate this lack of G’d’s pity for the state His people were in at that time.  We find that Daniel 2,43 refers to this attribute when he speaks about iron not blending with earthenware. Daniel mentions five different categories of materials which cannot form a blend, an alloy. This word הא occurs a total of three times in the Bible, once in the Torah, once in the Books of Prophets (Ezekiel 16,43), and once in the Hagiographa (Daniel 3,25). The message is that this attribute of G’d will accompany the Israelites through all the various exiles. The very word עמך, “with you,” which G’d uses to describe Himself as accompanying Yaakov to Egypt, is also associated with צרה, distress, sorrow, trouble, as we know from עמו אנכי בצרה, Psalms 91,15 “I am with him when it is in trouble.” In our verse the choice of that word then is a double-entendre. It means that even when the Israelites were exiled to Babylon the שכינה was with them also. Our sages base this on Isaiah 43,14: “for your sake I send (the redeemer) to Babylon.” We have a similar situation regarding the exile under the Edomites, (the present exile). Isaiah 63,1 describes the redeemer as coming from Edom, his clothing full of blood, etc., an allusion to G’d taking His vengeance on our oppressors. The word זה in that verse is a reference to G’d Himself being that redeemer. The word זה referred to our redeemer, i.e. G’d, already when the Israelites had crossed the sea and watched the Egyptians drown. At that time they broke out in a song of thanksgiving adulating G’d by saying זה א-לי ואנוהו “this is my G’d and I want to enshrine Him.” The word זה, of course, also ends with this letter ה, the attribute we have been discussing. Interestingly enough, even Joseph phrased his invitation to his father to come to him in Egypt in a word ending with the letter ה, when he said (45,9) רדה אלי אל תעמוד, “come down to me, do not delay.” He added the letter ה instead of saying רד אלי, which would have been quite sufficient. He meant to convey his confidence that the attribute of G’d represented by the letter ה would accompany his father and his family. Keeping all this in mind, the phenomenal increase of the Jewish people from 70 souls to over 600,000 arms-bearing men at the time of the Exodus (only 210 years later) becomes much less surprising. Clearly the Presence of G’d’s benevolent שכינה must be credited for this. (the author had referred to the addition of the latter ה in Avraham’s name in Genesis 17,5 as supplying the element which would enable his descendants to multiply prolifically). This element came into its own while the Jewish people were in Egypt and actually was also a prime factor in their eventual enslavement (compare Exodus 1,7-13). Once they had attained the required number of 600.000 men over 20 years of age they qualified for G’d revealing Himself to them openly at Mount Sinai.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>DO NOT ‘TIRG’ZU’ BY THE WAY. Rogez is an expression of trembling and movement, and is usually applied when the trembling is a result of fear, as for example, a heart ‘ragaz’ (that is trembling); (Deuteronomy 28:65.)  ‘V’ragzu’ (and they shall tremble), and be in anguish; (Ibid., 2:25.)  And where I stand ‘ergaz’ (I tremble); (Habakkuk 3:16.)  And drink thy water ‘b’ragzah’ (with trembling) and with anxiety. (Ezekiel 12:18.)  Therefore, the correct interpretation of this verse is, in my opinion, that Joseph said to them, “Do not fear by the way,” and the purport thereof is that since they were carrying corn and bread and sustenance (Verse 23 here.)  and the best of Egypt in the days of the famine, they might fear lest robbers attack them while they travelled on their journey to Canaan, and the moreso when they return to Egypt with all their possessions, and thus they will not hasten the matter. (See II Chronicles 24:15.)  Therefore he told them that they should go quickly and hurry to come there, as it is said, Hasten ye, and go up to my father, (Verse 9 here.)  and they should have no fear at all on the way as his name is upon them. Since he is the ruler of the entire land of Egypt, and the lives of the peoples of those countries are in his hand, and all are fearful of his awe, they will travel and arrive in peace.</p>

              <p>Connected with this, let us analyze a statement of the sages on this verse (Gen. 15:13) which the Maggid brings: “know that I am the one who spread them out and I am the one who gathered them; I am the one who enslaved them and I am the one who redeemed them.” (See Bereshit Rabba 44:18, though the version is slightly different there: ר יִהְיֶה זַרְעֲךָ (בר טו, יג), יָדֹעַ שֶׁאֲנִי מְפַזְּרָן, תֵּדַע שֶׁאֲנִי מְכַנְסָן. יָדֹעַ שֶׁאֲנִי מְמַשְׁכְּנָן, תֵּדַע שֶׁאֲנִי פּוֹרְקָן. יָדֹעַ שֶׁאֲנִי מְשַׁעְבְּוַיֹּאמֶר לְאַבְרָם יָדֹ תֵּדַע כִּי גֵדָן, תֵּדַע שֶׁאֲנִי גּוֹאֲלָן. כִּי גֵר יִהְיֶה זַרְעֲךָ בְּאֶרֶץ לֹא לָהֶם, מִשֶּׁיֵּרָאֶה לְךָ זָרַע. אָמַר רַבִּי יוּדָן גֵּרוּת בְּאֶרֶץ לֹא לָהֶם, עַבְדּוּת עִנּוּי לְאַסְפַּטְיָא שֶׁלָּהֶם.)  We need a commentary for the commentary here! One might have said that, “A stranger shall your offspring be,” (Gen. 15:13) means an actual stranger. Actually, it was necessary so the dross could be removed from the holy sparks from the 130 years that Adam was separated from Eve. During that time he inadvertently discharged seed, (creating demons). (See BT Eruvin 18a)  Thus he was made impure by the husks and needed purification. This took place through the years of subjugation “in a land not their own.” And if you say that things could have gone from bad to worse because he didn’t know where the place of clarification should occur, to this one might answer, know that I am the one who separated you;” “Since everything is under My providence, I separated you to an appropriate place of clarification and I would not send you to a place of misfortune, God forbid!” as it is written, “And you I will scatter among the nations.” (Lev. 26:33) The ancients suggest that this should have been written with an ‘open aleph; it was written with a chataf segol alluding to the Divine Presence. Thus we know that the Shechinah was with us. It means, I was with them when I scattered them and I clarified them. Our hope is that the Shechinah will be with us; know that I will also gather you since I was the one who scattered you while the Shechinah was with you. It is a sign that I will gather you as well, as the Zohar says. “And if you say, ‘Now they will be exiled to the nakedness of the land (Another term for the demonic realm.)  so that the harsh and powerful Sitra Achra shall rule over them and nothing shall save them,” to this one may answer, “I am the one who enslaved you,” and not by Egypt. Rather it was I, God, who caused them to be enslaved. Joseph ruled over Egypt, acquiring Israel as slaves so that afterwards they would be subjugated. Whatever a slave acquires, his master acquires.” (See BT Pesachim 88b)  It would appear that Israel was first enslaved to Joseph (as is alluded to with regard to the Sephirah of Yesod.) This is what allowed them to leave Egypt. If, God forbid, it had not been so (if they had been enslaved by Egypt) they never would not have been able to escape the might of Egypt, with its harsh and powerful husks. See what is written there at length. That which is written, “I am the one who subjugated them,” refers to the subjugating them to the realm of holiness; “And I am the one who will redeem them; for there is no reason to worry that they would become impure through the husks of Egypt since I am the one who subjugated them. When I was young I wrote at length on the verse, ‘God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me without delay,” (Gen 45:9). Some years later I came across the book, K’nei Chochma. I found a homily there (dr. 10, page 35) and I set my mind to record it as it was stated. The author brought the passage from Pirkei D’Rebbi Eliezer that the nights in Egypt were counted (as part of the period of slavery) since that Hebrew slaves cannot be forced to work day and night. Because the Israelites were sold to the Egyptians, they were able to force them to work day and night. Regarding an Israelite who is sold to a fellow Israelite, the Torah states, “Provide for them,” (Deut. 15:14) just as I provided in Egypt. The law of providing for a liberated slave only applies to Hebrew slaves. According to Rabbi Menachem Azaria MiFano (Menahem Azariah da Fano (1548 – 1620) was an Italian rabbi, Talmudist, and Kabbalist.He was a disciple of Rabbi Moses ben Jacob Cordovero,)  in his work Asarah Maamarot the reason for this is that the Covenant between the Pieces predicted that they would be sold into slavery. The slavery was established by Joseph. Since he ruled over his brothers, supported them and was master over all of Egypt it was forbidden to make them work day and night. Were it not for this, they would have had to remain in Egypt the full 430 years. As a result they would have entered the fiftieth gate of impurity and would have been trapped there forever.</p>

So Jacob at once chides and instructs the man wise in his own conceit when he says: “You must know, fine Sir, that the foods which nourish the soul are various forms of knowledge, and that these are not bestowed by the word of bodily sense but by God. He who reared me from youth and early prime to full-grown manhood (cf. Gen. 48:15) will Himself satisfy my needs.”</p>

Joseph was well aware that his father would not want to reside in the capital; this is why he arranged for him to live in Goshen.  Concerning the words: וכלכלתי אותך שם... פן תורש, “I will provide for you there. so that you will not become impoverished,” (verse 11) the meaning of these words is: “if you remain in Canaan you will surely become impoverished during the next five years of famine.” Joseph implied that he would not be able to look after his family economically while they were in the land of Canaan as he would be suspected of sending them grain in order to trade in it on the local market and to profiteer through their connection to him. Furthermore, they would suspect that the export of such grain supplies to his family were only a prelude to his own return there. On the other hand, if they would all come to Egypt everyone would know that he had no reason to return to Canaan and that he was not amassing a secret fortune in order to enable him to leave the country.</p>

Um zum Volke zu werden, ohne sich zu vermischen, dazu musste sie in die Mitte einer Nation kommen, der das ganze jüdische Wesen national widerstand, und dies war Mizrajim. So war später der Fanatismus, der die Ghetti baute, das wirksamste Mittel in Gottes Hand, um uns von aller Unkultur des Mittelalters fern zu halten und im engen Umkreis Familiensinn und Familienglück und Gemeindesinn bei uns zu pflegen.

              <p>“There I will provide for you” [45:11]. Ramban asks a question. Why did Joseph not provide for Jacob in the land of Canaan and told him to go outside the land of Israel. The explanation Ramban gives is that he said, I cannot provide for you in the land of Canaan. The king and his ministers will say that Joseph wants to enrich himself in the land of Canaan and wants to return to the land of Canaan. Therefore, you have to go to the land of Goshen, since the famine will still continue. When you and my brothers will come to Goshen, the ministers and the king will see that I will remain in the land of Egypt. (Ramban, Genesis, 45:11.) </p>

(Ibid. 30:27) &quot;I have found through divination that the L-rd has blessed me for your sake.&quot; Joseph went down to Potifera — blessing came in his wake, viz. (Ibid. 39:5) &quot;and the L-rd blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph's sake.&quot; Jacob went down to Pharaoh — blessing came down for his sake, viz. (Ibid. 47:10) &quot;And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.&quot; In what way did he bless him? In that years of famine were withheld from him. And after the death of Jacob they returned, as it is written (Ibid. 50:21) &quot;And now, do not fear, I (Joseph) will feed you and your little ones,&quot; and (Ibid. 45;11) &quot;And I will feed you there.&quot; Just as &quot;feeding&quot; there was in the (projected) years of famine, so, the &quot;feeding&quot; here (50:21) was in the years of famine, (the famine having returned with Jacob's death).

            <summary>Rabbi Yoseph explains that Joseph's promise to provide for his brothers after their father's death was due to the famine resuming, as seen in the use of the same expression as during the famine in chapter 45. Zevach Pesach on Pesach Haggadah clarifies that Jacob's family only intended to reside temporarily in Egypt during the famine, as evidenced by their request to dwell in Goshen for their herds and the response from Pharaoh offering them the land. The brothers' honest explanation convinced Pharaoh to allow them to settle in Goshen, despite Joseph's initial plan to deceive Pharaoh.</summary>

              <p>Rabbi Yoseph in Tossephta Sotah 10,9 points out that the famine resumed after Yaakov’s death and that Joseph’s promise to provide for his brothers (50,21 made after his father had died) was precisely because the famine had resumed at that time. Just as Joseph had used the expression וכלכלתי אתכם, “I will provide for you” in 45,11 at a time when the famine was in full force, so the same expression used in chapter 50 also reflects that the famine was again in full force. Rabbi Shimon did not feel that such an explanation would reflect credit on G’d as it creates the impression that blessings by the righteous are valid only during their own lifetime. His son Rabbi Eleazar nevertheless said that he preferred Rabbi Yoseph’s interpretation to that of his father.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>&quot;And he resided there&quot; – this teaches that he didn't go down to settle there, but rather to reside there, as it is stated, &quot;And they said to Pharaoh, to reside in the land have we come, since there is not enough pasture for your servant's flocks, since the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan, and now please grant that your servants should dwell in the land of Goshen.&quot; (Gen. 47:4) The Maggid did not interpret, “And he resided there” as a reference to settling permanently in Egypt as we see elsewhere, “And Jacob resided in the land of Ham,” (Ps. 105:23) for two reasons. First, because if this is what the text meant, it would have been more fitting for it to say, “And he dwelled there.” (Vayeshev sham) (Vayeshev means to settle permanently while vayagar is to reside for a limited amount of time.)  The descendants of Jacob actually dwelled there a long time and were already residents of the land. So why does Scripture use “residing” (geirut) if it doesn’t reflect their intention when they came there… The second reason is that Scripture states, “They resided there few in number.” This implies that the residing must have taken place at the beginning of their stay in Egypt when they were still few in number, only seventy. The verse is referring to the time soon after they arrived in Egypt. The most direct explanation of the verse, ‘They resided there few in number” reflects their thinking when they first arrived and not when they had been dwelling for a while in Egypt. About this (later period of their residence in Egypt) it states, “and there they became a great and mighty nation.” (As happened during many periods of Israel exile, what began as residence quickly turned into settlement. Jacob and his family came planning to reside for a short time in Egypt but they became as great nation when they remained there permanently.)  A proof is brought for this from the verse, “to reside in the land have we come.” (Gen. 47:7) The Maggid understood from the true meaning of the story of Joseph; Joseph only told the brothers to bring their father to Egypt to live there during the years of the famine, as he said, “And here I will nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine, lest you, and your household and all you have come to poverty.” (Gen. 45:11) He thought that after the famine ended, they would return to Canaan. When they arrived in Egypt Joseph planned to dupe Pharaoh into allowing them to settle the land of Goshen. He ordered his brothers, when he presented them to Pharaoh and he asked them what type of work they did, to say, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34) He then told them the reason why they should say this, “That you may live in the land of Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.” (Gen. 46:34) Because of this the Egyptians would not want them to dwell in Egypt. Even though this advice was for their benefit and there can be no doubt that it was true that both they and their ancestors were shepherds, still Joseph had them say this so Pharaoh would not suspect that they came to Egypt to eat his food, and that Joseph was going to give it to them from the king’s treasury. The brothers came before Pharaoh and when he asked them, “What is your trade,” they answered as Joseph instructed them, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our ancestors;” this would have been enough for them to say. So why did they add, “And they said, ‘Moreover, we have come to reside in the land.’” (Gen. 47:4) Also why did they explicitly ask Pharaoh, “Let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” (Gen. 47:4) It was not Joseph’s intention that they should ask for the land of Goshen but rather they should answer him in this way so that Pharaoh himself would offer it to them. Yet the truth of the matter became apparent when they said, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34). They became silent thinking that Pharaoh would answer, “Then go dwell in the land of Goshen…” But upon hearing this Pharaoh didn’t say anything so the brothers felt it was necessary to add the second part of the statement, “They said, to reside in the land we have come.” This was an unexpected statement and it made known the truth of their intentions, that it was not their plan to continue to dwell in the land but to reside there temporarily because of the pressing needs of their herds and because the famine was severe in Canaan. Then they asked him clearly to give them permission to dwell in Goshen for the sake of their herds for a limited time. To this second request Pharaoh did not answer directly; rather he turned to Joseph and said, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.” (Gen. 47:5) He said to Joseph, ‘’All of this was to fool me, for your father and brothers came because of their herds and you can see that other shepherds have not come from Canaan. The truth is they came “To you” – because you are a leader in my land and so you can support them. They want to dwell in the land of Goshen and I want things to go well for them. Since that is the case, “Behold the land is before you; let your father and your brothers live in the best of the land.” (Gen. 47:6) From this it has been explained that when the brothers said, “We have come to reside in the land,” they were not being duplicitous. They were being completely honest – this is what they meant. It is why the Maggid explains, “and he resided there” to mean, they did not come to Egypt to settle there. (While Joseph tried to trick Pharaoh into letting his family settle in Goshen, the brothers’ honest explanation was more affective in convincing Pharaoh to allow them to settle in Goshen. Pharaoh is cleverer than Joseph and he turns on him and makes it clear that he knows Joseph’s true intentions. Thus when the Haggadah says, that they did not come to settle but to reside in Egypt it is clear that the brothers had no intention of staying on but remaining until the end of the famine.)  We have now answered the questions in the forty-ninth and the fiftieth gates.</p>

I have become wealthy, and God has blessed me on account of you.&quot; Before Joseph descended to Egypt, the house of Potiphar was not blessed. Once he descended, what does it say, but (Gen. 39:5), &quot;And God blessed the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph.&quot; Before Jacob descended to Egypt [after Joseph sent for him], there was famine, as it says (Gen. 45:6), &quot;For it is two years now that the famine has been in the midst of the land, etc.&quot; Once he descended, what does it say, but (Gen. 50:31), &quot;And now, do not fear, for I will sustain you and your little children, etc.&quot; It says here &quot;sustain,&quot; and it says there (Gen. 45:11) &quot;sustain,&quot; just as &quot;sustain&quot; over there is in reference to the famine, so too &quot;sustain&quot; over here is in reference to the famine. As long as Joseph and the tribes (i.e., his brothers) were alive, Israel comported itself with grandeur and honor, as it is said (Ex. 1:7), &quot;And the Children of Israel bore fruit and swarmed, etc.&quot; Once he died, what does it say, but (Ex. 1:6-9), &quot;And Joseph died[, and all his brothers, and all that generation],&quot; &quot;And a new king arose [over Egypt],&quot; &quot;And he said to his people, [Here this people ... is greater and mightier [in number] than we],&quot; &quot;Come  now, let us use our wits against it, etc.&quot;</p>

              <p>THAT IT IS MY MOUTH. It is well known that peh (mouth) spelled peh, heh is in the absolute. However, when it appears in the construct the silent heh (The heh in peh is not sounded.)  changes to a silent yod, (Peh becomes pi (my mouth) or fi when the rules of grammar call for the omission of the dagesh. I.E. refers to the yod following a chirik as a silent yod.)  as in The mouth of (pi) the righteous (Ps. 37:30). The same form (pi) is also used for the plural, as in But the mouth (pi) of the wicked (Prov. 10:11). (Resha’im (wicked) is in the plural. Thus the mouth of the wicked should be rendered, the mouths of the wicked men (Cherez).)  Now when the yod that takes the place of the heh comes together with the yod of the first person pronominal suffix, one of the yods is dropped, (My mouth should be written peh, yod, yod, one yod serving as the first person pronominal suffix and the other substituting for the heh. However, one yod is dropped to simplify enunciation. Thus pi can mean either my mouth or mouth of.)  as in my mouth (fi) that speaketh. The meaning of my mouth that speaketh unto you is: I speak directly to you in Hebrew without the use of an interpreter.</p>

              <p>והנה עיניכם רואות ועיני אחי בנימין, “and here you can see with your own eyes and so do the eyes of my full brother Binyamin.” He equated Binyamin with the total of the other brothers. The Torah teaches that the love of the other brothers for him was no less than that of Binyamin who had not been a party to the sale.  כי פי המדבר אליכם, “that it is my mouth that is speaking to you.” He referred to the fact that he addressed them in Hebrew (without interpreter). According to Nachmanides the fact that Joseph had a command of Hebrew did not prove that he was their brother as many people in Egypt knew that tongue and the ruler was bound by law to be familiar with all the languages spoken in countries which had trade relations with Egypt. The proof of his identity was the revelation that he knew they had sold their brother Joseph to Egypt. The meaning of the words: “that my mouth is speaking to you,” was a reference to his authority and that by dint of this authority he decreed that the brothers bring their father to Egypt as well as their families. By underlining that he was “your brother,” he demonstrated that he had their welfare at heart when he wanted them to move to Egypt. According to Megillah 16 the words mean that “my mouth speaks only what is in my heart.” Although Joseph made no reference to his heart, our sages arrive at this conclusion as he could simply have said: “I am speaking to you.” He mentioned “my mouth” as the mouth is the instrument used to convey feelings of the heart.</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 45:12:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>THAT IT IS MY MOUTH THAT SPEAKETH UNTO YOU. I.e., in the Holy Language. This is the opinion of the commentators, (Rashi, Ibn Ezra and R’dak.)  and it is also the translation of Onkelos. It is possible that Joseph said so to them for plausibility and in order to be conciliatory, for the fact that a person in Egypt speaks the Holy Language is not proof that he is Joseph. It is my opinion that the Holy Language was the language of Canaan for Abraham did not bring it there from Ur of the Chaldees or Haran, as they spoke Aramaic there, as is attested to by “the heap.” (Above, 31:47. In Aramaic, Laban named it Yegar-sahaduth (the heap of witness). Thus it is clear that Aramaic was the spoken language in Abraham’s birthplace.)  Now it was not the language of one man alone; rather, it was the language of the entire land of Canaan, and many people in Egypt knew it, since Canaan was nearby. We would particularly expect knowledge of languages in the case of a ruler for it is usual for kings and rulers to be linguistic. It is just as you see in the case of Nebuchadnezzar who said in the Holy Language, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream, (Daniel 2:3.)  because there were the magicians, and the enchanters, and the sorcerers, and Chaldeans, (Ibid., Verse 2.)  people of many languages, as well as from Israel, and they all would understand him. They, however, answered him in Aramaic, as it says, Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Aramaic, (Ibid., Verse 4.)  as they were close to him, and sat first in the kingdom, (Esther 1:14.)  and they had the permission to speak to the king. Moreover, just as Joseph came from Canaan to Egypt, many others also came. Besides, the brothers had greater proof that he was Joseph when he mentioned his name and the circumstance of the sale, saying, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. (Verse 4 here.)  The correct interpretation in my opinion is that Joseph is saying: “And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that I, the ruler and lord of all Egypt, am the one telling you with my mouth that I am your brother, and command you to bring down my father to me in order to sustain him. This being so, you will tell my father of all the glory in Egypt, and of all that you have seen (Verse 13 here.)  with your eyes, and you will hurry and bring him down to me for the words I have spoken are true, and I have the power to deliver him and to keep him alive in the famine.” (See Psalms 33:19.)  This is analogous to saying, “for I have spoken my word.” In the Gemara of Tractate Megillah, (16b.)  the Rabbis have said: “As my mouth, so is my heart,” [meaning: “Just as I indicate no hatred against you in my speech, so is my heart free of hatred against you].”</p>

His command of the Hebrew language would prove this better than anything he might have heard from a third party. Therefore he instructed them</p>

    Nachmanides writes that the fact that Joseph suddenly admitted being able to speak Hebrew would not prove that he was their long lost brother. The fact that he mentioned his real name to them, plus the details of how he had been sold were far more potent arguments to establish his true identity in their eyes.
    Personally, (still Nachmanides writing) I believe that the true interpretation of what Joseph is saying in our verse is: “your own eyes as well as the eyes of my brother Binyamin are living testimony to my august position here in Egypt, and in my capacity of your brother and the de facto ruler of Egypt, I command you to move to Egypt and to join me here. The only reason I command you to tell our father of my position here and the esteem in which I am held, is to persuade you to come here so that I can provide for you during the remaining years of the famine. If I did not entertain feelings of love and fondness towards you, there would be absolutely no reason for me to speak to you in this fashion.”

I am circumcised and I speak Hebrew as well as you. Hizkuni asks. What kind of proof is circumcision? There are many Turks who practice circumcision. The explanation is that the Turks practice circumcision, but do not uncover the corona, but Joseph had circumcision, and uncovered corona. Hizkuni asks another question. The Egyptians circumcised themselves for the sake of grain, since Joseph did not want to give grain to the Egyptians. They had to circumcise themselves first. What kind of proof was it that Joseph showed his circumcision? Perhaps he was one of the Egyptians who had circumcised themselves? The explanation is that Joseph was the lord over the grain. Had he been an Egyptian, he would not have needed to circumcise himself because he was very wealthy. Therefore, the brothers said that he must be a Jew and is our brother. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:4.)  Therefore, Joseph said, “you can see for yourself” [45:12]. That is, you see my great honor and wealth and that I am circumcised and that I am a Jew. (Rashi, Genesis, 45:12.) </p>

              <p>“My brother Benjamin for himself” [45:12]. He compared all the brothers to each other. That is, just as I have no hatred toward Benjamin, so too, I have no hatred to all of you. (Rashi, Genesis, 45:12.)  Hizkuni writes. Joseph said to his brothers. If you will not tell our father that I am alive because you have all sworn that you would not tell him, then let Benjamin see that I am alive. Let him tell my father, since Benjamin had not sworn (Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:12.)  Toldot Yizhak asks a question. Why did Joseph say that you see and Benjamin sees that I speak Hebrew? There were many people in Egypt who could speak Hebrew. The explanation is that Joseph said: you should go and tell our father that he should come here. The famine will last another five years. If you do not believe me that I am right, then see with your own eyes that the dream that I dreamed, that eleven brothers will bow down to me, and the dream of the ears of grain pointed to famine. Your eyes show you that you have come along with Benjamin and you bowed down. This is why I desired that you should also bring Benjamin, so that you eleven brothers should bow down at one time, in the expectation that the dream should be fulfilled. Therefore, you should also believe me when I tell you that there will be a famine for five years. This is the meaning of the verse, “it is indeed I who am speaking to you” [45:12]. That is to say, you can understand what I am saying, that it is true. Therefore, bring my father and I will support him. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 45:12.)  Rabbi Isserl writes. When Joseph said, “I am Joseph, is my father still well?” [45:3]. That is to say, I am still alive and my father should still live. With his prophecy, he should know that I am alive, if my father was a prophet. Therefore, Joseph asked, is my father still alive with his prophecy? (Be’ure Maharai, Genesis, 45:3.) </p>

              <p>Another reason for the redemption of Israel, they said in Shir Hashirim Rabbah (4:12) about the verse a locked garden (Song of Songs 4:12): “Rabbi Huna said in the name of bar Kappara: By virtue of four matters, Israel was redeemed from Egypt: That they did not change their name, they did not change their language, they did not speak slander, and not one of them was steeped in licentiousness. They did not change their name: Reuben and Simeon descended [to Egypt]*; Reuben and Simeon ascended*. They did not call Reuben Rufus, they did not call Simeon Luleyani, [...] They did not change their language. There, it is written: The survivor came and told Abram the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13), and here it is written: The God of the Hebrews [has called upon us] (Exodus 5:3), and it is written: That it is my mouth speaking to you (Genesis 45:12), in the sacred tongue.* They did not speak slander, as it is stated: Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask each man from his neighbor (Exodus 11:2). You find that this matter had been entrusted to them for twelve months, and not one of them was found to have informed on his counterpart. Not one of them was steeped in licentiousness, as it is stated: The son of an Israelite woman went out, and he is [the son of] an Egyptian man (Leviticus 24:10–11), to apprise in praise of Israel that not one of them was found except for this one.”(Shir HaShirim Rabbah 4:12:1) (Translation of the midrash adapted from The Sefaria Midrash Rabbah, 2022) .</p>

A great king came to this city, this is Joseph, as it is written &quot;God made me lord&quot; (Genesis 45:8).

That is what it is written: “And his brothers could not answer him because they were alarmed before him.” When the Holy One blessed be He will come and rebuke each and every one according to his status, as it is stated: “I would reprove you and set it before your eyes” (Psalms 50:21), all the more so.   “Please approach me, and they approached” – he showed them the circumcision. “I am Joseph.”  “And now, it was not you that sent me here, but God.

                <h4>Shir HaShirim Rabbah 4:12:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>“A locked garden is my sister, my bride; a locked fountainhead, a sealed spring. Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates, with delicious fruit, henna with nard” (Song of Songs 4:12–13). “A locked garden is my sister, my bride” – Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: [This is analogous] to a king who had two daughters, one older and one younger, and he did not devote attention to arranging their marriages. The king left them for many years and went overseas. The girls arose and asserted themselves and married themselves to men. Each of them would take her husband’s seal and his signet. Years later, the king returned from overseas and he heard the voices of the people slandering his daughters and saying that the king’s daughters had engaged in licentiousness. What did he do? He issued a proclamation and said: The entire people shall go out to the assembly hall. He came and sat in the vestibule. He said to them: ‘My daughters, is this what you have done; have you tainted yourselves?’ Immediately, each of them produced her husband’s seal and his signet. He called his son-in-law and said to him: ‘To whom are you a bridegroom?’ He said to him: ‘I am your first son-in-law, [married] to your older daughter.’ He said to him: ‘What is this?’ He said to him: ‘This is my seal and this is my signet,’ and likewise [occurred with] the second [son-in-law]. At that moment, the king said: My daughters are sheltered from immorality and you slander and demean them? By your lives, I will administer justice against you. So it is with the nations, because they would taunt Israel and say: “Egypt enslaved the children of Israel [with harshness]” (Exodus 1:13); if they compelled them to perform labor, all the more so [they must have dominated] their bodies and their wives. At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He said: My sister, My bride, a locked garden. What is a locked garden? The Holy One blessed be He said: My garden is locked and it is being condemned? (This is a metaphor meaning: The women of Israel have not had relations with anyone other than their husbands, and yet they are being maligned?)  Rabbi Pinḥas said: At that moment the Holy One blessed be He called the angel appointed over pregnancy and said: Go and shape [the children] with all the features of their fathers. Who did the fathers themselves resemble? The paterfamilias of the families. That is what is written regarding Reuben: “The families of the Reubenites [haReuveni]” (Numbers 26:7). Rabbi Hoshaya said: Reuben, Reubenite [haReuveni], Simeon, Simeonite [haShimoni]. (See Numbers 26:14. The members of the tribes are referred to in this way in order to imply that they looked like Reuben and Simeon. This was proof that they were actually the descendants of their fathers.)  Rabbi Marinos ben Rabbi Hoshaya said: Like you say: Baronite, Savronite, Sivoyite. (These were names common at the time of the writing of the midrash. Just as Baronite means a member of the Baron family, the same is true of Reubenite. Alternatively, Rabbi Marinos is disputing Rabbi Hoshaya’s point and saying that just as members of any family can be referred to in this manner, the term Reubenite does not mean anything special (Etz Yosef).)  Rabbi Huna in the name of Rabbi Idi: Heh at the beginning of the word and yod at the end; God [yod-heh] attests for them that they were indeed the sons of their fathers. Rabbi Pinḥas said: “A locked garden” – these are the virgins. “A locked fountainhead” – these are the non-virgins. (Although there is an opening – gal means door in Aramaic – it remains locked before men other than her husband.)  “A sealed spring” – these are the males. (They did not engage in illicit sexual activity.)  It was taught in the name of Rabbi Natan: “A locked garden, a locked fountainhead” – why was it [written] twice? Rather, it connotes two acts of intercourse for the woman; one in the typical manner and one in the atypical manner. (Vaginal intercourse and anal intercourse.)  Rabbi Huna said in the name of bar Kappara: By virtue of four matters, Israel was redeemed from Egypt: That they did not change their name, they did not change their language, they did not speak slander, and not one of them was steeped in licentiousness. They did not change their name: Reuben and Simeon descended [to Egypt]; Reuben and Simeon ascended. They did not call Reuben Rufus, they did not call Simeon Luleyani, Joseph, Listis, or Benjamin, Alexandra. They did not change their language. There, it is written: “The survivor came and told Abram the Hebrew” (Genesis 14:13), and here it is written: “The God of the Hebrews has called upon us” (Exodus 5:3), and it is written: “That it is my mouth speaking to you” (Genesis 45:12), in the sacred tongue. They did not speak slander, as it is stated: “Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask each man from his neighbor” (Exodus 11:2). You find that this matter had been entrusted to them for twelve months, and not one of them was found to have informed on his counterpart. (The Israelites knew twelve months before the Exodus that they would ask to borrow goods from the Egyptians and that they would then leave Egypt never to return. Nonetheless, none of them told the Egyptians about this plan.)   Not one of them was steeped in licentiousness, as it is stated: “The son of an Israelite woman, [whose father was an Egyptian.…] the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed” (Leviticus 24:10–11), to apprise in praise of Israel that not one of them was found except for this one, and the verse publicized her. (The verse specifies that this woman had conceived from an Egyptian man in order to emphasize that she was the exception; no other Israelite women had intercourse with Egyptian men.)   Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Sarah descended to Egypt (See Genesis 12:10–20.)  and sheltered herself from licentiousness, and all the [Israelite] women were sheltered by her merit. Joseph descended to Egypt and sheltered himself from licentiousness, and all the males were sheltered by his merit. Rabbi Pinḥas in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: The sheltering from licentiousness was itself sufficient that by its merit Israel would have been redeemed from Egypt. What is the reason? “A locked garden is my sister, my bride.” What is written thereafter? “Your branches [shelaḥayikh] (They merited to be sent [lehishalaḥ] from Egypt.)  are an orchard of pomegranates.” Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: [This is analogous] to one to whom an inheritance fell at the site of a garbage dump. The heir was indolent and he sold it at a minimal price. The purchaser went and industriously excavated there and found a treasure. He built a large palace. The purchaser began walking in the marketplace with servants following him [all due] to the treasure that he had purchased there. The seller saw and was sorrowful, saying: Woe is me over what I lost. So too, when Israel was in Egypt, they were enslaved in mortar and bricks and they were contemptible in the eyes of the Egyptians. When they saw their flags encamped at the sea in the array of a royal army, the Egyptians became sorrowful, saying: Woe are we, what did we send from our land? This is as it is stated: “It was [vayhi] when Pharaoh sent (Exodus 13:17). (Pharaoh shouted woe [vay] is me.)  Rabbi Yonatan said: [This is analogous] to one who had a field capable of producing a kor, and he went and sold it at a minimal price. The purchaser went and excavated springs and planted gardens and orchards there. The seller saw and was sorrowful, saying: Woe is me over what I lost. So too, when Israel was in Egypt, they were enslaved in mortar and bricks and they were contemptible in the eyes of the Egyptians. When they saw their flags encamped at the sea in the array of a royal army, the Egyptians became sorrowful, saying: Woe are we, what did we send from our land? This is as it is stated: “It was [vayhi] when Pharaoh sent” (Exodus 13:17). Rabbi Yosei said: [This is analogous] to one who had chopped-down cedars, and he sold it at a minimal price. The purchaser went and crafted from them trunks, closets, chests, and wagons. The seller saw and was sorrowful, saying: Woe is me over what I lost. So too, when Israel was in Egypt, they were enslaved in mortar and bricks and they were contemptible in the eyes of the Egyptians. When they saw their flags encamped at the sea in the array of a royal army, the Egyptians became sorrowful, saying: Woe are we, what did we send from our land? This is as it is stated: “It was [vayhi] when Pharaoh sent” (Exodus 13:17).</p>

              <p>Another matter: “The son of an Israelite woman…went out” – that is what is written: “A locked garden is my sister, my bride; a locked fountain, a sealed spring” (Song of Songs 4:12). Rabbi Pinḥas said: “A locked fountain” – these are the virgins. “A locked garden” – these are the married women. “A sealed spring” – these are the males. (The meaning is that none engaged in in illicit sexual activity, other than the one Israelite woman mentioned in the verse who had a son with an Egyptian man. )  It is taught in the name of Rabbi Natan: “A locked garden,” “a locked fountain” – these are two forms of intercourse, typical and atypical. (The reference is to vaginal and anal intercourse.)   Another matter: Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: “A locked garden” (Song of Songs 4:12) – because Israel restrained themselves from licentiousness in Egypt, they were delivered from Egypt. As a result, “your branches [shelaḥayikh]” (Song of Songs 4:13) – your being sent out [shiluḥayikh], (The midrash reads the term “your branches [shelaḥayikh]” to mean “your being sent out [shiluḥayikh],” which is the result of what was indicated in the previous verse, namely that they restrained themselves from licentiousness. )  just as it says: “It was when Pharaoh sent out [beshalaḥ]” (Exodus 13:17). Rabbi Huna said in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Sarah our matriarch descended to Egypt and restrained herself from licentiousness, and all the women restrained themselves by her merit. Joseph descended to Egypt and restrained himself from licentiousness, and all of Israel restrained themselves by his merit. (Sarah refrained from licentiousness when Pharaoh had her taken so that he could marry her (see Genesis 12:14–20), and Joseph refrained from licentiousness with the wife of Potifar (see Genesis 39:7–12). In so doing, they bequeathed to their descendants the spiritual fortitude to withstand such temptation. )    Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: The restraint from licentiousness was itself sufficient for Israel to have been redeemed on its account. Rav Huna said in the name of bar Kappara: Due to four matters, Israel was redeemed from Egypt: Because they did not change their name, their language, they did not speak slander, and there was not one among them who was found to be steeped in licentiousness. They did not change their name; Reuben and Simeon descended [to Egypt], and Reuben and Simeon ascended. They did not call Judah Rupa, nor Reuben Luleyani, nor Joseph Leisteis, and nor Benjamin Alexandri.   They did not change their language. There it is written: “The survivor came and told Abram the Hebrew” (Genesis 14:13), and here: “They said: The God of the Hebrews called upon us” (Exodus 5:3); and it is written: “That it is my mouth that is speaking to you” (Genesis 45:12) – in the sacred tongue.  They did not speak slander, as it is stated: “Speak now in the ears of the people, [and they shall ask each man from his neighbor and each woman from her neighbor, silver vessels and gold vessels]” (Exodus 11:2). You find that this matter had been entrusted to them for twelve months, and not one of them informed on another. (The Israelites knew twelve months before the Exodus that they would ask to borrow goods from the Egyptians and that they would then leave Egypt never to return. Nonetheless, none of them told the Egyptians about this plan. )   And there was not one among them who was found to be steeped in licentiousness. Know that it was so, as there was one, and the verse publicized her, as it is stated: “And the name of his mother was Shelomit, daughter of Divri, of the tribe of Dan” (Leviticus 24:11). (The verse mentions the name of this woman who had conceived from an Egyptian man in order to emphasize that no other Israelite women had conceived from Egyptian men. )  “Shelomit” – as Rabbi Levi said: She was very talkative in greetings: Greetings to you, greetings to you. (She would strike up conversations with everyone, including men. )  “Daughter of Divri” – that she caused a matter [davar] to befall her son. “Of the tribe of Dan” – it is a disgrace for him, a disgrace for his family, a disgrace for the tribe from which he emerged.</p>

            <summary>Rabbi Elazar explains that Joseph harbors no resentment towards his brothers, as he did not resent Benjamin for not being present when he was sold (Megillah 16b:3). Additionally, Rabbi Elazar interprets the plural use of &quot;necks&quot; in the verse about Joseph embracing Benjamin as a reference to the destruction of the Temples in Benjamin's territory and the tabernacle in Joseph's territory (Megillah 16b:2).</summary>

              <p>The Gemara elaborates on certain elements in the story of Joseph and his brothers. The verse states with regard to Joseph: “And he fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck [tzavarei] and wept” (Genesis 45:14). The wording of the verse gives rise to a question, as the word tzavarei is plural, meaning necks: How many necks did Benjamin have, such that the verse should use the plural tzavarei rather than the singular tzavar? Rabbi Elazar said: This intimates that Joseph cried over the two Temples that were destined to be in the tribal territory of Benjamin and were destined to be destroyed. The same verse continues: “And Benjamin wept on his neck” (Genesis 45:14); he cried over the tabernacle of Shiloh that was destined to be in the tribal territory of Joseph and was destined to be destroyed.</p>

Previously, they could not speak to him peacefully (Bereishit 37:4) because they could not follow his leadership. Now, when Yosef said, “For you see that it is my mouth that speaks to you,” they accepted his leadership, recognizing the path he opened as essential for preparing for the ultimate redemption. They now understood and appreciated Yosef's role, acknowledging that the exile had begun.

              <p>It seems that Jacob did not travel to Egypt intending to remain there. He planned to see Joseph and immediately return to Canaan for he had no desire to settle there. His only desire was to be in the Promised Land with his offspring with the hope of eventually inheriting it, as God promised. When the brothers came and told him that Joseph was alive and ruling over the Egypt and described Joseph’s great honor and glory as they were instructed to do, “You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that you have seen,” (Gen. 45:13) Jacob then answered, “Enough! My son, Joseph, is still alive.” (Gen. 45:28) Jacob was saying, “I don’t care about Joseph’s position or the greatness of which you speak. Since he is alive, I must go and see him before I die. I will go by myself and return immediately.” But Isaac was in doubt whether God approved of him leaving Canaan and entering the iron cauldron of Egypt, especially since God had refused to allow Isaac to leave Canaan in a time of famine, “Do not go down to Egypt; stay in this land and I will be with you and bless you and to your offspring I will give this land.” (Gen. 26:2-3) He was also afraid that he might die while he was in Egypt. These fears and doubts were in his heart when he arrived at Beersheba. He was not on his way to Egypt when he came there; rather he came to Beersheba because it was a place of prayer and supplication to God. He came to find out what he should do. He offered sacrifices to the God of his father since this place was special to Isaac and God had prevented Isaac from going to Egypt. God answered him in a dream. God calls to him, “Jacob, Jacob.” It is my thought that with this double language, God comes to tell him that the promise that God made was to Jacob the individual and to Jacob, the nation who are also called by this name. God offers two teachings, one to the person and one to the people. Speaking to Jacob, our forefather, he says, “Fear not to go down to Egypt.” That is, “Even though I prevented Isaac, from going to Egypt, I am permitting you to go. Do not think you are any different to me. I was the God of your father and I am the One who says to you, ‘Fear not to go down to Egypt;’” “I am the Lord, I am no different.” The only difference according to the Kabbalists is that Isaac was never allowed to go to Egypt; this was not the case for Jacob. </p>

            <summary>The text discusses the use of the word &quot;neck&quot; in various forms in the context of Joseph embracing Benjamin and weeping over the future destruction of the Temples in their respective territories, with Rashi interpreting the embrace as a reference to the Temple. The bond between Joseph and Benjamin is emphasized as stronger due to their shared mother, and the plural form of &quot;necks&quot; is seen as a reference to the Temple. Benjamin's weeping is linked to the destruction of the Tabernacle in Shiloh, while Joseph's weeping is linked to the future destruction of the Temples.</summary>

              <p>NECK. Scripture employs both the plural and singular forms for the neck. (The singular of neck is tzavvar. Cf. Is. 8:8 and Jer. 28:10; tzavvare is a plural. However, the plural is occasionally also used for the singular when this noun is employed.)  We also find the word for neck spelled with a nun. (Cf. tzavveronayikh (thy neck) in Cant. 4:9.)  However, its alef is never dropped. (According to Weiser. The problem is that there is no alef in tzavveronayikh. Filwarg suggests that in I.E.’s copy of the Bible tzavveronayikh had an alef. Also, Kimchi in his book of roots says that tzavveronayikh is spelled with an alef. Weiser suggests that what I.E. means is that tzavveronayikh should have been written with an alef but for some reason it was dropped.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויפול על צוארי בנימין אחיות, “he fell on the neck of his brother Binyamin.” The verse tells us that Joseph embraced Binyamin and Binyamin embraced his brother Joseph by each one falling on the other’s neck, a customary gesture amongst brothers who wanted to demonstrate their fondness for each other. Solomon refers to such an embrace in Song of Songs 8,1 when he wrote: “if only I could embrace you as I would embrace a brother who has nursed at my mother’s breast.” The intimate relations between brothers of the same mother are also spelled out in the Torah in Deut. 13,7 where the Torah describes a secret seduction to idolatrous practices by someone who is the brother of the second party by the same mother.” Evidently, the Torah considers the bond between two sons of the same mother as stronger than a similar bond by two sons of the same father. The reason our verse refers to צוארי, i.e. “two necks,” is that a person’s “neck” consists of two parts known as עורף and גרון respectively. Jeremiah 2,27 distinguishes between עורף and פנים, the rear of the neck and the part of the neck facing forward. The sides of the neck are also known as צואר. A Midrashic approach to the plural form of the “necks.” Joseph wept when he foresaw that the Temple in Binyamin’s territory would twice be destroyed. The reason that the neck of a person evokes the image of the Temple is that it is the highest part of his body and the Temple was also erected on a mountain. When Binyamin wept, he thought of the destruction of the Tabernacle at Shiloh which was situated in the territory of Joseph (Ephrayim), and which was also slated to be destroyed.</p>

              <p>For the Tabernacle of Shiloh... You might ask: Perhaps this phrase follows its plain meaning, [and Binyomin’s crying was not over the Tabernacle’s destruction]? Rashi’s explanation about Yoseif’s crying is understandable because there it is written צוארֵי, the plural form, rather than צואריו. But here it is written צואריו. Perhaps it follows its plain meaning. Nachalas Yaakov answers: Re’m explained at length [citing Midrash Rabbah 92:12. See] there. Also Matnos Kehunah [on that Midrash] writes that [Chazal’s interpretation is because] צואריו is singular. However, they both overlooked the Gemara in Megillah 16b which also states [as the Midrash Rabbah:] “How many necks did Binyomin have?!” [thus implying that the interpretation is based on the switch between צוארֵי and צואריו]. However, Rashi explains that this line should be deleted from the Gemara’s text because it is normal for Scripture to refer to צואר in the plural form. Accordingly, Re’m’s efforts were in vain [because Rashi states that Scripture’s switching between plural and singular of צואר is not a basis of expounding the word]. Rather, it seems that the [following] change in wording is the basis for the exposition. Regarding the [other] brothers it is merely written that Yoseif wept upon them. But with Binyomin it mentions צואר (neck). Therefore צואר is to be expounded: it hints to the Temple, which is called צוארך, as mentioned above. The reason that two Temples are mentioned for Binyomin and one for Yoseif is because in fact it was so, not because this was learned from plural and singular forms [of the word צואר]. </p>

              <p>It is written (Gen. 45, 22) To each of them he gave changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave … five changes of raiment. Is it possible that that which gave trouble to Joseph's father (Ib. b) proved a stumbling block to Joseph? For Rabba b. Mehasia quoted R. Chama b. Guria, who said in the name of Rab: &quot;On account of two Selaim worth of silk which Jacob bestowed on Joseph in preference to his other sons, the brothers became jealous of him, and brought about the entrance of our ancestors into Egypt.&quot; &quot;This was a hint that from him would descend a man who would wear five royal garments,&quot; said R. Benjamin b. Jepheth, in the name of R. Elazar. Who is he? Mordecai, concerning whom it is written (Est. 8, 15) And Mordecai went out in a royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a cloak of fine linen and purple. (Gen. 45, 14) And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's necks. How many necks had Benjamin? R. Benjamin b. Jepheth, in the name of R. Elazar, said: &quot;He wept for the two Temples, that were destined to be in Benjamin's land and were doomed to destruction.&quot; And Benjamin wept upon his neck; i.e., he wept for the Tabernacle of Shilo, that was designated in Joseph's part of the land, and was destined to be destroyed. (Ib.) And behold, your own eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin. &quot;This means,&quot; said R. Benjamin b. Jepheth in the name of R. Elazar, &quot;that he (Joseph) said to them, 'Just as I have nothing in my heart against Benjamin, who took no part in my sale, so have I nothing against you, who sold me.'&quot; (Ib.) It is my mouth the best things of Egypt? R. Benjamin b. Jepheth, in the name of R. Elazar, explained this: &quot;What I speak with my mouth, I think in my heart.&quot; (Ib. 23) And to his father he sent after this manner with the best things of Egypt. What is the meaning of that speaketh unto you. R. Benjamin b. Jepheth, in the name of R. Elazar, said: &quot;He sent him old wine, which strengthens the minds of old when they drink it.&quot; </p>

              <p>Similarly, the comparative lack of pathos when Moshe and Aharon reunite after many years of separation (Shemot 4:27) (Shemot 4:27.)  reveals a calm and unambivalent relationship. Absent is the falling on the neck and crying that marks the reunion of brothers and of fathers and sons in the book of Bereshit.Bereshit 33:4; Bereshit 45:14 and Bereshit 46:29 (Bereshit 33:4, 45:14 and 46:29.)  The crying and the carrying on that appear in the other stories are a response to feelings of loss and regret at what could have been. In all of those cases, mistakes had been made and opportunities had been missed. And, as is the way of such situations, the feelings of loss could be fully recognized only after the changes that had taken place in the other person had been observed. This, of course, could occur only at the point of reunion. Unlike the stories in Bereshit, the separation of Moshe and Aharon appears to have been preceded by harmony and a lack of complexity. Thus, whatever missed opportunities elapsed on account of their separation resulted from events outside their control. The outcome of all this was Moshe and Aharon’s emotionally uncomplicated reunion. (The lack of complexity revealed in Moshe and Aharon’s reunion could also be due to the lack of previous exposure to each other, Moshe having grown up largely out of his home. At the same time, that doesn’t negate the fact that their reunion also reflects a lack of earlier conflict in comparison to the other stories.) </p>

Rabbi Elazar said: This intimates that Joseph cried over the two Temples that were destined to be in the tribal territory of Benjamin and were destined to be destroyed. The same verse continues: “And Benjamin wept on his neck” (Genesis 45:14); he cried over the tabernacle of Shiloh that was destined to be in the tribal territory of Joseph and was destined to be destroyed.</p>

              <p>And he kissed all his brothers and cried on them and after that etc.... That he saw them terrified when they saw that the dreams came true per his prophesy. And that (they thought) after this maybe Joseph interprets the dream of eleven starts bowing to him as a permanent state, that hashem decreed them all his slaves (in perpetuity). After this they could not speak to him face to face. But he showed them by kissing them and crying as one brother does over another.  They understood that he interpreted his dreams as having already been fulfilled and that he no longer believed he was their master, God Forbid.  And now they spoke to him. </p>

After all, everything that Joseph had said to them up to that point might have been designed only to alleviate the brothers' feeling ashamed of their conduct. It was only after he kissed them and wept over the years they had been separate that the brothers recognised Joseph's truly good character and that he was a true brother that they were able to speak to him naturally. Whereas Joseph's original burst of weeping could have been attributed to his reunion with Benjamin, the latest burst of weeping definitely concerned his reunion with all of them.</p>

              <p>וינשק לכל אחיו ויבך עליהם, “he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them.” He assured them that he not only harbored no ill feelings toward them but that on the contrary, he meant to treat them well.  ואחרי כן דברו אחיו אתו; “after this his brothers talked with him.” Up until this moment he had been speaking and they had not had a chance to talk to him. Now their minds had been put at ease. Tanchuma Vayigash 5 interprets the words וינשק את כל אחיו as meaning that every brother kissed Joseph and wept while doing so. Joseph did not reconcile himself with the brothers until they had wept. This is a lesson for future Jewish generations that G’d will not send the salvation until the Jewish people have wept in remorse for their sins. This is the meaning of Jeremiah 31,9: “They shall come with weeping, and with compassion will I guide them.”</p>

As mentioned previously, although Joseph was a powerful ruler he could quickly become emotional. 5 The brothers’ shock at the discovery that the ruler of the land was none other than Joseph was replaced by their concern that he might take revenge upon them, a worry that had not abated even many years after they had sold him. They knew that if he sought to punish them, justice would be on his side. And only afterward, upon hearing his statement and seeing his tears and emotion as he approached them, their fears were assuaged, and his brothers spoke with him. </p>

              <p>Kiss the son: – as (in the verse) &quot;and he kissed all his brethren&quot; (Gen. 45:15). And (the word) בר is the same as בן; and so &quot;What, my son (בני)? &quot;; and &quot;what, O son (בר) of my womb?&quot; (Prov.xxxi. 2). Or it may be interpreted by &quot;the pure (ברי) of heart&quot; (Ps. 73:1). If its meaning is &quot;son,&quot; this will be its interpretation: Kiss this son whom God has called &quot;son,&quot; as He says (above): Thou art My son. And the command is Kiss, because it is the custom for a servant to kiss the hand of the master. And if its meaning is &quot;pure,&quot; its interpretation is, &quot;What have I to do with you, for I am pure in heart and there is no wickedness in me that ye should come and fight against me? Your duty is to kiss me and to confess that I am king by the command of God.&quot; And בר may also be fittingly interpreted from (the verse) &quot;Choose (ברו) you a man for you&quot; (1 Sam. 17:8), upon the analogy of &quot;Saul the chosen of the Lord&quot; (2 Sam. 21:6).</p>

              <p>.והקול נשמע בית פרעה , “the news was heard in the palace of Pharaoh.” All of Egypt was already aware that Joseph had prominent brothers as he had told them about it. Now, when they heard that the brothers had arrived this was very pleasing to the Egyptians seeing that originally they had felt ashamed to be ruled by a onetime slave. Now that Joseph had been able to establish that he never had been born a slave but was a member of a highly respected family they felt honoured. Tanchuma Vayigash 5 takes an entirely different view of the meaning of the words “a voice was heard in the house of Pharaoh.” According to this Midrash as soon as the brothers recognised Joseph they wanted to kill him. An angel descended and scattered them to the four corners of his mansion. At that moment Yehudah raised his voice in a thundering tone so that all the walls in the public squares of Egypt collapsed; all pregnant women immediately had miscarriages from the sound of that voice. Joseph fell off his throne and the faces of the guards who surrounded Joseph’s throne turned gray in consternation. Tanchuma bases himself on Job 4,10: “The lion may roar, the cub may howl, but the teeth of the king of beasts are broken.” At any rate, the sound that was heard in the house of Pharaoh was that of Yehudah’s roaring like a lion.</p>

Therefore, they were pleased to hear that Joseph in fact came from a distinguished family and had originally been a free man.</p>

              <p>When at last they recognized him, they sought to kill him. An angel descended and scattered them to the four corners of the room. At that moment, Judah screamed so loudly that all the walls of Egypt toppled, all the animals of Egypt gave birth prematurely, and Joseph and Pharaoh tumbled from their thrones. Their teeth fell out, and the heads of the powerful men standing at Joseph’s side were reversed and remained so until their deaths, as it is said: The lion roareth, and the fierce lion howleth—and the teeth of the young lions are broken (Job 4:10). Hence Scripture says: The voice thereof was heard in Pharaoh’s house (Gen. 45:16). The voice here refers to the voice of Judah, as it is said: Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah (Deut. 33:7).</p>

              <p>&quot;Until the appointed time, his word had not yet come. Rabbi Chiya bar Abba and the rabbis disagreed. One said, 'Until Joseph's word comes to pass,' while the other said, 'Until the word of the Holy One, blessed be He, comes to pass, which Joseph said to the chief butler (Genesis 40:14), &quot;But think of me when it is well with you.&quot; The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &quot;You spoke truthfully; you will live another two years,&quot; as it says (Genesis 41:1), &quot;After two years of time.&quot; Therefore, &quot;Until the appointed time, his word had not yet come.&quot; The king sent and released him, and he was put in charge of his household. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan ben Saul, &quot;Joseph said to them, 'What do you think, that the Holy One, blessed be He, would not let me taste of what my grandfather Jacob blessed, saying (Genesis 27:29), &quot;Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you&quot;? Therefore, as it says (Genesis 41:40), 'And Joseph ruled over the land.' 'Put him in charge of his household, to bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his elders wisdom' (Psalms 105:21-22).&quot; Another explanation is that his rulership is alluded to in the verse (Genesis 41:45), &quot;Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah and gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potiphera.&quot; And he ruled over his people, and the Egyptians strengthened him. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, &quot;What is this matter comparable to? It is like two officials who are in the palace, one is great and the other is also great, but one is greater than the other. It is also like two mighty warriors, one is mighty and the other is also mighty, but one is mightier than the other. Their hearts were turned against him.&quot; Rabbi Chiya said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan, and Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Yehozadak, &quot;Yesterday (Genesis 45:16), 'The voice was heard,' etc., and Pharaoh was pleased with him. Now their hearts were turned against him (Exodus 1:8), 'And there arose a new king over Egypt.'&quot;</p>

              <p>One who possesses intellect in other areas of wisdom is called a bas – benos in the plural – because the main result of studying the other areas of wisdom is not to build the spiritual world but rather to enhance the structure of Torah. The other sciences are intertwined with [the application of] many Torah laws. A proof of this may be found in Midrash Rabbah, parasha 90: [When Scripture states]: “Benos saw her and acclaimed her;” (Song of Songs 6:9.)  it is referring to the tribes [of Israel], as it states: “[Their] fame was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying: Joseph’s brothers have come.” (Gen. 45:16.)  [When the former verse continues], “Queens and concubines praised her,” it is referring to Joseph, [as it states]: “Pharaoh said to his servants: Can we find such a one as this? (Gen. 41:38.)  “</p>

              <p>This is [consistent with] the wording of the verse, “Benos [daughters] of kings are with your precious ones; the shegal,” etc. (Psalms 45:10.)  It was previously explained [in chapter 5], the exegesis of the Sages of blessed memory in Tractate Rosh Hashanah 4a that [“daughters of kings”] refers to those who diligently study the Torah with an intense love. The Torah helps those who reach such a level to understand the other types of wisdom and thus learn those areas of Torah that require [secular knowledge] to fully comprehend them. “Daughters of kings” refer to the various forms of knowledge possessed by the kings of the nations of the world. “Are with your precious ones,” mean that the nations of the world, will hold you in high regard [as “precious”], for he who is learned in Torah and is also wise in secular knowledge causes the Torah’s to be held in higher regard – that the Torah is the main structure of the world.

            <summary>In Genesis 45:17, Ibn Ezra explains that the word &quot;ta'anu&quot; means &quot;load&quot; and connects it to &quot;meto'ane,&quot; which means &quot;thrust through,&quot; while Sforno interprets the verse as referring to the purpose of taking Jacob and his family to Egypt. Or HaChaim notes that Pharaoh's command to &quot;do this&quot; refers to needing permission to take wagons for transporting their families, and Radak explains that &quot;beasts&quot; is a collective term. Tur HaArokh clarifies that Pharaoh meant the brothers should prod the beasts pulling the wagons to proceed quickly. Rav Hirsch delves into the meanings of various Hebrew words related to animals and foolishness, while Rashi simply interprets &quot;load your beasts&quot; as meaning to load them with grain. Lastly, Steinsaltz notes that Pharaoh agreed to the plan of loading the animals with grain to bring to Canaan, showing trust in Joseph's judgment, and Tze'enah Ure'enah explains that Pharaoh ordered the brothers to send grain to Canaan and bring Jacob and his family to Egypt.</summary>

(I.E. renders this, laden with wounds of the sword (Krinsky). It is noteworthy that in Isaiah, I.E. says that it is farfetched to connect ta’anu to meto’ane; therefore he connects meto’ane with an Arabic word meaning pierced.) </p>

Accordingly, Joseph urged his brothers to spur on their beasts of burden by means of the דרבן, a spur or goad in order that the good news of his survival should reach his father sooner. Rabbi Saadyah gaon also translated the word in this fashion into Arabic.</p>

Wir haben für Weisheit kaum so viele Namen als für Torheit, vielleicht, weil die Narrheit mannigfaltiger und buntscheckiger ist: סכל ,אויל ,פתי ,כסיל ,בער. Unter den verschiedenen Bedeutungen des בער ist wohl jedenfalls &quot;Brennen&quot; die ursprüngliche. Denn lautverwandt damit heißt באר: aus der Dunkelheit ans Licht treten, daher בְאֵר: der lebendige Brunnen, Wasser aus der Tiefe, und בַאֵר: klar machen, בהר: leuchten, gesteigert: בער brennen.

              <p>In welcher Beziehung heißt das Tier: חיה ?בעיר heißt es, insofern es das Leben repräsentiert im Gegensatz zur Pflanzenwelt, בהמה bezeichnet die dem Menschen sich als במה (rad. בהם :בום) als &quot;Piedestal&quot; seiner Menschengröße unterordnende Tierart; (vergl. auch die Verwandtschaft von בהם mit פעם, auf etwas anschlagen, auftreten, stoßen; Schritt und Amboss). בעיר heißt das Tier nach seinem instinktiven Charakter. Wir haben die Betrachtung des Begriffes חטא, dessen Verwandtschaft mit חתה, und demgemäß הטא &quot;als ein absichtsloses Hinausfallen aus dem &quot;göttlichen Feuer sowie כפרה als ein Wiederhingeben an das אשדת als לחם אשה ד׳, zu erkennen geglaubt. (Siehe zu Kap. 39, 9.) Ist dies kein Traum, so würde die im Menschen waltende göttliche Kraft, der der Mensch sich frei hingeben soll und sich ihr daher auch muss entziehen können, sich als &quot;Feuer&quot; darstellen. Es gibt aber auch lebendige Wesen, die sich dem göttlichen Willen nicht entziehen können, in welchen jede Regung und jede Tätigkeit ein willenloses Produkt des in sie gehauchten göttlichen Feuers ist, deren Lebenstätigkeit somit ein &quot;Brennen&quot; ist. So lange diese Feuerkraft in ihnen lebt, können sie sich ihr nicht entziehen, und בעיר wäre somit die prägnanteste Bezeichnung des Tieres nach seiner unfreien, instinktiven Natur. So wird Schmot 22, 4 jede naturgemäße, das fremde Eigentum gefährdende Tätigkeit des Tieres, שן ורגל, hinsichtlich deren es מועד מתחלתו ist, für deren Leitung und Wahrung daher die Intelligenz des Eigentümers volle Verantwortung trägt, charakteristisch durch בער und das Tier als בעיר bezeichnet.</p>

Der סָכָל hat diese subjektive Kraft; allein er bleibt bei ihr stehen, er bildet subjektive Vorstellungen, Begriffe und Urteile, ohne ihnen die objektive Wirklichkeit zu Grunde zu legen, und ohne sie an der Wirklichkeit zu berichtigen. סכל ist somit die missbräuchliche Anwendung des שכל.

What Pharaoh meant was that the brothers should prod the beasts pulling the wagons to proceed with all possible speed.

              <p>There are three types of forbidden fat for which one is liable for kerat: the fat on the digestive organs, on both kidneys, and on the flanks. The fat-tail, by contrast, is permitted to be eaten. (The Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De'ah 64:5) states that one must remove the fatty portion on the inner side.)  It is called fat only with regard to the sacrifices, just as the kidneys and the large lobe of the liver are referred to as &quot;fat&quot; with regard to the sacrifices. (Chulin 117a interprets Leviticus 3:16: &quot;All of the cheilev to God&quot; as referring to the portions of the animal offered on the altar. These include the kidneys and the lobe of the liver although they are not &quot;fat&quot; (see Hilchot Maaseh HaKorbanot 1:18). Instead, the intent of term cheilev in the verse is &quot;choice portions.&quot;)  Similarly, we find the expressions (Genesis 45:18; Deuteronomy 32:14.)  &quot;the fat of the land,&quot; and &quot;wheat as fat as kidneys&quot; [where the intent is not &quot;fat,&quot;] but &quot;choice.&quot; Since these entities are being raised up from the sacrifice to be consumed with fire for God, they are called &quot;the fat,&quot; i.e., the choice portion, for there is nothing more choice than the portion consumed with fire for God. For this reason, with regard to terumat ma'aser (The tenth of the tithe which the Levites who receive the tithe must separate and give the priests.)  [Numbers 18:30] states: &quot;When you raise up its fat from it.&quot; (Here also the intent of the term cheilev is &quot;choice portions.&quot;) </p>

            <summary>Ramban explains that the fat (cheilev) is separate from the meat, while shuman is intertwined with the meat; the fat tail contains shuman, not cheilev, and doctors have confirmed this. He refutes the Karaites' prohibition of eating the fat of the tail, stating that only fat that falls under the term cheilev is forbidden. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra and Gaon Rav Saadia interpret the text differently, but Ramban supports the tradition that the tail is not cheilev. Ibn Ezra's argument that cheilev of common food cattle is not forbidden is more harmful than the Karaites' stance. The Rabbis' interpretation that only certain fats are forbidden is considered valid. In another commentary, it is explained that the Egyptians' wealth was drained but hidden treasures remained. In Mishnah, the term cheilev is translated as &quot;hebe&quot; in Targum. In Deuteronomy, Moses lists high-quality species, comparing it to eating the fat of the land.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>CHELBO’ (THE FAT THEREOF) ‘HA’ALYAH TH’MIMAH’ (THE FAT TAIL ENTIRE). The term cheilev (fat) in the Sacred Language indicates that part of the fat which is separate from the meat and not joined to it. Shuman, on the other hand, is that fat which is intertwined with the meat and cannot be separated from it, something like that which Scripture states: ‘Vayishman Yeshurun’ (But Jeshurun waxed fat); (Deuteronomy 32:15.)  so they did eat, and were filled ‘vayashminu’ (and became fat); (Nehemiah 9:25.)  ‘hashmein’ (make fat) the heart of this people; (Isaiah 6:10.)  and my flesh is lean ‘mishamen’ (and hath no fatness); (Psalms 109:24.)  and it shall be rich ‘v’shamein’ (and fat); (Isaiah 30:23.)  my soul is satisfied as with marrow ‘vadeshen’ (and fatness), (Psalms 63:6. It should be noted that this verse does not contain the root shuman, but deshen. We must assume then that Ramban considered them equivalent terms. This is strengthened by an examination of the Hebrew wording of the verse: ‘k’mo cheilev vadeshen tisba nafshi.’ Now deshen is thus in parallelism to cheilev; hence deshen must here be understood as shuman, as explained above.)  and similarly in all places. But cheilev is the fat which is separate from the meat and covered by a membrane, and is easily peeled off. The Hebrew language never interchanges these terms [cheilev and shuman] in any place. Thus we say, basar shamen (fat meat), but not basar cheilev [since cheilev, as explained, is the fat which is separate and distinguished from the meat]. Similarly in languages of other nations these terms are separate. The term cheilev is sometimes used metaphorically, as is written, when ye set apart ‘chelbo’ (the best thereof) from it, (Numbers 18:30.)  since the good part of the produce which is taken up [to be given to the priest], Scripture figuratively calls cheilev, just as the cheilev is set apart in the offerings. ‘Cheilev kilyoth’ (the kidney-fat) of wheat (Deuteronomy 32:14.)  — Scripture here compares wheat to the kidneys and the fat therein, just as it states, and of the blood of the grape thou drankest foaming wine, (Deuteronomy 32:14.)  although wine is not blood [hence we must conclude that Scripture only uses these terms figuratively]. And ye shall eat the ‘cheilev’ (fat) of the land (Genesis 45:18.)  means that they shall eat the best of the bullocks, sheep, and goats and all animals. Such is the usage of this figure of speech. Now the tail does not contain any cheilev at all, (Having established the premise that the term cheilev has a figurative meaning, Ramban now proceeds to his main theme here: that the tail of the animal contains no cheilev [which is the term for the fat which is forbidden to be eaten] at all, but rather it contains shuman [which is the fatty substance contained in the meat which cannot be separated from it, and is permitted to be eaten]. At the end of this lengthy discussion it will be made clear that Ramban’s intention is to refute a major contention of the Karaites, who prohibited the eating of the fat of the tail, while the true tradition of the Rabbis permits it to be eaten. See further, Note 277.)  but rather has in it shuman (fat) which is not separate from the meat thereof, just as there is in every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder. (Ezekiel 24:4.)  This is confirmed by doctors who in their studies of nature have established the fact that cheilev [fat which is separate from the meat], is never to be found [in the animal] near the hide, nor in a limb which is always in movement [such as the tail]. The doctors have further said that the nature of shuman found in the ribs, sides and tail, which is not separate from the meat, is warm and moist, whilst that fat which can be separated from the meat, such as that which is upon the kidneys, is cold and moist, thick and coarse; it is difficult for the stomach to digest it fully, and it easily spoils; it also increases the white fluid (The ancients believed that a person’s physical and mental constitution is determined by the proper balance of the four bodily fluids which exist in every man. These are “the four humors” — the red, the white, the green, and the black — which vary constantly in man and determine his state of health and disposition at any given moment. Since the eating of cheilev increases the white fluid beyond the proper proportion, it affects the health of the person adversely.)  and constipates. If so, the verse stating, Eat ye not any ‘cheilev’ (fat) nor blood, (Further, Verse 17.)  does not include the shuman (fat) which is upon the tail, for that is not cheilev by name or nature. If all fat were to come under the term cheilev, then all fat in an animal — on the shoulders and sides — would not be allowed to be eaten! For Scripture does not say: “All fat which is offered unto G-d ye shall not eat” [so that you would include in this prohibition the fat of the tail, since it is offered as a fire-offering on the altar]. Rather, He states that “the cheilev (fat) of all cattle which are brought as offerings upon the altar, must not be eaten.” (Ramban’s intent is to refer to the following verse: For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men present an offering unto the Eternal, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people (further, 7:25). Now the verse does not state “For whosoever eateth the fat which men present as an offering …” [so that you could argue, since the tail and the fat thereon are offered upon the altar, therefore they may not be eaten]. Rather, the verse states, For whosoever eateth the fat ‘of the beast’ of which men present an offering …, thus teaching that the cheilev of any animal which can be brought as an offering — whether it is actually brought as a hallowed offering or is eaten as common food — is forbidden to be eaten. Thus the verse establishes that cheilev of the ox, sheep, and goat [from which offerings can be brought] is forbidden to be eaten, whether it be an offering or common food. See further, Note 277.)  It is indeed impossible to say that He prohibited all these fats of the animal which are offered on the altar, for if so the kidneys and the lobe above the liver would be forbidden to be eaten [since they are offered on the altar]! (Verses: 4 and 10, etc. And yet even the Karaites do not forbid these foods!)  Rather, whatever fat comes under the term cheilev [as explained above], is forbidden to be eaten, even though it is not brought on the altar, such as the fat on the spleen; and that which is not called cheilev may be eaten even though it is offered on the altar, such as the [fat of the] kidneys and the lobe above the liver, and similarly also that of the tail [which even though it is brought on the altar, may be eaten because it is shuman and not cheilev]. Similarly, Scripture states in connection with the command of the installation of the priests, And thou shalt take of the ram ‘ha’cheilev’ (the fat) and the tail; (Exodus 29:22. This shows that the fat of the tail is not called cheilev.)  and at the performance thereof it is written, And he took the fat, and the tail, (Further, 8:25.)  for the tail is not cheilev. Now this verse [before us] which states ‘chelbo ha’alyah th’mimah’, means that he shall offer up [from the peace-offerings] the fat thereof, together with the entire fat tail, meaning that when he removes the “entire fat tail” until the rump-bone, he must take with it much fat that is attached to it on the inside. Thus the Rabbis have said in Torath Kohanim: (Torath Kohanim, Vayikra 19:2.)  “This tells us that he must also take the fat near the tail, which is the fat between the sinews [in the loins].” In my opinion the purport of this verse is also like that of the other verse: And he shall offer of it all ‘chelbo’ (the fat thereof): ‘ha’alyah’ (the fat tail), and the fat that covereth the inwards. (Further, 7:3.)  So here likewise He says, And He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace-offerings all the fat thereof. In these two verses [just quoted], He first makes a general statement, that [the priest] should offer all the fat thereof, and then He mentions in detail all the parts that he should offer [namely, the fat tail entire … and the fat that covereth the inwards … and the two kidneys, and the fat upon them … and the lobe above the liver …]. Now not everything that is mentioned here is cheilev [fat forbidden to be eaten], for the two kidneys [themselves] and the lobe above the liver are not at all included in the term cheilev. Thus He stated in the section of Bayom Ha’shemini: (“On the Eighth Day” of Initiation. It is the third section in this Book of Vayikra, known as Shemini.)  And ‘ha’cheilev’ (the fat), and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver, (Further, 9:10. The use of the separate terms there thus clearly proves that not everything mentioned is cheilev; hence we may also say that the alyah mentioned is not cheilev.)  mentioning the cheilev by itself and then the other inwards by themselves, even as He said, And thou shalt take of the ram ‘ha’cheilev’ and the tail. (Exodus 29:22. This shows that the fat of the tail is not called cheilev.)  If so, the reason why the tail is offered [on the altar] is not because it is included here in Verse 9] in the term chelbo. Rather, He states here that the priest should burn [on the altar] from the peace-offerings all the fat thereof, and then He proceeds to explain all the inwards [which he should offer], some being cheilev and some not. The meaning of the verse in the case of the sin-offering stating, And all the fat thereof he shall take away, as ‘cheilev’ (the fat) is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings, (Ibid., 4:31.)  is not to refer only to that which is strictly speaking cheilev, for if that were so, the kidneys and the lobe on the liver [which are not cheilev] would not be offered up in the case of the sin-offering. Rather, the intention of the verse is that he is to take away the cheilev together with all the things that are removed from the peace-offerings. Similarly, [the verse stating in the case of the she-lamb brought as a sin-offering], And all the fat thereof shall he take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace-offerings, (Ibid., Verse 35.)  means that he is to take away as he had done in the case of the peace-offerings, meaning everything that he had taken away there, including the tail with its fat. Similarly, And they put the ‘chalavim’ (fats) upon the breasts, and he caused the fats to ascend in fumes (Ibid., 9:20.)  means [the cheilev] together with all that is removed from them. I have had to discuss this point at length in order to shut up the mouths of the Sadducees, (So also in Ibn Ezra here. The “Sadducees,” strictly speaking, were a sect during the Second Temple that denied the authority of the oral tradition. The name Sadducee, however, became a synonym for all those who denied Talmudic authority. The reference here is definitely to the Karaites — a sect which appeared in the Gaonic period (760 Common Era) which rejected the authority of the Oral Law, and based itself on individual interpretation of the Torah. A major contention of theirs (based upon the present verse) was that the tail is forbidden to be eaten since it is here called cheilev. See also Maimonides who writes: “the heretics who here in the Orient are called Karaites” (“The Commandments,” Vol. I, p. 160).)  may their name be erased [from memory], for in matters of Torah it has been said, Answer a fool according to his folly, (Proverbs 26:5. Ramban’s allusion [in his words “for in matters of Torah it has been said, Answer … “] is to a point the Sages have made regarding an obvious contradiction in the Book of Proverbs. In Verse 4 there it states, Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him, and immediately in the following verse it states, Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes. The Sages explained that there is no contradiction: “in matters of Torah answer him, but in other matters do not” (Shabbath 30b). It is to this principle that Ramban alludes in writing, “for in matters of Torah it has been said … ”)  and the Rabbis have also said, (Aboth 2:14.)  “Be diligent in learning Torah, in order to (“In order to.” In our standards text of the Mishnah: “and know what to.”)  be able to answer the unbeliever.” The Gaon Rav Saadia (See in Exodus, Vol. II, p. 99, Note 230.)  explained it to them, (I.e., the Karaites. “Saadia persisted in fighting Karaism with literary weapons; and throughout his checkered life he continued to combat its apostles with unrelenting vigor, so that he became the most dreaded and most hated opponent of the [Karaite] sect down to our own times” (H. Malter, “Saadia Gaon,” p. 262).)  by saying that chelbo ha’alyah is missing a connective vav, which would make it: chelbo veha’alyah — (its fat “and” the tail) [thus clearly meaning that the tail is not included in the cheilev]. But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra refuted Rav Saadia Gaon by saying [that “from a grammatical point of view this could not be possible, for if so] it should have said chelbo elyato (In other words, since chelbo comes with the pronominal suffix [meaning “its fat”], the word ha’alyah (the tail) should likewise have come in that form: elyato (“its tail”).)  or hacheilev ha’alyah.” (Or since v’ha’alyah (according to Saadia Gaon’s interpretation) comes without the pronominal suffix, the word chelbo should also not have it, making it — hacheilev v’ha’alyah. Thus Ibn Ezra is saying that the Karaite interpretation still stands, for since it is written chelbo ha’alyah it would appear that ha’alyah is in apposition to chelbo, thus explaining: “What is chelbo? Ha’alyah.” — Ramban, however, will refute this argument of Ibn Ezra, bringing proof from another verse in Scripture which mentions two nouns together, and yet one is written with a pronominal suffix and the other without. Thus Saadia Gaon’s refutation of the Karaite interpretation is valid, and the tradition that the tail is not cheilev is confirmed. See, however, further in text where Ramban comments on the Gaon’s interpretation.)  But Ibn Ezra’s refutation is not valid, for we find [Scripture stating], And all Israel and their elders, and officers, and their judges! (Joshua 8:33. Here u’zkeinav (and their elders) comes with a pronominal suffix, and v’shotrim (and officers) does not. In our case too it is therefore correct to say, as Saadia Gaon does, that chelbo ha’alyah means chelbo v’ha’alyah, and the two nouns do not stand in apposition to each other, thus proving that the alyah is not cheilev.)  I will yet mention (Further, 7:25.)  a great mistake which Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra made in his arguments with them [i.e., the Karaites], in which he spoke more wrongly than they. (Ramban’s intent is to Ibn Ezra’s statement there that cheilev of a cattle slaughtered as common food is not forbidden to be eaten (see above Note 266). That opinion is more harmful than what the Karaite have said. For in abstaining from eating the fat of the tail no infringement of the Torah is incurred, whilst in eating of the cheilev of cattle slaughtered as common food, one violates a prohibition of the Torah!)  However, the Gaon’s interpretation is not correct, (In other words, Ibn Ezra’s argument against the Gaon’s interpretation is surely not valid, as explained above. Yet the Gaon’s interpretation is also not persuasive, since his explanation is dependent upon a missing connective vav, making the word ha’alyah — v’ha’alyah (“and” the tail). Such an interpretation is not sufficiently convincing to base thereon the permission to eat the tail.)  and surely it is not an argument sufficiently persuasive to permit the eating [of the tail because of it]. But the interpretation which our Rabbis advanced (Chullin 117a.)  on the verse, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat, (Further, 7:23.)  that He prohibited only [that kind of fat like] the fat of the ox which is common to all [i.e., the sheep and the goat, thus excepting the fat of the tail of the sheep, which is not found in the ox], that is a proper interpretation [from which we may clearly know that the tail is permitted to be eaten]! But in order not to give contestants an occasion to dispute [the tradition of the Rabbis], we have had to bring the [other] proofs and arguments which we have written.</p>

This is beloved, as it is stated, &quot;And the children of Israel carried Jacob, their father,&quot; and afterward, &quot;and their little ones and their wives&quot; (Exodus 46:5).</p>

            <summary>Ramban explains that returning to God means doing so with all one's heart and soul, accepting and following all His commands for oneself and future generations, as seen in the redemption from Babylon. Rashi clarifies that the term &quot;ונצלתם&quot; in Exodus 3:22 should be understood in the passive voice, as in other biblical examples. Radak suggests that the phrase &quot;לך לך&quot; in Genesis 12:1 is a common expression without special significance, similar to other instances in the Bible. Additionally, Radak notes that the phrase &quot;לך לך&quot; is frequently used in the Bible, as seen in various verses including Genesis 22:2. Rashi explains that the term &quot;ונמלתם&quot; in Genesis 17:11 is not a Niphal form but rather a regular verb form with an added נ to the root.</summary>

                <h4>Radak on Genesis 12:1:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>ויאמר ה' אל אברם לך לך מארצך וממולדתך ומבית אביך אל הארץ אשר אראך, in this instance the word ויאמר refers to something G’d had already said to Avram before he had even moved away from Ur Casdim, a move he made at the command of G’d. We know this from Genesis 15,7 where G’d reminds him that “I am the Lord Who has taken you out of Ur Casdim.” It is possible that G’d repeated this directive once more while Avram was in Charan. As to the meaning of the word lecha, i.e. “for your own good,” this does not have any special significance, being a commonly used figure of speech. One example would be Exodus 18,27 וילך לו where Yitro’s return to Midian is described in a similar way, and no one suggests that he did so “for his own good.” Another such example is found in Jeremiah 5,5 אלכה לי, “I am going,” where no one suggests that Jeremiah had ulterior motives in going to the wealthy people to speak to them in the belief that they knew the ways of the Lord. Still other examples of a similar construction are found in Numbers 22,34 אשובה לי or in Genesis 45,19 קחו לכם.</p>

              <p>ולך לך, this phraseology is quite common. We have encountered it in 12,1, in Jeremiah 5,5, in Exodus 18,27 as well as in Numbers 22,34 and again in Genesis 45,19. There are more such examples.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND THOU SHALT RETURN UNTO THE ETERNAL THY G-D, AND HEARKEN TO HIS VOICE ACCORDING TO ALL THAT I COMMAND THEE THIS DAY, THOU AND THY CHILDREN. The meaning thereof is that you will return with all thy heart, and with all thy soul (In Verse 2 before us.)  and you will take it upon yourself and upon your children throughout their generations to do according to all that I command thee this day, just as they did at the second redemption [i.e., the redemption from Babylon], as it is written, and they entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in G-d’s law, which was given by Moses the servant of G-d, and to observe and do all the commandments of the Eternal our G-d, and His ordinances and His statutes. (Nehemiah 10:30.)  Or it may be that the expression that I command thee this day, thou and thy children is like “command you — to you and to your children,” (The word thou is gramatically difficult, because the verse begins with the accusative thee, and follows with the nominative thou. Ramban offers two explanations: First, that the verse contains two separate thoughts: that you will return to G-d, and that you will accept upon yourself and your children all that He commands us. Second, that the nominative thou is equivalent to the accusative thee [“to you”], and the verse is thus expressing a single thought: “that I command thee this day — to you and to your children.” Ramban proceeds to cite Scriptural examples of similar usage — a nominative in place of an accusative.)  similar to the expression ‘v’atah tzuveitha’ (Genesis 45:19. Here, too, the nominative v’atah (and you) is to be understood as lecha (“and to you”).)  [meaning lecha tzuveithi — “to you I ordered that the command be given”]. So also, and they dealt ill ‘othanu’ (Above, 26:6. Here likewise the literal meaning of othanu is “us,” but Ramban interprets it in the context of the verse as if it means “to us.”)  means lanu (“to us”). (So also in the verse before us, atah (you) means lecha (to you).)  And in my opinion there is in this matter a great secret; for it alludes to that which the Rabbis said, (Yebamoth 62a.)  “The son of David [i.e., the Messiah] will not come until all souls in the guf (Here understood as “a storehouse of souls in heaven.” Ramban’s concept is that the final redemption will come when all souls will have been purified and no longer in need of a sojourn on earth. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 479.)  are exhausted.” I have already spoken of this matter. (See Genesis 1:26 (Vol. I, p. 479).) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>ונצלתם render it as the Targum does: and ye shall empty out Egypt. Similar are: (Exodus 12:36) “And they emptied out (וינצלו) Egypt”; (Exodus 33:6) “And the children of Israel stripped themselves (ויתנצלו) of their ornaments” The נ in it is a root-letter. Menachem ben Seruk placed it (this word ויתנצלו) in section צ (taking the root as צל not as נצל) together with, (Genesis 31:9) “And God took away (ויצל) your father’s cattle”, and with, (Genesis 31:16) “which God hath taken away (הציל) from our father”, but his view cannot be sustained. For if the נ is not a root-letter, then seeing that it (the word ונצלתם) is vowelled with Chirik, it cannot be used in the sense of “and ye shall do something” (the active voice, which is required here since את מצרים can only be the object of the verb), but in the sense of “and ye shall have something done to you” (the passive — “Niphal”), as (Deuteronomy 28:63) “And ye shall be plucked up (וְנִסַּחְתֶּם) from off your land”; (Leviticus 26:25) “and ye shall be given (וְנִתַּתֶּם) into the hand of the enemy”; (Leviticus 17) “And ye shall be smitten (וְנִגַּפְתָּם) before your enemies”; (Ezekiel 22:21) “And ye shall be melted (וְנִתַּכְתָּם) in the midst thereof”; (Jeremiah 7:10) “And ye say, נִצַּלְנוּ” — which expresses the idea “we have had something done to us” (the Niphal: we have been delivered). Then again, every נ which sometimes appears in a word and sometimes is omitted, as e. g. the נ of נוגף and נושא and נותן and נושך, when the word expresses the sense “and ye shall do something” (the Kal), it is pointed with vocal Sheva (חטף a “snatched” sound), as, for instance, (Genesis 45:19) “and ye shall bear (וּנְשָׂאתָם) your father”; (Numbers 32:29) “And ye shall give (וּנְתַתֶּם) them the land of Gilead”; (Genesis 17:11) “And ye shall circumcise (וּנְמַלְתֶּם) the flesh of your foreskin”. Consequently I am of the opinion that this letter נ which is vowelled with a Chirik is one of the root letters, and the grammatical form of the noun of the same root is נִצּוּל which is of the strong (dageshed) forms, just as דִּבּוּר and כִּפּוּר and לִמּוּד. When, in the case of verbs formed from these roots one expresses the idea of “and ye shall do something” (active voice) the נ has the vowel Chirik (i. e. it is the Piel conjugation), as (Numbers 20:8) “And ye shall speak (וְדִבַּרְתֶּם) unto the rock”; (Ezekiel 45:20) “And ye shall atone (וְכִּפַּרְתֶּם) for the house”; (Deuteronomy 11:19) “And ye shall teach (וְלִמַּדְתָּם) them unto your children”.</p>

              <p>“Joseph gave them wagons” [45:21]. Joseph sent a sign to Jacob that he should believe that it was Joseph. He said to tell Jacob, remember what torah we studied when you accompanied me on the way. You studied with me that it is a very meritorious thing to accompany the guest. When one accompanies the guest, the guest is protected from robbers on the road. Therefore, the Torah commanded to bring a calf as expiation when one finds a person who was killed near a city. The people must kill the calf and must say over the calf, we have not spilled this blood. We have accompanied the guest and gave him bread for provisions. That is why the verse says, “he gave them wagons.” That is to say, he sent Jacob a sign from the calves that Jacob studied when he separated from him. (Rashi, Genesis, 45:27. The comment builds on the connection between wagons [agalot] and calf [egel].) </p>

When Joseph’s brothers came to him and said to him: “Joseph is still alive… his heart was faint [because he did not believe them]” (Genesis 45:26). He remembered at which chapter he left him, and said to himself: I know that it was at the chapter of the beheaded calf [egla arufa] that Joseph left me. He said to them: ‘If you know at what chapter Joseph left me, I will believe you.’ Joseph, too, knew at what chapter he left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons [agalot], as it is stated: “Joseph gave them wagons by Pharaoh’s order” (Genesis 45:21). This is to teach you that everywhere Jacob would settle he would study Torah, just as his fathers would.  At this point, the Torah had not been given, but it is written of Abraham: “[Because Abraham heeded My voice,] and he kept My charge, [My commands, My decrees, and My Torahs]” (Genesis 26:5) – from where did Abraham learn the Torah? Rabban Shimon says: His two kidneys became like two jugs of water and they would gush Torah. From where is it derived that it is so? As it is stated: “Even on nights [my kidneys] instruct me” (Psalms 16:7). Rabbi Levi said: He studied Torah on his own, as it is stated: “The dissembler in his heart shall have his fill from his own ways, and a good man shall be satisfied from himself” (Proverbs 14:14). Rabbi Yonatan Sar HaBira said: Abraham knew even the joining of cooked foods, as it is stated: “Because Abraham heeded…” (Genesis 26:5). (The end of the verse mentions “My Torahs,” in plural, implying both the written and oral Torahs. The oral Torah includes even rabbinic laws, like the joining of cooked foods [eruv tavshilin]. The rabbis forbade cooking on a festival day for Shabbat unless one prepares two cooked items for Shabbat before the festival day (see Beitza 15b).)   How old was Abraham when he recognized his Creator? He recognized his Creator at the age of forty-eight years old. Reish Lakish said: At the age of three years old, as “ekev” is written, the numerical value of ekev, and Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years. (The verse states “because [ekev] Abraham heeded My voice…” The numerical value of the word ekev is one hundred and seventy-two, implying that Abraham heeded God’s voice for one hundred and seventy-two years. )  You learn from this that at age three, he recognized his Creator. He would observe the details of the Torah and would teach his children, as it is stated: “For I have loved him, [so that he will command his children and his household after him and they will observe the way of the Lord]” (Genesis 18:19). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You taught your children in this world, but in the World to Come, I, in My glory, will teach all of you the Torah,’ as it is stated: “All your children will be students of the Lord” (Isaiah 54:13).</p>

                <h4>Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Vayigash 12:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(Gen. 46:28:) NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM UNTO JOSEPH TO TEACH BEFORE HIM. (This interpretation is assumed in the midrash.)  What is the meaning of &lt; TO TEACH BEFORE HIM &gt;? R. Nehemiah said: To establish an academy for him where he would teach Torah so that the tribes might study Torah. (Gen. R. 95:3; Tanh., Gen. 11:11; also Gen. R. 94:3.)  You know that this is so; &lt; for &gt;, when Joseph had left him, Jacob knew at what chapter he had left him because he had taught him. When Joseph's brothers came and said to him (in Gen. 44:26): JOSEPH IS STILL ALIVE &lt; … &gt; HIS HEART GREW FAINT, because he did not believe it, as stated (ibid.): FOR HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM. Jacob recalled at what chapter Joseph had left him. He said to them: Did he give you a sign (Gk.: semeion.)  &lt; indicating &gt; at what chapter Joseph left me? Jacob said in his heart: I know that he left me at the chapter on the heifer ('GLH, i.e., Deut. 21:1-9). He said to them: Say at what chapter he left me, and I will believe you. Joseph also recalled at what chapter he had left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons ('GLH in the singular), as stated (in Gen. 45:21): SO JOSEPH GAVE THEM WAGONS. &lt; This verse is &gt; to teach you that in every place that he went he was busy at Torah, just as his ancestors had been, even though the Torah had not yet been given. Ergo, it is written of Abraham (in Gen. 26:5): AND HE KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS. From where did Abraham learn the Torah? R. Simeon ben Johay says: &lt; His &gt; two kidneys became like two full vessels which spouted forth Torah. And where is it shown? Where it says so (in Ps. 16:17): EVEN IN THE NIGHTS MY KIDNEYS ADMONISH ME. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Jonathan ben Eleazar Ish haBirah: Our father Abraham even knew the eruvim of cooked foods. (See above, 3:14; also 3:1.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): BECAUSE ('QB 'ShR) ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE, &lt; AND KEPT MY CHARGE &gt;…. Now at the age of three Abraham recognized his Creator, as stated (through the first word of this verse): 'QB (with a numerical value of 172). Since all the days of Abraham were one hundred and seventy-five, from here (Gen. 26:5) you learn (by simple subtraction) that at the age of three he had recognized him and that he was even keeping the fine points of Torah. He also taught his children, as stated (in Gen. 18:19): FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &lt; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD, TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE &gt;…. The Holy One said to him: You have taught your children Torah in this world, but in the world to come I in my glory will teach them the Torah, as stated (in Is. 54:13): AND ALL YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE TAUGHT BY THE LORD, AND GREAT SHALL BE YOUR CHILDREN'S PROSPERITY.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>The Talmud Yuma 28 states that Avraham even observed the various rabbinical ordinances such as עירובי תבשילין and עירובי תחומים. [The former involves preparing food for the holiday before the holiday if the Sabbath occurred immediately after the holiday, in order that it would not appear that the holiday was used to prepare for the Sabbath. עירובי תחומים, on the other hand, is a device employed to change the radius of one’s habitat prior to the Sabbath by means of depositing food at the centre of the new radius in order to fulfill duties such as welcoming Torah scholars who did not reach that area prior to the beginning of the Sabbath. Ed.].  In illustrating the fact that our patriarchs taught their children all these aspects of Torah which had not been legislated as yet, they quote Genesis 45,21 in which the Torah refers to the wagons Joseph sent to transport his father Israel down to Egypt. The choice of the word עגלות for such wagons [which is less appropriate than, say, מרכבה, Ed.] is interpreted as Joseph reminding his father that the last subject in their Torah study they had learned prior to his going on his ill-fated mission, was the one called עגלה ערופה, the heifer which needs to be killed in order to atone for a murder committed near a Jewish community when the murderer has not been found. Joseph hinted to his father that during the 22 years he had not seen him he had maintained his custom to study Torah.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND HE KEPT MY CHARGE. Rashi comments: “As a reward that Abraham hearkened to My voice when I tested him. And he kept My charge — these are the precautionary decrees instituted by the Sages, which are intended to make us avoid the violation of Biblical laws, such as Second Degrees of forbidden marriages and certain prohibited acts on the Sabbath. My commandments — these are precepts which, had they not been written in the Torah, were requisite to have been written, such as robbery and murder. My statutes — these are matters against which the evil inclination and the heathen nations argue, such as the prohibitions against eating the swine and the wearing of garments woven of wool and linen, there being no apparent rationale for them except that they are decrees of the King imposed on His subjects. And My laws — the plural is intended to include, [besides the Written Law], the Oral Law as well as those rules given to Moses from Sinai.” [Thus far the words of Rashi.] Now if so, all this interpretation is posited on the opinion that Abraham fulfilled and observed the Torah before it was given on Sinai. This is indeed what the Sages of the Midrash said in connection with the verse, And Joseph gave them ‘agaloth’ (wagons), (Ibid., 45:21. The word agaloth (wagons) may also mean “heifers,” thus suggesting that as a mark of identification to his father, Joseph gave his brothers a reference to the law of the Heifer (Deuteronomy 21:6) which he studied with his father just before he became separated from him. The Midrash referred to is in Bereshith Rabbah 95:2.)  thereby indicating to his father that when he left him they were studying the section dealing with Eglah Arufah. (See Deuteronomy 21:1-9.)  Thus Joseph occupied himself with Torah just as his fathers did. Though the Torah had not yet been given, it is still written of Abraham, And he kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws. (Thus far the Midrash in Bereshith Rabbah, 95:2.)  There the Sages also said (Bereshith Rabbah, ibid.)  that Abraham observed the details of the Torah, which he taught to his children, etc. (To his children, as it is said, For I know him that he will command his children and his household after him, etc. (Above, 18:19.) Bereshith Rabbah, ibid.)  The question presents itself: If it be the case [that the laws of the Torah were observed by our ancestors before the Torah was given on Sinai], how did Jacob erect a pillar (Further, 28:18. This is forbidden in Deuteronomy 16:22.)  and marry two sisters in their lifetime, (Forbidden in Leviticus 18:18.)  and, in the opinion of our Rabbis, four sisters. (According to Bereshith Rabbah 74:11, Bilhah and Zilpah were also daughters of Laban. Thus Jacob married four sisters: Leah, Rachel, Bilhah and Zilpah.)  Also, Amram [Moses’ father] married his aunt, (Exodus 6:20.)  and Moses our teacher erected twelve pillars. (Ibid., 24:4.)  How then was it possible that they should be permissive in matters of Torah which Abraham their ancestor had prohibited on himself, and for which G-d appointed him reward, when he [Abraham] was wont to command his children and his household after him (Above, 18:19.)  to walk in His ways? In the case of Jacob the Sages taught that he observed the Sabbath and established borders for Sabbath distances. (Bereshith Rabbah 79:7.)  In this matter of the Sabbath it is possible though that Jacob observed it because it is equal in importance to the entire Torah since it testifies to the act of Creation. Perhaps then we should say that My charge refers to the Second Degree of marriages which were forbidden to the Sons of Noah; (See Seder Bereshith, Note 222, and Seder Vayishlach, Note 148.)  My commandments applies to robbery and murder; My statutes refers to the laws against eating a limb torn off from a live animal, as well as breeding mixed kinds of cattle or grafting together different species of trees; and My laws refer to civil statutes and the prohibitions against idol worship. The Sons of Noah were commanded concerning all of these matters, and Abraham observed and fulfilled the Will of his Creator, observing even the details and the strictures of their commandments, even as the Sages mentioned: “The tractate of idolatry of our father Abraham contained four hundred chapters.” (Abodah Zarah 14b.)  They further expounded [on the verse referring to Isaac, which says], And he found in that year a hundredfold, (Further, Verse 12.)  that he measured the produce for the purpose of tithing, (Bereshith Rabbah 64:6.)  since the patriarchs were the generous ones of the peoples, (Psalms 47:10.)  giving tithes to the poor or the priests of G-d, such as Shem and Eber and their disciples, just as it is said, And he was a priest of the most high G-d. (Above, 14:18. Reference is to Melchizedek, whom tradition identifies as Shem, the son of Noah. See Ramban, ibid.)  Now it appears to me from a study of the opinions of our Rabbis that Abraham our father learned the entire Torah by Ruach Hakodesh (See Note 90.)  and occupied himself with its study and the reason for its commandments and its secrets, and he observed it in its entirety as “one who is not commanded but nevertheless observes it.” (The concept of “one who is not commanded but observes” is found in the Talmud (Kiddushin 31 a). His reward is less than that of “one who is commanded and observes.” (Ibid.) The reason for it, as explained in Tosafoth, is that he who is commanded to do a certain mitzvah (commandment) is under tension lest he might not properly fulfill it, while he who is not commanded therein has no responsibility in the matter and may leave it at his will. Consequently, his reward is less.)  Furthermore, his observance of the Torah applied only in the Land of Israel, whereas Jacob married two sisters only when outside the Land, (See Leviticus 18:25 where Ramban extends the explanation further by saying that the reason Rachel died as they entered the Land of Israel (35:16-19) was that she was the sister whom Jacob married last.)  and similarly with Amram who married his aunt. For the Commandments are the ordinance of the G-d of the land, (II Kings 17:26.)  even though we have been charged with personal duties in all places. Our Rabbis have already alluded to this secret, and I will yet call your attention to it with the help of G-d. (See Ramban on Leviticus 18:25.)  And the matter of the erection of the pillar [by Jacob and Moses referred to above] was a commandment that was innovated at a certain time, as the Sages expounded from the verse, “Neither shalt thou set up a pillar which the Eternal thy G-d hateth, (Deuteronomy 16:22.)  He hated it although it was pleasing to Him in the days of the ancestors.” (Ibid., Sifre. The reason for the change being that the Canaanites afterward had made it an ordinance of idol worship.)  And with respect to Joseph concerning whom the Sages expounded that he observed the Sabbath even in Egypt, (Bereshith Rabbah 92:4.)  it was because it is equal in importance to all the commandments, constituting, as it does, a testimony to Creatio ex nihilo. (In Hebrew, chiddush (new), thus implying that G-d created a new world out of an absolute void.)  Therefore Joseph would do so in order to teach his children faith in the Creation of the world, to remove from their hearts the false doctrine of idolatry and the opinion of the Egyptians. This then is the intent [of the Sages when speaking of the patriarchs and their children observing the Torah]. In accordance with the literal meaning of Scripture, you may say that My charge means faith in the Deity, implying that Abraham believed in the unique Divine Name and kept vigilant guard over it in his heart, differing thereby with the worshippers of idols, and calling by the name of the Eternal to bring many to His worship. My commandments refers to all that G-d commanded Abraham: Go out of thy land, (Above, 12:1.)  the bringing of his son as a burnt-offering, and the expulsion of the maid-servant and her son. (Ibid., 21:12.)  My statutes refers to walking in the paths of G-d by being gracious and merciful, doing righteousness and judgment, (See Maimonides, “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 11-12 Soncino edit. Positive Commandment 8.)  and commanding his children and his household concerning them. (Above, 18:19.)  And My Laws refers to the circumcision of Abraham himself and his sons and his servants, as well as all Commandments of the Sons of Noah (See Seder Bereshith, Note 222, and Seder Vayishlach, Note 148.)  which constitute their Law.</p>

              <p>מה נצטדק How shall we justify ourselves? — This is a verbal form of צדק. In the same way every root whose first letter is צ when used in the Hithpael or Nithpael takes a ט instead of the ת of the prefix. This, however, is not placed before the first radical letter, but between the first two letters of the root. For example: נצטדק of the root צדק; (Daniel 4:13) “and let it be wet (ויצטבע)” of the root צבע to steep; Joshua 9:4) “and made as if they had been ambassadors (ויצטירו)”, of the same root as ציר in (Proverbs 13:17), ציר אמונים a faithful ambassador”; (Joshua 9:12) “we took our provision (הצטידנו)” of the same root as צדה in (Genesis 45:21) צדה לדרך “provision for the way”. And in the same way, with a root whose first letter is ס or ש, when it is used in the Hithpael, the ת of the prefix separate (i.e. is placed between) the first two letters of the root. For example: (Ecclesiastes 12:5) “and the grasshopper shall drag itself along heavily (ויסתבל)” from the root סבל “to carry a load”; (Daniel 7:8) “I considered (משתכל הוית) the horns”, from the root שכל to reflect on: (Micah 6:16) “for the statutes of Omri are kept (ישתמרו)” from the root שמר to keep; (Isaiah 59:15) “And he that departeth from evil (משתולל) is regarded as a fool”, from the same root as שולל in (Job 12:17) “He leadeth counsellors away (שולל) as though they were fools”; (Exodus 9:17) “Thou treadest down (מסתולל) my people”, from the same root as סלולה in (Jeremiah 18:15) “a way not trodden down (סלולה).”</p>

But the one who interprets it as an expression of mire (רפש) and claims that the “teth” is added to it, as in (Gen. 44:16), “How can we clear ourselves (נצטדק)?” is in great error, because the “teth” is added to a word only in the reflexive voice, and to a word in which there is a radical “zaddi,” but nor in other words. for example, צדק and נצטדק, and like (Lev. 13:44) צרוּע, stricken with “zaraath,” and נצטרע, was stricken with “zaraath.” (Prov. 25: 13), “an emissary (ציר) faithful,” and (Josh. 9:4), “and they went and disguised as ambassadors (ויצטירו)”; (Gen. 45:21) “צֵדָה, provision,” and (Josh. 9:12) “הִצְטַיַדְנוּ, we took... for our provision.”</p>

              <p>Genesis45,22. “he gave to each of them a change of ‎clothes; to Binyamin he gave three hundred silver pieces and ‎five changes of clothes.” Our sags in Megillah 16 ask: ‎‎“is it really possible that Joseph erred in the same way as had his ‎father when he showed Joseph preferential treatment? Was ‎Joseph not aware that by what the Torah describes him as doing ‎for Binyamin, he would arouse the brothers’ jealousy?” They ‎answer that the Torah alluded to the five Royal garments that ‎Mordechai, a descendant of Binyamin would be dressed in as we ‎read in Esther 8,15. Our author, clearly not too enthused with the Talmud’s ‎answer, suggests a different way of understanding the Talmud’s ‎answer. Our sages, understood that Joseph foresaw and hinted to ‎Binyamin that Mordechai, a distant descendant of his brother ‎Binyamin, would play a great part in the miracle of Purim. He ‎intimated that he and Binyamin shared a similar experience, ‎seeing that they were both the sons of the same mother, Rachel. ‎He had attained high rank as a result of someone’s dream ‎‎(Pharaoh’s) and Mordechai also rose to eminence as a result of a ‎dream, as our sages in the Targum on the Book of Esther ‎‎(chapter10) have told us. According to the Targum, on the ‎night when the king could not fall asleep (again), he had been ‎dreaming that Haman wanted to assassinate him. This is why he ‎became angry at Haman and commanded him to dress Mordechai ‎in the Royal robes, and paraded him throughout the capital on ‎the king’s horse. Joseph had been paraded similarly. (41,43) Just ‎as Joseph remained under the rule of Pharaoh at the time, so ‎Mordechai would remain under the rule of Achashverosh. ‎‎(Compare Rashi on 41,40)‎ This is another example of the approach of our sages to the ‎details the Torah has revealed about the lives of our sainted ‎forefathers, i.e. that they always were at pains to perform deeds ‎that foreshadowed future, critical, events in the lives of their ‎descendants. (Our author lists more examples of this theme when ‎relating to Shimon and Levi’s killing the inhabitants of Shechem ‎as being a forerunner of the Hasmoneans in the Chanukkah ‎story). [I will omit the balance of the paragraph as, seeing ‎this portion is also read sometimes on Chanukkah, the author felt ‎compelled to introduce this subject here, although those events ‎occurred in post-biblical times. It is somewhat forced, as it ‎requires us to see in Levi rather than Shimon, the principal ‎activist, otherwise the connection with the Hasmoneans who ‎were priests is too tenuous. Ed.]‎</p>

The internal essence, or pnimius, remains constant, but the external garments change according to a person's spiritual level, as it says, &quot;they remove one form and wear a different form.&quot; The benefit of going through exile is to rectify these external garments. When Bnei Yisrael left Mitzrayim, they took silver, gold, and clothing, with Rashi explaining that the clothing was most prized (Shmot 12:35). Yosef showed the way to 'dress' in different spiritual garments, as he did in Mitzrayim, where his brothers did not recognize his righteousness. Chazal explained that Yosef gave Binyamin five garments as a hint that his descendant, Mordechai, would wear five royal garments before King Achashveirosh (Megillah 16b). This was due to the extreme hiddenness of Hashem during Esther's time, and Mordechai rectified these five levels of garments. This concept is reflected in the tradition of changing clothes on Purim, aligning with the idea of 'change of clothing.' Yosef prepared the way for Bnei Yisrael's descent to Mitzrayim, as also indicated by the wagons he sent and the preparations made, and by the idea that Yaakov should have come down to Mitzrayim in iron chains.</p>

            <summary>Joseph gave each of his brothers two different garments as changes of raiment, and to Benjamin, he gave three hundred pieces of silver as a special gift, along with five changes of clothing. The three hundred pieces of silver symbolized the value of each brother as if they were a slave, while the five sets of garments had various symbolic meanings, including a hint at Mordechai's future. Benjamin received special treatment due to not being involved in Joseph's sale, and the gifts were given as compensation and penalty for various actions related to the incident with the goblet. Judah took a ban of excommunication upon himself to bring Benjamin back to their father, leading to a punishment that his bones could not rest in his coffin for forty years. Joseph's gifts and actions were laden with symbolism and significance, reflecting forgiveness, compensation, and foreshadowing future events.</summary>

Alternate explanation: outer garments. The reason why Joseph gave them these garments as presents was that he had been the cause that made them tear up their clothing when they found out that the goblet had been found in Binyamin’s bag. They had been deeply embarrassed to be walking around in torn garments. ולבנימין, “and to Binyamin;” seeing that he had not participated in his sale, he gave him three hundred silver pieces. As a result of this each of the other ten brothers had been treated as worth a slave, (according to the Torah, 30 pieces of silver. Compare Talmud Gittin 44, where it is stated that if someone sells his slave to a gentile he is penalised ten times his value.) Three hundred silver pieces are ten times the value of an ablebodied slave.</p>

              <p>“To Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver” [45:22]. He gave silver to Benjamin because he was not at the sale of Joseph. He did not give money to the other brothers. It was a penalty, since whoever sells a person as a slave; he must give thirty weights of silver. Therefore, Joseph penalized each brother thirty weights of silver and there were ten brothers who sold Joseph. Ten times thirty is three hundred. Therefore Joseph gave Benjamin three hundred weights of silver. So write Bahya and Hizkuni. (Bahya, Genesis, 45:22; Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:22.)  However, Toldot Yizhak writes. Joseph gave three hundred weight of silver because he spoke three evil things about his brothers. The law is that when someone says bad things about his friend, he must give a hundred weights of silver. It was not given to the brothers because they sold him. (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 45:22.)  He gave five changes of clothes to Benjamin. The first was because Benjamin tore his garments with the brothers over the goblet. The second garment was given because he was his brother from the same mother. The third garment was because he had hidden the goblet and accused him of being a thief. He gave him the last two garments because when someone steals something he must return double. Joseph accused Benjamin of being a thief and therefore he paid him double. So writes Hizkuni. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 45:22.)  Bahya and Toldot Yizhak write. Joseph gave five garments to Benjamin. With this he showed that Mordecai would come from Benjamin, and he would go forth in five garments before King Ahasuerus. (Bahya, Genesis, 45:22; Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 45:22.)  Joseph sent ten donkeys with food for his father. He sent good, old wine and all sorts of food in the world, and good fruits. (Rashi, Genesis, 45:23.)  All the brothers went to their father and also Benjamin, who went with Judah, who was his guarantor to bring him back to his father, upon which Judah took a ban of excommunication upon himself, to bring him. Bahya asks a question. Why was Judah punished that his bones could not rest in his coffin for the forty years in the desert? It is because he took upon himself the ban of excommunication to bring Benjamin back. What kind of sin did Judah commit? He did bring him back. The explanation is that because Judah said, I will have sinned all my days if I did not bring Benjamin back. How did he know that he would bring him back? Perhaps Joseph would not let him return? Therefore, Judah had not spoken properly. (Bahya, Genesis, 45:24.) </p>

            <summary>In the Midrash, it is explained that Jacob's favoritism towards Joseph led to his brothers' jealousy and ultimately their selling him into slavery, with Benjamin weeping for the destruction of the two Temples. Additionally, Joseph's sending of old wine to his father symbolized strengthening the minds of the elderly. In another Midrash, Benjamin's offering came after Joseph's sons due to the Divine Presence resting in Benjamin's portion in the Temple in Jerusalem, with the weight of his offerings symbolizing significant events related to his birth and life. Finally, in a different commentary, the three hundred pieces of silver given to Benjamin foreshadowed a future event involving a daughter and the execution of three hundred men, mirroring events in the story of Esther.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>“On the ninth day, prince of the children of Benjamin, Avidan son of Gidoni” (Numbers 7:60).  “On the ninth day, prince of the children of Benjamin, Avidan son of Gidoni” – why did Benjamin present his offering after Joseph’s sons? It is because, just as the Divine Presence was in Joseph’s portion in Shilo, so, it rested in Benjamin’s portion in the Temple in Jerusalem. Alternatively, it is based on what the verse said: “Rouse Your might before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, and come to our rescue” (Psalms 80:3). (The midrash here is based on the fact that Ephraim and Manasseh cannot be separated; see section 6.)  “His offering was one silver dish, its weight one hundred and thirty; one silver basin of seventy shekels, in the sacred shekel; both of them full of high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering” (Numbers 7:61).  “His offering was one silver dish [kaarat]…” – do not read it as kaarat, but rather as akeret, corresponding to Rachel, who was the pillar of the household; she was the principal [ikar] of Jacob’s household, as it is stated: “The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin” (Genesis 46:19). And it says: “Rachel died on me” (Genesis 48:7). “One silver” – as on the basis of her prayer, Benjamin was born, as it is stated: “She called his name Joseph, saying: May the Lord add another son for me” (Genesis 30:24). In her regard it is stated: “The tongue of the righteous is choice silver” (Proverbs 10:20) – the tongue of a righteous woman. “Its weight one hundred and thirty” – as Benjamin was born when Jacob was one hundred years old. That is why he was named Benjamin [Binyamin], (Son of yamin, whose numerical value is: Yod – 10; mem – 40; nun – 50; which sum to 100. In many verses there is only one yod in the word Binyamin.)  as he was born when his father was one hundred years old. And he was thirty years old when he descended to Egypt. That is one hundred and thirty.  “One silver basin” – it is a basin, it is a goblet, corresponding to Joseph, who assessed the righteousness of his brothers regarding Benjamin by means of the goblet. When Joseph saw that Judah sacrificed himself on behalf of Benjamin, he recognized his brothers’ righteousness and made himself known to them. Because Joseph would drink wine [yayin], whose numerical value is seventy, (Yod – 10; yod – 10; nun – 50; which sum to 70.)  from the goblet, therefore, the weight of the basin was “seventy…in the sacred shekel.” “Both of them full” – both of them were equal, Joseph and Benjamin, as the Tabernacle was established in Joseph’s portion in Shilo, and the Temple in Benjamin’s portion in Jerusalem. That is, “high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering.”   “One gold ladle of ten shekels, filled with incense” (Numbers 7:62).  “One gold ladle of ten shekels, filled with incense” – corresponding to ten sons that Benjamin had when he descended to Egypt, as it is stated: “The sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Bekher, [and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Eḥi, and Rosh, Mupim, and Hupim, and Ard]” (Genesis 46:21), and they were all righteous. That is, “filled with incense.”  “One young bull, one ram, one lamb in its first year, as a burnt offering” (Numbers 7:63).  “One goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 7:64).  “One young bull, [one ram, one lamb]” – these are three species of burnt offering corresponding to the three times that the Temple is built in his portion: one in the era of Solomon, one in the era of those who ascended from the exile, and the third, in the Messianic Era. “One goat as a sin offering” – it corresponds to the structure that Herod built, which was built by a sinful king, and whose construction served as atonement for him for having killed the Sages of Israel. (See Bava Batra 4a.)  “And for the peace offering, two bulls, five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Avidan son of Gidoni” (Numbers 7:65).  “And for the peace offering, two bulls” – corresponding to two kings who emerged from Benjamin, Saul and Ish Boshet. Alternatively, it corresponds to the two redeemers who emerged from him, Mordekhai and Esther.  “Five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year” – there are three species, five of each, corresponding to the three advantages of five each that Benjamin received; they were: “Benjamin’s gift was five times greater that the gifts of all of them” (Genesis 43:34). “To Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of garments” (Genesis 45:22). The third, this is Mordekhai, who was from Benjamin, and who was privileged to don five royal garments, as it is stated: “Mordekhai went out from before the king in royal garments of sky-blue and white, with a great golden crown, and a cloak of fine linen and purple wool” (Esther 8:15).   “This was the offering of Avidan…” – since he presented the offering in this order, the Holy One blessed be He began lauding his offering: “This was the offering of Avidan…”</p>

Is it possible that that which gave trouble to Joseph's father (Ib. b) proved a stumbling block to Joseph? For Rabba b. Mehasia quoted R. Chama b. Guria, who said in the name of Rab: &quot;On account of two Selaim worth of silk which Jacob bestowed on Joseph in preference to his other sons, the brothers became jealous of him, and brought about the entrance of our ancestors into Egypt.&quot; &quot;This was a hint that from him would descend a man who would wear five royal garments,&quot; said R. Benjamin b. Jepheth, in the name of R. Elazar. Who is he? Mordecai, concerning whom it is written (Est. 8, 15) And Mordecai went out in a royal apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and with a cloak of fine linen and purple. (Gen. 45, 14) And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's necks. How many necks had Benjamin? R. Benjamin b. Jepheth, in the name of R.

(Ib.) And behold, your own eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin. &quot;This means,&quot; said R. Benjamin b. Jepheth in the name of R. Elazar, &quot;that he (Joseph) said to them, 'Just as I have nothing in my heart against Benjamin, who took no part in my sale, so have I nothing against you, who sold me.'&quot; (Ib.) It is my mouth the best things of Egypt? R. Benjamin b. Jepheth, in the name of R.

          <details>
            <summary>Yosef's attitude towards clothing is highlighted by the unique word choice in the Torah regarding his changing of garments, indicating his understanding that clothing can be changed without altering the essence of the person it covers. This is exemplified when Yosef gives his brothers clothing before returning to Canaan. Additionally, Yaakov's favoritism towards Yosef, seen in the gift of an expensive garment, fueled jealousy among the brothers and ultimately led to their descent into Egypt. Joseph later follows in his father's footsteps by giving Binyamin more valuable gifts, but this is explained by their close relationship and Joseph's intention to reveal his true identity to his brothers. Additionally, the allocation of ancestral parts of land to Joseph is seen as a way to bring his remains back to Sh'chem, similar to a parable of returning an empty casket after a theft.</summary>

                <h4>Da'at Zekenim on Genesis 48:22:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>ואני נתתי לך, “I have given (allocated) to you;” Rabbi Moshe raises the point that Yaakov was directly responsible for fuelling jealousy between the brothers, commencing already with giving his son Joseph a garment that was visibly more expensive than those worn by his brothers. On account of this error in judgment, the whole family descended to Egypt, only to become enslaved for hundreds of years after initially having been welcomed there. (Compare Talmud, tractate Shabbat folio 10) We must also marvel that Joseph followed in his father’s footsteps by giving his full brother Binyamin far more valuable gifts than he gave to his other brothers (Genesis 45,22). In order to answer these questions we must remember that what Yaakov gave to Joseph was done while he was relatively young and immature, younger than 17 years old, an age at which Ishmael in Genesis 21,14 has still been described by the Torah as a ילד, “a child;” at that time the brothers who were jealous of him had reason to be so. What had he done to deserve preferential treatment by his father? Now that his dreams had come true, not only did they not feel jealous of him, but they were grateful and proud of his achievements. Moreover, they had become economically dependent upon him. Even if he had not treated them well, they were legally obligated to honour him on account of his position. If he gave Binyamin more gifts, that was easily explained by the fact that he was his only full brother. However, what bothers me is that at a time when he had not yet revealed to the brothers who he was, (Genesis 43,34) the brothers of Binyamin must have asked themselves for the reason that this ruler of Egypt who had –according to their assumption- never previously laid eyes on Binyamin, should have given him five times as much as he gave to them. Surely, this would have aroused the other brothers’ jealousy of Binyamin. However, the brothers found a reason for this also, as they considered it as Joseph compensating Binyamin for having insisted that he make the journey to Egypt just because he had not trusted the brothers’ statement that he even existed. Furthermore, I believe that Joseph, already at that point, had decided to reveal his true identity. He was certain that as soon as they would find out that he, Joseph, was a full brother of Binyamin, they would not begrudge him the additional gifts. Some commentators explain the words: שכם אחד, in our verse, the extra portion of ancestral parts of the land of Israel, allocated by Yaakov to Joseph, as referring to the grave in that city in which the remains of Joseph would be interred after the Israelites taking over that country. (Compare Joshua 24,32) The matter can be compared to a parable of thieves who had robbed the owner of a vineyard of a full casket of wine when they were found out by the owner. That owner asked the thieves to do him one favour; seeing that they had already emptied the casket of its contents he asked them to at least return the empty casket to him. Joseph had been sold in Sh’chem. The time had come to at least bring his remains back there. (Compare B’reshit Rabbah, 85,3).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>We have further indication of Yosef’s later spiritual growth as it relates to his attitude toward clothing in the unusual word choice regarding the clothing around him. First, when he changes his garments to appear in front of Pharaoh (Bereshit 41:14), (Ibid., verse 14.)  and then when he gives his brothers clothing before returning to Canaan to bring back their father (Bereshit 45:22), (Ibid., 45:22.)  the Torah uses terms derived from the Hebrew root chalaf, to change or substitute (vayechalef, chalifot simla’ot). We almost never see vayechalef anywhere else in the entire Bible (The two exceptions are in Bereshit 35:2 and in Tehillim 102:27.)  and the term chalifot is not found anywhere else in the Torah – though it is employed in the early prophets. In the context of what we have already learned about Yosef’s clothes, this is a superbly purposeful word choice: the Torah is telling us that Yosef now sees clothing as something that can be changed at will without its changing the essence of the person it covers. So much is Yosef aware of this that he is now even in a position to convey this message to his brothers. (In doing so, he again parallels Tamar, who conveys the same message to Yehudah.)</p>

              <p>AND TO HIS FATHER HE SENT ‘KAZOTH’ (IN LIKE MANNER). I.e., according to this amount. And what was the amount? Ten asses, etc. This is the language of Rashi. It is not correct that kazoth should refer to the amount [for if it refers to cheshbon (amount), it should have said kazeh in the masculine, and not kazoth in the feminine]. But it is possible that Scripture says, in like manner, meaning “according to this gift,” [with the word minchah matching the feminine gender of kazoth] The purport thereof is, “and to his father he sent this gift: ten asses, etc.,” [with the word kazoth being understood as if it were written zoth], and the letter kaph in the word kazoth is considered redundant. However, it is the way of the Sacred Language to express it in this way, just as, And she spoke to him, [saying]: ‘ka’dvarim ha’eileh’ (after the manner of these things) did thy servant do to me. (Ibid., Verses 17 and 19.)  It may be that Scripture is saying: “and to his father he sent provision (tzeidah), [which is also in the feminine gender], which was like this provision which he gave to his brothers.” But the intent of the expression is not to make them equal, but only to say that just as he gave them provision for the road when they went to Canaan, so did he send his father corn and bread and sustenance for his journey towards Egypt. And this is the correct interpretation. Scripture mentions asses and she-asses to inform us that he sent him both the provisions and the animals that carried them, and it was customary to send males and females, as his father had done.

              </summary>
              <p>ולאביו שלח כזאת, “and to his father he sent the following:” Rashi explains that the word כזאת here is short for כחשבון הזאת: “the following amounts.” What did these “amounts consist of?” 10 donkey loads, etc., etc.
    Nachmanides feels that the word כזאת refers to the food for the extended family of Yaakov, which would sustain them on the journey to Egypt. He had, after all, provided his brothers with rations to sustain them on their homeward trip, also. (verse 21). The Torah mentions to Joseph’s credit that he did not only give them the supplies in question but also the means of transporting them, i.e. donkeys and she asses.
    According to Ibn Ezra the word כזאת refers to the quality of the new clothes Joseph handed out, i.e. the best quality available in Egypt.
    Some commentators claim that Joseph did not send Binyamin back with the other brothers, and they prove their point by the fact that he sent only ten donkeys to his father and not eleven. In other words, Joseph gave each of the ten brothers a donkey that would be led by him; if Binyamin had also returned to Canaan he would have had to give them eleven donkeys. Some say that this is no proof as Joseph simply did not want to burden Binyamin with the task of leading a donkey all the way back to Canaan.

Joseph instructed his brothers to act prudently and not reveal his identity to their father immediately, as he wanted to save his family from the famine that would last for five more years.

And he brought them before Pharaoh, and when Pharaoh saw all the brothers of ‎Joseph, all of them powerful men and of comely appearance, he rejoiced exceedingly. And ‎after this they went away from the presence of Pharaoh to go into the land of Canaan, unto ‎their father, and Benjamin their brother with them. And Joseph took eleven chariots of ‎Pharaoh and gave unto them. And Joseph gave unto them likewise his own chariot in which he ‎rode on the day he was made king of Egypt, to bring their father in it unto Egypt. And Joseph ‎sent garments to all the children of his brothers and a hundred pieces of silver to every one of ‎them, and he sent also garments for the wives of his brothers from the garments of the king's ‎wives according to their numbers, and various perfumeries he sent likewise unto them. And ‎he gave to every one of his brothers ten men to go with them into the land of Canaan to ‎attend upon them and their children and all belonging to them in coming into Egypt. And ‎Joseph sent by the hand of his brother Benjamin, ten garments for his ten sons, an additional ‎gift above the gifts sent to the other children of Jacob's sons. And he sent to each of them fifty ‎pieces of silver and ten of Pharaoh’s chariots. And to his father he sent ten asses laden with ‎the good things of Egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father, ‎and all those that were with him, for provision on the road. And unto his sister Dinah he sent ‎garments of silver and of gold and frankincense and myrrh and aloes, and all sorts of toilet ‎articles in abundance. And he sent likewise such things to the wives of Benjamin from ‎Pharaoh’s wives. And he gave unto all his brothers and also to their wives, from all sorts of ‎onyx stones and bdellium, rubies and emeralds, and from all luxuries worn by the nobility of ‎the Egyptians. There was nothing left, of all precious things that Joseph did not send unto his ‎father's house.

And Joseph went out, to accompany them on ‎the road on to the boundaries of Egypt, and he instructed them concerning his father and his ‎household and their coming down into Egypt. And he said unto them: See that you fall not out ‎by the way, for this thing was from the Lord in order to save the multitude of people from the ‎famine, for five years yet will the famine be in the earth. And he commanded them saying: ‎When you come into the land of Canaan do not bring that matter suddenly upon my father, ‎but act prudently.‎</p>

              <p>When the gifts Joseph sent to his father are described in 45, 23, and the Torah says: ולאביו שלח, the word לאביו is mentioned twice. The first time it probably teaches us the above described unique relationship between Jacob and his son Joseph. Our sages in Megillah 16b elaborate on the significance of the various gifts listed in that verse. They find an allusion to יין ישן, aged wine, in the words מטוב מצרים. We must realize that there were two categories of wine. One category is called by our sages יין המשומר. This wine has a mystical dimension to it, it is made from grapes saved since the six days of Creation, and it will be served to the צדיקים in the World to Come. It's potency is associated with the emanation בינה, the root of the auxiliary emanation דעת. When this kind of wine is drunk in our world it has a beneficial effect on the clarity of mind of the זקנים, and it puts their minds at ease concerning the Hereafter; it enables the one drinking it to penetrate with his mind up to the כתר, the root of roots of all the emanations. This root is called עתיק יומין, עתיקא קדישא, &quot;The venerable One, the Holy One of antiquity.&quot;</p>

            <summary>Ramban explains that the phrase &quot;all the goods of his master being in his hand&quot; in Genesis 24:10 refers to a deed of gift written in favor of Isaac to ensure that his ownership would not be contested by other children. Some argue that the servant took camels immediately after being sworn because he had authority to take whatever he desired from his master's belongings. The correct interpretation, according to Ramban, is that the camels carried all the good and excellent fruits and precious things from his master's house. The verses use shortened expressions when the subjects are understood.</summary>

                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 24:10:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>AND ALL THE GOODS OF HIS MASTER BEING IN HIS HAND. Rashi comments: “This refers to a deed of gift of all his possessions which he wrote in favor of Isaac so that they would be eager to send him their daughter.” And so it is also stated in Bereshith Rabbah, (59:15.)  “He carried with him a disposition of property.” According to this opinion, the verse stating, And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac, (Further, 25:5.)  means that he caused him to take possession of the belonging at the time of his death so that the other children would not contest his ownership, just as it is said, And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived. (Ibid., Verse 6.)  If so, the word “taking” applies also to the first part of the verse, And the servant ‘took’ ten camels, and departed, and all the goods of his master he took in his hand. Perhaps [the words of the verse are to be transposed as follows]: “And the servant took ten camels and all the goods of his master in his hand, and departed.” Others (This interpretation is found in the commentary of Chizkuni.)  explain the sense of the verse as meaning that immediately upon being sworn, the servant himself went and took many camels from his master’s camels because all his master’s goods were in his hand, he being the officer and captain over all and authorized to take from him whatever he desired, just as the verse says, that ruled over all that he had. (Verse 2 here.)  The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the meaning of this verse is similar to that of the verse concerning Hazael, general of Aram, And Hazael went to meet him [Elisha the prophet], and took a present with him, and every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, (II Kings 8:9.)  [which means “and ‘of’ every good thing of Damascus].” Here too Scripture states that he took in his hand of all his master’s goods ten camels’ burden. The sense of the verse concerning Hazael is that the camels carried all that was good and excellent among those species of fruits and precious things that were found in Damascus or in his master’s house, and in addition they carried a present with them. In a similar sense is the verse, ten asses laden with the good of Egypt, (Further, 45:23.)  [which means laden with the good and excellent fruits of Egypt]. The verses, however, shorten expressions when the subjects are understood.</p>

This contradicts the Talmudic principle of dividing one's daily activities to include Torah study.

              </summary>
              <p>Genesis 45,24. “do not quarrel on the way.” ‎‎Rashi does not follow the traditional translation, but says ‎that Joseph told the brothers not to engage in halachic ‎discussions, and the subsequent differences of opinions resulting ‎while you are on the journey. If Rashi is correct, we must ‎try and understand why the brothers’ father, Yaakov, did not give ‎the brothers similar instructions governing their conduct during ‎their journey  to Egypt?‎ Besides, how could Joseph arrogate to himself the right to ‎give such instructions, when we have it on the authority of ‎‎Kidushin 30 that a person should strive to divide the ‎activities he performs (equally) into the three parts of his life, ‎devoting one third to the study of the written part of the Torah, ‎another to the study of the oral part of the Torah, ‎‎(Mishnah) and the third part to the discussions on the oral ‎part of the Torah in the Talmud. One difficulty of that statement ‎is that we do not know how long we are going to live, so how can ‎we make the correct division? The Talmud therefore corrects ‎itself, saying that what is meant is the way we divide each day of ‎our lives. It follows that each one of us is duty bound to study ‎some halachah on a daily basis. So how could Joseph forbid ‎this to his brothers?‎ The statement in the Talmud can be seen as plausible if we ‎first consider two premises upon which it is built. 1) Yaakov had a ‎tradition that he need not fear ever being consigned to ‎‎gehinom provided that none of his children died during his ‎lifetime. (Rashi 37,35 based on a Tanchuma Vayigash ‎‎9. 2). A statement by our sages that the combined lifetimes of the ‎patriarchs would be 500 years, corresponding to ‎כימי השמים על ‏הארץ‎, (Deut.11,21). [According to a number of ‎commentators this verse describes the “distance” between earth ‎and the celestial regions through the intervening ‎רקיע‎, outer ‎space, being equivalent to 502 “years.” The combined lifetimes of ‎the patriarchs, were 502 years, though more than half of these ‎overlapped, and we do not know the criteria applied here, i.e. ‎‎“light years,” i.e. the time it takes light to traverse this distance, ‎or whatever other criteria are referred to. Ed.]‎ If a human being were to know how long he was going to live ‎on this earth, he would be able to apportion one third of his life ‎to the respective study of Torah, Mishnah, and ‎‎Gemara. Based on the above calculation, when Yaakov saw ‎that Joseph had disappeared, he concluded that he must be dead, ‎so that one of the premises, i.e. that he would not have to worry ‎about spending time in gehinom had already lost its ‎comforting meaning. From that moment on he became afraid ‎that the second premise we have mentioned could also be ‎compromised, as he had no idea how long he would live. He was ‎therefore unable to instruct his sons to leave out the study of ‎‎halachah, i.e. gemara, for a single day. Joseph, who was ‎aware that his father had no reason to worry, as all his sons were ‎alive and well, was able to issue such a command without ‎endangering the spiritual future of his father. The brothers would ‎have lots of time to make up for the halachot they had not ‎studied while on the journey to bring good news to their father.‎</p>

They were also warned not to quarrel about past events, specifically the selling of Joseph into slavery, and to avoid excessive studying that could lead them astray.

We have encountered the meaning of “nervousness” as being רגז, also in Deuteronomy, 28,65, לב רגז. An alternate exegesis: even though I have loaded you with great wealth in a time of famine when everyone else suffers from possessing very little, you have no reason to be nervous about its implications.</p>

              <p>וישלח את אחיו, He sent off his brothers, etc. This means that Joseph sent everybody home, including Benjamin. Benjamin's testimony would convince Jacob most of all; this is why Joseph had already stressed previously (45,12) that Benjamin was a witness that he was Joseph. Now that Yehudah had fulfilled the conditions of his guarantee it is clear that if his bones rattled in his coffin during the years Israel travelled in the desert this was only because he failed to have his vow annulled, as pointed out in Megillah 11.</p>

              <p>וישלח את אחיו וילכו “he sent off his brothers and they went on their way.” All his brothers, Reuven, Shimon and the rest, including Binyamin so that Yehudah kept his promise to his father. Why then did the sages (Sotah 7) say that Yehudah was punished for his guarantee so that the bones in his coffin rattled during all the 40 years the Israelites wandered through the desert? The reason is that his vow and its fulfilment depended on the goodwill of others. It is sinful to make such promises unless the factors relating to fulfilment of the promise are all under the control of the person making the promise. Yehudah had known from the outset that it would depend on the ruler of Egypt if he could make good on his guarantee.  Our sages (Makkot 11) used this incident to formulate a halachah concerning conditional excommunication, saying that the threat of excommunication even if conditional, requires a retroactive annulment even if in the meantime the party who had been threatened with such excommunication had fulfilled the conditions imposed upon him. This explains why Yehudah qualified for punishment for having guaranteed Binyamin’s safe return.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>אל תרגזו בדרך, “do not become agitated on the journey.” The word may mean: “do not be afraid,” based on Deut 28,65 ולב רגז, “a trembling heart,” or on Deut. 2,25 ורגזו וחלו מפניך, “they will tremble and be anxious before you.” It is customary that during periods of famine people who are loaded with grain and food are constantly afraid of being attacked. How much more so would this apply when the whole clan of the Hebrews including all their chattels would travel to Egypt. This is also why Joseph told his brothers to rush home and not to have any fear at all as his reputation and the fact that they were under his protection would suffice to frighten off marauders. Thus far Nachmanides on the subject. Our sages in Taanit 10 understand the words אל תרגזו בדרך, as an instruction not to get involved in halachic discussions while they were traveling as this would slow them down. He did not mean to stop them from discussing such matters; he only did not want them to go into them at depth as this would prove time-consuming. He could not in good conscience have told them not to discuss Torah as we have a statement in Sotah 49 that when even two Torah scholars travel together without discussing matters of Torah they deserve to be burned at the stake. Our sages base this on Kings II 2,11: “as they kept on walking (Elijah and Elisha), a fiery chariot with fiery horses suddenly appeared and separated one from the other.” They needed to be separated because they were engaged in Torah-discussions. Had they not been engaged in discussing Torah they would both have been burned to death.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>DO NOT ‘TIRG’ZU’ BY THE WAY. Rogez is an expression of trembling and movement, and is usually applied when the trembling is a result of fear, as for example, a heart ‘ragaz’ (that is trembling); (Deuteronomy 28:65.)  ‘V’ragzu’ (and they shall tremble), and be in anguish; (Ibid., 2:25.)  And where I stand ‘ergaz’ (I tremble); (Habakkuk 3:16.)  And drink thy water ‘b’ragzah’ (with trembling) and with anxiety. (Ezekiel 12:18.)  Therefore, the correct interpretation of this verse is, in my opinion, that Joseph said to them, “Do not fear by the way,” and the purport thereof is that since they were carrying corn and bread and sustenance (Verse 23 here.)  and the best of Egypt in the days of the famine, they might fear lest robbers attack them while they travelled on their journey to Canaan, and the moreso when they return to Egypt with all their possessions, and thus they will not hasten the matter. (See II Chronicles 24:15.)  Therefore he told them that they should go quickly and hurry to come there, as it is said, Hasten ye, and go up to my father, (Verse 9 here.)  and they should have no fear at all on the way as his name is upon them. Since he is the ruler of the entire land of Egypt, and the lives of the peoples of those countries are in his hand, and all are fearful of his awe, they will travel and arrive in peace.</p>

              <p>אל תרגזו, do not be nervous about robbers that you might encounter on the route. I have no hostile neighbours on any of my borders. This is also the meaning of the word רגזו in Psalms 4,5. The verse there implies that you should be worried not to commit a sin against G’d. If you are, you will not have to worry about any man-made hazards. The meaning of the same root in Deuteronomy 28,65 is also the same, i.e. as a result of your sinful conduct G’d burdened you with a heart which is constantly worried about all kinds of disaster that may befall you. This is part of the punishment you will experience for not having worried about ignoring G’d’s commandments previous to the retribution. Chabakuk 3,7 as well as Isaiah 32,11 make similar points. On the other hand, the same root used in Job 9,6 or when it appears in the Book of Daniel and the Book of Ezra refers to a state of anger. The word טרנבלד (old French for trembling) is the translation of כעס for anytime that word appears in the 24 books of the Bible.

Maharshal writes that Rashi’s first explanation follows one opinion in Taanis 10b, and Rashi’s alternate explanation follows the Baraisa there. Rashi also explains, “And arrive at your evening destination while there is still daylight.” The Baraisa itself offered these two explanations [of “large steps” and “daylight”] because it understands תרגזו בדרך to mean overly intensive walking, but it did not know whether it means taking large steps or walking a long time, i.e., until nightfall. Thus it offered both explanations: one pertaining to taking large steps, and one pertaining to arriving at their destination while there is still daylight. An overly intense person takes large steps, and the Rabbis taught (ibid), “Large steps remove one-fivehundredth of a person’s eyesight.” </p>

Following their shocking experience in Egypt, the brothers were liable to blame each other for the selling of Joseph during the trip home. Reuben and Judah both had a certain amount of mercy on their brother and attempted to delay or foil the attempt to kill him, but it is unclear how many of the other brothers, aside from Judah (see 37:26), were active participants in the sale and how many merely refrained from preventing it. Apparently, until now they considered themselves active participants. Now, when it became evident that Joseph was alive and his status was more powerful than theirs, they might use the journey to rehash past events. 6 Consequently, he said to them: Do not quarrel on the way. </p>

              <p>“Do not be quarrelsome on the way” [45:24]. Joseph said to his brothers. Do not be afraid when you have many goods with you. Now in this inflation, there is much robbery, but because I am sending you and they are afraid of me on all sides. He also said that you should not argue with each other that you spoke ill of Joseph and that is why you sold him. Therefore, do not argue. You should not study excessively on the way, so you don’t go astray. (Bahya, Genesis, 45:24.)  Imre Noam asks a question. Why did Jacob not forbid his children to study when they went to Egypt for grain? The explanation is that Jacob did not have to forbid that they should not study Torah on the way, because they had no grain, they would certainly not study Torah. One does not need to forbid them. Our sages said, “if there is no flour, there is no Torah” [M. Avot 3. 17]. (Imre Noam, Genesis, 45:24.)  Some sages say that Joseph commanded that when they studied Torah on the road, they should not talk about idle things, such as “what a beautiful tree this is, or what a lovely field this is” [M. Avot, 3.7]. Therefore he said, do not engage in halakhic matters [Rashi, 45:24]. That is to say, you should not speak idle words when you will study, but you should study earnestly. (Devek Tov, Genesis, 45:24.)  Joseph also commanded them that they should not stride quickly and run, since it diminishes the sight of the one who strides quickly. (B. Ta’anit, 10b.)  Joseph thought that they would walk quickly to tell their father the good news about Joseph. Therefore, he forbade them to stride quickly. (Rashi, Genesis, 45:24.) </p>

The importance of trembling and fearing one's sins is emphasized, as failing to do so can result in falling into the same trap repeatedly. It is crucial to recognize the power of one's impulses and seek to increase fear of God in order to avoid further transgressions. The analogy of a dog returning to its vomit is used to illustrate the folly of repeating disgraceful acts.</summary>

              <p>And furthermore - reflect upon the evil of the one who delays repenting, as it is great. For if it were not that he had delayed - now when his impulse would confront him a second time and he have the opportunity to sin, he would recoil and sigh with a bitter heart, with anguish and worry; and his eye would weep with grief. He would [then] subdue his impulse, remember that the cup of bitterness had passed over him once and he would not drink it again. As it is stated (Psalms 4:8), &quot;Tremble and do not sin&quot; - its explanation is, tremble and fear and be troubled about your sinning, and do not sin again. For it mentioned their sin above [in that chapter in Psalms], when it stated (Psalms 4:3), &quot;you sought falsehood, Selah.&quot; And its using the expression, &quot;tremble,&quot; confirms this explanation. [As its usage is like in] (Genesis 45:24), &quot;Do not tremble along the way&quot;; and (Habakkuk 3:16), &quot;I trembled where I stood.&quot; And their meaning is distress at something that passed and is still present. And it did not state (in Psalms above), &quot;Fear,&quot; or &quot;Flinch.&quot;  But when he delays from repenting - when the sin comes to his hands, he will fall into its trap like he fell at first. And his second iniquity will be very great and his evil will rise up in front of God. For at first, he did not think that the marauding impulse would come upon him. But after he saw the weakness of his power and that his impulse had overcome him and that it is more powerful than he; he should have seen that it is unbridled, and he should have sought to increase his fear of God, to bring down His fright upon his soul, to save it from the ambush of his impulse and to protect it from its iniquity. And King Solomon, peace be upon him, said (Proverbs 26:11), &quot;As a dog returns to his vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.&quot; Its explanation is that a dog eats disgusting things; but when he vomits them, they are more disgusting, yet he returns to eat them. Such is the matter of a fool. For he will do a disgraceful act, but when he repeats it, it is [even] more disgraceful, as we explained. </p>

              <p>“They went up from Egypt, and they came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father” (Genesis 45:25).   “They told him, saying: Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over the entire land of Egypt. His heart was faint because he did not believe them (Genesis 45:26).  “They went up from Egypt…. They told him, saying: Joseph is still alive…his heart was faint” – Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: What is the plight of the liar? Even if he says truthful matters, he is not believed.  “They spoke to him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and he saw the wagons that Joseph sent to convey him, and the spirit of Jacob their father was revived” (Genesis 45:27).  “He saw the wagons” – the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him had idols etched on them. Judah stood and burned them. That tribe is experienced in burning idols. (See II Samuel 5:21; I Chronicles 14:12.)   Rabbi Levi [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan bar Shaul: [Joseph] said to them: ‘If he believes you, fine. If not, say to him: “At the moment that I took my leave of you, was I not engaged in [studying] the passage of the beheaded calf [egla]?’ That is what is written: “He saw the wagons [haagalot]…and the spirit…was revived.”  “Israel said: Enough, Joseph my son is still alive; I will go and see him before I die” (Genesis 45:28).  “Israel said: Enough [rav]” – the power of my son Joseph is great [rav], as many troubles befell him, but still he remained in his righteousness much more than I did, as I sinned when I said: “My way is hidden from the Lord” (Isaiah 40:27). But I am certain that I have a portion in “how great is Your goodness” (Psalms 31:20). (Jacob knew through divine inspiration that if none of his sons were to die during his lifetime, he would be assured of a place in the World to Come (Etz Yosef, based on Tanḥuma (Warsaw ed.) Vayigash 9). ) </p>

              <p>And just as a deer is quicker than any beast or animal, so the fruits of Eretz Yisrael are &quot;quicker&quot; (to come) than those of all the other lands.

And thus is it written (Isaiah 5:11) &quot;I will now sing of my Beloved, my Beloved's song of His vineyard. My Beloved had a vineyard in the horn of Ben Shamen&quot;: Just as there is nothing higher in a bullock than its horns, so, Eretz Yisrael is higher than all of the other lands. — But perhaps, just as a bullock is defective in the contents of its horns, so, Eretz Yisrael is more &quot;defective&quot; than all of the other lands! It is, therefore, written &quot;in the horn of Ben Shamen&quot;: It is fat (shamen, rich, fruitful, productive). Eretz Yisrael, being higher than all (other lands) is superior to all, viz.: (Bamidbar 13:30) &quot;Let us go up and we will inherit it,&quot; (Ibid. 13:21) &quot;and they went up and spied out the land,&quot; (Ibid. 13:22) &quot;and they went up in the south,&quot; (Bereshith 45:25) &quot;and they went up from Egypt.&quot; The Temple, in that it is higher than all, is superior to all, viz.: (Devarim 17:8) &quot;then you shall rise and go up&quot; (to the Temple), (Isaiah 2:3) &quot;and many peoples will go and say 'Let us go up to the mountain of the L-rd, to the house of the G-d of Yaakov,'&quot; and (Jeremiah 31:5) &quot;For there is a day when the watchers will call out on the mountain of Ephraim: 'Arise, let us go up to Tzion to (the house of) the L-rd our G-d!'&quot;</p>

            <summary>Jacob's heart stopped beating briefly when he heard that Joseph was alive and became a ruler in Egypt, due to the shock and disbelief at the news. This reaction was common in elderly individuals overwhelmed by sudden joy, causing fainting. However, Jacob's spirit revived when he saw the wagons Joseph had sent, allowing him to believe the news. The brothers' careful delivery of the news and the gradual revelation of evidence helped Jacob come to terms with the reality. Joseph's delay in revealing himself to his father was attributed to various factors, including concern for his brothers' dignity and fear of their reaction. Ultimately, the gradual unfolding of events led to a successful reunion between Joseph and Jacob.</summary>

He only reacted after seeing the carriages that Joseph had sent along. An alternate exegesis: the words: ויפג לבו, mean that he reacted joyfully, seeing that in the Talmud we see it used in this sense in tractate Yuma, folio 19, אישי כהן גדול עמוד והפג אחת על הרצפה, “my lord the High Priest, arise and demonstrate joy,” (according to Rashi there). [According to this the High Priest rejected the implication that he was going to sleep as ridiculous; Ed.] In our case, Yaakov considered the claims by his sons as ridiculous, not worth even thinking about. The latter explanation is supported by Onkelos, who writes: פיגו.</p>

It means his heart stopped and was still. It has the same meaning as and his heart died within him (I Sam. 25:37). Jacob reacted in this manner because he didn’t believe them. (Jacob reacted in this manner because what his sons said reminded him that Joseph was dead.)  However, when he saw the wagons, his spirit revived. Do not be surprised at the term his heart stopped for it is the style of the prophets to speak in hyperbole. Compare, neither was there breath left in me (Dan. 10:17).</p>

              <p>ויגדו לו לאמור. They told him, saying, etc.. The word ויגדו indicates the difficulty the brothers had telling their father what had transpired in Egypt. What was good news for their father involved a confession of the evil the brothers had perpetrated and how they had caused their father unnecessary anguish. It is also possible that the use of the word ויגדו [especially the missing letter י ] alluded to the ensuing exile of the Jewish people and the hard times their descendants would experience there eventually. We do indeed find that Jacob was afraid to travel to Egypt until reassured by G'd in a dream (46,3).</p>

              <p>Besides, Joseph may well have felt that the brothers still wanted him out of this world and would confer how to bring this about. When Bereshit Rabbah 91 described the brothers as taking a great deal of money to Egypt in order to ransom Joseph, this merely means that they hoped to succeed in order to demonstrate that they were sorry for what they had done. Only then would they no longer feel threatened by him and plan to dispose of him. </p>

              <p>Joseph, of course, was unaware that the brothers had undergone a change of heart until he had personally tested them in the presence of Benjamin. Only after that experience did Joseph realise that he was no longer in danger from his brothers. Until all the pieces of the puzzle came together at the time Joseph decided to reveal himself to his brothers it would have been premature to risk identifying himself. Until Joseph was able to put the brothers at ease by attributing all that had happened to G'd's planning, he would have been risking his life by revealing himself. You will recall that Yehudah had resorted to a confrontational stance when he found out that Joseph had included innocent Reuben in his treatment of the brothers. Tanchuma item 5 on our Parshah even reports the brothers as planning to kill Joseph [not in his capacity as Joseph, of course, but in his capacity of a ruler who had framed Benjamin, Ed.], and that it had taken an angel to save Joseph from their hands. Considering all the foregoing Joseph can hardly be faulted for allowing events to run their course without informing his father prematurely.</p>

              <p>The reason the Torah uses the expression לאמור is to tell us that the brothers were astute in the manner they conveyed the good news to their father. It is well known that sudden good news may shock a person and cause cardiac arrest. The brothers therefore led up to what they had to say in stages; first they mentioned that they were the bearers of good tidings, ויגדו לו לאמור; after Jacob had been thus prepared they told him that Joseph was still alive. At that point this news was not liable to endanger Jacob's life. </p>

While it is true that as long as Joseph was a slave he may not have been able to communicate with his father, nonetheless during the nine years since his appointment as viceroy surely he could have done so? Why did he not at least write his father a letter to temper his father's pain and to stop him from mourning him? Not only this, why did he not at least send a message to his father during the year of famine when there was a constant stream of travellers between Egypt and Canaan? Who had given Joseph permission not to tell his father that he was alive after the brothers arrived in Egypt the first time?</p>

On the other hand, he considered a statement by our sages in Baba Metzia 59 that it is preferable to be burned in a fiery oven than to cause a fellow human being to go pale with shame. Joseph was concerned for his brothers' dignity as human beings, something they would lose if their father would find out at that point what the brothers had done to his favourite child. He decided therefore that the anguish of one man, i.e. his father, was preferable to discrediting his brothers.</p>

              <p>ויפג לבו, “his heard went numb.” The word ויפג is related to Lamentations 3,49 מאין הפוגות, “without respite.” The meaning is that Yaakov’s tears went on flowing without interruption. The meaning of the expression here is: “his heart stopped beating, he became like dead.” It is not unusual for someone to faint when he is the recipient of unexpected good news. The physiological explanation is a sudden expansion of the arteries of the heart which causes the heat inside the heart to suddenly dissipate and to cover the outside of the body. As a result, the heart itself is left cold, or at least too cold to perform its task. This causes fainting. These phenomena are more common among the elderly and among people with a weak constitution. The Talmud in Ketuvot 62, when discussing the frequency or otherwise of marital relations between Torah scholars and their wives, reports that after an absence of twelve years from his home, the wife of Rabbi Chanina ben Chachinai suddenly saw (according to Rashi thought she saw) her husband standing in the doorway. Her heart gave such a leap that she died from the shock. Her husband was stunned that this should be the reward of a pious woman who had enabled him to study Torah all these years. He prayed for her revival and she was restored to life.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>‘VAYAPHAG’ HIS HEART. His heart passed away and ceased to believe; his heart took no notice of their words. The word vayaphag has the same meaning as the Mishnaic expression: “The fragrance of all spices m’phigin (escape).” (Beitza 14a.)  Similar is the verse, Without any ‘haphugoth’ (intermission). (Lamentations 3:49.)  The verse, And his scent is not ‘namar,’ (Jeremiah 48:11.)  is rendered in the Targum: “and his scent is not pag (passing away).” This is the language of Rashi. But it is not correct, for phugah is an expression of cessation and abolition, just as : give thyself no ‘phugath’ (respite). (Lamentations 2:18.)  So also, Mine eye is poured out, and ceaseth not, without any ‘haphugoth,’ (Lamentations 3:49.)  meaning “mine eye pours out tears steadily without cessation or intermission.” And so likewise, “m’phigin (their fragrance)” (Beitza 14a.)  means that the spices scatter the fragrance and it is voided. So also, Therefore the law is ‘taphug,’ (Habakkuk 1:4.)  that is, voided and ceased. In this verse also, ‘vayaphag’ his heart [thus means that the beat of] his heart was suspended and his breathing ceased, for the movement of the heart ceased and he was as dead. This condition is known when joy suddenly comes upon one, and it is mentioned in the books of medicines that old or feeble persons cannot withstand the shock, for many of them faint when joy comes to them very suddenly. The heart widens and opens suddenly, and its natural heat goes out and scatters throughout the outer parts of the body, and the heart thus ceases to function because of its coolness. Thus the patriarch fell as dead. Scripture says, for he believed them not, in order to relate that he remained in that condition a great part of the day, and he lay so without movement because he did not believe them. Concerning such fainting it is known that people shout to the fainting person and accustom him to that joyful event gradually until he accepts it with a tranquil spirit. And this is the meaning of the verse, And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them, and when he saw the wagons [which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived], (Verse 27 here.)  for they shouted into his ears the words of Joseph and brought the wagons before him. Then did his spirit return to him, and his breathing began and he was revived. It is this which Scripture says, And the spirit of Jacob their father revived. Now Onkelos translated: “The Divine Presence, [which had departed from him when he was in mourning], again rested upon him.” Onkelos added this because the thing is true, and he expounded this interpretation from the word ruach (spirit), since Scripture does not say, “and Jacob their father revived,” [but rather, and the spirit of Jacob their father revived]. He thus explained the verse here as being analogous to these verses: The spirit of the Eternal G-d is upon me; (Isaiah 61:1.)  And now the Eternal G-d hath sent me and His spirit; (Ibid., 48:16.)  A man in whom is spirit. (Numbers 27:18.) </p>

              <p>ויפג לכו. Aus der Analogie von מאין הפוגות (Klagel. 3, 49), Auf- hören wird das ויפג לבו gewöhnlich auch als: sein Herz stand stille, ging ihm aus, er ward ohnmächtig, natürlich vor Freude, verstanden, und findet man eine Bestätigung dieser Auffassung in dem dann folgenden ותחי רוח יעקב, das man als: &quot;er kam wieder zu sich&quot; erklärt. Es wäre auch an sich ganz natürlich, daß ein Greis von solcher Freude überwältigt worden, wenn nur nicht dabei stände: כי לא האמין להם! Wenn er ihnen nicht glaubte, so konnte er doch vor Freude nicht ohnmächtig werden. Es muss demnach das פוג anders zu fassen sein. פוג heißt: eine Bewegung, die zum Stillstand kommt, aufhört. ויפג לבו scheint daher: &quot;sein Sinn wurde stutzig&quot; zu bedeuten, sein Herz stand zweifelnd stille, denn er glaubte ihnen nicht; er konnte sich nicht so rasch in die ihm gewordene Nachricht hineinfinden.</p>

    According to Nachmanides the word is similar to the word ביטול, as in Lamentations 2,18 אל תתני פוגת לך, “give yourself no respite.” The word פוג always means that something active suddenly ceases to be so and becomes inert, like dead. Yaakov’s heart became cold and his blood circulation stopped. This is a well known phenomenon when someone suddenly receives unexpected good news and is overwhelmed by it. Yaakov fainted and lay on the floor as if dead. The Torah reports that it took Yaakov a long time to recover from his shock and to believe what the brothers had told him. The standard remedy used to bring someone who fainted at the receipt of good news to recover from his fainting spell, is to dance around him and make noise and display joy and elation. When the brothers repeated their conversation with Joseph, and when upon opening his eyes he beheld the carriages Joseph had sent, he began to believe them and to react accordingly.

Prayers for the life of Mashiach ben Yosef are seen as crucial for the beginning of the Redemption, with the Gaon emphasizing the importance of this prayer and mentioning the merit of his own ancestor, Rabbi Eliyahu Chasid, who was seen as Mashiach ben Yosef in his generation.</summary>

For as long as Yosef is still alive, King David of Israel is still alive and exists. Therefore, we pray daily for the life of Mashiach ben Yosef in the prayer that contains the words: “the throne of David, your servant, ” in the blessing “who builds Jerusalem.” This is explained above (#67) from the aspect of David’s throne (see above, chapter 1, section 21). The Gaon, who was the light of Mashiach ben Yosef used to pray daily the prayer “Yosef is still alive” for all 999 footsteps of the Mashiach during the beginning of the Redemption depend on him. When saying this prayer the Gaon would mention also the merit of the his own great-grandfather, Rabbi Eliyahu Chasid, who was Mashiach ben Yosef in his generation.

              <p>“They went up from Egypt, and they came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father” (Genesis 45:25).   “They told him, saying: Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over the entire land of Egypt. His heart was faint because he did not believe them (Genesis 45:26).  “They went up from Egypt…. They told him, saying: Joseph is still alive…his heart was faint” – Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: What is the plight of the liar? Even if he says truthful matters, he is not believed.  “They spoke to him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and he saw the wagons that Joseph sent to convey him, and the spirit of Jacob their father was revived” (Genesis 45:27).  “He saw the wagons” – the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him had idols etched on them. Judah stood and burned them. That tribe is experienced in burning idols. (See II Samuel 5:21; I Chronicles 14:12.)   Rabbi Levi [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan bar Shaul: [Joseph] said to them: ‘If he believes you, fine. If not, say to him: “At the moment that I took my leave of you, was I not engaged in [studying] the passage of the beheaded calf [egla]?’ That is what is written: “He saw the wagons [haagalot]…and the spirit…was revived.”  “Israel said: Enough, Joseph my son is still alive; I will go and see him before I die” (Genesis 45:28).  “Israel said: Enough [rav]” – the power of my son Joseph is great [rav], as many troubles befell him, but still he remained in his righteousness much more than I did, as I sinned when I said: “My way is hidden from the Lord” (Isaiah 40:27). But I am certain that I have a portion in “how great is Your goodness” (Psalms 31:20).

              <p>Another matter, “he sent Judah before him.” Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Aḥa, and Rabbi Ḥanina, one said: To arrange a residence for him. And one said: To arrange an academy in which he would teach Torah matters and in which the tribes would study. Know that it is so; when Joseph departed from him, he knew at which chapter that he was teaching him he left him. When Joseph’s brothers came to him and said to him: “Joseph is still alive… his heart was faint [because he did not believe them]” (Genesis 45:26). He remembered at which chapter he left him, and said to himself: I know that it was at the chapter of the beheaded calf [egla arufa] that Joseph left me. He said to them: ‘If you know at what chapter Joseph left me, I will believe you.’ Joseph, too, knew at what chapter he left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons [agalot], as it is stated: “Joseph gave them wagons by Pharaoh’s order” (Genesis 45:21). This is to teach you that everywhere Jacob would settle he would study Torah, just as his fathers would.  At this point, the Torah had not been given, but it is written of Abraham: “[Because Abraham heeded My voice,] and he kept My charge, [My commands, My decrees, and My Torahs]” (Genesis 26:5) – from where did Abraham learn the Torah? Rabban Shimon says: His two kidneys became like two jugs of water and they would gush Torah. From where is it derived that it is so? As it is stated: “Even on nights [my kidneys] instruct me” (Psalms 16:7). Rabbi Levi said: He studied Torah on his own, as it is stated: “The dissembler in his heart shall have his fill from his own ways, and a good man shall be satisfied from himself” (Proverbs 14:14). Rabbi Yonatan Sar HaBira said: Abraham knew even the joining of cooked foods, as it is stated: “Because Abraham heeded…” (Genesis 26:5). (The end of the verse mentions “My Torahs,” in plural, implying both the written and oral Torahs. The oral Torah includes even rabbinic laws, like the joining of cooked foods [eruv tavshilin]. The rabbis forbade cooking on a festival day for Shabbat unless one prepares two cooked items for Shabbat before the festival day (see Beitza 15b).)   How old was Abraham when he recognized his Creator? He recognized his Creator at the age of forty-eight years old. Reish Lakish said: At the age of three years old, as “ekev” is written, the numerical value of ekev, and Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years. (The verse states “because [ekev] Abraham heeded My voice…” The numerical value of the word ekev is one hundred and seventy-two, implying that Abraham heeded God’s voice for one hundred and seventy-two years. )  You learn from this that at age three, he recognized his Creator. He would observe the details of the Torah and would teach his children, as it is stated: “For I have loved him, [so that he will command his children and his household after him and they will observe the way of the Lord]” (Genesis 18:19). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You taught your children in this world, but in the World to Come, I, in My glory, will teach all of you the Torah,’ as it is stated: “All your children will be students of the Lord” (Isaiah 54:13).</p>

              <p>(Genesis 24:34): It was learned — there were 13 that never tasted the taste of death. These were them: The milcham [phoenix] bird and its [species], Enoch the son of Yered, Serah the daughter of Asher, Batya the daughter of Pharaoh, Jabez, Hiram the king of Tyre, Elijah, Ebed-melech the Kushite, the Messiah, the cohort of Jonadab the son of Rechab, Rabbi Judah the Prince's grandson, Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Levi, and Eliezer the servant of Abraham. Why the milcham bird? Because when Eve ate from the tree, and afterward they both gave [from it] to all the creatures to taste, when they gave [it] to the milcham bird, it did not want to eat [it]. The Holy One, blessed be He, [then] said, &quot;I will make it stand forever as an example for all the generations. It and its species will testify about the merit of the Jewish people in the future.&quot; And it is still in that city that the angel of death built, and they are fruitful and multiply like the other creatures. But when they become a thousand years old, they become small like a chick and then grow to be like an eagle and never die. Why Enoch? Since everyone in his generation was completely wicked and he was completely righteous. Hence, he resembled the ministering angels. Serah the daughter of Asher, because she had always been righteous. And when the sons of Jacob went up from Egypt and found Joseph alive, the holy spirit disappeared from Jacob until the day he was told, Joseph is still alive (Genesis 45:26). At that time, he said to her, &quot;You should likewise live forever.&quot; And it clung to her since she had always been righteous. So she is still sheltered in the Garden of Eden. Batya the daughter of Pharaoh, because she raised Moses and saved him from death. Jabez, because everyone in his generation was righteous, but he was the greatest of them all. And he was Othniel the son of Kenaz. Hiram the king of Tyre went into the Garden of Eden but left. He entered because he toiled [in building] the Temple. Hence they placed him in the Garden of Eden for 400 years. In the end, he became haughty-hearted and said: I am a god; I sit enthroned like a god (Ezekiel 28:2) — hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Ezekiel: say to the prince of Tyre, &quot;Because you have been so haughty [... You have been] in Eden, the Garden of God, etc.&quot; (Ezekiel 28:2-13). So He therefore expelled him from the Garden of Eden and he is [now] in Geihinnom. And were it not that the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to punish Hiram, the Temple would still not be destroyed. As it were, the Temple would have been embarrassed to [take part in] hurting Hiram. Once the Temple was destroyed, He permitted the ministering angels to give him his full sentence for everything he said in front of the divine presence. Why Elijah? Because he was a righteous zealot, son of a zealot. Hence He gave him a covenant of peace to live forever. Ebed-melech the Kushite, because he had mercy upon the prophet Jeremiah, peace be upon him, and took him out from the pit. [So] Jeremiah prayed for him to the Holy One, blessed be He, and He gave Him eternal life. Why the Messiah? Because he was in a wicked generation and he saw his fathers, the kings of the House of David, worshipping idolatry; but he repudiated them and chose the Holy One, blessed be He, and sought mercy for the Jewish people, to fast and to pray for them, as it is stated: But he was wounded because of our sins, etc. and by his bruises we were healed (Isaiah 53:5). Hence he was hidden, so that he will redeem the Jewish people with the ingathering of the exiles and rejoice with them during the resurrection of the dead. Why Jonadab and his cohort? Because he was in a wicked generation, but when he heard the rebukes that Jeremiah was giving over to the Jewish people at the time of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah, that the Temple would be destroyed in the future and the Jewish people exiled, he stood and made his children and all of his cohort take an oath that they would not build houses, etc. so that you may live long (Jeremiah 35:7). Because of this, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: There shall [never] cease to be a man of the line of Jonadab, etc. (Jeremiah 35:19). And they are still in the land of Eden and they will live forever. Rabbi Judah the Prince's grandson, due to his great humility and righteousness, he was of a lowly spirit. He never lifted his eyes even towards his wife, all the more so towards the wife of his fellow. And due to his great modesty and fear [of God], he merited to enter the Garden of Eden while living. Why Rabbi Yehoshua the son of Levi? Since he never asked [to annul] his oath, and [due to] that which happened with the angel of death. Eliezer, because he said, &quot;I am a descendant of Cham who was cursed together with his descendants by Noah to be a servant to his brothers forever. It is better for me to serve a servant of God, may He be blessed, and not to serve a servant of idolatry.&quot; So he converted and stood with Abraham to learn humility, righteousness, and justice. Come and see his humility! For when they wanted to honor him greatly in Aram Neharaim, he belittled himself and said: I am the servant of Abraham (Genesis 24:34). And also [because] he was suspected of something that was not true about him. </p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT. This text is related (to Hos. 11:4): WITH HUMAN TIES I DREW THEM IN, WITH BANDS OF LOVE. (See Gen. R. 86:1.)  Israel would have deservedly gone down to Egypt in chains and collaria, (The Latin word means “neck chains.”)  just as they went down to Babylon, had not Joseph gone first. All that happened to Joseph happened to Zion. (See below, 11:11.)  That which is written of Joseph is written of Zion. It is written of Joseph (in Gen. 39:6): BEAUTIFULLY BUILT WITH A BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE; and it is written of Zion (in Lam. 2:15): A PERFECTION OF BEAUTY. For this reason Jacob was afraid to go down to Egypt: Because it had been decreed over Abraham (in Gen. 15:13): KNOW FULL WELL THAT YOUR SEED SHALL BE ALIEN IN A LAND &lt; NOT THEIRS WHERE THEY SHALL SERVE THEM AND BE OPPRESSED BY THEM &gt;. So he dwelt in the land of Canaan. They came and said to him: Joseph was sold when he resembled a bull. It is so stated (of Joseph in Deut. 33:17): LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY. And here he is ensconced in Egypt (Gen. 45:26)! When Jacob heard this, he said: See, I am going down to Egypt even though I am paying Abraham's bill (of indebtedness). Immediately (it says in Gen. 45:28): THEN ISRAEL SAID: ENOUGH, MY SON JOSEPH IS ALIVE. &lt; I WILL GO AND SEE HIM BEFORE I DIE &gt;. Immediately all the tribes went down with him. Who caused them to go down to Egypt? Joseph. (Hos. 11:4:) WITH HUMAN TIES I DREW THEM IN. This &lt; HUMAN &gt; is Joseph. (Gen. 39:1:) WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT.</p>

What is the meaning of &lt; TO TEACH BEFORE HIM &gt;? R. Nehemiah said: To establish an academy for him where he would teach Torah so that the tribes might study Torah. (Gen. R. 95:3; Tanh., Gen. 11:11; also Gen. R. 94:3.)  You know that this is so; &lt; for &gt;, when Joseph had left him, Jacob knew at what chapter he had left him because he had taught him. When Joseph's brothers came and said to him (in Gen. 44:26): JOSEPH IS STILL ALIVE &lt; … &gt; HIS HEART GREW FAINT, because he did not believe it, as stated (ibid.): FOR HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM. Jacob recalled at what chapter Joseph had left him. He said to them: Did he give you a sign (Gk.: semeion.)  &lt; indicating &gt; at what chapter Joseph left me? Jacob said in his heart: I know that he left me at the chapter on the heifer ('GLH, i.e., Deut. 21:1-9). He said to them: Say at what chapter he left me, and I will believe you. Joseph also recalled at what chapter he had left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons ('GLH in the singular), as stated (in Gen. 45:21): SO JOSEPH GAVE THEM WAGONS. &lt; This verse is &gt; to teach you that in every place that he went he was busy at Torah, just as his ancestors had been, even though the Torah had not yet been given. Ergo, it is written of Abraham (in Gen. 26:5): AND HE KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS. From where did Abraham learn the Torah? R. Simeon ben Johay says: &lt; His &gt; two kidneys became like two full vessels which spouted forth Torah. And where is it shown? Where it says so (in Ps. 16:17): EVEN IN THE NIGHTS MY KIDNEYS ADMONISH ME. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Jonathan ben Eleazar Ish haBirah: Our father Abraham even knew the eruvim of cooked foods. (See above, 3:14; also 3:1.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): BECAUSE ('QB 'ShR) ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE, &lt; AND KEPT MY CHARGE &gt;…. Now at the age of three Abraham recognized his Creator, as stated (through the first word of this verse): 'QB (with a numerical value of 172). Since all the days of Abraham were one hundred and seventy-five, from here (Gen. 26:5) you learn (by simple subtraction) that at the age of three he had recognized him and that he was even keeping the fine points of Torah. He also taught his children, as stated (in Gen. 18:19): FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &lt; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD, TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE &gt;…. The Holy One said to him: You have taught your children Torah in this world, but in the world to come I in my glory will teach them the Torah, as stated (in Is. 54:13): AND ALL YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE TAUGHT BY THE LORD, AND GREAT SHALL BE YOUR CHILDREN'S PROSPERITY.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>And he sent Judah before him (Gen. 46:28). Jacob sent Judah before him to establish an academy wherein he might teach the Torah as he had previously done for the tribes. You know that he taught his sons earlier from the fact that Jacob remembered the chapter of the Torah that Joseph was studying with him at the time of his disappearance. When Joseph’s brothers returned and told him: “Joseph is yet alive” … his heart fainted, for he believed them not (Gen. 45:26). Jacob recalled the chapter of the Torah that Joseph was studying at the time of his departure, and he said to himself: “I know that he was studying the portion devoted to the beheaded heifer.” (See Deut. 21:1–9.)  Whereupon he turned to them and said: “If he gave you something to indicate the chapter he was studying when he departed from here, I will believe you.” Joseph had also remembered the chapter he was studying when he was separated from his father. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons (ibid., v. 21). When Jacob saw the wagons (‘agalot), the spirit of their father revived forthwith. (Word-play relating ‘agalot (“wagons”) to kelayot (“kidneys”), stated in the next paragraph to be the organ through which Abraham learned and retained the law.)  This teaches us that wherever Joseph went, he devoted himself to the law, as his ancestors had done before him, even though the Torah itself had not yet been given. And thus it is written: Because that Abraham hearkened to My voice and kept My laws (Gen. 26:5).</p>

              <p>Understanding for Eitan the Citizen. The mercies of the Lord I will sing forever; to generation and generation I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth. This is what the Scripture says (Jeremiah 9:23-24), &quot;Thus says the Lord, 'Let not a wise man boast of his wisdom, and let not the mighty man boast of his might, let not a rich man boast of his riches; but let him who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the Lord who exercises lovingkindness, justice and righteousness on earth; for I delight in these things,' declares the Lord.&quot; Eitan the Citizen said, &quot;I have gained understanding, and so I will sing of Your mercies forever.&quot; The Lord said to him, &quot;You have gained understanding, for in these things I delight. Whoever praises Me, let him praise Me in these things alone. As it is said (Hosea 6:6), 'For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, and in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.'&quot; David said, &quot;You desire mercy, and so I will praise You for Your mercy.&quot; Therefore it is said (Psalm 62:13), &quot;But to You, O Lord, belongs mercy.&quot; And it is not just one mercy, but many mercies. Isaiah also says (Isaiah 63:7), &quot;I shall make mention of the lovingkindnesses of the Lord.&quot; Therefore it says, &quot;those mercies of the Lord.&quot; They asked Eitan, &quot;On what does the world stand?&quot; He said to them, &quot;I have said, 'The world will be built on mercy; the heavens will be established through mercy.'&quot; And not just the heavens, but even the throne itself does not stand except through mercy, as it says (Psalm 89:15), &quot;Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne; lovingkindness and truth go before You.&quot; It is like a throne that has four legs, and one of them was collapsing, so they took a bundle and leaned it against it. Likewise, the heavenly throne was collapsing until the Lord supported it, and with what did He support it? With mercy. &quot;The world will be built on mercy.&quot; David also says (Psalm 136:5), &quot;To Him who made the heavens with skill, for His mercy endures forever.&quot; And by whose means do they stand through mercy? As it says (Psalm 100:5), &quot;For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, and His faithfulness endures to all generations.&quot; And so with every psalm. And afterwards it says (Psalms 145:15), &quot;He provides food for all flesh,&quot; to teach you that the difficulties of a person's sustenance are equivalent to all the acts of creation. Rabbi Elazar says, &quot;Why is sustenance compared to redemption? Just as redemption is miraculous, so too sustenance is miraculous. Just as sustenance is provided every day, so too redemption is provided every day.&quot; Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani says, &quot;Sustenance is greater than redemption.&quot; I have said, &quot;The world is built on kindness.&quot; A parable to what is the world similar? (And the glory of the Holy One, blessed be He,) It is similar to a king who had treasure houses filled with all kinds of goodness, and he said, &quot;Upon what are these treasures lying? I shall take servants and feed them and give them drink, and they shall praise me.&quot; Thus, the world was void and without form, and He created the world and created man and granted him dominion over all goodness in order to praise Him. And it is written (Psalms 150:6), &quot;Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.&quot; And it says (Psalms 41:14), &quot;Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.&quot; Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yose ben Zimra, &quot;Amen, Amen.&quot; Amen to an oath, amen to acceptance. Amen, Amen, as it is said (Genesis 45:26), &quot;And they believed him.&quot; Amen to an oath, as it is said (Numbers 5:22), &quot;And the woman shall say, 'Amen.'&quot; Amen to acceptance, as it is said (Nehemiah 8:6), &quot;And all the people answered, 'Amen, Amen,' with lifted hands.&quot; Amen in this world and amen in the world to come.</p>

            <summary>Yitro was so overjoyed by the news of the Jewish people's liberation that his skin broke out in goose-pimples, a physical reaction to overwhelming joy. The term used for passing out in Psalms 38:9 is also found in Genesis 45:26, indicating a connection. The term &quot;his heart went numb&quot; in Genesis 45:26 is explained by Rambam in Mishnah Yoma 1:7 as a way to drive away sleep by standing on cold marble. Da'at Zekenim on Genesis 42:1 discusses Yaakov's ability to see what his sons could not, despite their proximity, and the reasons why Joseph did not communicate with his father for 22 years.</summary>

                <h4>Da'at Zekenim on Genesis 42:1:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>וירא יעקב כי יש שר ב מצרים, “Yaakov ‘saw’ that there was grain-trading in Egypt;” this is what Solomon had in mind when he said in Proverbs 20,12: אוזן שומעת ועין רואה ה' עשה גם שניהם, “the ear that hears, and the eye that sees, the Lord has made them both.” What prompted Solomon to make such a banal sounding statement? Did G–d not make the whole body? Why did he single out the ear and the eye? The answer is that all parts of the body, in due course, will have to give an accounting for their activities while they were alive on earth, except the ear and the eye. What is the reason for this? The eye sees things which are not good for it to see, and so does the ear hear things which are not good for it to hear. [involuntary perceptions. Ed.] This is not true of the other organs or limbs. You choose what the mouth eats, etc., you choose where your legs are to take you, etc. Rabbi said that the words: וירא יעקב, “Yaakov saw,” although he was an old man sitting hundreds of miles away, what his ten sons who were going in and out and meeting all kinds of people, did not see. All this was although both Yaakov and Joseph had been blessed with the spirit of prophecy. Joseph was only a distance of 4 or 5 days travel away from them, and when they searched for him they did not find him. Furthermore, why did Joseph not communicate with his father during all these years which would have spared his father a great deal of grief? The answer is that they all had sworn a sacred oath not to reveal to their father that he was in Egypt. They had made G–d a partner to their oath, so that He too could not reveal their secret to him. All this can be proved from Scripture, when before revealing himself to his brothers (Genesis 45,1) he commanded that all the people around him remove themselves before he would have that conversation with his brothers. He did not want that anyone would ever hear about that oath which had now expired. Other commentators offer a different reason for why Joseph had not communicated with his father for 22 years. As long as he had been a slave (13 years) he did not want to increase his father’s grief by informing him of his sorry condition. If he were to end a message that in the meantime he had become a king, his father would not believe him; he was right as his father did not even believe this when all his sons told that they had seen it with their own eyes. (Genesis 45,26) In addition, he was afraid that if his father were to leak his new found knowledge to someone, the brothers would each flee in all directions out of fear of his vengeance. As a result, his father would experience additional grief. This is why he waited until the time would be ripe for him to reveal himself, so that he would first reveal himself to his brothers before informing his father of his survival and the good fortune which had befallen him.</p>

              <p>The meaning of stone is the very thing. (Stone represents essence, the very thing. The reference is to Jacob and his family. Cf. Rashi.)  Some say (The reference is to Rabbi Isaac ibn Giat (Weiser, Cherez).)  that mi-sham (from thence) should be interpreted from that time. However, we never find the word sham (there) to have this meaning anywhere in Scripture. This commentator also interprets the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel as meaning: the one whose heart died and was as stone, (The reference is to Jacob whose heart died within him when he was told that Joseph was alive (Gen. 45:26,27). In I Sam. 25:37 such an experience is described as the heart turning to stone (Weiser, Cherez). According to Krinsky the reference is to Jacob and his family who would have died (their hearts would have turned to stone) had Joseph not fed them.)  but who revived to feed (ro’eh), i.e., to live by eating. However, this interpretation is farfetched.</p>

              <p>It appears that Yitro was so overjoyed when he heard about the total liberation of the Jewish people that his skin broke out in goose-pimples. It is a well known fact that when a person experiences an unexpected overpowering feeling of joy he develops a physical reaction; sometimes he may pass out or even die from shock. Read what I have written on Genesis 45,26 about Jacob's reaction when told that Joseph was still alive. Although Yitro had previously heard part of the good news, the story Moses told him about the death of the guardian angel of Egypt made his skin crawl.</p>

And again when Jacob disbelieved those who told him that “Joseph lives and is ruler over all Egypt,” he was in an “ecstasy,” we are told, “in his mind, for he did not believe them” (Gen. 45:26). Also in Exodus, in the account of the congregation, it says, “for Mount Sinai was all covered with smoke, because God came down to it in fire and the smoke rose up like vapour of a furnace, and all the people were in a great ‘ecstasy’ ” (Ex. 19:18). Also in Leviticus at the completion of the sacrifices on the eighth day, when “fire came out from heaven and devoured what was on the altar, both the whole burnt offerings and the fats”; for the next words are, “and all the people saw it and were in an ‘ecstasy,’ and fell upon their faces” (Lev. 9:24): a natural consequence, for an “ecstasy” in this sense produces great agitation and terrible consternation.</p>

        <summary>Yaakov's spirit was revived upon seeing the wagons sent by Yosef, symbolizing the connection between worldly matters and the divine; Yosef hinted at redemption and inheritance of Israel. The brothers lied to Yaakov about selling Yosef, who was unaware of their actions until seeing the carriages sent by Yosef, reviving his spirit and prophetic insights. The Rambam believes Yaakov criticized Shimon and Levi for selling Yosef, while the Ramban disagrees. Moral imperfections can lessen prophetic inspiration, with certain vices causing it to be entirely withdrawn. The Holy Spirit withdraws during spiritual separation but returns upon reconnection, as seen with Yaakov and Yosef. The sale of Yosef led to a famine, but his brothers' reunion in Egypt lifted the excommunication pact and revived Yaakov's spirit. Judah's bones rolled until Moses implored mercy, Jacob's soul was restored upon learning Yosef was alive, and Israel's death reflected a higher spiritual level. Rashi explains that Yaakov's spirit was revived upon reuniting with Yosef, and Da'at Zekenim discusses how the Holy Spirit returned when the brothers' oath was released. Rabbi Shimon discusses the punishment for a liar using the example of Yaakov's sons deceiving him about Yosef, with some suggesting Yaakov regained the Holy Spirit upon learning the truth. In Deuteronomy 21, laws regarding unknown murders, captive women, inheritance, wayward sons, and burial practices are outlined. Yaakov's spirit of prophecy was revived upon hearing Yosef's words and seeing the wagons sent by him.</summary>

It was difficult for Yaakov to go down to Mitzrayim, but this is why Yosef preceded him. Yosef represents the connection between worldly matters and the inner divine element (pnimius) within them, nullifying all externalities. The wagons (עגלות) symbolize this idea, as their root word עיגול means circle, indicating that everything returns to its source and is unified. This concept is also mentioned in the sefer Kedushas Levi. Initially, Yaakov did not believe his sons because his connection to them was through Yosef. The brothers acted as a chariot for Yaakov, and it was through Yosef that Yaakov was drawn to them. When he saw the wagons, he realized the deeper message and his spirit was revived.</p>

            <summary>Jacob was never told by his sons that they had sold Joseph, as they feared his wrath and Joseph's good ethical conduct prevented him from revealing the truth. The brothers lied to Jacob, claiming he had instructed them to tell Joseph to forgive them after his death, showing that Jacob was unaware of their actions. When Jacob saw the carriages Joseph sent, he realized that only a ruler could have authorized their departure from Egypt, reviving his spirit and prophetic insights that had departed when Joseph was sold. Joseph sent the carriages as a reminder to Jacob of their last discussion, hinting at the laws of the heifer that is thrown off a cliff to atone for an unknown murder, to which only Joseph and Jacob were privy. The carriages were a symbol of Joseph's message to his father, as he was the only one who could have sent them due to the restrictions on exporting cows from Egypt.</summary>

              <p>.אשר שלח יוסף, “that Joseph had sent.” Yaakov reasoned that if the sender had not been my son, no one else would have gone to the trouble to send me carriages to be riding in on my journey . Rashi adds that the consonants in the word עגלה have a dual meaning; they can mean eglah, “a heifer,” or they can mean agalah, “carriage.” Joseph wished to remind his father that the last subject that they had discussed together were the laws pertaining to the heifer that is thrown off a cliff to atone for a murder committed by persons unknown. (Deuteronomy chapter 21) If you were to ask how these carriages were a memorable symbol of their discussion? When the Torah reports Yaakov as having accompanied Joseph part of the descent from the mountain on which Chevron is situated, Joseph is reported to have said to him that he should go back. In other words, there could not have been a connection to the subject of the eglah arufah, where our sages assume that the murdered person had not been accompanied, or he would have become the object of murder. His father had then told him that the subject of accompanying a departing guest would rank highly in the Torah in the future. The reason that Joseph reminded him of that was that it was something to which no one else could have been privy. The almost unbelievable text in Deuteronomy has the Supreme Court members proclaiming that it was not they who had murdered the unknown victim. Who could have dared to accuse them of having done so? No one could have dreamt up such a paragraph in the Torah! Joseph made use of the play on words: eglah/agalah. A different explanation: Joseph had placed heifers on the carriages, which would remind his father of their last conversation in case he had forgotten. Concerning the carriages being once described as Pharaoh’s, and once as Joseph’s: it was forbidden to export cows unless their wombs had been removed so that they could not multiply in other countries. (Talmud, Bechorot, 28). In this instance, an exception was made and express permission from Pharaoh was granted. When the carriages were described as having been sent by Pharaoh, the meaning is that Pharaoh had given his permission, but the animals were owned by Joseph.</p>

              <p>וידברו אליו את כל דברי יוסף, “they said to him all the words Joseph had spoken. According to Rashi, Joseph conveyed to his father a code word that would convince him that only he could have known this. It concerned the subject matter that his father and he had been discussing when he accompanied him part of the way on his fateful journey. It dealt with someone being found dead on the road, someone whom no one knew and who had nothing on him that could identify him. This subject is discussed in chapter 21.of the Book of Deuteronomy. The hint was contained in the translation of the word וישלחהו, “he sent him off,” which the Targum renders in Genesis 12,20 when Pharaoh sent Avraham home as ואלויאו, “he gave him safe conduct.” Joseph had at the time told his father to go home, to which Yaakov had replied that it was a virtuous act to accompany someone departing some distance. He acquainted him at the time with the paragraph quoted from Deuteronomy chapter 21. He even pointed out the fact that failing to accompany a departing guest some distance, could make such a person liable to have to swear a sacred oath that he had not been negligent in this respect. The subject is discussed in the Talmud tractate Sotah chapter nine at length, where it is presumed that the word עגלות was supposed to refer to the heifer that would be the animal offered as atonement for this sin of negligence by the townspeople closest to the murdered person. Other commentators believe that what Yaakov and Joseph had been discussing was the subject of a carriage being pulled by a heifer (compare Sotah, folio 46.) In either event, it seems very forced to see in the carriages Joseph had sent to carry Yaakov’s family a reference to the word עגלה, heifer. It is more plausible that the hint had to do with the carriages used by the Jewish people to transport the parts of the Tabernacle that could not be carried on the shoulders of the Levites. (Compare Numbers 7,3)</p>

Ed.] Now Pharaoh had relented and instructed Joseph to bring his family to Egypt by means of carriages. This turnaround convinced Yaakov that he and his family would be welcome in Egypt. He realised that such a command could only have been given by Pharaoh himself. [He had attributed antisemitic feeling in Egypt as dating back to when his grandmother had almost been raped there, had G–d not interfered. (Compare Genesis chapter 12 and the derogatory term used by Potiphar’s wife about the ‘Hebrew’ slave in Genesis 39,18. Ed.]

              <p>וידברו אליו את כל דברי יוסף אשר דבר אליהם, “they told him all the words Joseph had said to them.” According to Nachmanides what they told Yaakov was as follows: “Your son Joseph has said: ‘G’d appointed me as ruler over the whole land of Egypt, etc. etc. G’d has sent me to be the provider of my whole family, etc.’,” When they told Yaakov all this they failed to mention that Joseph had added the words “you who have sold me to Egypt.” Yaakov was never told of this. He was left under the impression that Joseph had lost his way at the time he tried to locate his brothers at or near Dothan, and that the members of some caravan who had found him had kidnapped him and sold him to Egypt. The brothers on their part did not tell their father about their part in the sale of Joseph as they did not want to incriminate themselves. In addition, they were afraid that if they would tell their father about their share in Joseph’s disappearance he would curse them as he did on his deathbed when he referred to the sins of Reuven, Shimon and Levi.  Joseph, in his humility and dedication to maintaining peaceful relations with his brothers, never told his father either. This leaves us with the problem of why the brothers claimed after Yaakov’s funeral that the latter had asked them to tell Joseph to forgive them (Genesis 50,14). Actually, these words were proof that Yaakov had never known about who had sold Joseph. Had he known about it surely the brothers would have begged their father to intercede with Joseph while he was still alive and to beg Joseph personally to forgive his brothers. Surely Joseph would not have refused such a request by his father.</p>

We have an ancient tradition, amply documented in history, that in the absence of joy in one’s life a person cannot enjoy such a spirit of prophecy. On the way to Egypt, at Beer Sheva, the prophetic spirit of Yaakov (Yisrael) did indeed become manifest again (46,2)

              <p>AND THEY TOLD HIM ALL THE WORDS OF JOSEPH. It is my opinion, in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, that it was never told to Jacob throughout his entire lifetime that the brothers had sold Joseph. Rather he thought that Joseph had strayed in the field, and those who found him took him and sold him into Egypt. The brothers did not want to tell him of their sin, being afraid for their lives lest he be wroth and curse them as he did to Reuben, Simeon and Levi, (Further, 49: 3-7.)  while Joseph in his good ethical conduct did not want to tell him. It is for this reason that it is said, And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying: Thy father did command before he died, etc. (Ibid., 50:16.)  And had Jacob known of this matter, it would have been proper for them to plead before their father at the time of his death to command Joseph by word of his mouth, for he would have granted his father’s request and not rebelled against his word, and they would not have been in danger, nor would they need to feign words out of their own hearts.

What proof did they bring? Perforce, “He gave them a sign... the topic of עגלה ערופה.” I.e., the word העגלות that is written in the verse should be read as הrֶגְלות (the heifers). You might ask: How did Yaakov decide to teach him the subject of עגלה ערופה when they parted? The answer is: When Yoseif left, Yaakov escorted him until the depths of Chevron, as Rashi explained on the verse (37:14), “And he sent Yoseif from the depths of Chevron.” Yoseif said to him, “You should go back.” Yaakov answered, “I am not permitted to go back. A person must escort his fellow [on the way], as it is written in the section of עגלה ערופה (Devarim 21:7): ‘Our hands have not spilled this blood,’ [which means:] ‘We did not dismiss him without escort,’” as Rashi explains there. Consequently, he taught him the subject of עגלה ערופה.

Once he felt joy in his life once more, the holy spirit that had been absent since Joseph’s disappearance overcame him again
    According to the Midrash which understands the gift of carriages as a reminder by Joseph to his father that after all these years he had not forgotten that the last subject in which his father had instructed him had been the subject known as עגלה ערופה, the heifer which is killed by the judges of the Supreme Court in expiation of any indirect guilt in a unresolved murder on holy soil, we must understand our verse in terms of the two principles known as יש אם למקרא, ויש אם למסורה, that (normally) the unusual spelling of a word draws attention to a double meaning intended by the author. No one would argue that the carriages had not been sent for transporting Yaakov and family. But these “carriages” had an additional significance. This is why the Torah, instead of describing them as having been sent by Pharaoh, describes them as having been sent by Joseph, a slight but significant inaccuracy. It was to alert Yaakov that his son had not forgotten, in spite of his position at the Egyptian court, what had been the last lesson his father had taught him before he had sent him on the errand to see how his brothers were doing in Shechem. [in this instance it is not the spelling but the change in the description of the sender of the carriages. Joseph had actually sent heifers, עגלות, also, a double entendre of the word עגלות. Clearly, these had not been intended to pull the carriages. Ed.] Some commentators believe that the brothers did not transport grain in carriages but on their donkeys, [in small quantities. Ed] for if they had transported wagon-loads of grain, it would have looked as if they were depleting Egypt of its reserves of grain. In order to do this, special permission from Pharaoh himself was needed.

              </summary>
              <p>Thou must not be surprised to learn, however, that a few moral imperfections lessen the degree of prophetic inspiration; in fact, we find that some moral vices cause prophecy to be entirely withdrawn. Thus, for instance, wrath may do this, as our Rabbis say, &quot;If a prophet becomes enraged, the spirit of prophecy departs from him&quot;. (Pesaḥim 66 b. Cf. Moreh, II, 36 (end))  They adduce proof for this from the case of Elisha, from whom, when he became enraged, prophecy departed, until his wrath had subsided, at which he exclaimed, &quot;And now bring me a musician!&quot; (II K. III, 15. See Pesaḥim 117 a.)   Grief and anxiety may also cause a cessation of prophecy, as in the case of the patriarch Jacob who, during the days when he mourned for Joseph, was deprived of the Holy Spirit, until he received the news that his son lived, whereupon Scripture says, &quot;The spirit of Jacob, their father, revived&quot;, (Gen. XLV, 27.)  which the Targum (M. attached a great deal of importance to the Targum of Onkelos in the elucidation of many biblical passages, and refers to it many times in the Moreh. In Moreh, I, 27, he speaks of Onkelos, the proselyte, as being thoroughly acquainted with the Hebrew and Chaldaic languages. See Frankel, Hodegetik, p. 322, and Bacher, Die Bibelexegese Moses Maimunis, pp. 38-42.)  renders, &quot;And the spirit of prophecy descended upon their father, Jacob&quot;. The sages, moreover, say, &quot;The spirit of prophecy rests not upon the idle, nor upon the sad, but upon the joyous&quot;. (Shabbat, 30 b; Pesaḥim, loc. cit.: שאין השכינה שורה לא מתוך עצלות ולא מתוך עצבות ולא מתוך שחוק ולא מתוך קלות ראש לא מתוך דברים בטלים אלא מתוך דבר שמחה של מצוה. Cf. Moreh, II, 36 (end).) </p>

However, when he rejoiced over the tidings that Yosef was alive, the verse states, (Genesis 45:27)  “The spirit of Yaakov was revived,” that is, the Holy Spirit (Ru’ach HaKodesh) returned and rested upon him.

            <summary>The sale of Joseph led to a famine in Canaan, prompting his brothers to go to Egypt where they found Joseph alive, leading to the lifting of the excommunication pact and the revival of Jacob's spirit. The atonement for the sale of Joseph was not complete until the brothers died. When Jacob heard that Joseph was alive, his spirit was revived. The wagons sent by Joseph had idols on them, which were burned by Judah. Joseph instructed his brothers to mention the beheaded calf to convince Jacob of the truth. Jacob acknowledged Joseph's righteousness and expressed his desire to see him before he died, confident in his own place in the World to Come.</summary>

              <p>“They went up from Egypt, and they came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father” (Genesis 45:25).   “They told him, saying: Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over the entire land of Egypt. His heart was faint because he did not believe them (Genesis 45:26).  “They went up from Egypt…. They told him, saying: Joseph is still alive…his heart was faint” – Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: What is the plight of the liar? Even if he says truthful matters, he is not believed.  “They spoke to him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and he saw the wagons that Joseph sent to convey him, and the spirit of Jacob their father was revived” (Genesis 45:27).  “He saw the wagons” – the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him had idols etched on them. Judah stood and burned them. That tribe is experienced in burning idols. (See II Samuel 5:21; I Chronicles 14:12.)   Rabbi Levi [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan bar Shaul: [Joseph] said to them: ‘If he believes you, fine. If not, say to him: “At the moment that I took my leave of you, was I not engaged in [studying] the passage of the beheaded calf [egla]?’ That is what is written: “He saw the wagons [haagalot]…and the spirit…was revived.”  “Israel said: Enough, Joseph my son is still alive; I will go and see him before I die” (Genesis 45:28).  “Israel said: Enough [rav]” – the power of my son Joseph is great [rav], as many troubles befell him, but still he remained in his righteousness much more than I did, as I sinned when I said: “My way is hidden from the Lord” (Isaiah 40:27). But I am certain that I have a portion in “how great is Your goodness” (Psalms 31:20). (Jacob knew through divine inspiration that if none of his sons were to die during his lifetime, he would be assured of a place in the World to Come (Etz Yosef, based on Tanḥuma (Warsaw ed.)

              <p>It was because of this episode that a famine befell Canaan, compelling Joseph’s ten brothers to descend to Egypt to buy grain, where they discovered that Joseph was still alive. (Only then) did they abrogate the pact of excommunication and Jacob learned that Joseph was alive. It is written about him: The spirit of Jacob their father revived (Gen. 45:27). Had his spirit actually died? No! His spirit was revived from the despair that resulted from the vow of excommunication they had entered into, and the Holy Spirit had departed from him because of it, but now it hovered over him once again.</p>

Owing to the sale (of Joseph) a famine came into the land of Israel for seven years, and the brethren of Joseph &quot;went down to buy corn&quot; (Gen. 42:3) in Egypt. And they found Joseph (still) living, and they absolved themselves of the ban; and Jacob heard about Joseph that he was living, and his soul and his spirit revived. Did their father Jacob's spirit die, so that it had to be revived? But, owing to the ban, the Holy Spirit had departed from him, and when they had removed the ban the Holy Spirit rested on him as at first; that || is what is written, &quot;The spirit of Jacob their father revived&quot; (Gen. 45:27).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Another awesome thing which befell Judah: Our sags of blessed memory have said (Sotah 7b): &quot;All those years that Israel was in the desert, the bones of Judah were 'rolling around' in his casket, until Moses arose and implored mercy for him. He said… (Devarim 33:7): 'Hear, O L-rd, the voice of Judah' — at which his limbs reunited. But he was not yet brought to the Heavenly synod, at which Moses said (Ibid.): 'and to his people shall You bring him.' But he could not engage in halachic converse with the sages there, at which Moses said (Ibid.): 'Let his hands do battle for him', etc.&quot; All this befell him because he had said (Bereshith 43:9): &quot;If I do not bring him [Benjamin] to you and present him to you [alive], I shall have sinned against you all the days.&quot; __ But he did bring him! But, &quot;the curse of a sage is fulfilled even if the condition [(in this instance, bringing him back)] is fulfilled&quot; (Makkoth 11b). And we have already said that whatever issues from a man's mouth is by Divine providence, so that the L-rd's will was being enacted here. It seems to me that the explanation is as follows: It is known that they [the brothers] placed a ban on anyone who would reveal this [(the sale of Joseph)] to our father Jacob, and they included the Shechinah in this ban, wherefore the Holy Spirit [of prophecy] was removed from our father Jacob (until the end [of the episode], where it is written (Ibid. 45:27): &quot;And the spirit of Jacob their father revived,&quot; which Onkelos translates: &quot;And the Holy Spirit [again] reposed upon him.&quot;) And because of this ban it was decreed upon him [Judah] that holiness depart from him entirely, (as any man who is excommunicated), wherefore Judah was constrained to accept excommunication upon himself, as it is written: &quot;And I shall have sinned against my father all of the days.&quot;</p>

He thus became his own re incarnation. That re-incarnation was no longer subject to physical death. &quot;Death&quot; happened only to the part of the Jacob-Israel personality known as Israel. This is the deeper meaning of 47,29: ויקרבו ימי ישראל למות, &quot;the death of the person called Israel drew near.&quot; The spiritual part of Jacob's soul (נפש) called Israel, was on a higher level than the spiritual part of the נפש called Jacob. Jacob's request to Joseph to perform a חסד של אמת emanated from his “ישראל” aspect. The word עמדי emphasized that he was speaking in his capacity as ישראל.</p>

            <summary>Rashi explains that Jacob sent Judah ahead to prepare living quarters for the family in Goshen and establish a Torah academy, which revived Jacob's spirit upon reuniting with Joseph (Genesis 45:27). Da'at Zekenim discusses how Jacob's spirit was revived when he learned Joseph was alive, as the brothers' oath not to reveal what they had done to Joseph was released, allowing the Holy Spirit to return (Genesis 45:27).</summary>
            <details>
              <summary>
                <h4>Da'at Zekenim on Genesis 37:35:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>ויבך אותו אביו, “his father wept for him (losing him).” According to Rashi, the word: “his father,” in this verse refers to Yitzchok, Yaakov’s father. He was however, not mourning him as he knew that Joseph was still alive. He did not want to reveal this to Yaakov out of respect for G–d, who had not seen fit to reveal this to his son. (B‘reshit Rabbah 84,21) Rashi had already explained that the brothers had sworn a solemn oath one to another not to reveal what they had done Joseph to anyone, and they had included G–d in that oath of theirs. When, after 22 years they came to Egypt and found Joseph alive, they cancelled this oath. This released G–d also, and that is why the Torah wrote that upon hearing that Joseph was alive and well, the bothers’ father Yaakov “revived,” i.e. again was blessed with Holy Spirit. (Genesis 45,27). From this verse it is clear that ever since Joseph’s disappearance he had not enjoyed the presence of the Holy Spirit. From this entire chapter we learn and can prove that when an entire congregation unanimously declares something or someone as “banished,” and a single member of that congregation demurs by not accepting that decision, he is bound by the decision of the congregation, nonetheless. After all, Joseph had not been a party to the brothers’ oath, and it had remained in force nonetheless. If Joseph had been part of that oath, the other brothers would not have had to include in their oath. They had been lacking Reuven and Binyamin to make up the necessary quorum by themselves. Although Joseph was aware of this, he did not wish to interfere with that oath by revealing his whereabouts to his father. The author promises to also provide an alternate reason why Joseph did not let his father know during all these years that he had been alive and well. If you were to argue that the ban into which the brothers had put the subject of the sale of Joseph was more stringent than an ordinary such ban where G–d had not been co-opted as a partner, this is not a valid argument, as even nowadays whenever we make such a ban, we add the words: “with the consent of the Lord.” We also find this approach to oaths in the Book of Samuel 14,24, where King Sha-ul had sworn that any man eating food before evening (the day of the battle) and the army had defeated their enemy, would be cursed, i.e. executed, that his own son Jonathan, who had tasted some honey, not having been aware that his father had pronounced such an oath, had become aware of someone having violated that oath, as one of the jewels in the breastplate of the High priest had suddenly lost part of its luster. Whenever a tribe performed a commandment, the jewel representing that tribe would shine more forcefully. When a tribe, or member of it, committed a trespass, its jewel would lose its luster. When King Sha-ul found out that the jewel representing his own tribe, that of Binyamin, suddenly did not shine anymore, he realised that the fault must lie with someone of his own tribe and family. He determined who that member of his tribe was by casting lots, as had done Joshua in Joshua 7, when he found out that the jewel representing the tribe of Yehudah had lost its luster. He had cast lots to determine which member of the tribe of Yehudah had been the guilty party. Achan, son of Karmi, was the one who had illegally pocketed some of the loot from the city of Jericho, and he was duly executed after having confessed.

              <p>.ואת יהודה שלח לפניו אל יוסף , “and he sent Yehudah ahead of him to Joseph.” He sent Yehudah ahead to prepare living quarters for him in Goshen; he picked Yehudah as the most capable one of his sons.  Our sages (Tanchuma Vayigash 11) paid especial attention to the unusual word להורות in this verse stating that Yaakov’s purpose in sending Yehudah ahead was for him to establish a Torah academy so that Torah study could take place as soon as Yaakov and his family would arrive in Goshen. This is not nearly as strange as it sounds at first glance as we have a tradition that Yaakov had been instructing his son Joseph in Torah and that at the time he had sent him on that fateful errand they had studied the subject of eglah arufah together, a subject dealing with a town’s expiation for a murder committed in its vicinity by a murderer or murderers unknown. When Yaakov had seen the עגלות his son sent him for transportation, he realized that his son had not forgotten this last lesson and that is what made his spirit revive (45,27).</p>

              <p>If, in the land that your God יהוה is assigning you to possess, someone slain is found lying in the open, the identity of the slayer not being known, your elders and magistrates shall go out and measure the distances from the corpse to the nearby towns. The elders of the town nearest to the corpse shall then take a heifer which has never been worked, which has never pulled in a yoke; and the elders of that town shall bring the heifer down to an everflowing wadi, which is not tilled or sown. There, in the wadi, they shall break the heifer’s neck. The priests, sons of Levi, shall come forward; for your God יהוה has chosen them for divine service and to pronounce blessing in the name of יהוה, and every lawsuit and case of assault (assault Cf. 17.8. Or “skin affection”; cf. 24.8.)  is subject to their ruling. Then all the elders of the town nearest to the corpse shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the wadi. And they shall make this declaration: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done. Absolve, יהוה, Your people Israel whom You redeemed, and do not let guilt for the blood of the innocent remain among Your people Israel.” And they will be absolved of bloodguilt. Thus you will remove from your midst guilt for the blood of the innocent, for you will be doing what is right in the sight of יהוה. When you [an Israelite warrior] take the field against your enemies, and your God יהוה delivers them into your power and you take some of them captive, and you see among the captives a beautiful woman and you desire her and would take her [into your household] as your wife, you shall bring her into your household, and she shall trim her hair, pare her nails, and discard her captive’s garb. She shall spend a month’s time in your household lamenting her father and mother; after that you may come to her and thus become her husband, and she shall be your wife. Then, should you no longer want her, you must release her outright. You must not sell her for money: since you had your will of her, you must not enslave her. If a householder (householder See the first note at 1.31.)  has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have borne him sons, but the first-born is the son of the unloved one— when he wills his property to his sons, he may not treat as first-born the son of the loved one in disregard of the son of the unloved one who is older. Instead, he must accept the first-born, the son of the unloved one, and allot to him a double portion (double portion Lit. two-thirds.)  of all he possesses; since he is the first fruit of his vigor, the birthright is his due. If a householder (householder See the first note at 1.31.)  has a wayward and defiant son, who does not heed his father or mother and does not obey them even after they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the public place of his community. They shall say to the elders of his town, “This son of ours is disloyal and defiant; he does not heed us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.” Thereupon his town’s council (town’s council Lit. “participants whose involvement defines the depicted situation of the town.” Taking Heb. ’anshe ha-‘ir as a technical term; NJPS “men of the town,” trad. “men of the city.” See the Dictionary under ’ish.)  shall stone him to death. Thus you will sweep out evil from your midst: all Israel will hear and be afraid. If any party is guilty of a capital offense and is put to death, and you impale the body on a stake, you must not let the corpse remain on the stake overnight, but must bury it the same day. For an impaled body is an affront to God: you shall not defile the land that your God יהוה is giving you to possess.</p>

        <summary>Yaakov was overjoyed to hear that Joseph was still alive after 22 years, as it showed that Joseph had remained true to his tradition and teachings despite being exposed to negative influences in Egypt. The Gemara provides advice on how to navigate desires and joys through four levels of birrur, starting with curbing lust with thoughts of mortality, then studying Torah, reciting the Shema, and finally contemplating death. Jacob expressed his immense joy that Joseph was alive, indicating that his position in Egypt was inconsequential compared to the fact that his son was still alive. Jacob's sons return to Canaan with news of Joseph being alive, and they use Serach to gently break the news to Jacob. Jacob's faith is restored, and he plans to see Joseph before he dies. Joseph reveals his true identity to his family, emphasizing that it was part of God's plan and urging them to prepare to migrate to Egypt. Israel expresses great joy and gratitude for the unexpected news that his son Joseph is still alive, after being delivered from various dangers.</summary>

              <p>Genesis 45,28. “my son Joseph is still alive.” These ‎words, though apparently unnecessary, reflected Yaakov’s joy ‎that his son after these 22 years of being alone in Egypt had ‎remained true to his tradition and the teachings of his father. In ‎spite of his having been exposed during all these years to every ‎perversion known to mankind, he had remained a tzaddik. ‎The word ‎עוד‎, in this verse emphasizes that the “cultural” ‎influence exuded by Egyptian society, though powerful, was ‎relatively secondary, peripheral, an “also ran,” seeing that Joseph ‎had absorbed the largesse that originated from G’d in heaven, a ‎predominant, and more powerful influence.‎</p>

              <p>“And Israel said, it is enough, Yosef still lives! I will go and see him before I die.” (Bereshit, 45:28) It is written in the Gemara (Berachot, 5a), “Rabi Levi bar Hama said in the name of Rabi Shimon ben Lakish, a man should always have his yetser tov [inclination to good] rage [fight against] his yetser hara [inclination to evil], as it is said, ‘rage and do not sin’ (Tehilim, 4:5). If he is victorious, good. If not, he should study Torah, as the verse continues, ‘say to your hearts.’ If he is victorious, good. If not, he should recite the Shema, as it continues, ‘on your beds.’ If he is victorious, good. If not, he should be reminded of the day of his death, as it continues, ‘and be silent, selah.’” Rabi Levi bar Hama said specifically, “a man should always rage,” for “always” means all matters that overwhelm a person. If galdlut, important matters and difficult life decisions, need birrur (clarification), then joy all the more so in order to gauge whether or not the joy is encumbered with dross from a negative influences. Therefore the Gemara offers four levels of advice as to how to do the birrur and arrive at the true depth of the matter. Afterwards, when he knows for certain that that the matter was truly from God, he may extend himself and rejoice, all the while knowing that it is either a mitzvah or the joy of doing a mitzvah. So when any this-worldly matter befalls man that needs birrur, we have these four levels of advice. The first birrur is, “one should always have his yetser tov rage over his yetser hara.” This means that he needs to curb his lust by knowing that he will not have these desires forever, contemplating his mere “seventy years” and asking himself, “What good is my joy if it does not last forever?” “If he is victorious, good, and if not, he should learn Torah.” For when he makes a deep reckoning about the ephemeral nature of this desire, knowing full well that he yearns for desire that lasts forever, but still lusts, he needs then to undergo another birrur. This is to be engaged in the Torah which reinforces his goal and teaches man how to guard himself. However, “at the time of the yetser hara, no one remembers the yetser tov,” (Nedarim, 32b), so in response to this the Holy One, blessed be He, created the Torah Tavleen, the antidote of the Torah to guard a person from sin. For truly, a man immersed in desire and unable to extricate himself from it has no advice to remind him that he is doing something forbidden, for the halakha on its own does not have the power to separate man from evil when he is overcome by his yetzer. Then the Torah reminds him that he can find the same desire or satisfaction in words of Torah, the only difference that the desire for Torah is rooted in kedusha (sanctity). This is explained below on the verse, “the sea saw and fled,” from the book of Tehilim, where it says that he saw how God can transform a rock into a pool of water and dry flint into a flowing spring. One would think that it would be formulated in the opposite way, for at a time  God’s might was readily apparent, that He could destroy and dry up the ocean. However, water hints at desire, and at a time when desire overpowers the only advice against it is to show how the same desire and enegy he can use for lust also exists also in a state of kedusha, quelling the desire. (This is as it is written (Devarim, 8), “He brings you water from the driest flint,” meaning that all the delights that are found in words of Torah are adorned with all kinds of beauty. When a man remembers this, then the sea will be calmed from its fury. It is just as if a man runs in a panic to fill his hunger, and his friend reproves him on the speed of his panic, and wants to stop him from running so fast, he will certainly not be heard, for he is terrified from his hunger. But if his friend says to him, “why do you need to run? Just go home and you will find all you ask for in greater amounts,” he will certainly be heard. Tashlum Mei HaShiloach.)  This is the advice to study Torah. “If he is victorious, it is well. If not, he should recite the Shema.” For exalted states are found in words of Torah, and by means of words of Torah one may dare to become arrogant, and then he will not be able to come to true refinement. For this, the advice is to recite the Shema. The matter of reciting the Shema is explained in the Gemara (Ta’anit, 31a). “In the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will make a circle dance of the Tsaddikim [righteous].” This means that all will see that all is in the hands of God, and no one has any superiority over his peers. Specifically a “circle dance,” because the nature of a circle is that it has no end, and this hints at the matter of reading the Shema. “If he is victorious, it is well. If not, he should be reminded of the day of his death.” This means that he should visualize before him as if right now is the day of his death. This is the difference between the first advice, “he shall rage,” explained in a similar way, yet remind him of the day of his death, i.e., visualize as if now is the time of his death; and if so, the lusts and the unwarranted rejoicing have no place. And if after all this the lusts and rejoicing still remain in his heart, then it is proof that it comes from God and endures forever. So it was with Yaakov Avinu at the time when he heard the news that Yosef is still alive, as it is said, “and Yaakov’s spirit was revived.” At this moment he feared that perhaps his rejoicing was only the rejoicing of this world, therefore he tested and refined himself with these birrurim. The first birrur was when he said, “I will go and see him before I die,” and this corresponds to “a man should always rage,” as was explained. The second was, “and he offered sacrifices to God of his father Yitzchak,” which corresponds to “engage in Torah,” as we bless each day “who has sanctified us with His mitzvot and commanded us to engage in words of Torah.” For when the Holy One, blessed be He, gave the Torah He was called, “Gevurah,” power, for there it is said that Moshe heard from the mouth of Gevurah (Megillah, 31b). And there God said to Yaakov, “and I [Anochi] will surely bring you up again,” which corresponds to the fist saying in the Decalogue, “I [Anochi] am Hashem your God, who brought you out.” Only here it is phrased in the past, and in our Parsha it is phrased in the future. Furthermore, what is said, “and he sent Yehuda before him” (Bereshit, 46:28), is explained by our sages (Midrash Tanchuma, Vayigash 11) that it was “to establish a house of study for him,” which is also related to this matter. Afterwards he clarified the third birrur with “and he wept on his shoulder,” and our sages interpreted this to mean that he recited the Shema. Then after, he said to Yosef, “now let me die,” which corresponds to the fourth advice, to remind him of the day of his death. When Yaakov saw that after all of this his joy was still with him, then he understood that it was from God, and that his rejoicing was true and would last forever.</p>

An alternate interpretation: Yaakov’s children kept on telling their father about Joseph’s position in Egypt, until their father got tired of listening to this and tried to stop them by saying: רב, “enough,” I now know that my son Joseph is still alive. He added that if this was really true, he would make the journey to Egypt in order to see him once more before he would die.</p>

              <p>ויאמר ישראל, “Yisrael said.” As long as his prophetic spirit had not been restored to him, the Torah referred to him only as Yaakov. Now that he had regained this additional spiritual dimension he is once more referred to as Yisrael. We have 18 instances from here until the end of the Book of Genesis where Yaakov is referred to as ישראל, such as 46,1; 46,5; 46,8; 46,29; to name but a few. The reason that G’d called him “Yaakov” in 46,2 whereas the Torah (G’d Himself) had referred to him as ישראל in the same verse was because the journey to Egypt was a voluntary exile on the part of Yaakov and it was not appropriate that the name Yisrael which denotes authority, victory, etc., should be applied to someone who exiles himself and subordinates himself to a human ruler. Once G’d had called him by the name Yaakov, it is not surprising to see that the Torah reverts to use of that name (compare 46,5, 46,6, 46,8, 46,19, 46,26, 46,27, etc.).  When the Torah (46,5) nonetheless speaks of וישאו בני ישראל את יעקב אביהם, “the sons of Israel carried their father Yaakov, etc.,” the message of the Torah is that Yaakov’s descent to Egypt involved both his names, i.e. although at this stage he had become an exile, ultimately, -through the exile experience in Egypt- he (his people) would be redeemed there and would emerge as more deserving of the name בני ישראל than before. This is the reason that in the verse mentioned the sons of Yaakov are referred to as בני ישראל rather than as the בני יעקב. The Torah could have simply written that “Yaakov’s sons carried him, etc.” We have this concept repeated at the beginning of the Book of Exodus where the Torah speaks of: “these are the children of Israel who came down to Egypt.” The same verse goes on naming them as “Yaakov and his sons.” These are the very ones who in the future would be called “the children of Israel.”</p>

              <p>רב, עוד יוסף בני חי, “it is indeed great! My son Joseph is still alive!” According to the plain meaning of the text the two separate exclamations by Israel refer to the two separate pieces of information that the brothers had brought with them. 1) The information that Joseph was alive. 2) The news that he occupied such a lofty position in Egypt. When Israel exclaimed רב!, he meant that the news that Joseph was alive was already sufficient good news. The fact that he occupied such a lofty position was an added bonus to the principal news that he was alive. A Midrashic approach to this verse is that the exclamation רב, was meant to acknowledge Israel’s satisfaction at having been granted such a reward in his life on earth, whereas the second exclamation עוד, “in addition,” refers to the meta-physical dimension of this news, i.e. that his standing in the world to come would remain unimpaired, not as he had been afraid that the fact that he lost a child during his own lifetime was a sign that he had forfeited his claim to that world. Technically speaking, the use of both these exclamations in this sense is found in Psalms 31,20 מה רב טובך, whereas the word עוד in this sense is found in Psalms 84,5 עוד יהללוך סלה, “forever (even in the hereafter) they will praise You.” I believe that this is also what Onkelos alluded to when he translated סגי לי חדוא , “great joy for me.” This kind of joy is of a type reserved for the hereafter. Joy in this life is something finite and only in the hereafter do we encounter something enduring. This in spite of the fact that Yaakov had experienced more than his fair share of disappointments during his life on earth [ — Compare his own words in Genesis 47,9. Ed.] Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 76,2 state that “promises made to the righteous by G’d are not ironclad as to their validity during the terrestrial life of the recipient (my translation).” When Yaakov had thought that he had lost Joseph and had said (37,35) “for I will go down to my grave mourning for my son,” this expressed his fear that he had forfeited eternal life. He had come to believe that both Joseph and he himself were slated for purgatory due to sins they had committed. Now that he heard that Joseph was alive he was certain that both he and his son would merit life in the hereafter.</p>

I considered the days of menstruation, as the prophet said, &quot;Their way was like the uncleanness of menstruation before me&quot; (Ezekiel 36:17). I considered the days of childbirth, as the prophet said, &quot;Therefore, he will give them up until the time when she who is in labor bears a child&quot; (Micah 5:2). I thought about the generations, as it is written &quot;May his days be like those of a generation (Psalm 71:7).&quot; I thought that twenty years had passed since Isaac desired to have children, as it says &quot;Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah... (Genesis 25:20),&quot; and he had a son at the age of sixty, as it says &quot;Isaac was sixty years old when they were born (Genesis 25:26).&quot; I thought and was not redeemed. I thought that twenty-two years had passed for Jacob, corresponding to the twenty-two years that Joseph was separated from him [his father], and after twenty-two years he was reunited with him, as it says &quot;Joseph is still alive (Genesis 45:28).&quot; I thought and was not redeemed. I thought that Babylonian rule lasted for seventy years, as it says &quot;When Babylon reaches seventy years (Jeremiah 29:10),&quot; and I thought that the rule of Media and Greece would also end, but I was not redeemed. For many years, Aram enslaved me, and I was not redeemed. Has God forgotten how to pity? (Psalm 77:10), or perhaps &quot;Has His faithfulness disappeared forever?&quot; (Psalm 77:9). Therefore, I say, &quot;God has abandoned me.&quot; (Isaiah 49:14)</p>

              <p>“They went up from Egypt, and they came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father” (Genesis 45:25).   “They told him, saying: Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over the entire land of Egypt. His heart was faint because he did not believe them (Genesis 45:26).  “They went up from Egypt…. They told him, saying: Joseph is still alive…his heart was faint” – Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: What is the plight of the liar? Even if he says truthful matters, he is not believed.  “They spoke to him all the words of Joseph that he had spoken to them, and he saw the wagons that Joseph sent to convey him, and the spirit of Jacob their father was revived” (Genesis 45:27).  “He saw the wagons” – the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him had idols etched on them. Judah stood and burned them. That tribe is experienced in burning idols. (See II Samuel 5:21; I Chronicles 14:12.)   Rabbi Levi [said] in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan bar Shaul: [Joseph] said to them: ‘If he believes you, fine. If not, say to him: “At the moment that I took my leave of you, was I not engaged in [studying] the passage of the beheaded calf [egla]?’ That is what is written: “He saw the wagons [haagalot]…and the spirit…was revived.”  “Israel said: Enough, Joseph my son is still alive; I will go and see him before I die” (Genesis 45:28).  “Israel said: Enough [rav]” – the power of my son Joseph is great [rav], as many troubles befell him, but still he remained in his righteousness much more than I did, as I sinned when I said: “My way is hidden from the Lord” (Isaiah 40:27). But I am certain that I have a portion in “how great is Your goodness” (Psalms 31:20). (Jacob knew through divine inspiration that if none of his sons were to die during his lifetime, he would be assured of a place in the World to Come (Etz Yosef, based on Tanḥuma (Warsaw ed.) Vayigash 9). ) </p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 39:1): WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT. This text is related (to Hos. 11:4): WITH HUMAN TIES I DREW THEM IN, WITH BANDS OF LOVE. (See Gen. R. 86:1.)  Israel would have deservedly gone down to Egypt in chains and collaria, (The Latin word means “neck chains.”)  just as they went down to Babylon, had not Joseph gone first. All that happened to Joseph happened to Zion. (See below, 11:11.)  That which is written of Joseph is written of Zion. It is written of Joseph (in Gen. 39:6): BEAUTIFULLY BUILT WITH A BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE; and it is written of Zion (in Lam. 2:15): A PERFECTION OF BEAUTY. For this reason Jacob was afraid to go down to Egypt: Because it had been decreed over Abraham (in Gen. 15:13): KNOW FULL WELL THAT YOUR SEED SHALL BE ALIEN IN A LAND &lt; NOT THEIRS WHERE THEY SHALL SERVE THEM AND BE OPPRESSED BY THEM &gt;. So he dwelt in the land of Canaan. They came and said to him: Joseph was sold when he resembled a bull. It is so stated (of Joseph in Deut. 33:17): LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY. And here he is ensconced in Egypt (Gen. 45:26)! When Jacob heard this, he said: See, I am going down to Egypt even though I am paying Abraham's bill (of indebtedness). Immediately (it says in Gen. 45:28): THEN ISRAEL SAID: ENOUGH, MY SON JOSEPH IS ALIVE. &lt; I WILL GO AND SEE HIM BEFORE I DIE &gt;. Immediately all the tribes went down with him. Who caused them to go down to Egypt? Joseph. (Hos. 11:4:) WITH HUMAN TIES I DREW THEM IN. This &lt; HUMAN &gt; is Joseph. (Gen. 39:1:) WHEN JOSEPH WAS TAKEN DOWN TO EGYPT.</p>

              <p>And when Joseph had finished giving them his orders, he turned: and went back into Egypt, ‎and the sons of Jacob went to the land of Canaan, in joy and happiness to their father. And ‎when they came to the boundaries of the land, they said to one another: What shall we do in ‎bringing this matter before our father? For if we impart it to him suddenly, and tell him all ‎about it, he will be greatly astounded at our words and he will refuse to listen to us. And when ‎they went on until they approached their houses they met Serach coming towards them, and ‎the damsel was exceedingly beautiful and wise, and a skilled player on the harp; and they ‎called her and she came unto them and she kissed them. And they took her and gave her a ‎harp saying unto her: Go, we pray thee, before our father and sit down before him and strike ‎this harp and speak unto him according to these words. And they instructed her concerning ‎what she had to say, and she hastened unto Jacob and she sat down before him. And she sang ‎and she played beautifully upon the harp, and she sang in the sweetness of her voice: Joseph ‎my uncle is alive and he reigneth over all the land of Egypt; he is not dead. And she often ‎repeated these words. And Jacob heard her words and it pleased him greatly, and when he ‎heard her sing it twice and three times, the heart of Jacob was possessed by joy, through the ‎sweet ness of her voice, and the spirit of God came over him, and he knew that all her words ‎were true. And Jacob blessed Serach for singing these words before him, and he said: My ‎daughter, may death never prevail against thee forever, for thou hast revived my spirit, only ‎repeat thou this song once more before me, for thou hast caused me gladness with thy words. ‎And she sang once more the same words and Jacob listened, and he was pleased and he ‎rejoiced, and the spirit of God came over him. And while he was yet speaking with her, his ‎sons came before him with horses and chariots and royal garments and servants running ‎before them. And Jacob arose and went to meet them, and he saw his sons dressed in royal ‎garments and all the good things that Joseph sent unto them. And they said unto him: Be thou ‎informed that our brother Joseph liveth, and that he ruleth over the whole land of Egypt, and ‎it is he who hath spoken unto us all we have told unto thee. And Jacob heard all the words of ‎his sons and his heart fainted, for he believed them not, until he saw all that Joseph had given ‎unto them and all that Joseph had sent along with them, and all the signs he had spoken of ‎unto them. And they unpacked all the things before him, and they displayed all that Joseph ‎had sent, and they gave to every one of them what Joseph had sent him. And Jaco-b knew ‎that they have spoken the truth, and Jacob was greatly rejoiced on account of his son. And he ‎said: It is enough, Joseph, my son, is yet alive. I will go and see him before I die. And his sons ‎told unto him all that had befallen them, and Jacob said: I will go down into Egypt, to see my ‎son and my children. | And Jacob rose up and he put on the garments which Joseph had sent ‎unto him, and he put a turban upon his head which Joseph had sent him after having washed ‎and shaved himself. And all the men of the house of Jacob and their wives dressed ‎themselves with the things that Joseph had sent them. And they rejoiced greatly on account ‎of Joseph that he was still alive and that he was the ruler over Egypt. And all the inhabitants of ‎Canaan heard the news, and they came and rejoiced with Jacob on account of Joseph that he ‎was still alive. And Jacob prepared for them a feast of three days, and all the kings of Canaan, ‎and all the great men of the land ate and drank and made merry in Jacob’s house.‎</p>

              </summary>
              <p>There is an additional important allusion in this verse which is seized upon by the Zohar in a different context. Accordingly, the performance of a מצוה enhances the &quot;image&quot; of G–d, whereas when one sins one damages G–d's &quot;image&quot; both in the Celestial Regions and on earth. Man's sins leave noticeable imprints on his face; this is the reason that Isaiah 3,9 speaks of: הכרת פנים ענתה בם, &quot;Their faces reflect their sins. Rabbi Moshe Alshich, commenting on Genesis 45,28: אלכה ואראנו בטרם אמות, &quot;I will go and see him (Joseph) before I die,&quot; writes that Jacob wanted to determine if Joseph had remained loyal to the Abrahamitic tradition by looking at his face. As soon as Jacob looked at Joseph's face (Genesis 46,29) he expressed willingness to die. The Torah phrases this peculiarly when it writes: &quot;After I have seen that you are alive.&quot; At first glance the words &quot;that you are alive&quot; seem superfluous. Jacob indicated by his words that being &quot;alive&quot; in itself was quite meaningless unless Joseph had remained loyal to his father's teachings. Joseph's face reflected G–d's approval, i.e. G–d made Joseph's face light up. One of the ways which result in man's face being illuminated is by means of repentance. When the Jewish people are reminded (Deut. 5,4) that G–d spoke to them פנים אל פנים, &quot;face to face,&quot; this is a compliment telling us that their facial features had undergone a change for the better, and that the ugly lines on their faces reflecting their sinful behavior had been erased. Psalms 42,12 speaks of the hope of the sons of Korach. There is no point in being downcast when repentance can cause us to reflect G–d's salvation on our own face; not only this, but we will simultaneously remove the tarnish caused to G–d's &quot;image&quot; by our own sins. The commandment to appear in the Temple three times a year (16,16), caused our sages in Chagigah 2a to say that the word יראה can be read both passively or actively, i.e. &quot;to be seen&quot; or &quot;to see.&quot; Their message is that if one comes to the Temple with a positive attitude, i.e. in order to &quot;see&quot; G–d, then one will also be positively &quot;seen&quot; by G–d. This also enables us to understand another verse which is generally held to be almost beyond comprehension.</p>

              <p>וַיֵּ֣רֶד מִצְרַ֔יְמָה Vayered Mitzrayma: “He went down to Egypt.” This comes to teach us that when Jacob said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I must go and see him before I die.” (Gen. 45:28) it was his intention to go down to Egypt but to stop at the border. He thought that Joseph would come up and meet him there. Once Jacob saw Joseph, he would return to the land of Canaan. Immediately after the Torah states, “I will go and see him,” it states, “So Israel set out with all that was his…” (Gen. 46:10), meaning he took what he needed for the trip. It didn’t occur to him to take his herds, flocks, and his possessions, as it said afterwards. “That night God appeared to Jacob and said, “Don’t be afraid to go down to Egypt…” (Gen. 46:3 ) Thus, the statement, “Compelled by the word of God….” teaches us that he was then told that he must go down to Egypt. Only then does it state, “and they took along their livestock and the wealth that they had amassed in Canaan. Thus Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt:” (Gen. 46:6)</p>

              <p>ואביו שמר את הדבר. Why did the Torah bother to write this line? The reason is that when the brothers returned from Egypt and reported about Joseph’s position there, and Yaakov did not believe them that Joseph was still alive, he saw the carriages which Pharaoh had sent to transport him in (45,27) and realised that such an honour could only be bestowed by a king, and that seeing that the King of Egypt had no reason to honour him in such a manner, the carriages, though sent with the approval of Pharaoh, must have been sent by someone in an almost equally high position, i.e. his son Joseph, who had dreamed of attaining such stature. It was the recollection of the dream Joseph had told him about which then prompted Yaakov to exclaim רב,עוד יוסף בני חי, וכי הוא מושל בכל בארץ מצרים, “it is too much! Not only is my son Joseph still alive, but he is the ruler of the whole land of Egypt!” (45,28 combined with 26)</p>

Thus the personal story is intertwined with the national one, and the text therefore gives limited time and space to psychological details. The motif of God’s plan is stressed by the repetition of “God sent me” (vv.5, 7, 8), while the anticipated bounties of settling in Egypt are brought out by the threefold “good-things of Egypt” (vv.18, 20, 23) and by the repeated exhortation to “come” (vv.18, 19).</p>

              <p>It seems that Jacob did not travel to Egypt intending to remain there. He planned to see Joseph and immediately return to Canaan for he had no desire to settle there. His only desire was to be in the Promised Land with his offspring with the hope of eventually inheriting it, as God promised. When the brothers came and told him that Joseph was alive and ruling over the Egypt and described Joseph’s great honor and glory as they were instructed to do, “You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that you have seen,” (Gen. 45:13) Jacob then answered, “Enough! My son, Joseph, is still alive.” (Gen. 45:28) Jacob was saying, “I don’t care about Joseph’s position or the greatness of which you speak. Since he is alive, I must go and see him before I die. I will go by myself and return immediately.” But Isaac was in doubt whether God approved of him leaving Canaan and entering the iron cauldron of Egypt, especially since God had refused to allow Isaac to leave Canaan in a time of famine, “Do not go down to Egypt; stay in this land and I will be with you and bless you and to your offspring I will give this land.” (Gen. 26:2-3) He was also afraid that he might die while he was in Egypt. These fears and doubts were in his heart when he arrived at Beersheba. He was not on his way to Egypt when he came there; rather he came to Beersheba because it was a place of prayer and supplication to God. He came to find out what he should do. He offered sacrifices to the God of his father since this place was special to Isaac and God had prevented Isaac from going to Egypt. God answered him in a dream. God calls to him, “Jacob, Jacob.” It is my thought that with this double language, God comes to tell him that the promise that God made was to Jacob the individual and to Jacob, the nation who are also called by this name. God offers two teachings, one to the person and one to the people. Speaking to Jacob, our forefather, he says, “Fear not to go down to Egypt.” That is, “Even though I prevented Isaac, from going to Egypt, I am permitting you to go. Do not think you are any different to me. I was the God of your father and I am the One who says to you, ‘Fear not to go down to Egypt;’” “I am the Lord, I am no different.” The only difference according to the Kabbalists is that Isaac was never allowed to go to Egypt; this was not the case for Jacob. </p>

It was only because he realized that it had been ‎decreed for him to be exiled in Egypt, (compare Shabbat 89) ‎according to which Yaakov should actually have descended to ‎Egypt in iron chains. Under the circumstances, Yaakov realized ‎that he was very fortunate to travel to Egypt in style, instead. ‎When he addressed G’d as the G’d of Yitzchok, he implied that his ‎father Yitzchok had not been forced to leave the Holy Land, even ‎though there had been a famine there in his lifetime also, G’d had ‎commanded him to remain there. (Genesis 26,2) He may have ‎hoped to change G’d’s decree so as to enable him to remain in the ‎Holy Land.‎</p>

              <p>“… and he offered sacrifices to God of his father Yitzchak.” (Bereshit, 46:1) Why was God called here “God of his father Yitzchak”? Because Yaakov prayed in the direction of the words that were said to Yitzchak (from God) (Bereshit, 26:3), “live in this land [and do not leave the boundaries of Israel], and I will be with you.” So Yaakov then feared that perhaps it was also forbidden for him to leave. Therefore he prayed to God until He illuminated his eyes to show him that for him it was permitted to leave.</p>

            <summary>Jacob offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac at Beer-sheba, a place of prayer for his father, in order to bring all Divine attributes into accord towards him as he prepared to go down to Egypt. The sacrifices were peace-offerings, symbolizing the desire to perfect character traits, and were offered specifically to the attribute of Divine Justice associated with Isaac. This act of honoring his father over his grandfather by offering sacrifices to Isaac's God is emphasized in the text. The sacrifices were intended to restore the Holy Spirit to Jacob and bring Divine approval to his decision to leave the Holy Land. The sacrifices were also a way for Jacob to seek guidance and assurance from the Almighty as he embarked on this journey.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>ויזבח זבחים לאלו-הי אביו יצחק, “he offered meat-offerings to the G’d of his father Yitzchak.” The Torah really should have written: “he offered sacrifices to the Lord.” Seeing that the Torah did not use this wording, it is clear that the emphasis on the words “G’d of his father” refers to the attribute of G’d which had served as the model his father Yitzchak was in the habit of emulating. It was the attribute גבורה, the attribute of Justice. This was a kind of admission that Yaakov felt he had already been granted by G’d all that he was entitled to. Until he had returned to the land of Canaan, Yaakov had not been able to serve that particular attribute of G’d exclusively. This is why the Torah here informed us that this particular sacrifice of Yaakov was offered specifically to this attribute of G’d.  This is what the sages in Bereshit Rabbah 94,5 had in mind when they said concerning this verse that we learn from it that “a person is obligated to honor his father more than his grandfather.” The name of G’d י-ה-ו-ה represents the attribute of חסד, loving kindness, Avraham’s (Yaakov’s grandfather’s) outstanding attribute. Had the Torah reported Yaakov as offering his sacrifice to Hashem, i.e. the attribute י-ה-ו-ה, Yaakov would have demonstrated more honour for his grandfather than for his father. This is why the Torah here spoke of “the G’d of his father Yitzchak,” [even adding the name Yitzchak though all us know that Yaakov’s father was Yitzchak. Ed.]  In the same section of Bereshit Rabbah 94,5 the illustration provided by the Midrash as to what constitutes honouring ”one’s father before one’s grandfather is that one greets one’s student before greeting one’s teacher.” This means that when one encounters both Rabbi and student simultaneously, one first addresses the student. Seeing that the students walk ahead of their teacher, one encounters them first and also greets them as one meets them. One does not get to meet the teacher until after one has met the students. Seeing that Yitzchak was a student of Avraham, Yaakov sacrificed to the attribute represented by Yitzchak described by the Torah as “the G’d of his father Yitzchak.” Yaakov was bound to mention Yitzchak ahead of Avraham either because Yitzchak had been Avraham’s student or because Yitzchak was Yaakov’s father.  The type of sacrifices which Yaakov offered were שלמים, “peace-offerings,” seeing Yaakov realised that the exile commenced now for his sons, something which filled him with fear. He considered it appropriate therefore to offer them to the attribute of פחד יצחק, i.e. the attribute of Justice. The word שלמים contains an allusion to the fact that Yaakov strove to perfect his various character traits. Seeing that this was his goal, he merited a vision of the “weaker” form of that attribute, i.e. G’d appeared to him in a nocturnal vision while he was asleep. This was to reassure him that although he was on the way to Egypt and to exile that his descendants would not perish as a result of being exiled. When the Torah stressed that G’d appeared to him במראות הלילה, “in a nocturnal vision,” this was an allusion to the fact that subsequent to their exile, his descendants would experience redemption after having suffered cruel persecution.</p>

The reason why Yitzchok is mentioned here is because he too was about to escape from a famine by traveling to Egypt, whereas in his case, G’d stopped him from going there. (26,2) Yaakov, as opposed to his father, offered meat offerings at Beer Sheva. This town was at the border of the land of Canaan, and he wanted to enquire from G’d if he had His approval in his undertaking to leave the Holy Land a second time in his life. The sacrifices he offered were intended to restore the Holy Spirit to him which had departed when Joseph had departed from him.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND HE OFFERED SACRIFICES UNTO THE G-D OF HIS FATHER ISAAC. The duty of honoring one’s father is more imperative than that of honoring one’s grandfather. Therefore the sacrifices are associated with the name of Isaac, and not with that of Abraham. Thus the language of Rashi. But this is not sufficient, for it would have been proper for Scripture to say, “and he offered sacrifices unto the G-d of his fathers,” without singling out any one person, just as Jacob said, The G-d before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk; (Further 48:15.)  and in his prayer he said, O G-d of my father Abraham, and G-d of my father Isaac. (Above, 32:10.)  Or Scripture should have said, “and he offered sacrifices to the Eternal,” just as it says in the case of Abraham, And he built there an altar unto the Eternal. (Ibid., 12:7.)  And what need was there to explain it further? However, this verse contains a secret, which the Rabbis revealed to us there in Bereshith Rabbah: (94:5.)  When Jacob was about to go down to Egypt he saw that the exile was beginning for him and his children, and he feared it, and so he offered many sacrifices to the Fear of his father Isaac (Above, 31:53.)  in order that Divine judgment should not be aimed against him. This he did in Beer-sheba which was a place of prayer for his father, and from there he had taken permission when he went to Haran. (See Ramban above, 28:17.)  Now Scripture uses the word z’vachim, [a term connoting peace-offerings], to inform us that they were not burnt-offerings as were his fathers’, as Abraham offered burnt-offerings. Our Rabbis have said (Zebachim 116a.)  that Noachides (See Note 148 in Seder Vayishlach, also Note 222 in Seder Bereshith.)  did not offer peace-offerings; they offered burnt-offerings. And concerning Noah it is clearly written, And he offered burnt-offerings on the altar. (Above 8:20.)  But on account of his fear of the Eternal, Jacob offered peace-offerings in order to bring all Divine attributes into accord towards him, even as the Rabbis have expounded: (Torath Kohanim Vayikra 16:1.)  “They are called sh’lamim (peace-offerings) because they bring shalom (peace) into the world.” Now his original intent was directed at the Divine attribute of power, this being nearest to Isaac. This is the explanation of that which the Rabbis mentioned in Bereshith Rabbah, (94:5.)  i.e., that the duty of honoring one’s father is more imperative than that of honoring one’s grandfather. This explanation applies to that which the Rabbis have said there in yet another form: “First you greet the pupil and afterward you greet the Rabbi.” (The case refers to a procession of a Rabbi and his pupils on the road. Since the pupils travel in advance of the Rabbi, a person coming from the opposite direction would first meet the pupils and then the Rabbi. Similarly, Isaac is the pupil and Abraham is the Rabbi. Hence Jacob offered sacrifices to the G-d of his father Isaac.)  I have seen this text in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah: (Sefer Habahir, 135. See Note 42 in Seder Bereshith.)  “And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. (Above, 31:53.)  Is there any one who swears by the belief of the Fear of his father? However, it was because Jacob was not yet given strength, and so he swore by the power given to his father, as it is said, And Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac. (Above, 31:53.)  And what is this? It is this concerning which Scripture writes, Then the fire of the Eternal fell, and consumed the burnt-offering, (I Kings 18:38.)  and it is further written, For the Eternal thy G-d is a devouring fire, etc.” (Deuteronomy 4:24.)  Thus far the Midrash. From the words of the Rabbis of this Midrash, we learn that it was for this reason that it does not say here, “and he offered sacrifices to the Eternal,” [but instead it says, “to the G-d of his father Isaac],” because now in Beer-sheba Jacob had already become privileged to possess his own portion [and needed only to bring all Divine attributes into accord towards him], (The words in the brackets are from the Commentary of Lvush to the Rekanati on the Torah, who quotes these words of Ramban.)  as it is said, Thou wilt give truth to Jacob, mercy to Abraham, as Thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. (Micah 7:20.)  It was therefore necessary to explain it now. Thus by the merit of the sacrifices, the G-d of his father Isaac appeared to him in the visions of the night (Verse 2 here.)  with an ameliorated Divine attribute of justice. It is this which Scripture says concerning them, in the visions of the night, complementing that which He said, I am G-d, the G-d of thy father, (Verse 3 here.)  for He is the G-d of Beth-el Who said to him in Haran, I am the G-d of Beth-el, where thou didst anoint a pillar; (Above, 31:13.)  it is He Who is the G-d of thy father. This is the Name and this is the attribute. And He assured him that he should have no fear in Egypt for he will be found righteous in Divine judgment, and he will be redeemed after the affliction. This is the meaning of the Divine promise, And I will also surely bring thee up again. (Verse 4 here.)  Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] has written in the twenty-seventh chapter of the first part of the Moreh Nebuchim (Guide of the Perplexed) concerning Onkelos’ translation of the verse, I will go down with thee into Egypt, and I will also surely bring thee up again, (Verse 4 here.)  [which Onkelos rendered here literally]: “I will go down with thee…and I will bring thee up.” And the Rabbi was amazed at the opinion of Onkelos, [namely, that the literal translation should be used], saying that Onkelos had exerted all his effort to remove any implication of G-d’s corporeality from all narratives in the Torah. Accordingly, in the case of any expression found in the Torah implying any mode of motion that refers to G-d, Onkelos ascribed the action to a certain glory that had been created for the occasion, or a manifestation of Divine Providence. Thus he translated And G-d came down (Exodus 19:20.)  as “and G-d manifested Himself;” I will go down now and see (Above, 18:21.)  as “I will manifest Myself now and see.” And if so, why did Onkelos here translate literally, “I will go down”? And so the Rabbi explained that since Scripture said at the outset of the matter, And G-d spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, (Verse 2 here.)  thus indicating that it is an account of what Jacob was told and not what actually took place, Onkelos therefore did not hesitate to literally translate the words as they were addressed to Jacob in the visions of the night, for the words in question represent an account of what Jacob was told, not what actually took place. There is thus a great difference between a communication transmitted in a dream or a vision of the night, or a communication designated as having been made in a vision or manifestation, and a communication given clearly, [not in a dream, such as communications introduced by phrases like these]: “And the word of the Eternal came unto me, saying,” or “And the Eternal spoke unto me, saying.” These are the words of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon. Similarly he said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 48.)  that Onkelos never translated expressions of “hearing” literally [when the Scriptural references were to G-d], but instead explained them as expressing that a certain matter reached the Creator, or that He accepted a prayer. Thus Onkelos translated the Eternal heard (Above, 29:33.)  as “it was heard before the Eternal;” he translated the verse, I will surely hear his crying (Exodus 22:22.)  as “I will surely accept his complaint.” But if the matter is as the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] said, why does Onkelos shun literal translations of expressions of movement, and also avoid literal expressions of hearing due to his fear that they might indicate corporeality, but he does not in any place shy away from literally expressing “saying,” “speaking” or “calling,” whether the communication was in a dream or manifestation or overt speech, for in every case he translates: “and G-d said,” “G-d spoke,” “and G-d called unto Moses”? These expressions likewise signify corporeality, and Onkelos should have translated, “and it was said from before G-d,” or “and the glory of G-d said,” or “and G-d willed,” as is appropriate in each case, just as the Rabbi has explained (Moreh Nebuchim I, 65.)  with reference to the terms “speaking” and “saying” when they refer to G-d. And why did Onkelos avoid literal translation in the case of “hearing” and did not do so with respect to “seeing,” which he translated as: “and the Eternal saw”? (Above, 6:5.)  And that which the Rabbi has said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 48.)  that “seeing” indicates mental perception as well as the sensation of sight, this applies all the more to “hearing” for it is employed in many places to indicate mental perception and will, such as: And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai; (Above 16:2.)  Hear the voice of my supplications; (Psalms 28:2.)  Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; (Isaiah 1:15.)  And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d. (Deuteronomy 28:1.)  And so also, leiv shomei’ah (I Kings 3:9.)  (literally: a hearing heart, an understanding heart), and so also in the case of most of [the verses cited by Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon]. So Onkelos should not have been apprehensive of expressions of “hearing” as they only indicate acceptance of a matter by G-d and His being pleased with it, for he does not avoid literal translations of expressions of sight any place, but translates it literally in all cases even when seeing alone is involved. However, where a matter is not conceived by sight alone, but requires attention and discernment, Onkelos renders it as befits the subject. For example, when Scripture says, Because the Eternal hath looked upon my affliction, (Above, 29:32.)  [Onkelos rendered it as, “because my affliction is manifested before the Eternal”]. The verse, I have surely seen the affliction of My people, (Exodus 3:7.)  [was rendered by Onkelos as, “the enslavement of my people is manifest before me,” and the verse], And G-d saw the children of Israel, (Ibid., 2:25.)  [he rendered as, “and the enslavement of the children of Israel was manifest before G-d],” since His seeing them was not just as a matter of perceiving their bodies but of His attention to their situation and His knowledge thereof. This is Onkelos’ method throughout the Torah, and not as the Rabbi’s opinion would have it, as a consquence of which opinion he had to declare [our version of Targum Onkelos] erroneous (Ramban refers here to Chapter 48 of the first part of the Moreh Nebuchim mentioned above, in which Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Rambam) sets forth the theory that Onkelos always renders “seeing” literally except where it is connected with wrong, injury or violence, in which cases he expresses it as “It was manifest before the Eternal.” Onkelos is thus consistent with the prophetic phrase, Thou canst not look on iniquity (Habakkuk 1:13). However, Rambam mentions that he found three passages which contradict his theory. One is the verse, And the Eternal saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, (above, 6:5), and the other two are mentioned in the following note. In these three cases which are connected with wrong and violence, Onkelos should have expressed “seeing” in the form of “being manifest before the Eternal,” and yet he translated them literally! Rambam then concludes that our version of Onkelos is inaccurate in those three cases! It is this conclusion of Rambam with which Ramban takes issue in the text before us.)  in [the following three places: the verse mentioned above, namely, And the Eternal saw], (Above, 6:5.)  and two other verses, (And G-d saw the earth, and behold it was corrupt, (above, 6:12). And the Eternal saw that Leah was hated, (above, 29:31).)  which Onkelos translated as, “and He saw,” since these translations do not fit his theory. With reference to expressions of “passing” Onkelos paraphrased and thus translated the expression, And the Eternal passed by before him, (Exodus 34:6.)  as, “and He caused His Presence to pass before his [Moses’] face.” He did this so that the passing object would be, in accordance with Onkelos’ opinion, something created, as he would not ascribe any expression of motion to the Creator in accordance with what the Rabbi has mentioned. (Moreh Nebuchim I, 21.)  But if this is so, why did Onkelos literally translate the verse, The Eternal thy G-d, He will go over before thee? (Deuteronomy 31:3. In our version of Onkelos, the text reads, “His word will go over.” Ramban’s objection is thus removed.)  This is a form of motion occurring in a narrative (As opposed to “the visions of the night.” See the beginning of the section where Ramban explains this distinction which Rambam makes.)  and yet Onkelos was not apprehensive about it! Similarly, Onkelos translated the verse, And Israel saw the great hand, (Exodus 14:31.)  as, “and Israel saw the power of the great hand.” He added the term “power” due to the subsequent expression, that the Eternal did, (Exodus 14:31.)  yet he left intact the expression, “the great hand” and was not apprehensive and fearful of the term “hand” being ascribed to G-d and did not paraphrase it at all! He did the same in literally translating, written with the finger of G-d. (Ibid., 31:18.)  The Rabbi’s answer (Moreh Nebuchim I, 66.)  that Onkelos thought that “the finger” was a created instrument which, by the will of the Creator, engraved the writing on the tablets, is not the truth. There is the verse, At His right hand was a fiery law unto them, (Deuteronomy 33:2.)  in translation of which Onkelos wrote, “His right hand,” and he was not apprehensive of “the right hand writing,” that is lest it indicate corporeality, and such is the case also with “the finger” as mentioned above. He furthermore literally translated: Thou stretchest forth Thy right hand (Exodus 15:12.)  as, “Thou raisest Thy right hand.” So also the verses: Thy right hand, O Eternal, dasheth in pieces the enemy; (Ibid., Verse 6.)  Thy strong hand; (Deuteronomy 3:24.)  By a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm; (Ibid., 4:34.)  And My hand take hold on judgment; (Ibid., 32:41.)  The eyes of the Eternal thy G-d are always upon it. (Ibid., 11:12.)  [Onkelos literally translated all of these verses without fear that the terms “hand” and “eyes” might indicate corporeality.] Now in the case of Jacob, the Scriptural narrative begins, And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, etc., and yet Onkelos, fearing corporeality, translated [the verse, And, behold, the Eternal stood beside him], (Above, 28:12-13.)  as “and, behold, the Glory of G-d stood beside him,” and he did not translate literally, “and, behold, the Eternal” although it was in a dream. (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon’s thesis is that the reason Onkelos did not paraphrase the verse, I will go down with thee into Egypt, but translated it literally, is that the narrative begins with a statement that it was in a vision of the night. Ramban questions this thesis, for in the story of the ladder, which is also introduced as a dream, Onkelos avoided possible indications of corporeality, and accordingly he paraphrased the verses.)  He further translated the expression, And, behold, I am with thee, (Above, 28:15.)  as “and, behold, My word will be in thy help,” and did not say literally, “and, behold, I am with thee,” just as he literally translated, “I will go down with thee,” even though the story of the ladder is a statement of what Jacob was told, [not a narrative of what took place], and is completely analogous to the narrative of the dream here. Again, Onkelos literally translated the expression, And I will be with thy mouth, (Exodus 4:12.)  [even though the story there is not introduced as a vision of the night or a dream], and on the other hand he translated the verse, And He said, Certainly I will be with thee, and this shall be the token unto thee, (Ibid., 3:12.)  as “behold, My word will be with thee.” Furthermore, Onkelos does not always translate literally in the case of dreams. Thus he rendered the verses, And G-d came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, (Above, 20:3.)  And G-d came to Laban in a dream, (Ibid., 41:22.)  as “and the word came from before G-d.” Should you say that Onkelos paraphrased it there because he was concerned lest one think that G-d came to them before the dream, and one might thus think that G-d’s appearance actually took place, [this would still not justify his using the expression, “and the word came,”] for in the case of Solomon it is written, In Gibeon the Eternal appeared to Solomon in a dream, (I Kings 3:5.)  and yet Jonathan ben Uziel (See Note 152 in Seder Noach.)  translated it as, “G-d revealed Himself to Solomon,” even though, according to Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, a narrative introduced as a dream is rendered by Onkelos and Jonathan as it was actually said. They find no difficulty in translating such a statement literally, even though the expression connotes corporeality, because since it occurs in a dream, they understand that it is inexact. Thus in the case of Solomon, since the Eternal appeared to him in a dream, it was proper for Jonathan to give a literal account of the occurrence, for since Scripture relates that it was in a dream by night, (I Kings 3:5.)  one would himself infer that it was not real but only a dream in which the person dreaming imagined it to be so. [Now since Jonathan did not paraphrase the account of Solomon’s dream, although Onkelos did so in the case of the dreams of Abimelech and Laban, it thus helps to disprove the thesis of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon that accounts of what occurred in man’s imagination are not paraphrased by the Targum.] Now do not think that Jonathan ben Uziel did this because the term “seeing” in reference to dreams is not found in Aramaic — for the verse, And I saw in my dream, (Above, 41:22.)  is indeed translated [in Targum Onkelos] as “I saw,” and in the case of the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, it likewise says in Aramaic, Thou O King, sawest. (Daniel 2:31.)  And so did Onkelos translate the verse, Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Eternal, (Exodus 16:8.)  as “but against the word of G-d.” Onkelos thus paraphrased here even though there is no fear or apprehension of corporeality connoted by literal translation. Likewise, he translated And the people spoke against G-d, and against Moses (Numbers 21:5.)  as, “and the people murmured against the word of G-d.” So also the verses, Between Me and you, (Above, 9:12.)  and Between G-d and every living creature, (Ibid., Verse 16.)  were translated by Onkelos as: “between My word and you,” “between the word of G-d and every living creature.” There are many similar examples [of verses which he paraphrased in spite of the fact that there would have been no apprehension of intimating corporeality had he translated literally]. And so also he translated The Eternal watch (Ibid., 31:49.)  as “the word of G-d watch;” G-d is witness (Ibid., Verse 50.)  as “the word of G-d is witness.” Yet there would be no apprehension of corporeality had those expressions been literally translated. Besides, what sense is conveyed here by the expression, “the word of G-d’ watch or witness”? Similarly the verse, Swear unto me here by G-d, (Ibid., 21:23.)  is rendered by Onkelos as “swear unto me by the word of G-d,” although people who swear do not mention, “I swear by the word of G-d.” There are many other such cases in Onkelos, and their secret meaning is known to the learned students [of the mystic lore of the Torah]. Likewise, with respect to the term “standing” when applied to G-d, the Rabbi said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 28.)  that Jonathan ben Uziel’s intent was to explain it as meaning “to endure permanently,” and therefore he translated the expression, And His feet shall stand, (Zechariah 14:4.)  as “and He will appear in His might.” So also all expressions denoting contact and motion were rendered by him as “the might of G-d.” Yet Onkelos had no apprehension of the term “standing.” and he translated it literally: Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock. (Exodus 17:6.)  And concerning that which the Rabbi has said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 27.)  that all expressions denoting any mode of motion are rendered by Onkelos as the revelation of the Divine Presence, or the manifestation of a certain Glory that had been created for the occasion, now Onkelos avoids even literal translation of verses which mention “seeing” the Glory [of G-d, and would certainly oppose using it to denote expressions of motion]. Thus he translates the verse, And the glory of the Eternal appeared unto all the congregation, (Numbers 16:19.)  as “and the glory of G-d was manifested,” just as he said in translation of the verse, And the Eternal came down, (Exodus 19:20.)  “and the Eternal manifested Himself,” and did not translate it literally as “and the glory of the Eternal appeared.” He also likewise translates “seeing,” when referring to angels, as “and he manifested himself.” (Onkelos, ibid., 3:2.)  Now if it is as the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] said (Moreh Nebuchim I, 27.)  that in the case of angels, or manifestation of a certain glory that had been created for the occasion, Onkelos does not hesitate to literally translate expressions denoting corporeality, it would have been proper for him not to avoid expressions of literal “seeing” of angels by man, and should there translate it as “and he appeared,” just as he has literally rendered the verse, For I have seen ‘Elokim’ face to face, (Above, Verse 32.)  as “for I have seen an angel of G-d.” Heaven forbid that the Divine Presence or the Glory created for the occasion be anything except the glorious Divine Name, blessed be He, as the Rabbi has expressed himself here (Moreh Nebuchim I, 27.)  and in many chapters of his book. Thus Onkelos translated the expression, If Thy face go not, (Exodus 33:15.)  as “if Thy Divine Presence go not among us.” Now, other than the glorious Divine Name, blessed be He, Moses did not want a special Glory created to go with him, since the Holy One, blessed be He, had already told him, Behold Mine angel shall go before thee, (Ibid., 32:34.)  and Moses was not pleased with it. He instead wanted that G-d in His own glory should go with him. Also, after G-d heard his plea and told him, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken, (Ibid., 33:17.)  Moses said, Let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us, (Ibid., 34:9.)  and this Onkelos rendered as “let now G-d’s Divine Presence go among us.” (We thus see that even here, where it is clear from the context that the verse refers to G-d and not an angel, Onkelos does not hesitate to translate “going” literally.)  He similarly translated the expression, Thou canst not see My face, (Ibid., 33:20.)  “thou cannot see the face of My Divine Presence, for man shall not see Me.” [In translating the verse in the book of Ezekiel, Blessed be the glory of the Eternal from His place,] (Ezekiel 3:12.)  Jonathan ben Uziel said, “Blessed be the glory of the Eternal from the region of His Divine abode.” Now if by this “Glory,” [which is mentioned in the book of Ezekiel] Scripture refers to the Creator in His true essence, analogous to the verse, Show me, I pray Thee, Thy glory, (Exodus 33:18.)  which the Rabbi has indeed so interpreted, (Moreh Nebuchim I, 54 and 64.)  then how did [Jonathan ben Uziel] in translating the verse mention “the region of His Divine abode” [when the terms “region,” “abode,” etc., indicate corporeality]? And if one would say that the verse in Ezekiel refers to a certain glory that had been created for the occasion, as is the opinion of the Rabbi with respect to the verse, And the glory of the Eternal filled the tabernacle, (Exodus 40:35. Moreh Nebuchim I, 64.)  and other similar verses, then how did the angels direct their words, “Blessed, etc.,” towards it when he who blesses and prays to a glory created for an occasion is as he who worshipped idols? The teachings of our Rabbis also contain many texts which indicate that the name Shechinah (Divine Presence) is identical with G-d, blessed be He. But all these subjects, [some of which are rendered literally and some of which are paraphrased, are not influenced by a fear of using terms denoting corporeality but rather by secrets] of the Cabala (See Note 56 in Introduction to Sefer Bereshith.)  known to Onkelos and Jonathan ben Uziel, and the secrets thereof are revealed to those who know the mystic lore of the Torah. Thus in the Revelation on Mount Sinai, wherever Elokim is mentioned in that section, Onkelos renders it as “the Glory” or “the Word of G-d,” but when Scripture mentions the Tetragrammaton he does not so render it. All this is done by Onkelos with extraordinary care and wisdom, and I will yet mention (See Ramban on Exodus 20:19.)  this with the help of G-d, blessed be He. Now the reason that Onkelos literally translated the verse, And ‘Elokim’ spoke all these words, saying, (Ibid., 20:1.)  [rather than render it, “and the Glory of G-d spoke,” as he usually does wherever Elokim is mentioned], is that it is said, Face to face the Eternal spoke (Deuteronomy 5:4.)  unto your whole assembly. (Ibid., Verse 19.)  The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand. However, the reason why Onkelos here literally translated, I will go down with thee to Egypt, [and did not paraphrase it as “My Glory will go down with thee],” is that he wanted to allude to that which the Rabbis have said: (Mechilta Shirah 3. See also Megillah 29a.)  “When they were exiled to Egypt, the Divine Presence went with them, as it is said, I will go down with thee to Egypt. When they were exiled to Elam, the Divine Presence went down with them, as it is said, And I will set My throne in Elam.” (Jeremiah 49:38.)  Thus both the verse which speaks of G-d “saying” [namely, And He said, I am G-d, the G-d of thy father, etc.], (Verse 3 here.)  and [the verse which speaks of G-d] “going down,” [namely, I will go down with thee], are alike [for they both refer to the Creator in His true essence], as I have explained above, and therefore he could not, under any circumstances, have translated in any other way, as I have hinted. But there in the case of Jacob’s dream, Onkelos could not have literally translated, “and behold I am with thee,” [and was forced to paraphrase it as, “and My word will be in thy help],” (Above, 28:15.)  because it is written there, And, behold, the Eternal stood beside him. (28:13. Since the Tetragrammaton (“the Eternal”) represents the attribute of mercy, had Onkelos literally translated Verse 15, “and, behold, I am with thee,” it would have indicated that this attribute would follow Jacob into exile since at the outset of this matter in Verse 13, Scripture uses the Tetragrammaton. Hence Onkelos translated Verse 15 as, ‘and My word will be in thy help,’ which is a reference to the attribute of judgment. (Bei’ur Ha’lvush to Rekanati on the Torah, who quotes the words of Ramban.))  The student learned [in the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand. And due to the fact that Onkelos found the meaning of this verse not to be in line with its plain meaning, he therefore spurned [literally translating the rest of the verse, and rendered it as referring to assistance], and thus he said, “My word will be in thy help,” instead of saying “My word will be with you,” as he said in the case of Moses. (Ibid., 3:12.)  And may G-d show us wonders in His Torah.</p>

              <p>Sie reisten südwärts und kamen an die letzte Grenzstadt, an das durch die Erinnerung der Väter verherrlichte Beer-Schewa. Da opferte er זבחים. Wir finden nicht wieder, daß unsere Erzväter זבחים geopfert hätten. Sie, wie alle Noachiden, brachten vielmehr nur עולה .עולות drückt die gänzliche Hingebung an Gott aus, זבח ist an sich ein von den בעלים zu verzehrendes Familienmahl, und weiht die Familienstätte, das &quot;Familienhaus&quot; und den Familientisch zu Tempel und Altar. זבחים, ja in der Regel שלמים, drücken ja den höheren Gedanken aus, daß &quot;Gott zu uns komme&quot;; sie werden daher aus jenem heiteren Bewusstsein dargebracht, daß, wo ein Familienkreis pflichttreu und einig lebt und sich von Gott getragen fühlt, da אלקי׳ בדור צדיק, da sei Gott gegenwärtig. Darum sind שלמים, &quot;Friedensopfer&quot; des gottgesegneten Familienlebens, so spezifisch jüdisch. Der Gedanke des Aufgehens in Gott und des Hingebens an Gott dämmerte auch in nichtjüdischen Gemütern. Allein, daß das gewöhnliche Leben so von Gott durchdrungen sein kann, daß &quot;man isst und trinkt und schaut dabei Gott&quot;, daß alle unsere Familienräume Tempel, unsere Tische Altäre, unsere Jünglinge und Jungfrauen Priester und Priesterinnen, diese Durchgeistigung des gewöhnlichen Privatlebens, das ist eine Spende des Judentums. Daß Jakob-Israel nicht עולות, sondern זבחים opferte, das liegt darin, daß Jakob sich jetzt zum erstenmale in seinem Familienkreise glücklich und heiter und &quot;ganz&quot; fühlte. In diesem Bewusstsein und Gefühle brachte er Gott ein &quot;Familienopfer&quot; und in diesem Gefühle brachte er sein Opfer, tief bedeutsam, אבין לאלקי יצחק nicht allgemein לאלקי׳. In dem Liede am roten Meere spricht Israel: זה אל ואנוהו אלקי אבי וארוממנהו: &quot;In dieser meiner Rettung hat sich Gott als die mich tragende Allmacht mir gezeigt, auf daß ich ihn in meine Mitte aufnehme und ihm eine entsprechende Stätte werde; es ist dies aber derselbe Gott, den mich die Väter gelehrt, dem auch die Väter gedient, und der durch mich nur noch zu erhöhter Anerkennung gelangen will!&quot; &quot;Der Belehrung und dem זכות der Väter verdanke ich ich diese Rettung.&quot; So auch hier. Die Seligkeit, die Jakob eben jetzt empfand, schrieb er nicht seinem Verdienste, sondern dem זכות אבות zu. — Vielleicht auch ist es ein Hinblick auf die עקדה. Jakobs ganzes bisheriges Leben war nichts als eine in konkreter Wirklichkeit sich vollziehende עקדה, deren Auferstehungsmomente er eben jetzt sich genaht fühlte.</p>

Therefore, it was mentioned that he brought sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac and did not mention Abraham his grandfather. (Rashi, Genesis, 46:1.)  Hizkuni writes. Jacob brought the sacrifices because his father, Isaac, had brought sacrifices in Beer Sheva and therefore he mentioned Isaac and not Abraham. He brought sacrifices because he saw prophetically that his children would have to be in exile in Egypt. Therefore, he brought sacrifices so that the Holy One would act kindly with his children in the exile. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:1, 3.) </p>

              <p>“Israel, and everything that he had, traveled and came to Beersheba, and he slaughtered feast-offerings to the God of his father Isaac” (Genesis 46:1).  “Israel, and everything that he had, traveled and came to Beersheba” – where did he go? Rav Naḥman said: He went to cut down the cedars that his grandfather Abraham had planted in Beersheba, just as it says: “He planted…[in Beersheba]” (Genesis 21:33). It is written: “And the central bar inside the boards” (Exodus 26:28). Rabbi Levi said: The central bar was thirty-two cubits long. Where did they find it at that time? (Where did they get such a long piece of wood in the wilderness, just when they needed it to build that part of the Tabernacle? )  It teaches that they were hidden with them from the days of Jacob our patriarch. That is what is written: “And everyone with whom acacia wood was found” (Exodus 35:24). “With whom [acacia wood] could be found” is not written here, but rather, “with whom [acacia wood] was found.” (This implies that it was already in their possession. )    Rabbi Levi said: They chopped them down from Migdal Tzevaaya, (This is the name of a place in the Land of Israel.)  and they brought them with them to Egypt, and neither was a knot nor a crack was found in them. There were acacia trees in Migdela, and they treated them as prohibited due to the sanctity of the Ark. (Even in the times of the Sages of the midrash, acacia trees grew in Migdela, but due to the tradition that the wood eventually used for the Ark and the rest of the Tabernacle had been cut from there, the people of Migdela would not make use of the acacia trees. )  They came and asked Rabbi Ḥanina, colleague of the Rabbis. He said to them: ‘Do not deviate from the custom of your fathers.’</p>

              <p>“He slaughtered feast-offerings to the God of his father Isaac” – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: I circulated among all of the aggada experts in the south so that they would explain this verse to me, (His question was why Jacob invoked the God of Isaac and did not mention Abraham. )  but they could not tell me [the explanation] until I stood with Yehuda ben Pedaya, the son of ben Kappar’s sister. He said to me: ‘If a teacher and disciple are walking on the way, one first inquires after the wellbeing of the disciple, and then one inquires after the wellbeing of the teacher.’ (The disciples would walk before the teacher. That is why Jacob invoked the name of the God of Isaac and not the God of Abraham.)   Rav Huna said: When Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi came to Tiberias, he asked Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: ‘A person is obligated in the honor of his father more than the honor of his grandfather.’ Reish Lakish said: He sacrificed offerings for the covenant of the tribes. (This is the covenant that God made with Abraham that would be fulfilled through Isaac and not Ishmael (see Genesis 17:21).)   Bar Kappara and Rabbi Yosef bar Patros, one said: [Jacob said:] ‘Just as Father was eager to satisfy his throat, I, too, am eager to satisfy my throat.’ (Isaac had loved Esau because of the food he brought him (see Genesis 25:28), and Jacob was descending to Egypt to be sustained by Joseph (see Etz Yosef). )  The other said: [Jacob said:] ‘Just as Father distinguished one son from his other son, so, too, I distinguished one son from my other sons. (Jacob had shown preferential treatment toward Joseph, which had led to the events that brought Jacob to travel to Egypt, and he now brought offerings in order to achieve atonement (Etz Yosef). Alternatively, in Egypt, Joseph would rule over and provide for the entire family, which would give him an elevated status (Yefeh To’ar). Therefore, Jacob said he was going to Egypt despite this danger only because of the needs of the many people who required sustenance. )  Then I said: Father had only the burden of one life, but I have the burden of seventy lives upon me.’ (Jacob said he was descending to Egypt.)   Rabbi Yudan said: [Jacob said:] ‘Father blessed me with five blessings. Corresponding to them, the Holy One blessed be He appeared to me five times and blessed me.’   Rabbi Yudan said another [explanation], Rabbi Yudan said: [Jacob said:] ‘I was under the impression that He would give me a taste of those blessings.’ What were those blessings? “Peoples will serve you and nations will prostrate themselves to you” (Genesis 27:29) – this is Joseph. (Jacob saw that one of the blessings granted to him by Isaac was being fulfilled through Joseph, so he brought offerings of thanksgiving, and particularly mentioned “the God of his father Isaac.” )  Rabbi Berekhya said two [statements], Rabbi Berekhya said: The Holy One blessed be He associates His name with a living person only for those who undergo suffering. That is why it is not written here: “He slaughtered feast-offerings to the God of Jacob,” but rather, “to the God of his father Isaac,” who was already dead. Rabbi Berekhya said another [explanation]: It is because he had undergone suffering. The Rabbis say: Isaac’s ashes are viewed as though they are accumulated upon the altar. That is why he mentioned Isaac.</p>

              <p>“While the king was at his feast, my nard released its fragrance” (Song of Songs 1:12). “While the king was at his feast,” Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Meir says: While the King of kings was at His feast, in the firmament, Israel released a foul odor and said to the calf: “This is your god, Israel” (Exodus 32:4). Rabbi Yehuda said to him: ‘Enough, Meir, one does not expound Song of Songs disparagingly, but rather, favorably, as Song of Songs was given only in praise of Israel. What is: “While the king was at his feast”? While the King of kings was at His feast, in the firmament, Israel released a fine fragrance before Mount Sinai, and said: “Everything that the Lord has spoken we will perform and we will obey” (Exodus 24:7). According to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, it should have said: My stench released its odor. (Since the verse was referring to the Golden Calf, it should have referred to stench rather than the fragrance of the sweet-smelling nard.)  Rather, a treatise ascended in their hand from the Diaspora, (The midrash is citing an ancient tradition recorded in a treatise that was transported from Babylon during the Return to Zion to build the second Temple.)  and they taught in its regard that He skipped the incident of the calf for them and the act of the Tabernacle preceded it. (The sin of the Golden Calf (Exodus chap. 32) should have been recorded in the Torah immediately following the events of the revelation at Sinai. Instead, it is preceded by the commandments concerning the building of the Tabernacle (Exodus chapters 25–31), to indicate that even when Israel sinned, they were still beloved in the eyes of the God. Therefore, the verse characterizes their odor as nard.)  Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Akiva, and Rabbi Berekhya, Rabbi Eliezer says: “While the king was at his feast,” while the King of kings was at His feast, in the firmament, Mount Sinai was already enveloped in flames, as it is stated: “The mountain was burning with fire” (Deuteronomy 4:11). Rabbi Akiva says: While the King of kings was at His feast, in the firmament, already, “the glory of the Lord rested on Mount Sinai” (Exodus 24:16). Rabbi Berekhya says: While Moses was at his feast in the firmament, (While he was still on Mount Sinai.)  as he is called king, as it is stated: “He became king in Yeshurun, when the heads of the people were assembled” (Deuteronomy 33:5), already, “God spoke all these matters saying” (Exodus 20:1). Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov and the Rabbis, Rabbi Eliezer says: While the King of kings was at His feast, in the firmament, Mikhael, the great prince, had already descended from the heavens and rescued Abraham our patriarch from the fiery furnace. The Rabbis say: The Holy One blessed be He descended and rescued him, as it is stated: “I am the Lord who took you out of Ur of the Chaldeans” (Genesis 15:7). When did Mikhael descend? It was in the days of Ḥanaya, Mishael, and Azarya. (Mikhael is identified as the angel who descended to rescue Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya from the fiery furnace (see Daniel 3:25).)   Rabbi Tavyomei said: While Jacob our patriarch was lying [mesev] in his bed,  (The expression “at his feast [bimsibo]” in the verse is interpreted as a reference to Jacob lying on his deathbed.)  the Divine Spirit gleamed in him, and he said to his sons: “God will be with you” (Genesis 48:21). He said to them: ‘He is destined to rest His Divine Presence in your midst.’ Rav Naḥman said: It is written: “Israel and everything that he had traveled and came to Beersheba” (Genesis 46:1). Where did he go? He went to chop down the cedars that Abraham our patriarch had planted in Beersheba, as it is stated: “He planted a tamarisk in Beersheba” (Genesis 21:33). (Jacob chopped them down in order to take them to Egypt.)  Rabbi Levi said: It is written: “The central bar inside the planks extending from end to end” (Exodus 26:28). The bar was thirty-two cubits long. From where did they have it in their possession at that moment? (Where did they get such a long piece of wood in the wilderness, just when they needed it to build this part of the Tabernacle?)  It teaches that they were hidden with them from the days of Jacob our patriarch. That is what is written: “And everyone with whom acacia wood was found” (Exodus 35:24); “acacia wood was found,” is not written here, but rather, “with whom…it was found”—from the outset. Rabbi Levi bar Ḥiyya said: They chopped them down in Magdala of the dyers (This was the name of a place in the Land of Israel.)  and took them with them down to Egypt. They had no knots and no cracks. There were acacia trees in Magdala and the custom was to prohibit [using] them due to the sanctity of the Ark. (Even in the times of the Sages of the midrash, acacia trees grew in Magdala, but due to the tradition that the wood eventually used for the Ark and the rest of the Tabernacle had been cut from there, the people of Magdala would not make use of the acacia trees.)  They came and asked Rav Ḥananya, colleague of the Rabbis, and he said to them: Do not deviate from the custom of your ancestors.</p>

The peace-offering aims to harmonize divine attributes, the sin-offering is to appease God, and the guilt-offering is for transgressions not resulting in excision. The sin-offering of a prince is a he-goat, as he is sovereign, and the guilt-offering is male to direct to a higher celestial region. The peace-offering is addressed to reunite male and female forces, while the sin-offering must be female to address negative commandments. The guilt-offering is male to atone for more serious sins. The peace-offerings are mentioned last in offerings to perfect character traits and are addressed to Hashem. The seventy bulls offered represent the nations under Hashem. Jacob's blessing refers to God as a shepherd and friend, indicating peace and friendship.

              <p>As one who occupies himself with the book of Genesis is similar to someone who offers a burnt-offering. And that is, &quot;This is the law of the burnt-offering,&quot; since the law of the burnt-offering is explained there. As Abel offered a burnt-offering from the firstborn of his flock (Genesis 4:4). And likewise with Noah, it is written, and he brought up burnt-offerings on the altar (Genesis 8:20). And likewise, Abraham, and he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt-offering instead of his son (Genesis 22:13).  And likewise, Jacob, and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac (Genesis 46:1).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>אלה תעשו לה' במועדיכם לבד מנדריכם ונדבותיכם, “these (offerings) you are to present for Hashem on your appointed festivals apart from your vows and free-will offerings, etc.” Actually, the Torah should have written: “your burnt-offerings and your peace-offerings” first, seeing these are offerings consisting of meat before switching to offerings which consist of meal-offerings and libations, instead of mentioning the most important offerings, i.e. the total (burnt) offerings only after the vows and free-will offerings. After all, our sages in Yuma 34 are specific about the burnt-offering always preceding other offerings and being the first offering presented on the altar each morning. The Torah concluded its list with the peace-offerings as the purpose of these offerings is להשלים המדות, “to strive to perfect one’s character traits” (compare author’s comments on Genesis 46,1). Moreover, it is the custom for the Torah whenever it enumerates a number of different offerings to conclude with the “peace-offerings.” Furthermore the greatest and concluding blessing of the priests is the blessing of peace, i.e. שלום. This then is the reason why here too the “peace-offerings” are mentioned last.  Just as the tetragrammaton had been associated with these offerings at the beginning of the chapter, the Torah also concludes with mentioning the fact that these offerings are addressed to Hashem. The Torah wishes to underline that all the offerings must always be addressed to this attribute and none other. The reason that the seventy bulls are mentioned between the beginning and the end of our chapter is to remind us that although they were offered on behalf of the seventy nations who are under the immediate care of their celestial representatives, the offerings were all addressed to the attribute Hashem, not to any underlings, angels, etc. The blessings which humanity enjoys from celestial sources are due to the seventy bulls offered to Hashem on behalf of the nations by the priests in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. Each “force” in the terrestrial world must recognize that there is a “force” above it, until eventually the highest “force” Hashem is reached. This is the meaning of Kohelet 5,7: “for there is One higher than high Who watches and there are high ones above them.”</p>

              <p>It is also possible to say, in accordance with a kabbalistic approach, that the addition of the two letters הו in our verse here in the word תזבחהו are a deliberate reminder of the last two letters in the tetragram, i.e. symbolising the two attributes Mercy and Justice. (compare author’s comments on Genesis 46,1). This is why there was a need here to add these two letters. It is similar to the same two letters being written in Exodus 2,6 where the Torah describes the reaction of Pharaoh’s daughter when she saw young Moses in the basket as ותראהו את הילד, instead of ותרא את הילד which is what could have been expected. In that instance our sages commented that the extra letters meant that the princess also saw a manifestation of the Lord’s presence, Shechinah, when she looked at the baby (compare Sotah 12). Seeing that the תודה offering which is the subject of the word תזבחו in Leviticus 22,29 was addressed to only one attribute, i.e. Hashem, there was no reason to append the letter ה in addition.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>It is also important to reflect on why the burnt-offering, עולה, always had to be a male animal, whereas the sin-offering always had to be a female animal, and the peace-offering could be either male or female. The reason is connected to the destination of the burnt-offering, עולה, which is beyond a realm in the celestial regions where male and female emanations or attributes are separated. The domains to which the עולה offering is addressed does not know the distinction of פועל ומקבל, an active and a passive, receiving agent. The peace-offering on the other hand, could be ether male or female seeing that it was addressed to the קו האמצעי, the line in the diagram of the emanations which re-unites the male and the female forces. This is also why the very term שלמים reminds us of its purpose to be משלים, to perfect, to unite that which had been apart, had been separated. I have already mentioned this on Genesis 46,1. It follows that in connection with the peace-offering the Torah writes: אם זכר אם נקבה, “be it male or female.”  The reason the sin-offering must be a female animal is that it addresses the attribute שמור, a word which refers to negative commandments, commandments which are violated by not guarding, not observing them, i.e. by ignoring the commandment שמור. No activity is required to fulfill a negative commandment. One does so by remaining passive, i.e. female. An activity is required to violate it. The reverse is true of positive commandments. One has to perform an activity in order to keep a positive commandment. Remaining passive vis-a-vis a positive commandment is tantamount to violating it. This leaves us with the problem why the guilt-offering called אשם which is to atone for violating certain negative commandments had to be a male animal rather than a female. According to the logic we presented it should also be an animal of the female category. [The author’s comments on this, assuming that the אשם atones for sins for which the penalty is karet is untenable as only the חטאת atones for such sins. I have decided not to speculate and amend the author’s words but to omit them. Ed.] The sinner who has to bring an אשם in order to exonerate himself has to direct his sacrifice to a higher celestial region than people guilty of a חטאת sin-offering. Hence this sacrifice has to be a male animal. The saying of the sages in Berachot 34 that “the place where repentant sinners stand is one where even perfectly righteous people (those who never sinned) cannot stand,” is meant for the kind of people who rehabilitate themselves by means of the אשם offering.</p>

              <p>THE G-D, BEFORE WHOM MY FATHERS, ABRAHAM AND ISAAC, DID WALK, THE G-D WHO HATH BEEN MY SHEPHERD ALL MY LIFE LONG UNTO THIS DAY. The prophet (Jacob. Ramban is here explaining the double use of Elokim (G-d) in this blessing: The G-d before Whom … the G-d who hath been my shepherd.)  calls upon the G-d of his fathers Who [has] the greatness and the power and Who did great and tremendous things for them, and [after that he refers to Him in a synonymous way and] he calls upon the true G-d, Who had been his shepherd all his life. It is possible that the word haro’eh (shepherd) — in the phrase, Who hath been my shepherd — is derived from the word rei’ah (friend), as in the verse, Thine own friend (‘rei’acha’), and thy father’s friend, forsake not, (Proverbs 27:10.)  for in that attribute there is peace and friendship. Do not find difficulty with the expression, all my life unto this day, in connection with that which we have written on the verse, And he offered sacrifices unto the G-d of his father Isaac, (Above, 46:1. The difficulty is that the verse here indicates that the attribute of peace was forever directing Jacob’s life, while in the verse above (46:1) Ramban explained that this attribute did not come into his life until that time. (Tziyoni. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 263.))  for from his very inception He did indeed lead him in the true path, but His attribute of truth was not brought to bear upon him completely until he returned to the land of his ancestors as he was outside of the Land, and also because he was constrained to conduct himself in a crafty manner towards Laban, and that was not the path of truth.</p>

              <p>AND IF HIS OFFERING BE A SACRIFICE OF PEACE-OFFERINGS: IF HE OFFER OF THE HERD, WHETHER MALE OR FEMALE. The reason why the burnt-offering may only be male, (Above, Chapter 1, Verses 3 and 10.)  whereas in the case of the peace-offering it can be male or female, and the sin-offering must only be female, (Further, 4:28. This applies only to the sin-offering of an ordinary individual. See further on in the text for the sin-offering of the prince (4:23).)  is very clear, since the olah (the burnt-offering) is as its name indicates, [i.e., “ascension” — being that it reaches above all Divine attributes], whilst sh’lamim (the peace-offering) is of the expressions: and all My pleasures ‘yashlim’ (he will perform — literally: he will “perfect”); (Isaiah 44:28.)  ‘avanim sh’leimoth’ (whole stones). (Deuteronomy 27:6. Since the peace-offering is brought in order to bring peace into the world, it performs the function of harmonizing all attributes, such as justice and mercy. Hence it may be brought from the male or female (Ricanti). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 19; also Note 240 further.)  The sin-offering is in order to appease Him with the present that goeth before (Genesis 32:21.)  Him. I have already written on this matter. (Ibid., 46:1 (Vol. I, p. 542): “Jacob offered peace-offerings in order to bring all Divine attributes into accord towards him …”. See also ibid., 32:21 (pp. 402-403).)  The guilt-offering must be a male, (Further, Chapter 5, Verses 15 and 25.)  because the sin-offering is brought for those transgressions [for which, if committed wilfully, the sinner] incurs the penalty of excision, in order that the spirit return unto G-d who gave it, (Ecclesiastes 12:7.)  but the guilt-offering is not brought for those transgressions for which [if committed wilfully] one incurs excision, and therefore it is as if it were for a pleasing odor just like the burnt-offering. (Hence just like the burnt-offering is a male [for the reason explained above], so is the guilt-offering.)  The sin-offering of the prince is a he-goat, (Further, 4:23; although the sin-offering of a common person is a female, as explained above.)  because the prince is the sovereign unto whom judgment [rightfully] belongs, (See Ezekiel 21:32.)  and he fights the battles of G-d and lives by his sword; (See Genesis 27:40.)  therefore his offering is the same as the he-goat brought in case of idol-worship [by the congregation]. (Numbers 15:24.) </p>

              <p>Now the man Moses was very humble, more so than any man on the face of the earth. (Numbers 12:3) There are two levels. The first is when a person’s thoughts are completely divorced from the physical realm. They remain transcendent, even when the person thinks about mundane matters. The second level is not so removed from physicality. This is the meaning of: “Moses, Moses – without a separation. Jacob, Jacob – with a separation” (Zohar 3:138a. Both in Genesis 22:11, where G‑d calls “Abraham, Abraham” and Genesis 46:2, where He calls “Jacob, Jacob,” the oral tradition inserts a pause between the reading of the two names, indicated by the cantillation mark ׀. However, no pause is found in Exodus 3:4, where G‑d calls, “Moses Moses.”)  Because there is Moses above and Moses below; a Jacob above and Jacob below. There is no separation in Moses’ case because he was always one, whether above or below. He was always above and removed from physicality.
Nevertheless, he remained humble even when involved with transcendent things – “more so than any man on the face of the earth.” That is, even more than a man whose thoughts are completely below, “on the face of the earth.” Moses thought of himself as lower than even him. Likutim Yikarim </p>

              <p>In the verse (Num. 12:7), &quot;Not so with My servant Moses; he is regular [ne'eman] throughout My household.&quot;  This is difficult -- the two clauses are inconsistent, for, with respect to the first clause, where is there mentioned any lack of regularity/faith [emunah] in other prophets? Actually, the idea is that all of the [other] prophets had to change when prophesying, by divesting themselves of materiality, and becoming like a new creation, as it is said, &quot;When prophecy rested on them, their faces would glow like torches, etc.&quot;  If so, prophecy does not attach to them intrinsically.  But for Mosheh Rabbeinu, a&quot;h, the opposite is true -- when he needed to speak with them [i.e., the people], a veil would be placed in front of his face, and he would have to alter his attire, while when the prophecy spoke through him, it would be from his actual appearance, as it is written (12:8), &quot;with him I speak mouth to mouth.&quot;  And this is what is called &quot;regular&quot; [ne'eman].  And thus, they [the other prophets] did not have to separate from their wives as did Moshe Rabbeinu, a&quot;h, as it is said (Zohar), &quot;Moshe Moshe [Exod. 3:4] has no break&quot; [no p'sik; contrast Gen. 22:11, Gen. 46:2, and I Sam. 3:10], for the Moshe of the lower realm is the Moshe of the upper realm, &quot;the man of God&quot; (Deut. 33:1).  But the other prophets were attached to their supernal source only at the time of prophesying.

              <p>AND HE SAID, JACOB, JACOB. After G-d had told him, Thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name, (Above, 35:10.)  it would be proper that He call him by this glorious name, and so he is indeed mentioned three times in this section. (In Verses 1, 2 and 5.)  However, He called him Jacob in order to hint that now he will not contend with G-d and men and prevail, [as the name Israel indicates], (Above, 32:29.)  but he will be in a house of bondage until He will also bring him up again, since the exile now begins with him. This is the meaning of the verse, And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons, (Verse 8 here.)  for they would come there with the appellation, “children of Israel,” since the children would multiply and increase there and their name and glory would extend. However, he is “Jacob” when descending thereto. The reason why Scripture mentions Er and Onan (Verse 12 here.)  together with the children of Israel who came into Egypt, (See Ramban above, 38:8.)  [although they had already died, as clearly stated in Verse 12]; is due to a secret which can be known from the words we have already written. (See Ramban above, 38:8.)  The learned student [of the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand this, as well as the meaning of the entire Verse [12]. Scripture likewise mentioned them among those numbered (The intent of the Hebrew text may also be that Scripture likewise mentions them “in the book of Numbers,” thus giving this sentence the same format as Ramban’s next sentence, “And in the book of Chronicles….”)  in the desert: The sons of Judah: Er and Onan; and Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Judah after their families were, etc. (Numbers 26:19-20.)  And there, in the book of Chronicles, Scripture enumerates them in another count: The sons of Judah: Er, and Onan and Shelah; which were born unto him of Bath-shua the Canaanitess…And Tamar his daughter-in-law bore him Perez and Zerah. All the sons of Judah were five. (I Chronicles 2:3-4. This is difficult to understand. Since two of his sons died prior to the birth of the youngest two, how does Scripture conclude that they totalled five? Thus there is here also an allusion to that which was referred to above.) </p>

              <p>ויאמר יעקב, “Yaakov said, etc.” even though G’d had told him that in the future he would no longer be called Yaakov but Israel, this change of name was not the same as that of Avram’s name being changed to Avraham. Avraham had undergone a name change in honour of changing his religion, becoming circumcised and simultaneously becoming JEWISH. This was not the case with Yaakov who had been born Jewish. While it would have been inappropriate to continue to refer to Avraham by his former name, in fact it would have been insulting, this consideration did not apply to the name Yaakov.
    Furthermore, if Yisrael had never again been called Yaakov, people would have thought that the stigma attached to the name Yaakov, i.e. the crooked one, had been justified at the time he had been known as such.
    Nachmanides writes that the reason the Torah reverted to calling him Yaakov at this stage, was to hint that once in Egypt, his task would no longer be to contend with the heavenly representatives of the spiritually negative forces, such as the angel representing Esau in heaven. From now on he would be basically in the house of slavery, as effective from now the years of exile G’d had predicted at the covenant of the pieces to Avraham had begun. This condition would continue until G’d would redeem the Jewish people from there and lead them to the Holy Land. If, nonetheless, the Torah in verse 5 begins to list the names of בני ישראל, “the children of Israel,” and not as we might have expected “the children of Yaakov,” even though it was these who traveled to their exile, it was to assure them that paradoxically, the Jewish people’s developing into a numerically strong nation was a process that would take place in the very land where they would be cruelly suppressed and tormented. Verse 5 was a look into the future, whereas our verse deals with the present, i.e. a period when Yaakov, their patriarch, would in a manner of speaking become a symbol and would inspire them by what he had already accomplished on earth, not by what he still had to accomplish.

            <summary>Maimonides uses the verb &quot;he went down&quot; in reference to God consistently in his version of the Bible, except for one instance in which he renders it literally, revealing an important principle regarding prophecy. Prophecy involves the senses ceasing to act, with the Active Intellect influencing the rational and imaginative faculties, leading to prophetic visions. Prophets often receive their prophecies through angels, even when they believe it is directly from God. Scripture indicates that communications from God or angels to individuals occur in dreams or prophetic visions.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>This is his rendering [of the verb yarad, “he went down,” when used in reference to God] throughout his version, with the exception of the following passage, “I will go down (ered) with thee into Egypt” (Gen. 46:4), which he renders literally. A remarkable proof of this great man’s talents, the excellence of his version, and the correctness of his interpretation! By this version he discloses to us an important principle as regards prophecy.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Under such circumstances the senses cease to act, and the [Active Intellect] influences the rational faculties, and through them the imaginative faculties, which become perfect and active. Sometimes the prophecy begins with a prophetic vision, the prophet greatly trembles, and is much affected in consequence of the perfect action of the imaginative faculty: and after that the prophecy follows. This was the case with Abraham. The commencement of the prophecy is, “The word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision” (Gen. 15:1); after this, “a deep sleep fell upon Abraham”; and at last, “he said unto Abraham,” etc. When prophets speak of the fact that they received a prophecy, they say that they received it from an angel, or from God; but even in the latter case it was likewise received through an angel. Our Sages, therefore, explain the words, “And the Lord said unto her” that He spake through an angel. You must know that whenever Scripture relates that the Lord or an angel spoke to a person, this took place in a dream or in a prophetic vision.</p>

          <details>
            <summary>In Kabbalistic teachings, the repetition of a name, such as &quot;Avraham, Avraham&quot; or &quot;Yaakov, Yaakov&quot;, signifies a pause between the two names, except for &quot;Moshe Moshe&quot;. This repetition indicates a completion or unity of the individual's spiritual aspects, with one spirit remaining in this world and the other in the World to Come. Isaac is an exception as his soul left him when he was to be sacrificed, and only the soul of the World to Come was returned to him. The repetition of a name reflects the aspect of the root remaining above in adhesion to the tree, symbolizing the flow of beneficence from above to the individual.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>This is also the meaning of those verses that relate to the righteous, in which their name is doubled. For example, (Genesis 22:11)  “Avraham, Avraham,” and, (Genesis 46:2)  “Yaakov, Yaakov,” and (Exodus 3:4)  “Moshe, Moshe.” That is, one of these names corresponds to the aspect of the root that remains above in adhesion to the tree, and this aspect is called the flow from above (Mazal) of a person. This is as our sages, of blessed memory, related, (Talmud Bavli, Menachot 29b)  that Moshe saw the flow from above (Mazal) of Rabbi Akiva sitting and expounding the thorns of the letters. For, it is from there that the beneficence flows to the branch that descended to manifest in the body.</p>

              <p>And this the secret that they teach &quot;Ad-nai Ad-nai&quot; (Exodus 34) there is a pause between them. In every place that a name is called twice there is a pause between them, such as &quot;Avraham, Avraham&quot; (Gen. 22:11); &quot;Yaakov, Yaakov&quot; (Gen. 46:2); &quot;Shmuel, Shmuel&quot; (I Samuel 3:10). All have a pause between them, with the exception of &quot;Moshe Moshe&quot;, which has no pause between them. What is the reason? &quot;Avraham, Avraham&quot; - the last is complete, the first not. At first he was not complete since now he became complete through ten tests, and therefore there is a pause between them, since now he was not as he was at the beginning.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Tosefta Why is &quot;Noah Noah&quot; (Gen. 6:9) written twice? Each and every righteous person in the world has two spirits. One stays in this world, while the other is in the World to Come. And so we find that the Holy One, blessed be He, named all the righteous twice: &quot;Moses, Moses&quot; (Ex. 3:4), &quot;Jacob, Jacob&quot; (Gen. 46:2), &quot;Abraham, Abraham&quot; (Gen. 22:11), &quot;Samuel, Samuel&quot; (I Shmuel 3:10) with the exception of Isaac. He is not named twice because when he approached the altar to be sacrificed, the soul that was within him in this world left him. And because it is said of Abraham, &quot;blessed are You who resurrect the dead&quot;, so only the soul of the World to Come was returned to him. And that is why you shall find that the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, was not unified (on any righteous person in his lifetime). It was unified only on Isaac, because he was already considered as dead. He was like those who pass away from this world. The verse therefore states: &quot;Behold, He puts no trust in His holy ones&quot; (Iyov 15:15) because He does not unify His name on the righteous during their lifetimes.</p>

            <summary>The repetition of names such as &quot;Moses, Moses&quot; signifies affection and encouragement, indicating the righteous nature of the individual before and after being spoken to by God, with the double name highlighting a deep connection to both this world and the world to come, as seen in the lives of other righteous figures like Noah, Abraham, Jacob, and Samuel. The Midrash emphasizes the significance of these repeated names in highlighting the righteousness and special relationship these individuals had with God, as well as the dual nature of their existence in both this world and the world to come.</summary>

                <h4>Bamidbar Rabbah 14:21</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>“He heard the Voice speaking with him” – was it, perhaps, a low-volume voice? The verse states: “The Voice.” It is not stated: “Voice,” but rather, “the Voice.” It was the Voice that is articulated in the verses. What is the Voice that is articulated in the verses? “The voice of the Lord is mighty; the voice of the Lord is majestic. The voice of the Lord breaks cedars.… The voice of the Lord hews flames of fire. The voice of the Lord makes the desert tremble; [the Lord makes the wilderness of Kadesh tremble.] The voice of the Lord causes deer to calve” (Psalms 29:4–5, 7–9). Is it, perhaps, that they would hear it from without? The verse states: “The Lord spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting” – it teaches that the Voice would cease and would not emerge outside the Tent.  Similarly, you say: “The sound of the wings of the cherubs was heard until the outer courtyard” (Ezekiel 10:5). Is it, perhaps, because it was a low-volume sound? The verse states: “Like the sound of God Almighty when He speaks” (Ezekiel 10:5). If so, why is it stated: “Was heard until the outer courtyard”? It is, rather, that when it would reach the outer courtyard, it would cease.  Rabbi Eliezer says: It says: “I will commune there with the children of Israel, and it will be sanctified with My glory” (Exodus 29:43) – I am destined to commune with them and to be sanctified through them. When? This is on the eighth day, as it is stated: “The entire people saw, raised their voice in praise, and fell upon their faces” (Leviticus 9:24); or, is it only to give them a place of communion for speech? The verse states: “I will commune with you” (Exodus 25:22) – communion was with you, but there was no communion for all of Israel. Perhaps, I will exclude Israel, who were not fit to ascend the mountain, but I will not exclude the elders, who were fit to ascend the mountain. Perhaps, I will exclude the elders, who were not seen in the speech with Moses, but I will not exclude Aaron’s sons, who were seen when the speech came to Moses. I will exclude Aaron’s sons, who were seen when the speech came to Moses, but I will not exclude Aaron, who communed in the speech with Moses. The verse states: “I will commune with you there” – the communion was with you, but for all of them there was no communion.   Perhaps, I will exclude them from communion but will not exclude them from the speech. The verse states: “I will speak with you” (Exodus 25:22). Perhaps, I will exclude Israel but I will not exclude the elders. Perhaps, I will exclude the elders, but I will not exclude the sons of Aaron. Perhaps, I will exclude the sons of Aaron, but I will not exclude Aaron himself. The verse states: “To speak to you” (Exodus 29:42) – the speech was with you, but the speech was not with all of them.  Is it, perhaps, that they would not hear the speech, but they would hear the voice? The verse states: “He heard the Voice speaking with him” – the Voice to him, “the Voice…with him.” Perhaps, I will exclude Israel, but I will not exclude the elders. Perhaps, I will exclude the elders, but I will not exclude the sons of Aaron. Perhaps, I will exclude the sons of Aaron, but I will not exclude Aaron himself. The verse states: A Voice to him. (The verse states, “the Voice speaking with him,” which the midrash interprets as meaning, “the Voice speaking to him.”)  I will exclude them all, but I will not exclude the ministering angels, as Moses was unable to enter their domain and their place until he is called. The verse states: The Voice to him, “the Voice…with him.” Moses would hear the Voice, but all these would not hear the Voice.  Is it, perhaps, that the Holy One blessed be He would speak with him, but would not call him first? The verse states: “[The Lord] called to Moses, and spoke” (Leviticus 1:1) – He had the call precede the speech. It is common courtesy that a person should not speak to another unless he calls him first. It is only logical; speech is stated at the Tent of Meeting, and speech is stated at the bush. Just as regarding the speech stated at the bush, calling preceded speech, as it is stated: “God called to him from the midst of the bush” (Exodus 3:4), so too, [regarding] the speech stated at the Tent of Meeting, calling preceded speech. No; if you said regarding the bush that was the beginning of speech, would you say the same regarding the speech at the Tent of Meeting, which was not the beginning of speech? The speech at Mount Sinai will prove that it is not so, as it was not the beginning of speech, and calling preceded speech. No; if you said regarding Mount Sinai that was to all Israel, would you say this regarding the Tent of Meeting which was not to all Israel? You derive from a paradigm; the defining characteristic of the bush, which was the beginning of speech, is not like the defining characteristic of speech at Mount Sinai, which was not the beginning of speech, and the defining characteristic of Mount Sinai that was to all Israel, is not like the defining characteristic of the bush, which was not to all Israel. The common denominator between them is that they are speech from the Holy One to Moses, and calling preceded speech, so, everything that is speech from the Holy One to Moses, we will have calling precede speech. Maybe [we will claim], what is the common denominator between them? [It is] that they are speech, in fire, from the Holy One to Moses, and calling preceded speech; so too, everything that is speech, in fire, from the Holy One to Moses, calling will precede speech, excluding speech at the Tent of Meeting, which was not in fire. The verse states: “Called…and spoke”; calling preceded speech.  Is it, perhaps, that there was calling only for this speech alone? From where is it derived regarding all the speech in the Torah? The verse states: “From the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 1:1) – anything that is from the Tent of Meeting, calling precedes speech. Is it, perhaps that there was calling only for speech alone; (Sometimes the Torah states that God spoke to Moses, [vaydaber], sometimes the phrase is: God said to Moses [vayomer], and sometimes the phrase is God commanded [vaytzav].)  from where is it derived even for sayings (Leviticus 16:2) and commands (Numbers 28:2)? Rabbi Shimon said: The verse teaches: [Rather than writing,] “Speak,” [the verse writes,] “and He spoke” (Leviticus 1:1), to include even sayings and commands.   Is it, perhaps, even for pauses? The verse states: “And He spoke” (Leviticus 1:1) – for speech there was calling, but there was no calling for pauses. What purpose did the pauses serve? It was to provide respite for Moses to deliberate between one portion and another and between one matter and another. The matter can be inferred a fortiori: If one who hears from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He and speaks by means of the Divine Spirit is required to deliberate between one portion and another and between one matter and another, all the more so a layman who hears from a layman.  From where is it derived that all the callings were, “Moses, Moses”? The verse states: “God called to him from the midst of the bush, and He said: Moses, Moses” (Exodus 3:4). From where is it derived that to each and every calling, he would answer: Here I am? The verse states: “He said: Moses, Moses, and he said: Here I am” (Exodus 3:4). The verse need not have stated: “And he said: [Here I am],” but rather, “and he answered: Here I am.” Why does the verse state: “And he said”? It teaches that to each calling, he would say: “Here I am.”  “Moses, Moses” (Exodus 3:4); “Abraham, Abraham” (Genesis 22:11); “Jacob, Jacob” (Genesis 46:2); “Samuel, Samuel” (I Samuel 3:10) – it is an expression of love and an expression of urging. Alternatively, “Moses, Moses” – he was Moses before He spoke with him, and Moses after He spoke with him. (Moses did not become arrogant because God spoke to him.) </p>

Alternatively, it means that Joseph would close Jacob’s eyes after his death, in which case God is stating that He will bring Jacob back to the Land of Israel eventually, but not in his lifetime (Yefeh To’ar). )  “Jacob arose from Beersheba and the sons of Israel conveyed Jacob their father, and their children, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh sent to convey him” (Genesis 46:5).   “They took their livestock, and their property that they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and they came to Egypt: Jacob, and all his descendants with him” (Genesis 46:6).   “His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his descendants, he brought with him to Egypt” (Genesis 46:7).  “Jacob arose….

              <p>&quot;You rebuked nations. This refers to Amalek, as it is said (Numbers 24:20), 'Amalek was the first of the nations.' You destroyed the wicked. This refers to Esau, the wicked one, as it is said (Malachi 1:4), 'They will call them the border of wickedness.' He committed five sins in one day: he had relations with a betrothed woman, committed murder, denied the resurrection of the dead, denied God's sovereignty, and showed contempt for the birthright. Their name shall be blotted out, as it is said (Exodus 17:14), 'I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek.' Rabbi Levi said: It is written (Genesis 25:23), 'Two nations are in your womb.' What did [God] say to her [Rebecca]? 'Two governments are in your womb.' I reveal to you what is hidden: 'The first of the nations shall emerge from you,' as it is said (Jeremiah 2:3), 'Israel is the holy first fruits of his harvest.' Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: God never needed to rely on an intimate relationship with a woman, except for that righteous woman [Rebecca], and even she was only through the medium of an angel. Rabbi said in the name of Rabbi Yose: It was through the name of Noah's son that [Rebecca] was blessed. 'Two nations are in your womb' - I [God] made seventy nations from [Noah's three sons], as it is said (Genesis 10:19), 'These are the three sons of Noah, and from these the whole earth was populated.' How? Japheth had fourteen descendants, Gog and Magog had thirty, and Ham had thirty. That makes seventy. (Genesis 10:5) 'From these the isles of the nations were separated.' 'And two nations are in your womb' - I will make from one [nation], seventy souls, and they will be fruitful and multiply. Another interpretation of 'two nations' is that one is proud of his wealth, and the other is proud of his royalty: Edom among the nations and Solomon among Israel.&quot; Another matter, two nations whose hatred is embedded in your womb, all hate Esau and all hate Jacob. Another matter, two nations that hate each other. They will separate from your womb. From this, we learn that Jacob was born circumcised and uncircumcised. He is one of the thirteen who were born circumcised. Adam, the first man, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah, Shem, Terah, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Samuel, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah were all born circumcised. Adam was at the beginning of the creation of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated, &quot;And he begot in his likeness, after his image&quot; (Genesis 5:3). Enoch, as it is stated, &quot;And Enoch walked with God&quot; (Genesis 5:24). And it is stated, &quot;Noah walked with God&quot; (Genesis 6:9). Noah, as it is stated, &quot;Noah was a righteous man&quot; (Genesis 6:9). Shem, as it is stated, &quot;These are the generations of Shem&quot; (Genesis 11:10). Whoever had his name repeated was born circumcised, such as Shem, Shem, Noah, Noah, Terah, Terah. Jacob, as it is stated, &quot;And Jacob was a straightforward man&quot; (Genesis 25:27). And it states, &quot;Jacob, Jacob&quot; (Genesis 46:2). Joseph, as it is stated, &quot;These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph&quot; (Genesis 37:2). This teaches us that he was born circumcised like him [Jacob]. Moses, as it is stated, &quot;Moses, Moses&quot; (Exodus 3:4). And it is stated, &quot;And she saw that he was good&quot; (Exodus 2:2). He was born circumcised. (Samuel I 3:10) (meaning Samuel IV, as it is written) Samuel, Samuel. Isaiah, as it is stated, &quot;The Lord called me from the womb&quot; (Isaiah 49:1). Jeremiah, as it is stated, &quot;Before I formed you in the belly I knew you&quot; (Jeremiah 1:5). David, as it is stated, &quot;A golden Psalm of David&quot; (Psalms 16:1). And much will the young servant serve. Rav Huna said, &quot;If he merited, he will serve, and if not, he will not serve.&quot; And when David saw how Esau made Israel slaves, he said before the Holy One, blessed be He, &quot;Rebuke the nations who seek to destroy me&quot; (Psalms 44:6).</p>

              <p>“Moses said: I will turn now, and see this great sight; why will the bush not burn?” (Exodus 3:3).   “Moses said: I will turn [asura] now and see.” Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Moses took five steps at that moment, as it is stated: “I will turn [asura] (It should have said asur. The numerical value of the additional heh alludes to the five steps that Moses took.)  now and see.” Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: He turned around and looked, as it is stated: “The Lord saw that he had turned to see” (Exodus 3:4). Once he looked at it, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘He is suitable to shepherd Israel.’   “The Lord saw that he turned to see, and God called to him from the midst of the bush and He said: ‘Moses, Moses.’ He said: ‘Here I am’” (Exodus 3:4).   Rabbi Yitzḥak said: What is “that he had turned [sar] to see?” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘This one is depressed and upset [sar veza’ef] (An allusion to I Kings 20:43, 21:4.)  over seeing Israel’s suffering in Egypt; therefore, he is suitable to be their shepherd. Immediately, “God called to him from the midst of the bush.”  “He said: ‘Moses Moses.’” You find in “Abraham, Abraham” (Genesis 22:11), there is a pasek (A biblical cantillation sign connoting a break between the two names.)  between them; “Jacob, Jacob” (Genesis 46:2), there is a pasek between them; “Samuel, Samuel” (I Samuel 3:10), there is a pasek between them. However, “Moses Moses,” there is no pasek between them. Why is it so? This is analogous to a person who placed upon himself a great burden, and calls: So-and-so so-and-so, my dear, unload this burden from me. (Due to the urgency of the matter he calls without pausing.)  Alternatively, with all the prophets, He ceased speaking with them; however, with Moses, He did not cease all his days.  Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai taught: What is “Moses Moses?” It is an expression of fondness and encouragement. Alternatively: “Moses Moses” – it is he who taught Torah in this world, and he is destined to teach in the World to Come, as Israel is destined to go to Abraham and say to him: ‘Teach us Torah.’ He will say: ‘Go to Isaac, who studied more than I did,’ and Isaac will say: ‘Go to Jacob, who attended [to his teachers] more than I did;’ and Jacob will say to them: ‘Go to Moses, who learned it from the mouth of the Holy One blessed be He.’ That is what is written: “They will go from strength to strength, they will appear to God [Elohim] in Zion” (Psalms 84:8), and elohim is in fact Moses, as it is stated: “See I have placed you as elohim to Pharaoh” (Exodus 7:1). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: Anyone whose name is doubled is in two worlds. (This world and the world-to-come.)  “He said: Do not draw near; remove your shoes from your feet, for the place upon which you are standing is holy ground” (Exodus 3:5).   “He said: Here I am” (Exodus 3:4) – here I am for priesthood and kingship. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘You are standing in the place of the pillar of the world: Abraham said: “I am here” (Genesis 22:1), and you said: “I am here.”’ Moses asked that priests and kings emerge from him. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Do not draw [tikrav] near [halom]” – meaning, your descendants will not be sacrificing [makrivin], as the priesthood is fated for Aaron your brother. Halom – this is kingship, as it is said: “That you have brought me [King David] to this point [halom]” (II Samuel 7:18), and it says: “Has a man [Saul] come here [halom] yet?” (I Samuel 10:22). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Kingdom is fated for David.’ Nevertheless, Moses received both of them. Priesthood, as he served during the seven days of inauguration; kingdom, as it is written: “There was a king in Yeshurun” (Deuteronomy 33:5).  “Remove your shoes” – any place that the Divine Presence reveals itself, wearing shoes is prohibited. Thus with Joshua: “Remove your shoes” (Joshua 5:15). And thus the priests served in the Temple only barefoot.</p>

              <p>AS FOR THE CONGREGATION. Some say that the heh prefixed to the word kahal (congregation) is the sign of the vocative. (According to this interpretation our verse reads: O congregation (ha-kahal), there shall be one statute both for you, and for the stranger.)  However, I believe that there is no vocative letter in the holy tongue. The four instances (Where a common noun is repeated. They are: Moses, Moses (Ex. 3:4); Abraham, Abraham (Gen. 22:11); Jacob, Jacob (Gen. 46:2); Samuel, Samuel (I Sam. 3:1).)  are proof of this. (That there is no vocative heh, otherwise why repeat the common noun.)  One of them is Moses, Moses. (Ex. 3:4. I.E. probably quotes Moses, Moses as an example because he is expounding the Book of Numbers, and Moses is the central human character.)  On the contrary, this heh (The heh prefixed to kahal.)  is the sign of the definite object. (Thus the meaning of ha-kahal is, the congregation.)  It is not a sign of the vocative.</p>

              <p>V’HAYU’ (AND IT SHALL BE) THAT THE WATER WHICH THOU TAKEST OUT OF THE RIVER ‘V’HAYU’ (SHALL BECOME) BLOOD UPON THE DRY LAND. “The word v’hayu is mentioned here twice. (The literal translation of the Hebrew text is: “And it shall be that the water which thou takest out of the river, and it will be blood upon the dry land.”)  It appears to me that if He had said, ‘V’hayu (And it shall be) that the water which thou takest out of the river be blood upon the dry land,’ I might understand it to mean that it would be turned into blood in his hand, and that also when it reached the ground it would remain in the same state. But now, [as the verse actually reads], the final v’hayu teaches us that it would not become blood until it reaches the dry land.” (The significance of this point is explained by L’vush Ha’orah (see Preface in Vol. I, p. IX, Note 12): If the water had turned into blood while still in Moses’ hand, skeptics could say that it was done through some secret art. But running or flowing water turning into blood upon reaching the ground was undeniably a miracle.)  Thus the language of Rashi. But the purport of this verse is not as the Rabbi [Rashi] has it, and there is no need for his Midrash, for the masters of language (Found in R’dak’s Sefer Hamichlal. The repetition of a verb occurs after a lengthy intervening phrase.)  have found in many places that it is the normal style of Scripture to repeat words for the purpose of emphasis and significance, or because of some lengthy phrase intervening between them. Such a case is the verse: And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul. (Deuteronomy 18:6.)  Here Scripture repeats [the verb] “come” because of the lengthy expression between [the parts of the verse]. Similarly: And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah; and he said: When ye act as midwives, etc.; (Above, 1:15-16. Here the verb “said” is repeated because of the identification of the midwives stated in the verse.)  And G-d spoke unto Israel in the visions of the night, and He said: Jacob, Jacob. (Genesis 46:2.)  There are many instances of such verses.</p>

              <p>‎Rashi’s commentary on the opening line of our portion ‎begins with the statement that when a tzaddik leaves his ‎hometown this leaves a void behind that is felt by the people ‎remaining behind. The implication appears to be that while the ‎‎tzaddik had been in his hometown his peers had not ‎realized how blessed they had been by his presence. He quotes ‎Ruth 1,7 where Naomi and Ruth’s leaving the fields of Moav are ‎described in a similar manner, i.e. their departure leaving behind a ‎void. Rashi claims that otherwise the Torah need only have ‎written ‎וילך יעקב חרנה‎, “Yaakov set out on his way to Charan.” ‎There are numerous instances where the departure of certain ‎individuals from the Holy Land is described as ‎וירד‎, “he ‎descended,” seeing that the land of Israel is considered as being on ‎a higher level than all the countries surrounding it. This ‎statement does not refer to the physical altitude of the land of ‎Israel, but to the spiritual level of the people inhabiting that land. ‎By not writing ‎וירד יעקב‎, “Yaakov descended,” the Torah wishes ‎the reader to know that he did not leave behind his spiritual ‎assets in the land of Canaan but that he took all his spiritual ‎equipment with him. Rashi himself refers to this when he ‎writes on the words ‎והנה אנכי עמך‎, “and behold I am with you,” ‎‎(28,15) that Mount Moriah was uprooted at that time and ‎accompanied Yaakov on his way to Charan. [Not found in ‎our editions of Rashi on that verse. Ed.] The ‎sanctity of the Holy Land accompanied Yaakov on his journey ‎into exile. Nonetheless he was greatly troubled by having to leave ‎the Holy Land. If we needed confirmation for Yaakov’s feelings ‎about this, we find it in Genesis 46,3 where at Beer Sheva Yaakov ‎has second thoughts about going to Egypt in order to see his son ‎Joseph once more, and G’d has to reassure him by telling him not ‎only that he should not be ill at ease about this undertaking, but ‎that as a result of his going to Egypt the Jewish people would ‎develop into a numerous nation there. Rashi there ‎comments that Yaakov’s primary fear was the very fact of his ‎having to leave the Holy Land (his second exile). He was assured ‎by G’d that the Shechinah would accompany him there.‎</p>

Yaakov’s reasoning for being fearful was his knowledge that being strangers in a foreign land and being slaves which had been decreed already in the lifetime of his grandfather Avraham would most likely commence now that he was moving to Egypt. G-d answered him that although He had warned his father and grandfather of this, He appeared to him in order to give him reassurance. He hinted that although he was correct in assuming that the warning would soon be fulfilled, but by the same token, the promise made to all the three patriarchs that they would develop into a great nation, came closer to its fulfillment.</p>

              <p>TO GO DOWN. Me-redah (to go down) is an infinitive. Its first root letter is missing. (Me-redah is made up of the infinitive redah (go down) plus the prepositional mem. The root of redah is yod, resh, dalet.)  Me-redah is similar to tenah in Whose majesty is rehearsed (tenah) above the heavens (Ps. 8:2). (The root of tenah is nun, tet, nun. Both redah (whose yod is missing) and tenah (whose nun is missing) are infinitives whose first root letters are missing.) </p>

              <p>אל תירא…כי לגוי גדול אשימך שם &quot;Do not be afraid…for I will make you into a great nation there.&quot; What precisely was Jacob afraid of when he set out to go to Egypt? If it was the fear of ushering in exile for his family, how did G'd's assurance alleviate that fear? If, on the other hand, G'd meant to console him that there would be no exile there, history teaches that Jacob's family became enslaved and suffered persecution and hard labour in Egypt! Besides, how did the announcement that Jacob would become a great nation while in Egypt console him over what he was afraid of? Why could he not develop into a great nation in any other place but Egypt? Furthermore, why did G'd add the letter ל and said לגוי גדול אשימך, instead of merely בי גוי גדול אשימך?</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Clearly, the Torah refers to the prediction/decree at the covenant between the pieces when G'd told Abraham (Genesis 15,13) that exile had already been decreed. No doubt Abraham had informed his son and grandson of this decree. When Jacob saw that food was for sale in Egypt, he immediately associated this with the fact that his descendants would endure exile there. He was afraid that this exile would commence the moment he arrived in Egypt.. He was also worried that he would be buried there, in a land which was totally impure. G'd therefore appeared to him in a dream describing Himself as the G'd of his father; He meant that just as the exile had not commenced during Isaac's life and Isaac had not experienced persecution, so it would not commence during Jacob's lifetime either. Concerning Jacob's intention to return to the land of Canaan as soon as the famine was over, G'd told Jacob that he would develop into a great nation in Egypt; in other words, G'd had a good reason why Jacob would not return to the land of Canaan soon. G'd alluded to this by saying כי לגוי גדול אשימך שם, i.e. in order for this to be accomplished you have to stay there for some considerable time.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>In order to understand the whole concept I must preface by quoting a tradition we have in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues (recorded in Likutey Torah, Miketz). The purpose of the various exiles is to isolate segments of sanctity which are scattered Within various branches of the קליפה, the &quot;peel&quot; surrounding the kernel which is all sanctity. Inasmuch as Egypt was full of abominations [manifestations of such a קליפה, Ed.] and impurity had its &quot;headquarters&quot; in that country, it was no more than natural that many such segments of sanctity were scattered throughout that country. In fact the amounts of such scattered segments of sanctity are usually proportionate to the amount of impurity and defilement that abound in a certain area or environment. The phenomenon we have just described originated as soon as Adam sinned. It has been Israel's task to &quot;rescue&quot; all those splinters of sanctity and to make them part of a whole. Our sages (quoted in Likutey Torah on Parshat Vayeshev) have said that the nation that left Egypt and experienced the revelation at Mount Sinai was previously captive within this קליפה called Egypt. It is to such a nation that Moses said in Deut. 4,8: &quot;who is a great nation possessing such righteous statutes, etc.&quot; G'd told Jacob that the purpose of Israel spending time in exile in Egypt was to enable it to develop into this great nation. &quot;The great nation&quot; [all the fragments of sanctity, Ed.] at that time was &quot;lost&quot; amongst all the Egyptians and it had to be isolated and then led out from there. Unless Jacob descended to Egypt at this time, there would be no hope of accomplishing this. It was because Jacob represented sanctity in a powerful and concentrated form that he could become the &quot;magnet&quot; which would attract the various scattered segments of sanctity that still abounded in Egypt in an ineffectual form. This is the meaning of the statement in Bereshit Rabbah 79,1 that Jacob did not depart from this world until he had seen 600.000 descendants. These 600.000 were the ones who endured persecution there and were ultimately refined in what our sages are fond of calling the &quot;iron crucible&quot; which welded the Jewish people into a nation and enabled them to leave Egypt after having been refined. Jacob understood then that is was necessary for him to settle in Egypt for the rest of his life and he was no longer filled with dismay at that prospect, especially so since G'd assured him that he personally, would not experience oppression and persecution. As to Jacob's final concern, that he would not want to be buried amidst the impurities that Egypt was full of, G'd assured him that He would see to it that Jacob would be buried in the land of Israel.</p>

If I tell you now to proceed to Egypt, I do not want you to be afraid of this trip.” We have a similar assurance phrased by a warning not to be afraid in Isaiah 41,14 “do not be afraid, O worm Jacob.” A third example of G’d offering reassurance by phrasing it in a similar manner is found in Isaiah 41,10 “fear not for I am with you, be not frightened for I am your G’d.”</p>

          </summary>
          <details>
            <summary>The events leading up to Pesach were preordained as part of a plan by God, as seen in the Covenant between the Pieces and Jacob's descent into Egypt. However, the generation of Jews in Egypt was not preordained to suffer, as their move to Egypt was voluntary and not decreed by God. Despite God hardening Pharaoh's heart during the ten plagues, repentance is always possible, as seen in the cases of Achav and Menashe, challenging the idea that wickedness leads to a loss of free will.</summary>

                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 36:1:6</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Yet one may strive to understand why the generation of Jews in Egypt was subjected to such a cruel fate at the hands of the Egyptians and Pharaoh. Especially, are we entitled to do so, since scripture does not offer a list of specific wrongdoings of the people? The author rejects many solutions offered by his predecessors as being inadequate. Most of those explanations would violate the principle of our freedom of choice in one form or another. The author insists that statements such as &quot;he went down to Egypt,&quot; ((Deut. 26,5) or &quot;and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt,&quot; (Joshua 24,4) have to be understood at face value, and confirm that the move to Egypt was entirely voluntary, not pre­ordained in any way. It is interesting that throughout the events leading up to the arrival of Jacob in Egypt, G-d ascribes all happenings to Himself, except this last one (compare Joshua 24,3): &quot;I took your father, I multiplied his seed, I gave him Isaac. I gave Jacob to Isaac,” but &quot;Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.&quot;The statement G-d made to Jacob while the latter was on his way to Egypt (Genesis 46,3), &quot;Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt,&quot; is to be understood as permission, as an assurance of G-d’s continued support. Just as the spies Moses had sent out to check out the land of Canaan were not prevented from setting out on their mission (Numbers Chapter 13), so Jacob was not prevented from going down to Egypt. According to all this, the statement on the occasion of the covenant between the pieces (Genesis 15,13), &quot;Know that your seed will be a stranger in a land that is not theirs etc.,&quot; was simply a piece of information to Abraham, not an evil decree. The Torah, by not stating that this occurrence would be due to Divine intervention, as could have been implied by such statements as &quot;I will make them strangers&quot; or &quot;I will bring them down to Egypt,&quot; draws our attention to the fact that this was merely an announcement of an event in the future, but was not a decree. The most difficult example in the series dealing with the apparent suspension of free will is the repeated statement by G-d, &quot;I will harden the heart of Pharaoh&quot; or &quot;I have hardened the heart of Pharaoh,&quot; as found in the chapters dealing with the ten plagues (Exodus Chapters 4-10). On the other hand, we find that repentance by even the worst sinners is readily accepted, such as the repentance of Achav and Menashe, son of Chiskiyahu (compare Kings I 16 and Kings I 21, Kings II 21, Chronicles II 33,13). The Bible describes those two as being wicked par excellence; yet in the case of Pharaoh it seems that whenever he began to repent, obstacles were placed in his way to prevent him from repenting effectively. The author argues against Maimonides's view (Hilchot Teshuvah 6) that wickedness is cumulative, so that at some point the sinner forfeits his right to free will. The author feels that the repeated missions to Pharaoh by Moses would have been wasted, had they not been intended to produce a change of heart in Pharaoh. Also, since G-d had already told Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3, 19) that Pharaoh would not release the Israelites of his own accord, this had been prior to any mention having been made that &quot;I will harden his heart.&quot; </p>

              </summary>
              <p>The question is unavoidable, given the terms of the biblical narrative. The Torah indicates that there was nothing accidental about the events leading up to Pesaḥ. Centuries before, Abraham had been told by God in the Covenant between the Pieces, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and ill-treated for four hundred years” (Gen. 15:13). We make repeated reference in the course of the Haggada to the fact that the whole sequence of events was part of a preordained plan. God had already “calculated the end” of suffering. When Jacob went down to Egypt he was, we say, anus al pi hadibbur, “compelled by what had been spoken.” God himself told Jacob, “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there” (Gen. 46:3), without intimating the sufferings his children would endure. The sages say that at the end of his life, when Jacob wanted to tell his children what would happen to them at the end of days, the gift of prophecy was taken from him. Without knowing it, the Israelites were part of a narrative that had been scripted long before.</p>

              <p>“My beloved is like a gazelle or a fawn [ofer ha’ayalim]…” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, in truth you came to us first. “My beloved is like a gazelle” – just as the gazelle leaps, so the Holy One blessed be He leapt and bounded from Egypt to the sea and from the sea to Sinai. In Egypt, “I will pass in the land of Egypt…” (Exodus 12:12). At the sea, “this is my God and I will exalt Him” (Exodus 15:2). At Sinai, “He said: The Lord came from Sinai” (Deuteronomy 33:2). “Or a fawn” – Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: To the fawn of deer. (Rabbi Yosei teaches that &quot;ofer ha'ayalim&quot; means a fawn, and not a certain type of deer.)   “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9) – this is the wilderness of Sinai. “Watching from the windows” (Song of Songs 2:9) – “the Lord descended upon Mount Sinai…” (Exodus 19:20). “Peering through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9) – “God spoke all these matters…” (Exodus 20:1). “My beloved spoke up and said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10) – “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2).   Another matter: “My beloved is like a gazelle” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: Master of the universe, You told us that You will come to us first. “My beloved is like a gazelle” – just as the gazelle appears and is then concealed, so, the initial redeemer appeared and was then concealed. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Levi: Like the initial redeemer, so will be the ultimate redeemer. The initial redeemer, this is Moses; he appeared to them and was then concealed from them. How long was he concealed from them? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: Three months; that is what is written: “They encountered Moses and Aaron…” (Exodus 5:20). (“Encountered” indicates that there had been an interruption in the contact between them.)  The ultimate redeemer, too, will appear to them and will then be concealed from them. How long will he be concealed from them? Rabbi Tanḥuma said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama ben Rabbi Hoshaya: Forty-five days. That is what is written: “From the time of the abolishing of the daily offering and the setting up of the abomination of desolation there will be one thousand two hundred and ninety days” (Daniel 12:11), and it is written: “Happy is one who waits, and reaches one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days” (Daniel 12:12). How many are these extra days? They are the forty-five days that he will be concealed from them and will then reappear to them.   Where will he take them? (Where will they be during those forty-five days?)  Some say to the Judean desert, and some say to the wilderness of Siḥon and Og. Anyone who believes him and follows him will eat roots of the broom tree and saltwort leaves; that is what is written: “Who pick saltwort from bushes, and the root of the broom tree is their food” (Job 30:4). Anyone who does not follow him will go and make peace with the nations of the world, and they will ultimately kill him. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Maryon said: At the conclusion of forty-five days, the Holy One blessed be He will cause manna to fall for them. That is what is written: “I will yet settle you in tents as in the appointed [moed] days” (Hosea 12:10), and it says: “The appointed time [moed] of your exodus from Egypt” (Deuteronomy 16:6). “Or a fawn” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: To the fawn of deer.  “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9) – this is the western wall of the Temple, which is never destroyed. Why? It is because the Divine Presence is in the west. “Watching from the windows” (Song of Songs 2:9) – due to the merit of the patriarchs; “peering through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9) – due to the merit of the matriarchs. Just as there is a distinction between a window and a crack, so there is a distinction between the merit of the patriarchs and the merit of the matriarchs. “My beloved spoke up and said to me” (Song of Songs 2:10) – what did He say? “As I live, the utterance of the Lord, that you will don all of them like jewelry, and you will tie them like a bride” (Isaiah 49:18).  Another matter: “My beloved is like a gazelle” (Song of Songs 2:9) – just as this gazelle leaps from place to place, from fence to fence, from tree to tree, and from booth to booth, so, the Holy One blessed be He leaps and bounds from this synagogue to that synagogue. Why to that extent? It is order to bless Israel, as it is stated: “In every place I mention My name, [I will come to you and I will bless you]” (Exodus 20:21). By what merit? It is by the merit of Abraham our patriarch, as it is written: “So [ko] you shall bless,” just as it says: “So [ko] shall be your offspring” (Genesis 15:5). “Or a fawn” (Song of Songs 2:9) – Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: To the fawn of deer.  “Behold, he is standing behind our wall” (Song of Songs 2:9) – when the Holy One blessed be He came to visit Abraham our patriarch on the third day since his circumcision, just as it says: “The Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre, and he was sitting [yoshev]…” (Genesis 18:1). Yashav is written. (Yoshev is written without a vav, so it looks like yashav.)  He sought to stand; the Holy One blessed be He said to him: Sit, Abraham, you are a paradigm for your descendants, as when your descendants enter synagogues and study halls and recite Shema, they sit and My glory stands. What is the source? “God stands [nitzav] in the assembly of the Almighty” (Psalms 82:1) – Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: It is not written here, “God omed,” (The word “stands” would usually be rendered as omed.)  but rather, “God nitzav,” at the ready. This is just as it says: “It will be before they call, I will answer” (Isaiah 65:24). That is why it is stated: “Behold, he is standing behind our wall”; these are the synagogues and study halls.  “Watching from the windows” (Song of Songs 2:9) – when the Holy One blessed be He said to Aaron and his sons: “So you shall bless…,” Israel said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, to the priests You said that they should bless us. We need only Your blessings and to be blessed from Your mouth.’ That is what is written: “Look from Your holy abode, from Heaven, and bless Your people Israel” (Deuteronomy 26:15). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘Although I said to the priests that they should bless you, with them I stand and bless you.’ That is why the priests spread their hands, saying: The Holy One blessed be He is standing behind us. That is why it says: “Watching from the windows” – from between the priests’ shoulders; “peering through the cracks” (Song of Songs 2:9) – from between the priests’ fingers. “My beloved spoke up and said to me” – “and I will bless them” (Numbers 6:27).  “So you shall bless” – that is what is written: “I will render you a great nation…” (Genesis 12:2). Rabbi Pinḥas ben Yair said: The Holy One blessed be He blessed Abraham with seven blessings, and these are they: “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2); “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2); “I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:2); “you will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2). I will bless those who bless you” (Genesis 12:3); “one who curses you, I will curse” (Genesis 12:3), “[all the families of the earth] will be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3). These correspond to the seven verses in the act of Creation in which “that it was good” is written. (Seven including Genesis 1:31: “And it was very good.”)   Rabbi Levi bar Ḥayata and Rabbi Abba son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: There are three expressions of greatness and four blessings written here. He apprised him that there would be three patriarchs and four matriarchs. But is it not that there are only two expressions of greatness? “I will render you [ve’e’eskha]” is an expression of greatness (Thus, there are, in fact, three expressions of greatness.) , as it is written: “It is the Lord who appointed [asa] Moses [and Aaron]” (I Samuel 12:6).  Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – this is that we recite: God of Abraham. “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2) – this is that we recite: God of Isaac. “I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:2) – this is that we recite: God of Jacob. Do we, perhaps, conclude with all of them? The verse states: “You will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2) – it is with you they conclude: The Shield of Abraham, and we do not conclude with all of them. (This midrash is referring to the first blessing of the Amida prayer.)  Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ze’eira said: “You will be a blessing” – your blessing precedes Mine, as after they recite Shield of Abraham, only then do they recite: Who revives the dead.   Another matter: “You will be a blessing [berakha]” (Genesis 12:2) – you will be a pool [berekha]. Just as this pool purifies the impure, you, too, draw the distant under the wings of the Divine Presence. “I will render you [ve’e’eskha] a great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – Rabbi Berekhya said: It is not written here, Etenkha, (See Genesis 17:20: “I will make him [untativ] a great nation.” asimekha) , (See Genesis 46:3: “I will make you [asimekha] a great nation there.”)  but rather ve’e’eskha. (This connotes creation of a new entity.)  After I create you as a new creation, just as it says: “God made [vayaas] the firmament” (Genesis 1:7), then you will be fruitful and multiply.  “A great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – Abraham said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, from Noah, did You not produce seventy nations?’ He said to him: ‘That nation in whose regard it is written: “For who is a great nation” (Deuteronomy 4:7), I am producing from you.’ Rabbi Pinḥas HaKohen bar Ḥama said: When did the Holy One blessed be He render Abraham a great nation? It was when they departed from Egypt, came to Sinai, received the Torah, and arrived in the Land of Israel. Moses looked at them and said: They have been rendered just as the Holy One blessed be He promised to the elder, as it is stated: “And who is a great nation” (Deuteronomy 4:8). Alternatively, “a great nation” – as I will give your descendants the Torah, and from it they will be called a great nation, as it is stated: “It is a particularly wise and understanding people, this great nation” (Deuteronomy 4:6).   “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2) – Rabbi Berekhya said: Because travel causes a person three phenomena: It lessens procreation, it lessens his expenditure, (It reduces his disposable income.)  and it lessens his reputation; that is why it was stated to him: “I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:2) – travel will not lessen your procreation; “I will bless you” – travel will not lessen your expenditure; “I will make your name great” (Genesis 12:2) – it will not lessen your reputation.  People say in a parable: From house to house, a cloak; from place to place, a soul. However, you will lose neither a soul nor property.  “You will be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2) – it is already written: “I will bless you” (Genesis 12:2); why does the verse state: “You will be a blessing”? Rabbi Eliezer said: The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘From when I created My world until now, I needed to bless My creations,’ as it is stated: “God blessed them…” (Genesis 1:28), and it says: “God blessed Noah and his sons” (Genesis 9:1). ‘But from here on, the blessings are granted to you; to one whom you see fit to bless, bless.’ Nevertheless, Abraham did not bless his sons. Why is it so? It is analogous to a king who had an orchard and he entrusted it to a sharecropper. In that orchard there was one tree that was an elixir of life and one tree a deadly poison. The sharecropper said: I will cultivate and complete [my work], and the king will do with his orchard what he chooses. So, the king, this is the Holy One blessed be He. The orchard, this is the world. He granted it to Abraham, as He said to him: “You will be a blessing.” What did Abraham do? He had two sons, one righteous and one wicked: Isaac and Ishmael. Abraham said: If I bless Isaac, Ishmael will request to be blessed, and he is wicked. Rather, I am a servant; I am flesh and blood. Tomorrow, I will pass from the world, and what the Holy One blessed be He wishes to do in His world, He will do. When Abraham passed away, the Holy One blessed be He appeared to Isaac and blessed him, as it is stated: “It was after the death of Abraham, [God blessed Isaac his son]” (Genesis 25:11). Isaac blessed Jacob, and Jacob blessed the twelve tribes, as it is stated: “All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve, and this is that which their father spoke to them, and he blessed them” (Genesis 49:28). From here on, the Holy One blessed be He said: ‘The blessings are granted to you. The priests will bless My children, just as I said to Abraham their patriarch: “You will be a blessing.”’ That is why it is stated: “So you shall bless…”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>The midrashic commentators in Exodus Rabba read Exodus 3 with great sensitivity to both the local context (the use of an unusual phrase within the context of a verse) and the more global one (the absence of the same phrase where it might have been expected later in the chapter). The phrase in question, “I am the Lord of your father,” with which God identifies Himself to Moshe at the beginning of their long dialogue, requires comment for two reasons. First, the phrase is unusual, appearing only four times in the entire Tanakh. (The first two appearances of the phrase are in Genesis. In Genesis 46:3, when God tells Yaakov to go down to Egypt and not to be afraid, He refers to Himself as “the Lord of your father.” In Genesis 50:17, the brothers of Yosef, in asking his forgiveness after the death of their father say, “…and now please bear the sin of the servants of the Lord of your father.” In both these cases, the father referred to is one of the Patriarchs. The third occurrence is discussed above. The last place this phrase occurs is in the first book of Chronicles 28:9 when David, addressing Shlomo, says, “And you, Shlomo, my son, know the Lord of your father…,” the father in question being, of course, himself.)  Second, the phrase, which in verse 6 precedes the description of God as the Lord of Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov, is missing from verse 15 when God tells Moshe, “Thus you should say to the children of Israel, God, the Lord of your fathers, the Lord of Avraham, the Lord of Yitzhak, and the Lord of Yaakov has sent me to you....”</p>

            <summary>God emphasizes the contrast between the Israelites' enslavement in Egypt and their current freedom, with the redemption being necessary for the souls imprisoned by impurity (Or HaChaim). Jacob's descent into Egypt was a necessary step in fulfilling the promise of becoming a great nation, despite initial fears of impurity (Maarechet Heidenheim, Zevach Pesach, The Jonathan Sacks Haggadah). The Israelites' experience in Egypt was crucial for refining them and preparing them to receive the Torah, with the suffering serving to shorten their exile and lead to redemption (Or HaChaim). The blessings and promises made to the patriarchs were conditional on worthiness, and the fulfillment of these promises was seen in the growth and multiplication of the Israelites in Egypt (Da'at Zekenim, Chizkuni). The use of carriages to transport Jacob to Egypt fulfilled the promise of becoming a great nation (Da'at Zekenim, Chizkuni).</summary>

              <p>ויתן לך אלוקים, “and may G–d give you, etc.;” Yitzchok, -remarkably- addresses the attribute of Justice of G–d when we might have expected him to address the attribute of mercy. By doing so he implied that this blessing was conditional on the person on whom it had been bestowed being worthy of it. Nonetheless, when it comes to Esau, we see that Yitzchok does not include such a condition in his blessing, as in verse 39 in our chapter he reassures him by saying: “your dwelling will be in the fat parts of the earth and you will enjoy the dew from above. You will live by the sword, although you will serve your brother.” He adds that on the contrary, the blessing given to his brother Yaakov is conditional on his not making your life intolerable.” [my choice of words. Ed.] It is noteworthy that in his lengthy prayer after consecrating the Temple he has built, King Solomon attaches the condition of worthiness when speaking of how G–d shall respond to the prayers of the Israelites, whereas when speaking of gentiles coming to Jerusalem to pray there, he does not attach such a condition but asks G–d to grant the wishes of such gentiles, regardless. (Kings I 8,32-43) Solomon is concerned that the gentiles should not get the impressions that our G–d is someone with Whom one needs to bargain. Yitzchok was concerned about the same when realising that Esau, if he insisted on his blessing surely credited G–d in heaven with being the One Who would provide its becoming reality. If he did not think so, why would he demand it? [When G–d fulfills the requests of a gentile, without regard to his worthiness, if the gentile as a result does not become G–d fearing and grateful, he will find that the very fulfillment of his request will eventually boomerang and he will more than lose its benefit. Ed.] You will also find that there are ten different categories of blessings, corresponding to the ten utterances used by G–d when He created His universe, and corresponding to the Ten Commandments. These blessings were pronounced on seven different occasions. 1) here; 2).Genesis 28,3: ואל שדי יברך אותך and the attribute of G–d known as shadday will bless you. 3) Genesis 28,13 (to Yaakov); 4) Genesis 32,27: “I will not let you depart (Yaakov to the angel he had wrestled) until you bless me;” 5) Genesis 35,9: “G–d appeared to Yaakov;” 6) Genesis 46,3; and Genesis 12,2, where G–d blessed Avraham for the first time. Avraham was blessed by G–d on seven different occasions. The Jewish people were given seven different (days) that are holy, most of them festivals: Sabbath, Passover, Shavuot, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Sukkot, and Sh’mini Atzeret. There are seven stars that serve the sun and the moon in their orbits. [The author adds some astronomical observation that have to do with the time to plant and harvest being related to sunset and sunrise which I have not understood. Ed.]

              </summary>
              <p>Baruch Shomer Havtachato: God's Promise to Jacob Translator's Introduction:  Rabbi Bondi suggests that the promise referred to here is not the 'Covenant of the Pieces' (Genesis 15) made to Abraham but the promise God made to Jacob just before he went down to Egypt to see Joseph. For Rabbi Bondi, Abraham's promise doesn’t seem like much of a promise: God tells him that his ancestors will be enslaved and oppressed in a land not their own, but eventually will leave with great wealth. God, on the other hand, reassures Jacob at Beersheba: God tells him not to worry and that He will go down with the people to Egypt. Our commentator interpret these words, &quot;Praised is the One who keeps His promise,&quot; in this context. Finally, there is one other significance difference in Bondi's interpretation. The 'great wealth' that Israel takes from Egypt is not the goods they plunder but the commandments they receive from God at Mount Sinai. Unlike most commentators, Rabbi Bondi sees Israel as worthy of redemption rather than lost on the brink of oblivion, about to descend into the fiftieth level of impurity. This was Jacob's fear but, according to Rabbi Bondi, the years of slavery actually made Israel stronger.  Why do we say that God kept the promise he made to 'Israel'? Didn’t God make this promise to Abraham? Israel refers to the promise that God made to Grandfather Israel (Yisrael Saba), that is, our forefather, Jacob. Jacob was aware of the decree which God had made to Abraham: &quot;Your offspring shall be strangers in a land not theirs, and they shall be enslaved and afflicted for four hundred years…&quot; (Genesis 15:13) Egypt is not explicitly mentioned in this passage because God turns freedom of choice over to human beings. (That is, the land in which Israel would become strangers was not pre-determined) Still, the verse alludes to Egypt for Joseph transferred the Egyptians from place to place throughout the land so that they would not consider the land their inheritance. He was trying to avoid Egypt becoming the land of Israel's subjugation. This is what the commentators suggest the expression, &quot;A land not their own,&quot; means. The land did not belong to the Egyptians. Because of this decree, our forefather Jacob was fearful of going down to Egypt. Egypt was the most despicable of lands. Jacob felt that if his family had to spend four hundred years they would sink into the impurity of the Egyptians and would no longer be worthy of being redeemed. It was for this reason that God said: &quot;Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt. I will go down with you.&quot; (Gen 46:3) Wherever Israel is exiled, the Divine Presence is with them. &quot; I will also go up with you…&quot; (Gen. 46:4) God  also reassured Jacob, &quot;I will not allow your children to sink into the fiftieth level of impurity. Jacob also hinted to his children that they would not be in Egypt more than two hundred and ten years when he said to them, &quot;Go down (r'du)  to Egypt (see Rashi on Gen. 42:10).  God agreed to this, and along with God's promise Jacob was reassured. It was through the furnace of oppression in Egypt that Israel was refined and prepared to receive the Torah. It did not turn out as Jacob thought; he believed the people would deteriorate there and that is why he was afraid. The thoughts of the Holy One are mysterious. For instead of sinning, Israel was refined like silver until they finally sanctified the name of God in Egypt, at the sea, and in the wilderness. But the decree was four hundred years enslaved! What did the Holy One do? He made the yoke of servitude more severe so that they would complete the four hundred years sooner rather than later. They were refined more quickly in this way, so that Israel was enslaved only half the time. This is the meaning of, &quot;Praised is the one who keeps his promise to Israel.&quot; God told Jacob not to be afraid - and &quot;He recalculated the end,&quot; of servitude - the amount of time in Egypt, shortening their exile by 190 years. This is the meaning of the expression, &quot;God calculated the end (ketz) .&quot;  Even though they were only slaves 210 years it was as if they were there a full 400 years. &quot;They went forth with great wealth.&quot; The word great appears to be superfluous in this verse. It could have said, &quot;They went forth with wealth.&quot; They were so refined by the suffering of Egypt that they not only left with material wealth from the Egyptians (silver, gold and clothing), but they were worthy of receiving an even greater possession: the commandments of Passover and Circumcision. They were also worthy of receiving the Torah at Sinai which is our greatest possession.</p>

I must go and see him before I die.” (Gen. 45:28) it was his intention to go down to Egypt but to stop at the border. He thought that Joseph would come up and meet him there. Once Jacob saw Joseph, he would return to the land of Canaan. Immediately after the Torah states, “I will go and see him,” it states, “So Israel set out with all that was his…” (Gen. 46:10), meaning he took what he needed for the trip. It didn’t occur to him to take his herds, flocks, and his possessions, as it said afterwards. “That night God appeared to Jacob and said, “Don’t be afraid to go down to Egypt…” (Gen. 46:3 ) Thus, the statement, “Compelled by the word of God….” teaches us that he was then told that he must go down to Egypt. Only then does it state, “and they took along their livestock and the wealth that they had amassed in Canaan. Thus Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt:” (Gen. 46:6)</p>

              <p>These three components symbolised three things. 1) The exile which had embittered the Israelites' lives; 2) The suddenness of the Exodus so that even their dough did not have time enough to rise. 3) The fact that G'd &quot;passed over&quot; the houses of the Israelites which was a major element of the redemption. This &quot;leap-frogging&quot; severed Israel's previous dependence on the Egyptians which had appeared as incapable of separation. I have explained the nature of the good being inextricably intertwined with the evil in my commentary on Exodus 11,5. Redemption meant the tearing asunder of these bonds between good and evil. These three phenomena had to be experienced simultaneously otherwise the whole redemption would not have been possible. If a single element had been lacking the other two would not even have been miraculous at all by themselves. Without the exile experience no other refining process could have been effective and could have borne fruit. We have explained in our commentary on Genesis 46,3 how the descent into the immoral environment of Egypt was a necessary prelude to &quot;rescuing&quot; the souls that had been taken captive by the forces of the קליפה at the time Adam had eaten from the tree of knowledge. This is also the mystical dimension of Kohelet 8,9: &quot;there is a time when one man rules over another to his detriment.&quot; Had the Exodus not occurred as abruptly as it did, the Israelites might well have returned to Egypt to become ever more deeply mired in that moral morass. This idea is best expressed by the author of the Haggadah shel Pessach who claims that: &quot;if G'd had not taken us out of there (at the time), then both we and our forefathers would have remained subservient to Pharaoh in Egypt.&quot; This is what the Torah means in 12,39 when it testifies that &quot;they could not tarry any longer.&quot; The principal element of the redemption was the פסיחה, &quot;the skipping over.&quot; Hillel (Pessachim 115) symbolised the importance of the simultaneous occurrence of these three elements when he insisted that we must consume the meat, the bitter herbs and the unleavened bread as a single &quot;sandwich.&quot;</p>

The Israelites had been enslaved in a country which was notorious for not releasing slaves nor letting them escape (compare Isaiah 14,17). The Israelites had two major strikes against them at the time. They were mired deeply in impurity, and they were under the rule of a king notorious for not letting anyone escape. </p>

Accordingly, G'd repeated the statement concerning the Exodus because it referred not only to the bodies but also to the souls. The many stray souls which had been imprisoned in Egypt as part of the loot captured by the forces of the קליפה after Adam's sin had also been freed at that time.</p>

              <p>Once we remind ourselves that the souls of the Jewish people are the very root of sanctity seeing that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their offspring were part of G'd's heritage, we can understand that Jews do not react to insults heaped upon them by the Gentiles. We do not even view such people as in the category of אדם. It is this attitude vis-a vis the Gentiles that provides the background for Jews belittling Gentiles, even those Gentiles who have ceased worshiping idols. As a result the Torah saw fit to tell us why we must not remind strangers of their idolatrous past. We are not to tell such people that they are rooted in the domain of the קליפות, i.e. that their intrinsic worth is inferior to ours. When the Torah reminds the Jewish people: &quot;for you were strangers in the land of Egypt,&quot; this should be understood according to my comment on Genesis 46,3 and Exodus 20,2. I have demonstrated there that while the Jewish people resided in Egypt their own souls were mired deeply in the same moral morass that the souls of the Egyptians found themselves in.</p>

We are not told what fear Jacob had that led to this divine reassurance, but the text implies that Jacob already had a presentiment of the slavery and suffering his descendants would ultimately face as a result of this journey.

              <p>Fourth, Jacob was afraid lest Joseph would die during his life time and he would mourn for him. In response to this, God said, “Joseph’s hand will cover your eyes,” (Gen 46:4) he will be with you in the hour of your death. All of this is what he said to Jacob, the individual. But to the nation that would arise from Jacob he also offered reassurance, “Fear not to go down to Egypt, for I will make you there into a great nation.” (Gen. 46:3) That is, don’t be afraid or fearful of entering Egypt since this was a decree before me; it is inevitable that you must go there so I can make you a great nation. The expression, “A great nation” implies that they would become distinctive and recognizable as “Jews” and they would not mix with the descendants of Ham. This was so as long as Jacob’s descendants not change their language, maintained circumcision, and expressed fear of God. It was as if God said to them, “What do you have to fear since you cannot escape this fate in any way?” He also said regarding the nation, “I will go down with you to Egypt,” in order to tell them that even though Egypt was filled with idolatry and it would be hard to cling to their faith, even so the holy offspring would always have God’s providence, as was said, “Though they were exiled to Egypt, the divine presence was with them.” (Bemidbar Rabbah 7:10) He also said to the people, “And I will certainly go up with you.” This is a reference to the redemption from Egypt and the Exodus from there with signs and wonders…and he further said, “Joseph’s hand will cover your eyes.” This is also said about the nation, regarding our teacher Moses. He will continue (Playing on the name Joseph (Yoseif) and its similarity to Yoseef, he will add, he interprets the verse to mean he will add to them with their hand…)  to add to them honor and uprightness. With his teachings he will place his hands over their eyes and enlighten them. Thus we have explained from this vision what God said to Jacob, our forefather, and also to the house of Jacob, the people of Israel. I have now explained these verses completely and answered all the questions I have raised. We have learned from this that Jacob went down to Egypt, “compelled by the Divine Word,” because he didn’t completely agree to go down even after arriving in Beersheba until God made known to him what he had decreed. According to this, the expression, “compelled by the Divine Word,” follows the second approach which I mentioned above as the reasons for the Egyptian exile. There are some who interpret this expression as two separate parts: “Compelled” and “by the Divine Word.” First, they were compelled because of the sale of Joseph and the famine. Second, by the Divine Word, which gave them permission to go down to Egypt. But what I wrote first is the better interpretation and the intention of the Maggid, without a doubt. With this I have answered the questions in the forty-seventh and forty-eighth gates!</p>

        <summary>Chasidut explains that sacrificing oneself and recognizing God's presence in descent leads to spiritual elevation, as seen in Jacob's journey to Egypt. Various commentaries emphasize God's presence with Jacob in Egypt and the promise of returning to the Holy Land. Jewish thought discusses interpretations of corporeality in the Pentateuch and character traits of Jacob's sons. Kabbalah highlights the Shechinah's presence with the Jewish people in exile, while Midrash emphasizes God's protection and involvement with the Israelites. Musar reflects on the Shechinah's connection to Israel in exile, and the Second Temple commentary discusses God's continuous presence. The Talmud addresses seeking mercy from the Patriarchs and symbolism in dreams, while the Targum emphasizes God's promise to accompany the Israelites to Egypt and bring them back up again.</summary>

              <p>Genesis 46,4. “I will descend to Egyt with you, and I ‎will also ascend with you.” In order to understand this ‎verse properly, we must remember the pedagogic rule that when ‎a teacher is confronted with a student of limited intellect, he ‎must endeavour to rein in his superior intellect and descend to ‎the level of the student. When faced with a student who has a ‎brilliant mind, the teacher need not impose any restrictions on ‎himself when teaching such a student. As long as Yaakov resided ‎in the Holy Land, his intellect was very strong; he was afraid that ‎now that he would “descend” to Egypt, he would experience a ‎reduction in intellectual capacity so that G’d would “restrain” ‎Himself when communicating with him, so that he would not be ‎able to serve Him in the manner he was used to. G’d reassured ‎him here that he need not have any such concerns, as the ‎‎Shechinah would remain at his side as long as he would be in ‎Egypt. ‎G’d promises Yaakov that upon his return to the Holy Land, ‎he will have attained great spiritual stature. This is the meaning ‎of the words: ‎גם עלה‎. When the Shechinah which had ‎accompanied him “down” to Egypt, would return to the Holy ‎Land, [which had not contained any Jews during the ‎interval, so that these had not been deprived of its Presence, ‎Ed.], Yaakov would participate in this elevation, ‎עליה‎. </p>

It implied that Joseph would also be instrumental in his remains being transferred to the cave of Machpelah. A different interpretation of this verse: the words: על עיניך, are not to be understood literally, but are derived from the word עין being used as referring to someone’s or something’s, fountain, essence, as in עין יעקב, (Deuteronomy 33,28) where it refers to the personification of what Yaakov stood for. According to this interpretation, G-d assured Yaakov that in Joseph he will have a suitable successor. He will take care ably of all his needs.</p>

Proof for this interpretation is the fact that although 70 of his descendants have been mentioned as coming to Egypt, only sixty nine names have been listed, i.e. G–d Himself is considered as making up the seventieth. (Compare Deuteronomy 10,22) When the Israelites eventually would leave Egypt there was also one missing to make up the number 600000, this ‘one’ being G–d.” [This is why no precise number was quoted in Exodus 12,37 for the number of males that left Egypt, although on several counts in the desert, each time a precise number of the adult males is given. Ed.] Another interpretation: the words: אנכי אעלך גם עלה, are a correction by G–d for what Yaakov had thought of as a “descent” to Egypt. G–d tells him that far from being a “descent,” it will be seen as an ascent, by the time his descendants will leave Egypt.</p>

              <p>The other part of this message was that Jacob would not return to the land of Canaan alive. In fact this statement may be construed as G'd prohibiting Jacob from returning to Canaan as this would frustrate G'd's promise that Joseph would be present at his death.

              <p>Perhaps what G'd had in mind when He told Jacob that He would descend with him to Egypt was that whenever he or the Jewish people would experience problems, G'd would share their suffering (compare Psalms 91,15 &quot;I am with him in distress&quot;). אנכי ארד עמך מצרימה, the word מצרימה, may be derived from the word מצר, &quot;a narrow, confined area.&quot; G'd hinted that whenever Jacob (the Jewish people) would find themselves hemmed in, He would share their misery. G'd demonstrated this to Moses when He appeared to him out of the burning bush, certainly not a dwelling fit for G'd. G'd's message was that as long as the Jewish people are in distress in Egypt, He Himself would reside in such locations as the lowly thornbush. The שכינה never descended to the part of Egypt which was full of impurity. There are numerous instances (such as in Megillah 29) where the descent of the שכינה to Egypt is understood to mean that G'd shared the exile experience of the Jewish people with them. When Israel (Jacob) is described as prostrating himself at the head of the bed in Genesis 47,31, Tanchuma understands this as Jacob bowing down to the presence of the שכינה. [Evidently the presence of the שכינה was felt in Egypt then. Ed.] Moreover, Bereshit Rabbah 94,9 understands that the שכינה made up the number 70 in the list of descendants coming down to Egypt with Jacob, seeing that you will find only 69 names listed there. All of this proves that the שכינה did descend to Egypt (though not to areas infested with impurity).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>You have to realise that the manifestation of G'd's Presence (שכינה) occurs in a variety of forms and degrees. We are taught in Avot 3,6 that when ten people sit together and are preoccupied with Torah, the שכינה rests amongst them. The rabbis in the Mishnah there are at pains to prove from scriptural quotations that even a single individual studying Torah is accompanied by the שכינה. On the other hand, we find that the שכינה did not descend from heaven to take up residence amongst the Jewish people until the latter had established the Tabernacle (compare Exodus 40,35) and had made numerous preparations to qualify for hosting the שכינה. How is it possible that no such preparations appear to be required for an individual who studies Torah and qualifies for G'd's Presence as stated in Avot? Clearly, when one speaks of the presence of the שכינה one must distinguish between different levels of such a Divine Presence. The amount of enlightenment one experiences depends on the level of Divine Presence one is privileged to experience. If we were to describe such different levels of a Divine Presence, we could categorise the revelation at Mount Sinai as the highest level of such a Divine Presence. The next lower level may be the Divine Presence in the Holy of Holies in the Temple. A slightly lesser level of G'd's Presence may be experienced by the &quot;average&quot; prophet at the time he receives a message from G'd. Progressively lower levels of such a Divine Presence may be found in synagogues or houses of study. A group of ten people discussing matters related to Torah-study may qualify for an even lesser degree of such a Divine Presence, etc. When we keep this in mind we can better understand the statement of our sages that the Divine Presence, i.e. the enlightenment provided to a prophet never descended to certain levels. As a result, Moses had to leave the city in order to qualify for the degree of Divine Presence that could respond to his prayer. The degree of Divine Presence found amongst a group of people studying Torah is of a lower level, however, and it was that level of the שכינה which descended to Egypt with Jacob and remained there until the Exodus.</p>

              <p>While it may sound presumptuous to differentiate between different degrees of Divine light, this is true as long as we speak of G'd Himself. Light which radiates from G'd, however, is subject to different &quot;filters&quot; in order to ensure that the recipient receives the amount which is beneficial to him and does not harm him through over-exposure. The same principle applies even to different souls, all of which may be perceived as parts of G'd's &quot;light&quot; emanating from G'd's throne of glory.</p>

              <p>The considerations we have just mentioned may also explain why G'd referred to Himself twice as אנכי when telling Jacob that He would descend with him to Egypt and would go up with him again when Jacob would be buried. G'd meant that the level of שכינה that would accompany him on his return would be a higher level than that which accompanied him at the time he journeyed to Egypt. It was the latter level of אנכי which the Jewish people experienced at Mount Sinai, and it is that level of אנכי which is experienced at the end of the forty nine years of the Jubilee cycle. This is the mystical dimension of the fact that the Exodus from Egypt is mentioned in the Torah a total of forty nine times.</p>

G'd added the word גם, also, as an allusion that both the regular Jewish people will be redeemed as well as the lost souls which had been captive amongst all the impurity in that country and about which we have written earlier.

              </summary>
              <p>אנכי ארד עמך מצרימה, “I will go down to Egypt with you.” According to the plain meaning of the text this verse contains an assurance by G’d that He will be with Yaakov on this descent. This is why He said “I will go down,” instead of “I will make you go down.” If not for this lesson the latter form would have been more appropriate as G’d uses it when describing Yaakov’s return to the land of Canaan as a corpse which is described in the transitive form of אעלך instead of the intransitive form we have here.  ואנכי אעלך, “and I will bring you up.” G’d hinted to Yaakov that he would be buried in the land of Israel, “the highest” of the countries as it commands the gateway to heaven. G’d added the words גם עלה, “also raise up,” as Yaakov would experience also an “elevation” of a different dimension emanating from there, one to eternal life and the spiritual vistas in store for him there. This is the reason the term עליה appears twice in this verse. The verse contains the promise that his descendants would be redeemed in due course and that they would then reside in the land of Israel, the only country in which Torah precepts can be practiced to the full. The second עליה promised is that to the heavenly spheres, to eternal life of the soul, something for which every Israelite will qualify as part of his birthright (compare Sanhedrin 90). This is something which even Bileam, the accuser of Israel, already recognised when he wished himself a similar future as that of Israel, saying: “may my soul experience the death of the upright, and may my afterlife be like that of Israel” (Numbers 23,10). By saying this, Bileam hinted that pagans are not going to share in that afterlife. This is why he added immediately before this: “they are a nation that dwells in splendid isolation” (Numbers 23,9).  The reason G’d emphasised the word אנכי, when giving these assurances to Yaakov was that this was the word with which G’d introduced Himself at the revelation at Mount Sinai, when He gave us His Torah (Ten Commandments). He who abides by them would qualify for the promises made to Yaakov in this verse. A kabbalistic approach to our verse: The words: “I will go down with you,” are an allusion to the Presence of G’d, the שכינה, which would go down to Egypt with the Israelites. Our sages in Shabbat 89 and elsewhere say that G’d’s Presence descended with the Israelites. In order to hint at this, Onkelos translates the words as אנא אחות [a “physical” as opposed to a merely spiritual descent, in anthropomorphic terms, of course. Ed.], instead of as אנא אתגלי which is his usual translation for the word ירד, such as in Exodus 19,11 when applied to G’d. This is especially remarkable considering the care Onkelos takes not to apply anthropomorphic terms to G’d or His activities.  The reason the Torah writes מצרימה instead of למצרים, i.e. concluding with the letter ה, and also writing the word עלה in a form ending with the letter ה, is to provide tangible proof that G’d’s Presence, i.e. “ה,” will accompany the Israelites to Egypt. The letter ה, the last letter in the Ineffable Name, is the attribute which provided sustenance for Egypt during the years of famine.  Joseph already hinted at this attribute when he told the Egyptians in 47,23 הא לכם זרע, “here is seed for you.” In the following verse Joseph speaks of the חמישית, “fifth” or “hand” which G’d used to enact retribution from the Egyptians for abusing the Israelites during their exile there. This “hand” of G’d was in evidence when the livestock of the Egyptians was struck in Exodus 9,3, and it was the attribute the Israelites witnessed at the sea 14,31. It is also the attribute which Ezekiel mentioned when he described G’d’s anger during the destruction of Jerusalem and the Holy Temple (Ezekiel 16,43). We also find the words לא אחמול, “I shall not display pity,” five times in connection with that destruction (commencing in Ezekiel 5,11) after having described such scenes as parents eating the flesh of their children and children eating the flesh of their parents, to illustrate this lack of G’d’s pity for the state His people were in at that time.  We find that Daniel 2,43 refers to this attribute when he speaks about iron not blending with earthenware. Daniel mentions five different categories of materials which cannot form a blend, an alloy. This word הא occurs a total of three times in the Bible, once in the Torah, once in the Books of Prophets (Ezekiel 16,43), and once in the Hagiographa (Daniel 3,25). The message is that this attribute of G’d will accompany the Israelites through all the various exiles. The very word עמך, “with you,” which G’d uses to describe Himself as accompanying Yaakov to Egypt, is also associated with צרה, distress, sorrow, trouble, as we know from עמו אנכי בצרה, Psalms 91,15 “I am with him when it is in trouble.” In our verse the choice of that word then is a double-entendre. It means that even when the Israelites were exiled to Babylon the שכינה was with them also. Our sages base this on Isaiah 43,14: “for your sake I send (the redeemer) to Babylon.” We have a similar situation regarding the exile under the Edomites, (the present exile). Isaiah 63,1 describes the redeemer as coming from Edom, his clothing full of blood, etc., an allusion to G’d taking His vengeance on our oppressors. The word זה in that verse is a reference to G’d Himself being that redeemer. The word זה referred to our redeemer, i.e. G’d, already when the Israelites had crossed the sea and watched the Egyptians drown. At that time they broke out in a song of thanksgiving adulating G’d by saying זה א-לי ואנוהו “this is my G’d and I want to enshrine Him.” The word זה, of course, also ends with this letter ה, the attribute we have been discussing. Interestingly enough, even Joseph phrased his invitation to his father to come to him in Egypt in a word ending with the letter ה, when he said (45,9) רדה אלי אל תעמוד, “come down to me, do not delay.” He added the letter ה instead of saying רד אלי, which would have been quite sufficient. He meant to convey his confidence that the attribute of G’d represented by the letter ה would accompany his father and his family. Keeping all this in mind, the phenomenal increase of the Jewish people from 70 souls to over 600,000 arms-bearing men at the time of the Exodus (only 210 years later) becomes much less surprising. Clearly the Presence of G’d’s benevolent שכינה must be credited for this. (the author had referred to the addition of the latter ה in Avraham’s name in Genesis 17,5 as supplying the element which would enable his descendants to multiply prolifically). This element came into its own while the Jewish people were in Egypt and actually was also a prime factor in their eventual enslavement (compare Exodus 1,7-13). Once they had attained the required number of 600.000 men over 20 years of age they qualified for G’d revealing Himself to them openly at Mount Sinai. Having heard all this you will now understand the meaning of the scholar who claimed in a public lecture that a single Jewish woman in Egypt gave birth to 600,000 children (compare Shir Hashirim Rabbah 1,7). The word לידה, giving birth in an expanded sense, means to bring potential to fruition. The birth of Moses was equivalent to the coming into existence of 600,000 Israelites. The reason the scholar is described as making this mind-boggling pronouncement during a public lecture was because the audience had begun to doze off and the scholar wanted to rouse them from their sleep by making such an earth-shaking statement. The multitude was aroused by this statement though learned people knew that it was not to be taken at face value but summed up a certain concept. The scholar had sufficiently provoked his audience so that they asked who that woman was. He then told them that he referred to Yocheved who gave birth to Moses who was equivalent to 600,000 Israelites. The reason the scholar had used the term אשה, “a woman,” is the same as the reason which prompted Solomon in Proverbs 12,4 to say אשת חיל עטרת בעלה, וכרקב בעצמותיו מבישה, “a virtuous wife is the crown of her husband, but a wife who embarrasses him is like rot in his bones.” Solomon pointed out later in Proverbs 31,10 that finding such a virtuous woman was something very exceptional.</p>

    Some commentators understand the word אעלך as parallel to אל תעלני בחצי ימי, Psalms 102,25, where it means that David prays that he should not be allowed to die, -i.e. to ascend to the heavenly regions of after life- while he had lived only part of his allotted span on earth. [David wanted to experience the triumph of G’d on earth before leaving the earthly domain. Ed.] G’d told him that he would die while Joseph would survive him, and that is the meaning of “Joseph will place his hand on your eyes,” in our verse.
    Still another interpretation understands the word אעלך as referring to Yaakov’s soul whom G’d, personally, will accompany to the celestial regions, while his son Joseph, would perform the earthly rites connected with the passing of his father from life on earth.

              <p>“I Myself will go down with you” [46:4]. The Holy One said to Jacob, I will go with you to Egypt. That is to say, I will redeem you from exile, and promised him that he would be buried in the land of Israel. Therefore, the verse says twice, “will bring you back” [46:4]. That is, I will have you brought back to the land of Israel and all the twelve tribes will also be brought back to be buried in the land of Israel, and afterwards they will also be brought to the world to come. Therefore, he says I. That is to say, the Ten Commandments that begin with I. The tribes will accept them, and through that, they will ascend to the land of Israel, the world to come and the Garden of Eden. Just as the Holy One was in Egypt with Israel, so too he was in the Babylonian exile, and so is the Holy One with Israel in the exile of Edom, which is our exile that we are in the midst of. Because the Holy One was with Israel in Egypt, seventy souls became six hundred thousand men in the exile of Egypt. Bahya writes. A rabbi was once speaking in the house of study. He saw that the people were not interested in listening to his sermon and several were sleeping. He wanted to wake them, so he began to tell a tall tale in the hope that they would wake up. He said that there was a woman in Egypt who carried in her womb six hundred thousand children at one time. The people woke up as a result of this tall tale. They asked the rabbi, who was the woman who had so many children? The rabbi said: she was called Yocheved and she gave birth to Moses Our Teacher, who with his good deeds was compared to six hundred thousand men; that is to say, in comparison to all of Israel.

                <h4>Akeidat Yitzchak 33:1:9</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>(1) When calling in his sons concerning the events in the distant future, Jacob had in mind what happens to the souls after death. The second call concerned happenings during Messianic times, on this earth. Concerning Reuben, the statement yeter se-eyt refers to additional responsibilities which Reuben should have shouldered being a firstborn, instead of assuming an additional portion of negative virtues. Since the nature of his error was such that it could not be undone, like water which, if it has once hit the ground, cannot be retrieved, Reuben's sin of entering his father's bedroom constituted an irreversible desecration. This deprived him of the birthright, which was transferred to Joseph. Possibly, the hastiness and lack of mature judgment criticized here in Reuben's character may account for the equally hasty decision of the tribe of Reuben later in claiming their part of the ancestral inheritance in the territory formerly belonging to Sichon. It was the tribe of Reuben who was the first to experience exile and dispersion in later years. (2) Shimon and Levi are bracketed together because of the similarity of their actions. Their error was the opposite of that of Reuben. Reuben had acted hastily, without mature judgment. Shimon and Levi's action against Shechem was reprehensible precisely because it was preceded by careful planning. Aristo in Ethics 7, Section 9, already discusses the relative merit of impetuosity versus the person who is in perfect control of his actions who, though carrying out carefully planned deeds, has given no thought to the possibility that he may be wrong. At Shechem, Shimon and Levi sinned because they had planned. When it came to the violence done to Joseph, they could not even claim that their action had been thoroughly thought out. Concerning the first action, Jacob condemns an anger of the aph variety, something that would not evaporate until they had taken collective revenge. In the case of their treatment of Joseph, their action was the result of ratzon, free will, impetuous behavior. When both of these characteristics are found side by side, they spell too much danger for society. Jacob did not want to be associated with this. Therefore, the two have to be separated to reduce their potential for causing harm. Although anger is a negative virtue, it can on occasion be most helpful, since it awakens people to their duty who would otherwise have remained inactive, on the sidelines. Having Levi scattered throughout Israel would ensure that when the occasion would demand it, there would be people that would galvanize the rest of the population into taking action. When Isaiah (63,5) says, &quot;My arm brought me salvation, and my fury upheld me,&quot; he refers to exactly such instances of the usefulness of fury. Similarly, the Talmud in Ketuvot 103 reports how Rabbi Yehudah taught his son Rabbi Gamliel how to conduct himself in the office of the President. He told him, &quot;Conduct your office among the exalted and strike fear into the students.&quot; (3) Yehudah is the first of the sons whose heroic deeds did not manifest themselves in turning against his own flesh and blood when angered; rather, &quot;Your hand was against the neck of your enemy.&quot; Therefore, it is fitting that his brothers pay homage to him. &quot;A young lion;&quot; subsequently he is described as a fully grown lion (both in verse 9). This suggests that Yehudah's personality development proceeded according to accepted norms. He develops from strength to strength, unlike other crowned heads, many of whom experience their greatest moment of glory at the moment they are crowned and ascend the throne. Miteref beni aleeta, you overcame, surmounted the confused thinking of my other sons. Even though you were young in years, you showed mature judgment at the moment it was called for (&quot;What profit is there in killing our brother&quot; 37,26). Jacob proceeds to assure Yehudah that royalty will be hereditary in his descendants throughout the ages. However, just as the lion may crouch ready to pounce, but lacks the power, so the royal descendants of Yehudah will similarly be found lacking in strength on occasion. Such weakness will reflect Yehudah's lack of religious observance during such periods. The Talmud (in Sanhedrin 5) tells us that the term &quot;king&quot; is not used here for Yehudah to convey the idea that in the long years of exile when there will be no Jewish king, leadership functions will still devolve upon the descendants of Yehudah; &quot;The sceptre will not depart,&quot; &quot;the lawgiver,&quot; refer to such men as the Exilarch, i.e. the leader of the Jews in the Babylonian exile who were members of the tribe of Yehudah, often in a direct line from David. Once the era of Shilo commences, the condition of Yehudah being merely kore-a, crouching, will be over, and the whole world will pay homage to him. The reference then is to Yehudah's restricted leadership role in the interval, not the cessation of such status. The reason that Zevulun in this blessing is mentioned ahead of Issachar is that since the former provides the funding for the latter's sacred vocation, that of devoting himself to Torah, the former is the prime mover, and deserves to be recognized first. Issachar who is like a beast of burden weighed down under its load, represents the qualities without which Torah study devoid of ulterior motives cannot be undertaken successfully. A donkey accepts ever greater burdens without protest, is undemanding in manner, and modest in upkeep. (4) The reason that both sons of Zilpah are mentioned in between the sons of Bilhah, is to prove that Zilpah really was supposed to have become pregnant before Bilhah. Only Laban's trickery had prevented this at the time he tricked Jacob into marrying the wrong girl. (5) Issachar realized the kind of menuchah, rest, that is &quot;good.&quot; The reference is to the serenity attainable only through the diligent study of Torah, which ensures that one will reap the ultimate &quot;good&quot; at the end of one's endeavours. (6) After having mentioned the sons of Leah in the order of their birth, Jacob addresses himself to the oldest son of the maids. Samson, descendant of Dan would achieve the position of leader amongst his people, and become the first one to begin and shake off the yoke of the Philistines. Samson's activities were not accompanied by the glory and pomp of a royal Court, but like a snake, a loner, were simply acts of revenge perpetrated as acts of terror from ambush. This is just like the action of a snake which always seems unconcerned about its own fate. Samson died at the site of his greatest triumph, just as a snake presumably gets killed when the horse and rider it has bitten fatally kills the snake near the site of their own death. Since a victory in which the pursuer dies himself is hardly a true victory, the victor not surviving to enjoy the fruits of his deed, Jacob adds the words, &quot;In Your help I trust,&quot; expressing the hope that the defender of his people will be spared by Divine intervention. &quot;Gad will form units of troops,&quot; even though Gad will be the first of the tribes to be led into captivity (Kings II 10,33), he will eventually re-emerge at the time of redemption. Asher is blessed by being promised material blessings that are rarely found side by side, namely both grain and fruit. Perhaps during the reign of Solomon, he was called upon to supply the royal palace. &quot;He will supply the delicacies for the king.&quot; The comparison of Naftali to &quot;a hind let loose,&quot; i.e. fleet-footedness, may hint at the climatic conditions in his territory giving rise to earlier harvests than elsewhere in Israel. Possibly, Naftali had silver-tongued men, bearers of good tidings who would lead Israel in thanksgiving to the Lord. (7) Because Joseph was like a beautiful fruit, flourishing by a fountain, attracting admiration from all sides, he also attracted jealousy and envy. As a result, he was quarrelled with and persecuted. He himself, however, kept his ammunition in check instead of fighting back. Thus, he proved himself stronger than his adversaries. His hands were strengthened by the same G-d who had proven His might when aiding Jacob. Therefore, he possessed the merit to become the provider (ro-eh) for his family, his clan. &quot;May you receive your reward from the G-d of your father, may it be stored with the G-d Shadday, and may you receive the bountiful blessings from the heavens above and the depths that lie below, which are typified by the blessings of the breasts and the womb. The blessings of your father (Jacob) are greater than those of my parents (Isaac) in that I may select one of my sons for a special blessing, though all of them deserve blessings.” Each one of the sons of Jacob had a morally justifiable claim to givaut olam, high positions in the world; Joseph, however, had proven outstanding. Therefore, &quot;on his skull more than on that of his brothers,&quot; the special blessing. Since the tribe of Levi had not yet been given its special designation replacing the firstborn, and the number of tribes was not to exceed twelve, the blessings for Menashe and Ephrayim are here incorporated in the blessings pronounced on their father Joseph. At the time when Moses blessed the nation, singling out Levi for its share of recognition, Ephrayim and Menashe are once again not mentioned separately, to avoid exceeding the number twelve. Moses therefore only alludes to them by stating that bechor shoro, the firstborn, his ox, are the tens of thousands of Ephrayim and the thousands of Menashe. The importance of Benjamin is alluded to by the fact that he rates the opening of a new paragraph (the paragraph could easily have ended at verse twenty-nine). Just as the word &quot;Yehudah&quot; is usually found at the beginning of a &quot;page,&quot; so both of the brothers in whose territory the holy temple was to stand later, share the distinctive treatment in the manner in which their blessings are recorded in the Torah. Since the Priests and Levites will constantly be found in Jerusalem, it is reasonable to expect the members of those tribes to pursue the wisdom obtainable by keeping company with the priests, like wolves that rob in the morning and share the booty at night. Benjaminites will share in the knowledge obtained through close association with the tribe of Levi, and will teach others. Since in this manner they will both learn and teach, they are privy to the essence of all blessings. After all, success in any endeavor is based on study and dissemination of knowledge. The verse &quot;the tribes of Israel are twelve,&quot; means that &quot;although Joseph was divided into two tribes, the total still does not exceed twelve tribes, rather Levi is to be regarded as in a class by himself.&quot; This is what is meant by the words (verse 28), &quot;Which their father said to them&quot; (perhaps for this reason the scattering of Levi's cities was of quite a different nature than the dispersal of Shimon who had contiguous tribal territory, though it was an enclave within Yehudah). Since seventeen years had elapsed since Jacob and his family had left Canaan, Jacob was concerned lest any claim against the burial place of Abraham should have been registered during the family's absence from the country. Therefore, Jacob repeated all the details of his justified claim to the lands in question. Should any claim originate with the Canaanites, the fact that Ephron had sold to Abraham was essential; should the descendants of Ishmael claim the cave as theirs, the fact that Isaac had been buried there would prove that they had no valid claim thereto. To forestall any claim of Esau to be buried there, the fact that Leah had already been buried there, would attest to its ownership by the family of Jacob. Should the argument be used that the sale by an individual such as Ephron was invalid, since he was merely an individual and it was not in the national interest to sell off land to outsiders, the fact that the beney chet, a national group had approved the sale to Abraham, would invalidate any such claim in the future. (4) We have explained when Abraham died, that geviyah is the failure of one's faculties to function (clinical death), whereas meetah is the destruction and decay of the body's whole structure. Assiphah refers to the return of the soul to its hidden origin. Meetah is not mentioned in connection with Jacob. The reason our Rabbis may not have quoted this passage when they made the statement that &quot;Jacob did not die,&quot; is so as not to allow the misconception that the elaborate measures taken to embalm Jacob's body were what is meant by the absence of the term meetah. The impression could easily have been formed that preventing decay of the body is equivalent to preventing meetah, i.e. death. Joseph appears to have had his own royal embalmers, and instead of the standard thirty-day procedure, Jacob was given the royal treatment, i.e. seventy days. This made the removal of the intestines and brain unnecessary (possibly). It appears that during the mourning Joseph observed for his father for seventy days, he did not permit himself to communicate with anyone at the royal court, and spoke to Pharaoh only through intermediaries (50,4). (5) It seems that as soon as Jacob had passed on, his sons were ready to return to the land of Canaan with their families and livestock, but were prevented by the Egyptians who were already planning to eventually enslave Jacob's entire offspring (Midrash Rabbah Tzav). We are told therefore, that the reason the Parshah dealing with Jacob's &quot;death&quot; is closed, i.e. is not separated from the preceding Parshah by a paragraph or line, is to indicate that true independence was lost as soon as Jacob closed his eyes for the last time. The Jews already felt that their freedom of movement had become subject to restrictions, and that is why even a Joseph on his deathbed had to invoke the time when G-d would lead the Jews out of Egypt as the time when his own remains should be transferred to the holy land (50,24). (6) The words va-ya-al immo in 50,9 may refer to the Shechinah leaving Egypt, having accompanied Jacob on his journey to Egypt seventeen years earlier (compare &quot;I will go up with you,&quot; 46,4). The Canaanites saw a bad omen in all of this; they emphasized to their deities that this was an Egyptian affair, no business of theirs, and that any harmful fallout should befall Egypt. From then on, the brothers carried Jacob on their shoulders, just as their father had instructed. (7) The brothers had convinced themselves by and by that Joseph's rise to greatness was due entirely to their own action against him, and that because of that he owed them good treatment (as compensation). Their reasoning ran thus: &quot;If only Joseph would hate us and pay us back for the kind of harm (may it happen so to all Jewish children) we have done him.&quot; They hoped to receive good in return for evil as a matter of right, not as a gesture of generosity. (8) When speaking in the name of Jacob then, they referred to their treatment of Joseph as evil (50,17), but they referred to themselves as &quot;servants of the G-d of your father,&quot; who had acted presumably in consonance with G-d’s will, hence such eminently successful outcome of their actions. (9) Joseph realized that all this convoluted reasoning was the result of his brothers' fear, and he wept at their fear and discomfort. However, Joseph, answering his brothers along the line of their own argument, said, &quot;I am not in place of G-d, so you need no forgiveness from me since your intention was indeed wicked. However, it was G-d who arranged for the outcome to be good not just for me alone but for everyone concerned. Despite your moral guilt however, do not worry, I will look after your needs.” (10) Joseph's raising Ephrayim's grandchildren on his knees is reported to show that Jacob's blessing concerning such grandchildren had been fulfilled. Since Joseph died at a younger age than his brothers, his reassuring remarks on his deathbed concerning the Providence of the Lord are of prime importance. Since his embalming was different from the method employed for his father, his physical death is mentioned. Since his remains were going to be interred in Egypt immediately, the treatment described would be quite adequate. </p>

Thus he paraphrases “the Lord will come down” (Exod. 19:11), “The Lord will manifest Himself”; “And God came down” (xvi. 20), “And God manifested Himself”; and does not say “And God came down”; “I will go down now and see” (Gen. 18:21), he paraphrases, “I will manifest myself now and see.”</p>

            <summary>The Jewish people are beloved by God and the Shechinah accompanies them in exile, as seen in references to Egypt, Babylon, and Elam. In every place Israel is exiled, the Shekhinah is with them, as established by the sages. The Zohar explains that mental images formed in the mind can either corrupt or refine the soul, emphasizing the importance of envisioning holy images to perfect the intellect and avoid negative influences. It is forbidden to gaze at idolatry or evil images as they can corrupt the intellect.</summary>

              <p>The matter will be understood from what was explained in the Zohar regarding the verse &quot;And Joseph shall place his hand upon your eyes&quot; in Parshat Vayelech (Genesis 46:4). The eyes are the gateway to the mental images resembling intellect. Firstly, one envisions that thing in their mind and intellect. And behold, that image is formed there. If the image is of inferior things, then the intellect should approach and lower it from its exalted state. This is the prohibition of gazing at women and forbidden sexual matters, because even if one does not consciously intend to commit a sin, eventually he will form that image in his mind and contemplate that which is improper, even if he does not engage in any negative action. The reason is that the image formed in one's mind will either corrupt the soul or refine it if it is a good image. It will lead to several good aspects in the context of spiritual work. Therefore, when a person envisions a holy image in his mind, that holy image, when contemplated, will perfect his intellect. This is the meaning of Rabbi Aba in Parshat Mishpatim, where the form of Rabbi Shimon appeared before him, and he achieved great insights as a result. This is the meaning of &quot;And your eyes shall behold your teacher,&quot; and this is the reason why it is said, &quot;Do not turn to idols,&quot; because it is forbidden to gaze at idolatry, for that degrading image corrupts the intellect. This is the reason it is said, &quot;Do not gaze at the face of an evil person.&quot; (Megillah 28A) </p>

              <p>[2] Another interpretation: &quot;And it came to pass at that time that Judah went down.&quot; (Hosea 12:1) This is referring to the tribe of Judah. &quot;Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood.&quot; (Ibid.) This is in reference to what is written, &quot;They have denied the Lord and said, 'He is not!'&quot; (Jeremiah 5:12) &quot;And with deceit, the House of Israel.&quot; (Hosea 12:1) The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &quot;Even with their deceit, they call upon Me,&quot; as it is written, &quot;Your dwelling is in the midst of deceit.&quot; (Jeremiah 9:4) Therefore, they are subject to descent. &quot;Judah still goes down with them to battle against the enemy.&quot; (Hosea 12:2) Come and see how I cherish you, that even when you sin and are subject to descent, I am with you, as it is written, &quot;Judah still goes down with them.&quot; This is like what I said to Jacob, &quot;I will go down with you to Egypt and I will also surely bring you up.&quot; (Genesis 46:4) Similarly, in Babylon, I sent you into exile for your benefit, as it is written, &quot;And when they ascend, so do I.&quot; (Isaiah 43:14) As it is written regarding Samuel, &quot;And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him.&quot; (I Samuel 3:19) Similarly, regarding Solomon, &quot;And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly on high.&quot; (I Chronicles 29:25) And regarding David, &quot;David went and became great, and the Lord of Hosts was with him.&quot; (II Samuel 5:10) When you are in a state of descent, I am with you, as it is written, &quot;Judah still goes down with them.&quot; In every place where these two tribes meet, they hate each other, and they are antagonistic to each other. Judah and Joseph are different from each other in this regard. And the children of Israel asked, &quot;Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?&quot; (Judges 1:1) And the Lord said, &quot;Judah shall go up.&quot; (Judges 1:2) And what is written? &quot;And the House of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.&quot; (Judges 1:22) And it is written, Ephraim became a trained heifer, But preferred to thresh; [i  *Lit. “passed over the comeliness of its neck.”placed a yoke Upon her sleek neck.-i] I will make Ephraim  [*Taking rkb in the sense of the Arabic krb.do advance plowing;-j] Judah [*Emendation yields “Israel.”] shall do [main] plowing! Jacob shall do final plowing!(Hosea 10:11) You say that just as the Anointed One who will arise from Joseph and the Anointed One who will arise from Judah are not jealous of each other, as it is written: &quot;Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not harass Ephraim&quot; (Isaiah 11:13), so too will the antagonism between the sects come to an end in the future when they are united. However, in this world, since they are not connected to each other, they envy each other. As long as they are in this state of descent, they remain lowly. But in the future, when they are connected to each other, they will rise up, as it is written: &quot;The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together&quot; (Hosea 2:2), and at that time they will ascend from the earth (Hosea 2:2). God said, &quot;Now that you are united, you have risen up, and I am also elevated with you,&quot; as David said: &quot;The princes of the peoples gather together, even the people of the God of Abraham&quot; (Psalm 47:10), for which reason it is said, &quot;Judah will yet go up to God.&quot; When the nations rise up, Israel descends, and when Israel rises up, the nations descend. In the days of Rehoboam, when they sinned, they descended and the nations ascended, as it is written: &quot;Now it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem&quot; (1 Kings 14:25). In the days of Hosea, when they sinned, they descended and the nations ascended, as it is written: &quot;In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant&quot; (2 Kings 24:1). In the days of Jehoiakim and Zedekiah, when they sinned, they descended and the nations ascended, as it is written: &quot;Now it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it&quot; (2 Kings 25:1). However, in the future, the opposite will happen. As it is written, &quot;Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down&quot; (Ezekiel 32:18), and &quot;I will bring you down with those who descend into the Pit&quot; (Ezekiel 26:20), and Israel will ascend, as it is written, &quot;The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together&quot; (Hosea 2:2), and the Holy One, blessed be He, will be with them, as it is written, &quot;God is greatly exalted over all gods&quot; (Psalm 97:9).</p>

I will go up now and bury my father, and I will return” (Genesis 50:5).  “My father administered an oath to me, saying…that I dug for myself” – when Jacob stood with Esau, (When they divided Isaac’s estate.)  he said to him: ‘What do you want, money or a burial plot?’ He said to him: ‘What would this man do with a burial plot? Give me money and take the burial plot for yourself, but you must heap up much money in exchange for it.’ That is what is written: “In my grave that I acquired [lakaḥti] for myself” is not written here, but rather, “that I dug [kariti]” – I heaped up [hikarti] [money] in exchange for it.  “Pharaoh said: Go up and bury your father, in accordance with the oath he administered to you” (Genesis 50:6).  “Joseph went up to bury his father, and all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, went up with him” (Genesis 50:7).  “And all of Joseph’s household, and his brothers, and his father’s household. They left only their children, their flocks, and their cattle in the land of Goshen” (Genesis 50:8).  “He took up with him both chariots and horsemen, and the camp was very substantial” (Genesis 50:9).  “Pharaoh said: Go up…Joseph went up…” – until this point it was for lament, from this point on it was for battle (He was prepared for potential battle with Esau. )  –“he took up with him both [gam] chariots and [gam] (The term gam comes to include something that is not explicitly written in the verse.)  horsemen…” Rabbi Yitzḥak said: The great One of the world was there, and some say: The glory of the One who lives forever.

Alternatively, it means that Joseph would close Jacob’s eyes after his death, in which case God is stating that He will bring Jacob back to the Land of Israel eventually, but not in his lifetime (Yefeh To’ar). )  “Jacob arose from Beersheba and the sons of Israel conveyed Jacob their father, and their children, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh sent to convey him” (Genesis 46:5).   “They took their livestock, and their property that they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and they came to Egypt: Jacob, and all his descendants with him” (Genesis 46:6).   “His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his descendants, he brought with him to Egypt” (Genesis 46:7).  “Jacob arose….

              <p>Rabbi Berekhya said: Performing acts of kindness is in the Torah at its beginning, in its middle, and at its end. It is at its beginning, as it is written: “The Lord God built the rib [that he took from the man, into a woman, and He brought her to the man]” (Genesis 2:22). [This verse] teaches that the Holy One Blessed be He braided Eve’s hair, and brought her to Adam, and he became the groomsman for them; as in the coastal towns, they call braiding, building. It is in its middle, as it is written: “The Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre” (Genesis 18:1), teaching that He visited him. (God visited Abraham, who was recovering from his circumcision.)  “God blessed Isaac his son” (Genesis 25:11), this is the blessing of the mourners. (He came to console Isaac upon the death of Abraham.)  At its end, as it is stated: “He buried him in the valley” (Deuteronomy 34:6). (God buried Moses.)  Rabbi Ḥanin said: What is the measure of recompense [for acts of kindness]? Jacob died in the land of Egypt. For whom was it fitting to tend to him? Is it not the Holy One blessed be He, who said to him: “I will descend with you to Egypt [and I will also take you up]” (Genesis 46:4)? Joseph came and snatched the mitzva for himself, as it is written: “Joseph ascended to bury his father” (Genesis 50:7). Joseph died in Egypt. For whom was it fitting to tend to him? Is it not the tribes, to whom he administered an oath, as it is stated: “Joseph administered an oath [to the sons of Israel, saying: God will surely remember you, and you shall carry up my bones from here]” (Genesis 50:25). Moses came and snatched the mitzva for himself, as it is stated: “Moses took Joseph’s bones” (Exodus 13:19).

              </summary>
              <p>And Moses was tending... in the midst of a flame of fire from within the thorn bush. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai asks: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself from the heavens and speak to Moses from within the thorn bush? What is so special about this thorn bush, which is more formidable than all the trees in the world, such that any bird that enters it does not emerge from it in peace, but rather is cut to pieces? Similarly, the servitude in Egypt was harsher before God than any other servitude in the world. No slave or maidservant ever went free from Egypt, except for Hagar, as it is said (Genesis 12:20): &quot;And Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they sent him away, him and his wife and all that he had.&quot;  Another interpretation of &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: Rabbi Joshua says: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself from the heavens and speak to Moses from within the thorn bush? Whenever Israel is in distress, it is as if He Himself is in distress, as it is said (Isaiah 63:9): &quot;In all their affliction, He was afflicted.&quot; And it says (Psalms 91:15): &quot;I am with him in distress.&quot; And it says (Zechariah 2:12): &quot;For whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye.&quot; The scripture likens this to anyone who harms Israel is, so to speak, harming the One who spoke and brought the world into being. Thus, Rabbi Joshua says: Come and see the extent of God's compassion and merits for Israel. When they descended to Egypt, the Divine Presence went with them, as it is said (Genesis 46:4): &quot;I will go down with you to Egypt.&quot; When they ascended, the Divine Presence ascended with them, as it is said (ibid): &quot;And I will also surely bring you up again.&quot; When they went down to the sea, the Divine Presence was with them, as it is said (Exodus 14:19): &quot;And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved.&quot; When they came to the desert, the Divine Presence was with them, as it is said (Deuteronomy 1:31): &quot;In the wilderness, where you saw how the Lord your God carried you.&quot; When they were in distress, as it were, He was with them in distress, as it is said &quot;from within the thorn bush.&quot; When they were at ease, He was with them in comfort, as it is said (Psalms 106:5): &quot;That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that I may glory with Your inheritance.&quot;  Another interpretation of &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: Rabbi Yosi says: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself from the heavens and speak to Moses from within the thorn bush? Because it is pure, and the nations of the world do not make it into an idol.  Another interpretation of &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: A certain non-Jew asked Rabban Gamaliel: &quot;Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself to Moses from within the thorn bush?&quot; He replied: &quot;Had He revealed Himself upon a single carob or fig tree, you would have said that there is a place on earth devoid of the Divine Presence. Now that He revealed Himself upon a thorn bush, it teaches you that there is no place on earth devoid of the Divine Presence.&quot;  Another interpretation of &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: Rabbi Yosi says: Why &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;? Just as with a thorn bush, if a person inserts his hand into it, he is not harmed because its thorns point downward. But if he wishes to withdraw his hand, the thorns grasp it. Similarly, when the Israelites descended to Egypt, the Egyptians welcomed them, as it is said (Genesis 47:6): &quot;The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell.&quot; But when they wished to leave, the Egyptians held them back, as it is said (Exodus 5:2): &quot;I will not let Israel go.&quot;  Rabbi Eliezer says: Moses saw a great miracle from within the thorn bush: he saw the bush burning yet not consumed by the fire. If you are astonished by this, consider Aaron's staff, which was dry wood, yet it produced almonds and blossoms.  Another interpretation of why &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: Rabbi Elazar ben Arach says: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself from the heavens and speak to Moses from within the thorn bush? Although God could have spoken from the tops of mountains or the heights of the world or the cedars of Lebanon, He humbled Himself and spoke from a lowly thorn bush. Regarding this, Solomon said (Proverbs 29:23): &quot;A man's pride shall bring him low, but he who is of a humble spirit shall obtain honor.&quot; You will not find any tree more humble than the thorn bush. And it also says (Psalms 138:6): &quot;For though the Lord is high, He regards the lowly.&quot;</p>

Rabbi Yirmiyah said in the name of Rabbi Elazar, &quot;This world is not worthy to praise the Lord in His entirety, but only in part, as it is said, 'Let every soul praise the Lord' (Psalm 150:6). Therefore, it says 'Hallelujah.' From here we learn that Hallel must have at least three verses, as it says, 'Hallelujah, praise God' (Psalm 146:1), which has two verses, and 'Hallelujah, praise God in His sanctuary' (Psalm 150:1), which has three verses. And one who says only one verse, it is as if he did not say Hallel at all. And similarly, it says, 'For I will proclaim the name of the Lord; ascribe greatness to our God' (Deuteronomy 32:3), which has one verse, and 'Sing to the Lord a new song' (Psalm 96:1), which has three verses. Therefore, it says 'Hallelujah.' Where do we learn that there were Hallel songs when Israel descended to Egypt, and there were 71 with the Divine Presence among them, as it says, &quot;I will go down with thee into Egypt&quot; (Genesis 46:4)? And it is written, &quot;Thy fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons&quot; (Deuteronomy 10:22). And when the Holy One, blessed be He, ascended with them, it says, &quot;I will also surely bring thee up again&quot; (Genesis 46:4). Therefore, it says 'Hallelujah' for the number of 'Hallelujah.'</p>

              <p>“You shall bring them and plant them” Our Sages said: Praised be the name of the Holy One, who in the greatness of His love for Israel called them ‘My firstborn son Israel.’ (Shemot 4:22) Come and see how great is the loving generosity of the Holy One! A slave dresses his master, but the Holy One dresses Israel, as it says “And I clothed you with embroidered garments…” (Yechezkel 16:10) A slave washes his master, but the Holy One washes Israel, as it says “And I washed you with water…” (Yechezkel 16:9) A slave places the shoes on his master, but the Holy One shoed Israel, as it says “…and I shod you with the skin of the badger…” (Yechezkel 16:10) And beyond all this, when they were exiled to Egypt the Divine Presence was with them, as it says “I will go down with you to Egypt…” (Bereshit 46:4) When they were exiled to Elam the Divine Presence was with them, as it says “And I will place My throne in Elam…” (Yirmiyahu 49:38) They were exiled to Bavel and the Divine Presence went with them, as it says “Because of you, I sent to Babylon…” (Yeshayahu 43:14) In the future the Holy One will return Israel to His holy mountain, as it says “I will bring them to My holy mount…” (Yeshayahu 56:7) and it is written after this “And I will plant them on their land…” (Amos 9:15) Since Moshe saw the love of the Holy One for Israel he said before Him ‘Master of the World! Bring them and plant them there and let that planting be complete, which will never be uprooted. Bring down Jerusalem from the heavens and let it never be destroyed. Gather together there the exiled of Israel and let them settle upon the land in security. This is why it says “You shall bring them and plant them on the mount of Your heritage, directed toward Your habitation, which You made, O Lord; the sanctuary, O Lord, [which] Your hands founded.” (Shemot 15:17)</p>

That is what Scripture states: “Send Your light [orekha] and Your truth [amitekha]; they will lead me” (Psalms 43:3) – that is Moses and Aaron, as it is stated: “To Levi He said: Your Tumim [tumekha] and Your Urim [ve’urekha]” (Deuteronomy 33:8), (The Urim and the Tumim, which were oracular talismans that were part of the vestments of the High Priest, can be literally translated as ‘lights and virtues,’ which is close to the light and truth of the verse in Psalms.)  and it is written: “The Torah of truth was in his mouth” (Malachi 2:6).  “I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam before you” (Micah 6:4) – this teaches that he [Moses] was not seeking to redeem Israel; rather, Moses said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘“Who am I [that I should go]?” (Exodus 3:11). Is this what You promised to their ancestors, that You would take out their descendants by means of flesh and blood? “Who am I that I should go?” “And that I should take the children of Israel out” (Exodus 3:11) – is it about me that it is written: “I will judge” (Genesis 15:14), that You are sending me to deliver them? Did You not promise Abraham and say to him: “And also that nation whom they will serve, I will judge” (Genesis 15:14)? Did You not say to Jacob: “I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will surely take you up” (Genesis 46:4), and You say to me [to do it]? “Who am I?”’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘By your life, I will go down and deliver them. One woman went down to Egypt, and for her sake, I went down and rescued her. When? It was when Pharaoh abducted Sarah, as it is stated: “The Lord afflicted Pharaoh” (Genesis 12:17).

              <p>Another interpretation: “The Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying” (Exodus 12:1) – what is the Holy One blessed be He doing in Egypt? It is for the sake of Israel. Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa said: This is analogous to a noblewoman who provoked the king. The king put her in prison and went with her and was with her in prison. People said to him: ‘Why do you care?’ He said to them: ‘All the time that I am with her, she will not acquire a bad name.’ So, Israel was enslaved in Egypt, and the Holy One blessed be He, as it were, was exiled with them, as it is stated: “I will go down with you to Egypt” (Genesis 46:4). Similarly with [the exile to] Babylonia, it is stated: “For your sakes, I sent [shilaḥti] (The Masoretic text has shilaḥti but the midrash reads it shulaḥti, I was sent. )  to Babylon” (Isaiah 43:14). Likewise, with [the hegemony of] Media, as it is stated: “I will place My throne in Elam” (Jeremiah 49:38), and Elam is nothing other than Media, as it is stated: “Go up, Elam; besiege, Media” (Isaiah 21:2). With the [hegemony of] Greece, the Holy One blessed be He was with them, as it is stated: “[I will rouse your children, Zion, against your children, Greece, and will set you like the sword of a mighty man.] The Lord will be seen over them, and His arrow will emerge like lightning” (Zechariah 9:13–14).  They [the angels] said to the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Why all this?’ He said to them: ‘All the time that I am with them, they will not acquire a bad name. I was with them in Egypt, and they were found whole, as it is stated: “A locked garden, my sister, my bride” (Song of Songs 4:12). (They were not corrupted by the surrounding licentiousness.)  I was with them in Babylon, and they were found whole, as it is stated: “Behold our God whom we serve [is able to deliver us]” (Daniel 3:17). I was with them in Media and they were found whole, as it is stated: “Mordecai would not bow and would not prostrate himself” (Esther 3:2). In Greece, they refused to write on the horn of an ox that they have no portion in the God of Israel. (The midrash is relating to a tradition that the Greek-speaking rulers decreed that they must do so. See Bereshit Rabba 2:4. )  With regard to Edom [Rome], if the Holy One blessed be He says yes, who will say no, as it is stated: “Who is this, coming from Edom” (Isaiah 63:1).’ (This is the beginning of a prophecy about the destruction of Edom.)  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: This is analogous to a wealthy man who went out during the summer. People said that he was at the threshing floor. What did he do? He came in with a branch of a grapevine, so that everyone would know that he had come from the vineyard. So, the idolaters said to Israel: Where is your God? As it is stated: “Where is their God” (Deuteronomy 32:37). “Now, hear this, pampered one, who sits securely…” (Isaiah 47:8) (This verse refers to the idolaters.)  – what is the Holy One blessed be He destined to do to them? “I will make My arrows drunk with blood” (Deuteronomy 32:42). Not only that, but He is destined to trample them, as it is stated: “I have trodden a winepress alone” (Isaiah 63:3), and He us destined to tread with His shoe on all the great ones of Edom, as it is stated: “I cast My shoe upon Edom” (Psalms 60:10).</p>

              <p>Another matter: “This is the matter [hadavar]” – that is what is written: “Forever, Lord, Your word [devarkha] stands in the heavens” (Psalms 119:89). Does the word of the Lord not stand on the earth, but only in the heavens? Rabbi Ḥizkiya bar Ḥiyya said: Because the Holy One blessed be He promised something in the heavens, and after two hundred and ten years the promise that the Holy One blessed be He promised to the righteous one was fulfilled. How so? When the Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham: “Go from your land.… I will render you a great nation” (Genesis 12:1–2), he said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, what benefit do I have from all these blessings, when I am leaving this world without children?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Do you already know that you will not beget children?’ He said to Him: ‘Master of the universe, I see in my constellation that I will not beget children.’ He said to him: ‘Is it the constellation that you fear? As you live, just as it is impossible for a person to count the stars, so it will be impossible to count your descendants.’ Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Ḥanin: At that moment, the Holy One blessed be He lifted Abraham above the top of the firmament and said to him: “Look now to the heavens, and count the stars, if you could count them, and He said to him: So will be your descendants” (Genesis 15:5). He said to him: ‘Just as you see these and you are unable to count them, so will your descendants be such that no person will be able to count them.’  Likewise you find regarding Jacob that the Holy One blessed be He promised him and said to him: “Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth [and you shall spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south] (Genesis 28:14), and likewise, “I will descend with you to Egypt, and I will take you up again” (Genesis 46:4), and the Holy One blessed be He fulfilled it for him. That is, “forever, Lord, Your word stands in the heavens” (Psalms 119:89). Likewise you find regarding Aaron that the Holy One blessed be He promised to Moses and said to him: “And you, draw Aaron your brother near to you” (Exodus 28:1).

              <p>“Moses said to God: 'Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should take the children of Israel out of Egypt?’” (Exodus 3:11)  “Moses said to God: Who am I [anokhi]?” Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: This is analogous to a king who married off his daughter and committed to give her one province and gentlewoman as a maidservant, and he gave her a Kushite maidservant. His son-in-law said: ‘Didn’t you commit to give me a gentlewoman as a maidservant?’ So, Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, when Jacob descended to Egypt, didn’t you say this to them: “I [Anokhi] will descend with you into Egypt and I [Anokhi] will take you up” (Genesis 46:4), and now you say to me: “Go now, and I will send you to Pharaoh”? It is not I [anokhi] about whom you said: “And I [Anokhi] will take you up.”’ (Moses is, as it were, pointing out to God that He promised to take Israel out of Egypt Himself, and not by means of an agent.)   Another interpretation: Rabbi Nehorai says: Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘You say to me: Go and take Israel out. Where do I shelter (Following Rabbi David Luria’s emendation mashkinam rather that mashkim.)  them in the summer due to the sun, and in the winter due to the cold? From where do I provide food and drink? How many birth mothers are among them, how many pregnant women, how many children are among them, how many types of foods have you provided them to sustain them, how many delicacies have you prepared for the pregnant women, how much toasted grain and how many nuts have you provided for the children?’ Where is this matter explicated? It is in Song of Songs, as it is stated: “Tell me, whom my soul loves…” (Song of Songs 1:7). The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘The bread that came out with them from Egypt will suffice them for thirty days; you know how I am destined to lead them.’  Another interpretation: “Who am I?” – He [Moses] said before Him: ‘Master of the universe, how am I able to enter a place of robbers and a place of murderers? That is: “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh…” “And that I should take the children of Israel out” – what merit do they possess that will enable me to take them out?’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Because I will be with you” (Exodus 3:12). One says “I will be with you” only to someone who is afraid.  “He said: Because I will be with you, and this is your sign that it is I who sent you: When you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve God upon this mountain” (Exodus 3:12).  “And this is your sign that I sent you” – and in this manner it will be apparent that you are My emissary, because I will be with you and anything you wish I will perform.  “When you take the people out of Egypt, you will serve God upon this mountain.” That which you said: ‘With what merit will I take them out of Egypt?’ Know that due to the merit of the Torah that they are destined to receive through you on this mountain they will emerge from there.  Another matter: “[you will serve] God” – what is it that He said to him: “That I [anokhi] sent you”? (Why does the verse change from first person to third person? “This is your sign that it is I who sent you…you will serve God.”)  Our Rabbis of blessed memory said: A sign of the first deliverance is that Israel went down to Egypt with anokhi, as it is stated: “I [anokhi] will go down with you to Egypt” (Genesis 46:4), and with anokhi I will take you up. A sign of the ultimate redemption is that with anokhi they will be cured and are destined to be delivered, as it is stated: “Behold I [anokhi] will send you Elijah the prophet” (Malachi 3:23).</p>

              <p>“Go and gather the elders of Israel, and say to them: The Lord, the God of your fathers, God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying: I have remembered you, and what is being done to you in Egypt” (Exodus 3:16).  “Go and gather the elders of Israel.” The elders always uphold Israel, and thus it says: “And all Israel, and its elders, and its officers, and its judges, stood on this side and on that side of the ark” (Joshua 8:33). When is Israel capable of standing? It is when they have elders. Why, when the Temple was standing, did they consult with the elders, as it is stated: “Ask your father and he will tell you; your elders and they will say to you” (Deuteronomy 32:7)? It is because anyone who takes counsel from elders does not fail. Know that when ben-Hadad sent to the king of Israel, as it is stated: “So said ben-Hadad: Your silver and your gold are mine” (I Kings 20:3), the king of Israel sent to him: “As you said, my lord king: I, and everything that I have are yours” (Ibid. 20:4). He sent to him a second time: “But tomorrow at this time, I will send my servants to you and they will search your house, and the houses of your servants; and it will be, that everything precious [maḥmad] to you, they will seize, and take it” (I Kings 20:6). Was everything that he demanded initially not precious? He demanded silver and gold and they are precious, as it is stated: “And the precious items [ḥemdat] of all the peoples will come” (Haggai 2:7).  (The following verse in Haggai states: “Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, the utterance of the Lord of hosts.”)  He demanded women and they are precious, as it is stated: “Son of man, behold, I am taking away from you the desire [maḥmad] of your eyes…” (Ezekiel 24:16). He demanded children, and they are precious, as it is stated: “And I will slay the beloved fruit [maḥmad] of their womb” (Hosea 9:16). You must say: Everything he demanded initially was precious, and “everything precious to you” is an item that is ultimately precious, that is the Torah, as it is stated: “More precious than gold and more than much fine gold” (Psalms 19:11).  When the king of Israel heard this, he said: ‘This is not mine, but rather it belongs to the elders.’ Immediately, “The king of Israel called all the elders of the land…and all the elders and all the people said to him: Neither heed nor consent” (I Kings 20:7–8). Once he heeded the counsel of the elders, immediately: “The king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and the chariots” (I Kings 20:21). That is Israel consulting the elders. Therefore, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses: “Go and gather the elders of Israel.”  “Say to them…I have remembered [pakod pakadeti].” He said to him: ‘They have a tradition from Joseph that I will deliver them with this expression. (“God will remember [pakod yifkod] you” (Genesis 50:24).)  Go and say to them: This is the sign.’ What is pakod pakadeti? Pakod in Egypt, pakadeti at the sea; pakod in the future, pakadeti in the past. “And what is being done to you in Egypt” – in other words, I will remember for the Egyptians what they are doing to you, as it is stated: “I remember what Amalek did to you” (I Samuel 15:2).  (The verse actually states: “I remember what Amalek did to Israel.” This statement precedes God’s command to King Saul to annihilate Amalek.)  “And I said: I will take you up out of the affliction of Egypt, to the land of the Canaanites and the Hitites and the Emorites and the Perizites and the Hivites and the Yevusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey. They will listen to your voice and you shall go, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt and you shall say to him: The Lord, God of the Hebrews, happened upon us. And now, please, let us go a journey of three days in the wilderness, and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God.” (Exodus 3:17-18).  “And I said: I will take you up” – Say to them that, as I said to Jacob their ancestor, so I will do. What did He say to him [Jacob]? “I will also take you up” (Genesis 46:4).  (God promised Jacob when he went to Egypt that he would take his descendants out of Egypt.)  Likewise, Jacob said to his sons: “God will be with you and He will return you…” (Genesis 48:21). Immediately, “they will heed your voice.” Why? It is because they have a tradition of deliverance, that any deliverer who comes and says to them a double expression of remembrance [pakod pakadeti] is a genuine deliverer. Then “you shall go, you and the elders of Israel…” – He showed respect for the elders. “You shall say to him: The Lord, God of the Hebrews, happened upon us.” Why does it call them Hebrews [ivrim]? It is because they crossed [avru] the sea.  “And now, please, let us go a journey of three days...” Why did they say three days and did not say, please let us go forever? Why did they say this? It was so the Egyptians would be misled and pursue them when they left, and would say: ‘He delivered them only so they would go three days and sacrifice to Him, and it is they who have delayed for so long.’ And they will pursue them after three days and He will drown them in the sea to punish them with a punishment to fit their crime, as they said: “Every boy that is born you shall cast into the Nile…” (Exodus 1:22).</p>

              <p>It states, “Thus said Hashem, for your sake I have sent you into Babylon and I have sent them all down in boats” (Yeshayahu 43:14). [The Zohar comments (Parashas Shemos 2b), “‘I have sent you into Babylon’ — This alludes to the Holy One Blessed is He.”] This illustrates the great love of the Holy One Blessed is He for Israel, on account of which He shares in their afflictions and descends with them into exile. Similarly, regarding the descent into Egypt it is stated, “These are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt with [es] Yaakov” (Shemos 1:1). Wherever the word את appears it includes something not mentioned in the verse. In this case it includes the Shechinah, which went down with Yaakov into Egypt, in keeping with the verse, “I will descend with you into Egypt and I will bring you up” (Bereishis 46:4). Regarding the Babylonian exile, however, not only does it state, “For your sake I have sent you into Babylon,” but, “In all their afflictions He is afflicted” (Yeshayahu 63:9). The succeeding exiles were more difficult to bear than the Egyptian exile.</p>

              <p>When Israel sinned and as a result the Temple was destroyed, the שכינה went into exile with the Jewish people, seeing that it was a pledge G–d had entrusted to them. This is the mystical dimension of the verse: אלה פקודי המשכן, משכן העדות, &quot;These are the &quot;pledges&quot; of the Tabernacle, the &quot;pledges&quot; of the &quot;Testimony&quot; (Exodus 38,21). This is the basis for the Rabbinic statement in Megillah 29 that Israel is beloved (by G–d) since wherever the people of Israel are exiled, the שכינה is exiled with them. When they were exiled to Egypt the שכינה was with them, as we know from Genesis 46,4, where G–d told Jacob: &quot;I shall go down to Egypt with you.&quot; When the Jewish people went into exile in Babylonia the שכינה accompanied them, as we know from Isaiah 43,14: &quot;For your sake I sent to Babylon.&quot; When Israel was exiled in Elam the שכינה accompanied them, as we know from Jeremiah 49,38: &quot;I will set My throne in Elam.&quot; When the Jewish people went into the Roman exile the שכינה also went with them, as we know from Isaiah 63,1: &quot;Who is this coming from Edom,…..it is I who contend victoriously, powerful to give triumph.&quot; When the people of Israel return to their land from exile the שכינה will also accompany them as we know from Deut. 23,35: ושב ה' אלוקיכם את שבותך ורחמך, &quot;G–d will come back with your imprisoned ones and have mercy on you.&quot; We would have expected the Torah to say: והשיב, &quot;He will bring back,&quot; instead of &quot;He will come back.&quot; We also have a verse in Song of Songs 4,8: &quot;With Me from Lebanon O bride, come with Me!&quot; Rabbi Meir explains this as a parable: It is like a king saying to his servant &quot;if you need to seek me out, I shall be with my son.&quot; This is the meaning of &quot;who dwells with them in their defilement,&quot; which we have quoted earlier. All this although G–d had warned Israel not to defile their encampments or the land they would live on, for it is the land G–d Himself has His abode in. </p>

To those who have died in חוצה לארץ and whose body is being transferred to ארץ ישראל, Rabbi Yuda wants to apply the verse from Jeremiah 2,7: ותבאו ותטמאו את ארצי ונחלתי שמתם לתועבה, &quot;You have come and have defiled My land and made My inheritance an abomination!&quot; Rabbi Yuda answered that Jacob was an exception to this rule; the שכינה had accompanied him on his descent to Egypt and had never left him. This is the reason G–d had said to him in 46,4: אנכי ארד עמך מצרימה, ואנכי אעלך גם עלה, &quot;I shall go down with you to Egypt and I shall also go up with you.&quot; The message to Jacob was that, in spite of the fact that his soul would depart on foreign soil, it would remain close to G–d, whereas his body would be buried with those of his ancestors.</p>

              <p>In my humble opinion this latter tradition need not contradict the statement that Rabbi Akiva was the re-incarnation of Joseph. Inclusion of the שכינה in the brothers' conspiracy of silence is equivalent to including Joseph, whom we have described as a junior מרכבה, carrier of the שכינה. Rabbi Akiva was the reincarnation of Joseph, and this is demonstrated by the former's close association with the שכינה. Joseph was the carrier of the שכינה when he descended to Egypt, which was the beginning of Jewish exile according to the Zohar. We also have the tradition that when the Jewish people descended into Egypt the שכינה accompanied them (Mechilta Beshalach on Genesis 46, 4). Something similar occurred before every other exile; in this particular instance, G–d inspired Joseph before the rest of his father's family came to Egypt. We see that Joseph's essence was a Divinely inspired one, which made him a partner of the שכינה for he was the מרכבה. If Rabbi Akiva ben Joseph breathed his last by saying “אחד,” this means that his soul departed while it was immediately &quot;below&quot; the שכינה.</p>

              <p>Baruch Shomer Havtachato: God's Promise to Jacob Translator's Introduction:  Rabbi Bondi suggests that the promise referred to here is not the 'Covenant of the Pieces' (Genesis 15) made to Abraham but the promise God made to Jacob just before he went down to Egypt to see Joseph. For Rabbi Bondi, Abraham's promise doesn’t seem like much of a promise: God tells him that his ancestors will be enslaved and oppressed in a land not their own, but eventually will leave with great wealth. God, on the other hand, reassures Jacob at Beersheba: God tells him not to worry and that He will go down with the people to Egypt. Our commentator interpret these words, &quot;Praised is the One who keeps His promise,&quot; in this context. Finally, there is one other significance difference in Bondi's interpretation. The 'great wealth' that Israel takes from Egypt is not the goods they plunder but the commandments they receive from God at Mount Sinai. Unlike most commentators, Rabbi Bondi sees Israel as worthy of redemption rather than lost on the brink of oblivion, about to descend into the fiftieth level of impurity. This was Jacob's fear but, according to Rabbi Bondi, the years of slavery actually made Israel stronger.  Why do we say that God kept the promise he made to 'Israel'? Didn’t God make this promise to Abraham? Israel refers to the promise that God made to Grandfather Israel (Yisrael Saba), that is, our forefather, Jacob. Jacob was aware of the decree which God had made to Abraham: &quot;Your offspring shall be strangers in a land not theirs, and they shall be enslaved and afflicted for four hundred years…&quot; (Genesis 15:13) Egypt is not explicitly mentioned in this passage because God turns freedom of choice over to human beings. (That is, the land in which Israel would become strangers was not pre-determined) Still, the verse alludes to Egypt for Joseph transferred the Egyptians from place to place throughout the land so that they would not consider the land their inheritance. He was trying to avoid Egypt becoming the land of Israel's subjugation. This is what the commentators suggest the expression, &quot;A land not their own,&quot; means. The land did not belong to the Egyptians. Because of this decree, our forefather Jacob was fearful of going down to Egypt. Egypt was the most despicable of lands. Jacob felt that if his family had to spend four hundred years they would sink into the impurity of the Egyptians and would no longer be worthy of being redeemed. It was for this reason that God said: &quot;Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt. I will go down with you.&quot; (Gen 46:3) Wherever Israel is exiled, the Divine Presence is with them. &quot; I will also go up with you…&quot; (Gen. 46:4) God  also reassured Jacob, &quot;I will not allow your children to sink into the fiftieth level of impurity. Jacob also hinted to his children that they would not be in Egypt more than two hundred and ten years when he said to them, &quot;Go down (r'du)  to Egypt (see Rashi on Gen. 42:10).  God agreed to this, and along with God's promise Jacob was reassured. It was through the furnace of oppression in Egypt that Israel was refined and prepared to receive the Torah. It did not turn out as Jacob thought; he believed the people would deteriorate there and that is why he was afraid. The thoughts of the Holy One are mysterious. For instead of sinning, Israel was refined like silver until they finally sanctified the name of God in Egypt, at the sea, and in the wilderness. But the decree was four hundred years enslaved! What did the Holy One do? He made the yoke of servitude more severe so that they would complete the four hundred years sooner rather than later. They were refined more quickly in this way, so that Israel was enslaved only half the time. This is the meaning of, &quot;Praised is the one who keeps his promise to Israel.&quot; God told Jacob not to be afraid - and &quot;He recalculated the end,&quot; of servitude - the amount of time in Egypt, shortening their exile by 190 years. This is the meaning of the expression, &quot;God calculated the end (ketz) .&quot;  Even though they were only slaves 210 years it was as if they were there a full 400 years. &quot;They went forth with great wealth.&quot; The word great appears to be superfluous in this verse. It could have said, &quot;They went forth with wealth.&quot; They were so refined by the suffering of Egypt that they not only left with material wealth from the Egyptians (silver, gold and clothing), but they were worthy of receiving an even greater possession: the commandments of Passover and Circumcision. They were also worthy of receiving the Torah at Sinai which is our greatest possession.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Praised is the one who keeps His promise: There are several questions that must be answered here: Why is it necessary to tell us that God ‘keeps His promise’ – isn’t this obvious?  Why does this passage say that God kept His promise to Israel; wasn’t the promise made to Abraham at the covenant between the pieces?  What does it mean when it says that, “The Holy One determined their end?” What does this mean? Surely the text tells us that they would be strangers in a strange land four hundred years.  There are many words in the passage from Joshua which seem redundant. For instance, the word la’asot is unnecessary here – what does it mean in this passage? (This passage would literally be translated “God calculated the end to do (la’asot)…”)   In the proof text we find a double word: “Certainly know (yodoah teidah) that your offspring shall be strangers…” What is the meaning of this double expression? The verse also says that the offspring of Abraham would be enslaved and afflicted 400 years; and yet they were only enslaved 210 years. It should have said, “Your offspring shall be strangers 400 years.”  Scripture says: “Just as a person chastises his child, so your God shall chastise you.” (Deuteronomy 8:5)  We shall see in this explanation that even when God becomes angry with his children he still remembers to be compassionate and lightens his decree. This teaching can be applied to the amount of time that the Israelites were enslaved in Egypt. The time period of 400 years refers to two different events; “Your offspring will be strangers in a land not their own” and, “They will be enslaved and afflicted.” Both of these events will take place during the 400 year period. It will begin after the birth of Isaac and continue up to the Exodus from Egypt. When Joseph brought his family down to Egypt, he did not allow them to become settled in one place, unlike other nations – so they were strangers in the land. (This explanation is problematic – didn’t Joseph settle the people in Goshen?)  However, we might also say that they were strangers because unlike Isaac, they did not live in the land of Canaan for an extended period of time. The decree of slavery and oppression was supposed to be applied to a full period of four hundred years aside from living as strangers in a strange land. However, if the people repented and prayed to God, then God would calculate the period from the birth of Isaac and the end would come sooner. But if the people did not repent, then there would be a period of four hundred years of slavery and oppression. God did not reveal this to Israel because human beings must have free will to make choices on their own. This is alluded to in the expression yodoah teidah- there are two possible outcomes of God’s will depending on the choices the Israelites make. The 400 years can begin from the birth of Isaac or it can be 400 years of misery in Egypt. And so also the nations that they served I will judge: Even though God had decreed Israel’s exile and slavery, Egypt still was subject to punishment because they choose how severe to make Israel’s servitude. God only decreed that they live in a land not their own and be oppressed for 400 years – He did not decree the extent of the oppression. The Egyptians chose to oppress them ruthlessly for 210 years – therefore they deserved to be judged by God. The verse says “the nations that they served I will judge (dan anochi).” The word anochi is unnecessary here. It is a reference to the tenth plague about which it is written: I shall go forth in Egypt and strike down the first born.” (Exodus 11:4)  The words, “And so, also” implies that even if they only enslave but don’t oppress the Israelites they will be judged. “And afterwards they shall go forth with great wealth:” afterwards, whether they served the full 400 years or only part of them, they shall go forth with great wealth.  We know that the Israelites repented because the Torah says, “And God heard their sighs.” (Deuteronomy 26:7ff)  “And God remembered His covenant” – that God would begin counting the period of exile from the birth of Isaac. “The God of our fathers,” God made a covenant with Abraham, with Isaac he promised that the period of exile would begin from his birth, and with Jacob. God can be counted on to keep all of His promises particularly to our forefather Jacob to whom He said: “I will go down with you to Egypt and I will certainly come up (alo a’aleh) with you.” (Genesis 46:4)  The Ba’al Haturim points out that the word alo is written with a hei instead of a vav to teach that Israel would be enslaved for five generations: Jacob, Levi, Kehat, Amram and Moses. Praised is He: the word hu, he, is third person. (In Hebrew third person is called lashon nistar; literally hidden or concealed language. Therefore, third person words reflect something hidden, particularly when it refers to God.)  The calculation of the period of exile and enslavement was hidden by God. Only God could calculate the end of this period from the birth of Isaac. That is why it says that God calculates the keitz, the end. The gematriah of keitz is 190 leaving 210 years. Also Sarah was 90 and Abraham was 100 when Isaac was born – adding up to 190, keitz. The number 190 is also associated with the different spellings of the name Isaac: sometimes it is spelled yud-sin-chet-kuf (Psalms 108:9)  and usually yud-tzadi-chet-kuf – the difference between these two spellings is 190! The 210 years of slavery is fulfilled if we count from the birth of Isaac – then there are 190 years of slavery. Another way of interpreting this passage is to say that it applies specifically to Jacob/Israel. “Praised is the One who kept His promise to Israel” – that is, our forefather Jacob. The Holy One said to Jacob: “I (anokhi) will go down with you to Egypt and I (anokhi) will go up with you.” (Genesis 46:4)  Why does it say anokhi, “I,” twice in this verse? The Midrash says that when Jacob’s family went down to Egypt, God was counted as one of the seventy members of his household, and when the Israelites left Egypt, God was the six hundred thousandth necessary for them to leave. The Israelites could not leave Egypt until there were six hundred thousand like the number of letters in the Torah. They were lacking just one so God counted Himself as the One. In other words God was the anokhi that went down to Egypt and the anokhi that left with the people of Israel. (See Shenei Luchot HaB’rit – Masekhet Pesachim, Perek Torah Orah, Matzah Shemurah; v’hi sh’amda)  The Israelites could not wait another moment to leave Egypt so God did them a kindness and counted himself among the six hundred thousand. We can now understand the expression differently, God numbered himself among the people of Israel because the end was so near.</p>

(Deut. 26:8) וַיּוֹצִאֵ֤נוּ יְהֹוָה֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם Vayoteinu, “Adonai took us out from Egypt,” (Deut. 26:8) Since a verse states, “God sent a messenger (malakh) and took us out from Egypt,” (Num. 20:16) the commentators state that this verse is speaking of Moses, our teacher. Because the prophets are emissaries of God, they are considered, מַלְאָכִים֙ malakhim (angels). The Maggid comes to say that this is not that type of מַלְאָכִים֙, malakh, nor is it the type of malakh, our forefather, Jacob, was referring to when he said, “The angel who has redeemed me from all harm…” (Gen. 48:16) Jacob is not referring to an angel among the ministering angels for he would never have said that an angel should bless his grandchildren. Rather the termהַמַּלְאָךְ֩ hamalakh, “the Angel,” refers to the Shechinah, the Divine Presence and that God Himself took them out of Egypt.  One might say that these verses contradict one another! One says that God “Sent an angel to take us out…” (Num. 20:16) and the other verse says “ Adonai took us out…” (Deut. 26:8) and yet Maggid says, “Not by an angel…” However one should note that the verse does not say, “He sent an angel to take us out,” but rather, “He sent an angel and He took us out.” (Num. 20:16) He wishes to explain that God had already sent, “the angel of His presence,” (This is another term for the Shechinah.)  (Is. 63:9) to Egypt. This is what the sages meant when they stated, “The Divine Presence (Shechinah) was exiled to Egypt with them, as is stated, “I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I Myself will also bring you back.” (Gen. 46:4) This suggests that God will bring us out of Egypt through Shechinah itself and will perform miracles and wonders. This is what will happen in the future when God brings us out from this exile, as is written, “In that day, I will set up again the fallen booth of David,” (Amos 9:11) Therefore, it won’t be through a שָׂרָף Saraph, a fiery being, even though it is written, “I will bore you on the wings of eagles.” (Ex. 19:4) This refers to the face of the eagle in the divine chariot, (Ez. 1:1) It was not the Sarafim who took us out completely; rather it was God who took us out of Egypt and these eagles served to carry us to the land of Israel so we could eat the Passover offering, as the liturgist wrote, “They built and flew off to the bright and fairest of heritages… There they shall eat the Pesach offering with praise and songs, This is because outside of the land of Israel the Pesach offering was not allowed. On that night they shall return to the Valley of Kaftorim. I will perform miracles with all the gods of Egypt, I and not an emissary, The emissary is Moses who was sent on a mission by the Blessed One to Pharaoh and to the people of Israel, and not as the people who complained said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt?” It was not so - rather it was God who brought us out, and against all the Gods of Egypt did he bring judgment.</p>

              <p>וַיָּ֥גׇר שָׁ֖ם Va’yagar sham: And he sojourned there: “This teaches us that our ancestor Jacob did not intend to settle in Egypt.” This verse teaches us that from the moment that Jacob went down to Egypt and while he was there, even though he lacked for nothing and had a comfortable life because Joseph supported him and his children ministered to him, even so he acted as one who planned to live there temporarily. He constantly expected the Holy One to tell him to return to the land of his ancestors, as God said, “I Myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I Myself will bring you back,” (Gen. 46:4) Jacob was convinced that this would happen in his lifetime. That is why it states, “And he sojourned (Va’yagar) there.” Though he said to Pharaoh, “Pray, then, let your servants stay in Goshen,” he did so that it appears that he planned to stay in Egypt permanently, he only came because of the famine. However, when they (the brothers) found it so good, they decided to remain permanently in Goshen. If this had not been the case they would have returned to their land as soon as the famine ended. This verse comes to teach us that originally, “They came to sojourn,” there and that they did not go down to Egypt to settle there.  This teaches us that we should not make our dwellings in exile permanently by purchasing homes, fields and vineyards. Rather one should live like temporary residents in the land and will one day return to our land. One who does so will be called, “One who expects redemption,” as we are obligated to be.</p>

              <p>Looking at our verse from an homiletical point of view, Bereshit Rabbah 9,9 sees in the description והנה טוב a reference to the יצר הטוב, the urge which tells us to be good, whereas in the word מאד it sees an allusion to the evil urge יצר הרע. What the Midrash has in mind is that but for the addition of this יצר הרע, an urge to be “independent, individualistic, etc.,” man would not engage in founding a household, marrying and raising a family; as a result of such lack of enterprise and individuality the world would soon be in ruins.  The sages of the Midrash explained further: the words והנה טוב מאד are an allusion to death. Death is the reason that generations of humans feel the need to procreate in order to renew themselves through their offspring. The sages went so far as to institute a benediction to be said in the house of mourners in which one refers to G’d as הטוב והמטיב, “as the One who is both good and metes out goodness.”</p>

              <p>והנה אנכי עמך, “and here I am going to be with you, etc.” Onkelos translated these words as והא מימרי בסעדך, “and this word (promise) will assist you.” When the Torah writes in Exodus 3,12 ואהיה עמך, “and I shall be with you,” (G’d encouraging Moses to accept the role of leader) Onkelos translates this as ארי יהי מימרי עמך, “behold My promise will be with you” The (apparently minute) difference in the way Onkelos renders G’d’s promise to Moses reflects the difference between the spiritual level of these two men at the time G’d communicated with them. Seeing that in verse 13 the Torah wrote והנה י-ה-ו-ה נצב עליו ויאמר אני י-ה-ו-ה, Onkelos was forced to use the description בסעדך similar to when the Talmud in Shabbat 89 quotes G’d as telling Moses he should have assisted Him when he saw G’d write the crowns on the Torah. Yaakov was on a level where G’d applied to him the attribute of שדי, G’d as Master of nature. Whatever assistance Yaakov would receive would not be by means of נסים גלוים, the kind of miracles which upset the laws of nature. Moses, on the other hand, was already being addressed by the Ineffable Name, by a higher attribute of G’d. Yaakov only dreamed; Moses was wide awake when he saw the burning bush. If you were to challenge my explanation by pointing out that in 46,4 Onkelos translates the words אנכי ארד עמך as אנא איחות עמך, indicating that Yaakov was on a level not inferior to that of Moses, the context of that verse forced Onkelos to translate it in the way he did. The purpose of G’d’s message at that time was to reassure Yaakov that even in exile G’d’s Presence would be with the people, i.e. the שכינה would descend to Egypt with the Israelites.</p>

              <p>בשבעים נפש ירדו אבותיך מצרימה, “Your forefathers comprised only 70 people when they descended to Egypt.” Moses enumerates some of the great and wonderful acts performed by G’d for this nation. It is these which entitle G’d to be loved by this people. Although only 70 people emigrated to Egypt, their number by now had increased to be like the stars in heaven. This is why in the next verse Moses demands that the people love “the Lord your G’d and observe His commandments. Here Moses mentions the number of Israelites descending to Egypt as being 70 whereas if you will check the number given in Genesis 46,27 you will find that actually only 69 are listed as leaving. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 94,9 have already pointed out that the discrepancy is accounted for by Yocheved, who was conceived by her mother on the way but was not born until Yaakov and family arrived in Egypt.  Some sources claim that the discrepancy is accounted for by Serach, daughter of Asher. They base this on Samuel II 20,19: “I am one of those who seek the welfare of the faithful in Israel.” The words שלומי אמוני in that verse are understood as “completed their number.”  I have seen in Pessikta D'Rav Kahane that it was the Lord Himself Who made complete the number 70 as He said (Genesis 46,4) “I am going down with you (Yaakov) to Egypt.” [In other words 69 members of Yaakov’s family as listed in chapter 46 in Genesis plus the Shechinah went down to Egypt. Ed.]. The author of that Midrash cites our verse: “for He is your praise and your G’d,” in the same verse as Moses making reference to this number as proof that it was the fact that G’d personally accompanied the Israelites on their descent to Egypt as the reason that they can use Him as “their praise.” A similar approach is taken by the Midrash in Pirke d'Rabbi Eliezer chapter 39 where the words כשש מאות אלף, “about 600,000 foot soldiers” instead of “600,000 foot soldiers (Exodus 12,37) are also interpreted as the Israelites being 1 shy of that number with G’d Himself making up the number 600,000. If we accept this interpretation G’d made up the requisite number both when the Israelites descended to Egypt and when they ascended from Egypt. This would correspond to precisely what G’d said to Yaakov in Genesis 46,4: “I will go down with you and I will also surely bring you up.”</p>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Shemot 12:12:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>ועברתי בארץ מצרים, “and I will go through the land of Egypt, etc.” This whole paragraph is meant to be something that Moses and Aaron were to tell the Israelites. We would therefore have expected the Torah to write at this point ועבר בארץ מצרים, “and He will go through the land of Egypt,” rather than “and I will go through the land of Egypt.” The unusual change in syntax here prompted our sages the Haggadah shel Pessach to say that the emphasis on the ending תי, after the ועבר which we would have expected teaches that G’d meant that He personally and not any agent of His would execute all the firstborns. They phrase it as אני ולא מלאך, אני ולא שרף, אני ולא השליח, אני ה', “I and not an angel; I and not a category of agent known as Saraph; I and not someone whom I usually delegate such a task to; I, all by Myself.” When G’d killed an army of 185,000 Assyrians (Kings II 19,35) many hundreds of years later on the anniversary of that date, He employed an angel to carry out His decree. This time He did not delegate the task.  והכתי כל בכור, “I will smite every firstborn;” again we have the emphasis on “I, not a saraph.” Not only the dying but the smiting, the plague resulting in death will be inflicted by Me personally. I will not act like a king who delegates unpleasant duties to be performed by underlings. The “saraph” mentioned by our sages are the kind of angels that burned the soldiers sent to capture Elijah and whom he commanded to be burned (compare Kings II 1,10).   ובכל אלוהי מצרים אעשה שפטים, “and against all the deities of Egypt I will carry out judgments.” Again G’d employs the pronoun “I” to emphasise that He would not employ any delegate such as the angel Mattatron who normally is in charge of matters pertaining to the terrestrial part of the universe. The meaning of the word “Mattaron” transliterated is מורה דרך, someone teaching the way. A messenger is called Mentor in Greek.  'אני ה', “I the Eternal.” I and no one but I. G’d emphasizes His uniqueness, indicating that the reason He will do all this by Himself is to remind us that there is No On like Him.  Nachmanides writes that the emphasis on the words אני ה' is that inasmuch as G’d is supreme and unique there is no one who could interfere with what He sets out to do. Nachmanides wants to explain that had G’d employed any assistants in this plague then the plague would have occurred as an extension of His “intensified,” מתוחה, attribute of Justice. If this had been the case His delegates would not have been able to distinguish between Jewish and Egyptian firstborns seeing that from the vantage point of that attribute they had not deserved to be saved. This is why G’d had no choice but to carry out this plague unassisted without delegates. The aspect of G’d which carried out this plague was the Shechinah which is comprised of a mixture of the attribute of Mercy and the attribute of Justice. This is the meaning of what the sages referred to as “not by means of a messenger.” In other words, G’d performed the plague all by Himself. This is reflected in the use of the word אנכי for the name of G’d in connection with this plague. That term is an allusion to the Shechinah. We refer, of course, to the warning: הנה אנכי הורג את בכורך (Exodus 4,23) “Here I am going to kill your firstborn.” G’d used the same attribute describing Himself there as He had with Yaakov in Genesis 46,4 when He told him that He (His Shechinah) would accompany him down to Egypt and would also accompany him on the way back from there. G’d had already used that name אנכי describing Himself in Genesis 15,14 when He told Avraham about the distant future when his descendants would be enslaved prior to their redemption. It meant already at that time that the attribute which would exact retribution from the nation enslaving Avraham’s descendants would be the one known as אנכי. This is also what is meant in 12,27 “when He smote the Egyptians and He saved our houses.”</p>

              <p>I have found this explanation in Pirke d'Rabbi Eliezer chapter 39. According to the wording there “when G’d realized that they were short by only a single man to make up the required number, He took the place of the missing man thus completing the required quorum. In this manner G’d fulfilled what He said to Yaakov in Genesis 46,4 “I am also going to bring you up out of there.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ה' איש מלחמה, “Hashem is a master of war.” Seeing that Moses had told the people earlier that “Hashem will fight on your behalf,” they now confirmed to him: “G’d is a master of war.” In order to prevent someone making the mistake of thinking G’d employs conventional weapons when He carries on warfare, they added ה' שמו, “His name is Hashem.” It suffices for G’d to invoke His name and He does not have to engage in tiring and bothersome activity to prevail over His adversaries. We have a parallel line in Jeremiah 32,18: “O great and mighty G’d whose name is the Lord of Hosts.” When Jeremiah describes G’d as the Creator of the universe in Jeremiah 33,2, he also writes: “the Lord Who is shaping it (the universe) to bring it about, Whose name is “the Lord.” [Just as creating the universe did not entail toil and fatigue, neither will restoration of the Jewish state.]   A different approach: the word ואנוהו may be understood as אני והוא, meaning אדמה לו, “I wish to emulate Him.” The idea is similar to that expressed in Deut. 28,9 והלכת בדרכיו, “and you go in His ways.” Our sages (Shabbat 133) elaborated on this: “just as He displays patience and is long-suffering (man’s errors) so you shall be patient and long-suffering. Just as He clothes the naked so you shall clothe the naked. Just as He buries the dead, so you shall bury the dead.” The point of this Midrash is to demonstrate that just as G’d was involved in our redemption He is also part of our exile experience, suffering alongside with us. Proof that He participated in our exile is provided by the assurance in Genesis 46,4: “I will go down with you to Egypt.” Our sages used this verse to say that the Shechinah was exiled together with the Jewish people (Megillah 29). We also have a verse in Exodus 1,1 that G’d kept His promise when the Torah wrote the extra word את in that verse to show that G’d had gone down to Egypt together with Yaakov and his family. When we read in Exodus 12,37 that “the Israelites journeyed from Raamses, etc., this is followed in 14,19 where the Torah writes that “an angel of G’d traveled with them.” This illustrates that the Shechinah left Egypt together with them. When David wrote in Psalms 60,7 הושיעה ימינך וענני, “deliver with Your right hand and answer me,” this is a clear indication that G’d, i.e. the Shechinah, was itself in need of salvation.  The word ואנוהו, i.e. אני והוא is an allusion to both the Israelites and the Shechinah. They shared the exile experience first and now are ready to celebrate the redemption together also. When Ezekiel 1,1 describes his first experience as a prophet and says ואני בתוך הגולה, “and I was in the midst of exile,” the introductory letter ו is a reference to the Shechinah which shared the exile experience with the Jewish people. When Jeremiah 40,1 speaks of והוא אסור באזקים, “and He is bound in fetters,” the extraneous word והוא is a reference to the Shechinah.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>פקד פקדתי אתכם, “I have surely remembered you.” The Torah speaks here of two distinct remembrances. One is that Israel is being remembered, the other that the שכינה, which had descended with Yaakov to Egypt and had been exiled and subjected to abuse together with the Jewish people, was also now being “remembered.” The שכינה had been alluded to at the time by the letter ה at the end of the word מצרימה in Genesis 46,4 where G’d had promised to also bring it up again as we have explained there. The שכינה referred to by our sages in that context is none other than the כנסת ישראל which is referred to in verse nine as צעקת בני ישראל. This is also the reason that G’d said to Moses that He had remembered אתכם ואת העשוי לכם במצרים, “you and the כנסת ישראל,” the letter ה of the word מצרימה which we referred to earlier as proof that the שכינה descended to Egypt also. It is this שכינה which shared the pain that the Jewish people were experiencing.  As to the meaning of the word עשוי, “what has been done.” The word is related to Tzefaniah 33,19 הנני עושה את כל מעניך, which means that G’d is actively suffering as a result of His people suffering from by the Gentiles.</p>

              <p>One might object to Yitzchak’s lack of awareness as dangerous: By not taking a proactive and engaged approach to the world, one would expect that Yitzchak would not fare very well – especially from his vulnerable position as a stranger in the land. Yet surprisingly, even as Yitzchak does not devote much energy to his physical well-being, the world seems to treat him with kid gloves (his near-sacrifice on the altar notwithstanding). Divine providence keeps Yitzchak from enduring his father’s and his son’s worst experiences. When in the same situation as his father (i.e., with Avimelech), Yitzchak does not have his wife taken away from him. When Yitzchak thinks of going down to Egypt, God appears to him to prevent him from doing so, telling him that there is no need for him to go into exile (Bereshit 26:2–3). In contrast, when Yaakov contemplates going to Egypt, God appears to him and tells him that he can go (Bereshit 46:3–4). Finally, as opposed to both his father and his son, circumstances do not lead to Yitzchak’s marrying more than one woman, which created major difficulties for both Avraham and Yaakov. Strangely enough, God not only allows for, but seems to encourage, Yitzchak’s lack of interest in the world. As a result, even without possessing the worldly cleverness and engagement of Avraham and Yaakov, Yitzchak comes out of difficult predicaments smelling like a rose.</p>

              <p>Fourth, Jacob was afraid lest Joseph would die during his life time and he would mourn for him. In response to this, God said, “Joseph’s hand will cover your eyes,” (Gen 46:4) he will be with you in the hour of your death. All of this is what he said to Jacob, the individual. But to the nation that would arise from Jacob he also offered reassurance, “Fear not to go down to Egypt, for I will make you there into a great nation.” (Gen. 46:3) That is, don’t be afraid or fearful of entering Egypt since this was a decree before me; it is inevitable that you must go there so I can make you a great nation. The expression, “A great nation” implies that they would become distinctive and recognizable as “Jews” and they would not mix with the descendants of Ham. This was so as long as Jacob’s descendants not change their language, maintained circumcision, and expressed fear of God. It was as if God said to them, “What do you have to fear since you cannot escape this fate in any way?” He also said regarding the nation, “I will go down with you to Egypt,” in order to tell them that even though Egypt was filled with idolatry and it would be hard to cling to their faith, even so the holy offspring would always have God’s providence, as was said, “Though they were exiled to Egypt, the divine presence was with them.” (Bemidbar Rabbah 7:10) He also said to the people, “And I will certainly go up with you.” This is a reference to the redemption from Egypt and the Exodus from there with signs and wonders…and he further said, “Joseph’s hand will cover your eyes.” This is also said about the nation, regarding our teacher Moses. He will continue (Playing on the name Joseph (Yoseif) and its similarity to Yoseef, he will add, he interprets the verse to mean he will add to them with their hand…)  to add to them honor and uprightness. With his teachings he will place his hands over their eyes and enlighten them. Thus we have explained from this vision what God said to Jacob, our forefather, and also to the house of Jacob, the people of Israel. I have now explained these verses completely and answered all the questions I have raised. We have learned from this that Jacob went down to Egypt, “compelled by the Divine Word,” because he didn’t completely agree to go down even after arriving in Beersheba until God made known to him what he had decreed. According to this, the expression, “compelled by the Divine Word,” follows the second approach which I mentioned above as the reasons for the Egyptian exile. There are some who interpret this expression as two separate parts: “Compelled” and “by the Divine Word.” First, they were compelled because of the sale of Joseph and the famine. Second, by the Divine Word, which gave them permission to go down to Egypt. But what I wrote first is the better interpretation and the intention of the Maggid, without a doubt. With this I have answered the questions in the forty-seventh and forty-eighth gates!</p>

              <p>It would be helpful to explain several verses in Scripture according to this point of view: “Enough!” said Israel. “My son Joseph is still alive! I must go and see him before I die.” So Israel set out with all that was his, and he came to Bersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. God called to Israel in a vision by night: “Jacob! Jacob!” He answered, “Here I am.” And He said, “I am Adonai, the God of your father. Fear not to go down to Egypt, for I will make you there into a great nation. I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you back; and Joseph’s hand shall close your eyes.” (Gen. 45:28 – 46:4) </p>

              <p>We may not close the eyes (Shab. loc. cit. (Sonc. ed., p. 772). Closing the eyes of a corpse is a very ancient practice. According to Ibn Ezra the custom is alluded to in Gen. 46, 4, and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes (cf. his commentary ad loc.). The custom was current among the ancient Greeks and Romans and is practised by the Egyptians [cf. Seyffert, Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, p. 101b, and Lane, Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians, ch. XXVIII]. A man, at the moment of death, was believed to behold the Divine Presence (cf. Job 19, 27) and therefore it was unfitting that after that vision his eyes should look at anything mundane. Cf. A. Bender in Jewish Quarterly Review, VII (1895), pp. 102f.)  of a dying man. Whoever touches and moves him is a murderer. For R. Meir used to say: He can be compared to a lamp which is dripping; (Shab. loc cit. reads ‘a lamp that is going out’.)  should a man touch it he extinguishes it. Similarly whoever closes the eyes of a dying man is considered as if he had taken his life.</p>

Pharaoh's decree for exile was seen as determined by God, with the children of Israel repaying Yaakov by carrying him across the river. Despite his previous strengths, Yaakov's circumstances changed over time, and God promised to make him a great nation in Egypt, with Joseph caring for him and eventually bringing him back to the Land of Israel after his death. The title &quot;the children of Israel&quot; was used before the Torah was given, and the Jubilee Year is counted as one year of a Sabbatical cycle with two years deducted from every century. Yaakov's departure from Beer Sheva was made easier with God's promise, and his family traveled in wagons provided by Pharaoh, with the sons riding on the animals while the elderly Yaakov sat.</summary>

            <summary>Yaakov's children are referred to as &quot;the Children of Israel&quot; for the first time, signifying their dual task of conduct towards God and their environment. Yaakov's journey marked the beginning of exile, with Pharaoh's decree being seen as determined by God. The children of Israel repaid Yaakov by carrying him, symbolizing his previous act of carrying them across the river. Yaakov's departure from Beersheba was easier with God's promise, and his family traveled in wagons provided by Pharaoh, with the elderly and frail Yaakov sitting while the sons rode on the animals.</summary>

            <summary>In Kohelet Rabbah 9:11:1, Jacob is used as an example to show that success does not always come to the swift, valiant, wise, or clever. Despite his previous strength, wealth, knowledge, and favor, Jacob's circumstances changed over time. Similarly, Asael and Avner also faced challenges despite their abilities. In Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer 39:2, it is mentioned that Jacob's daughters married his sons to prevent intermarriage with outsiders. In Bereshit Rabbah 94:6, God reassures Jacob about going to Egypt and promises to make him a great nation, with Joseph taking care of him and eventually bringing him back to the Land of Israel after his death.</summary>

              <p>“God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said: Jacob, Jacob, and he said: Here I am” (Genesis 46:2).   “He said: I am God, the God of your father; do not fear to go down to Egypt, as I will make you a great nation there” (Genesis 46:3).   “I will go down with you to Egypt and I will also take you up again and Joseph will place his hand over your eyes” (Genesis 46:4).  “God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night…He said: I am the God Beit El (These words do not appear in the verse and should be deleted (Rashash). ) … and I will also take you up again” – you and all the righteous like you.  “And Joseph will place his hand over your eyes…” – Rabbi Ḥagai said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: Provided that “Joseph will place his hand over your eyes.” (This means that Joseph would take care of Jacob, and provide for all his needs, and Jacob would not have to attend to his own livelihood. Alternatively, it means that Joseph would close Jacob’s eyes after his death, in which case God is stating that He will bring Jacob back to the Land of Israel eventually, but not in his lifetime (Yefeh To’ar). )  “Jacob arose from Beersheba and the sons of Israel conveyed Jacob their father, and their children, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh sent to convey him” (Genesis 46:5).   “They took their livestock, and their property that they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and they came to Egypt: Jacob, and all his descendants with him” (Genesis 46:6).   “His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his descendants, he brought with him to Egypt” (Genesis 46:7).  “Jacob arose…. They took their livestock…His sons, and his sons’ sons…” – Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai said: Daughters of sons are considered like sons. Sons of daughters are not considered like sons.</p>

              <p>“I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, and the war is not to the valiant; also bread is not to the wise, and also wealth is not to the clever, and also favor is not to the knowledgeable, but rather, time and chance befalls them all” (Ecclesiastes 9:11). “That the race is not to the swift” – this is Jacob our patriarch; yesterday: “Jacob lifted his feet [and went to the land of the children of the east]” (Genesis 29:1), and today it is written: “He gathered his feet onto the bed [and expired]” (Genesis 49:33). “And the war is not to the valiant” – this is Jacob; yesterday, “he rolled the stone off the mouth of the well” (Genesis 29:10), and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Like a person removing the stopper from the mouth of a flask, (This demonstrates Jacob’s great strength, as the stone was heavy enough that generally multiple people had to lift it together (see Genesis 29:8).)  and today, “the sons of Israel transported Jacob their father” (Genesis 46:5), his body, and he could not be carried even [sitting] in a litter. (Jacob was so weak that his sons had to carry him themselves as they traveled.)  “Also bread is not to the wise” – this is Jacob; yesterday, “Jacob sacrificed an offering on the mountain…[and called his brethren to eat bread] and they ate bread” (Genesis 31:54). Were they his brethren? He had one brother, and if only he had buried him. (His only brother, Esau, wanted to kill him; it would have been better for Jacob had Esau died.)  Were they not his sons? Rather, once they reached his shoulders he likened them to himself and called them brethren. Today, “Return and purchase a little food for us…” (Genesis 43:2). (Jacob asked his sons to return to Egypt to purchase food. Instead of him providing for them, he asked them to provide food for him.)  “And also wealth is not to the clever” – this is Jacob; “the man became exceedingly prosperous [vayifrotz]” (Genesis 30:43). Rabbi Simon teaches in the name of Rabbi Shimon that he had a microcosm of the World to Come, as it is stated: “The one who breaks through [haporetz] will have ascended before them” (Micah 2:13). (Just as the Messiah, the subject of that verse, will break the laws of nature, God broke the laws of nature in causing Jacob’s flocks to multiply in order to grant him wealth.)  But today, “Joseph sustained his father and his brothers…” (Genesis 47:12). “And also favor is not to the knowledgeable” – this is Jacob. Yesterday, “I know my son, I know” (Genesis 48:19). I know about the incident of Judah and Tamar, the incident of Reuben and Bilha. If the matters that were not revealed to you, were revealed to me, the matters that were revealed to you, all the more so. But today, he said to him: “If I have found favor in your eyes…do not bury me in Egypt (Genesis 47:29). (Jacob was more knowledgeable than Joseph, as indicated in Genesis 48:19, yet he had to ask for Joseph’s favor so that he could be buried in the land of Israel.)  Another matter, “the race is not to the swift” – this is Asael, as it is stated: “Asael was light on his feet, like one of the antelopes…” (II Samuel 2:18). How was his lightness manifest? He would run over the awns of the stalks and they would not break. Yesterday, “Asael was light on his feet,” and today, “Avner struck him with the back of the spear” (II Samuel 2:23). “And the war is not to the valiant” – this is Avner, as it is written: “Are you not a man? Who is your equal in Israel…” (I Samuel 26:15). As Rabbi Asi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is easier for a person to move a six-cubit-wide wall than one of Avner’s legs; but today, “shall Avner die the death of a scoundrel?” (II Samuel 3:33). (David said this after Yoav tricked Avner and killed him.)  “Also bread is not to the wise” – this is Solomon. Yesterday, “Solomon’s daily provision was thirty kor of fine flour and sixty kor of flour” (I Kings 5:2), and it is written: “Ten fattened bulls…” (I Kings 5:3). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Likewise, each and every day, and likewise each and every one of his wives would prepare a meal for him, under the impression that he would dine with her. But today, “this was my portion from all my toil” (Ecclesiastes 2:10). There is one who says: [All he had was] his bowl, there is one who says: [All he had was] his walking stick, and there is one who says: [All he had was] his belt. (This is an allusion to the midrash (Kohelet Rabba 2:10) that Solomon was displaced from his throne and made to wander as a commoner with almost nothing.)  “And also wealth is not to the clever” – this is Job. Yesterday, “his livestock was seven thousand sheep…” (Job 1:3), “and his livestock spread [paratz] in the land” (Job 1:10). Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: He breached [paratz] the boundaries of the world. Everywhere, the way of the world is that wolves kill the goats; however, with Job, the goats would kill the wolves. But today, “pity me, pity me, you are my friends…” (Job 19:21). “And also favor is not to the knowledgeable” – this is Joshua. Rabbi Aḥva son of Rabbi Zeira said: There are two matters that Joshua spoke before Moses, but they did not find favor in his eyes, and these are: One regarding the appointment of the elders, and one in the incident of the [Golden] Calf. In the appointment of the elders, as it is written: “My lord Moses, incarcerate them [kela’em]” (Numbers 11:28); he said to him: Put an end to them [kalem] and remove them from the world. “Moses said to him: Are you zealous on my behalf?” (Numbers 11:29). [Moses] said to him: ‘Joshua, am I jealous of you? (According to rabbinic tradition, Joshua’s statement to Moses about two elders, Eldad and Medad, was made after the latter prophesied that Moses would die and Joshua would lead the nation in the land of Israel (Sanhedrin 17a). That is the backdrop of this midrash, in which Joshua demanded that these elders be punished for their lack of respect toward Moses, and Moses responded that he was not insulted by their prophecy (Rabbi David Luria).)  If only my son could be like you, if only all Israel could be like you, “would that all the people of the Lord would be prophets” (Numbers 11:29).’ And one regarding the [Golden] Calf, as it is stated: “Joshua heard the sound of the people in their uproar [and he said to Moses: There is a sound of war in the camp]” (Exodus 32:17). Moses said to him: ‘A person who is destined to assert authority over six hundred thousand [men] does not know to distinguish between one sound and another sound? “It is not the sound of a cry of strength [gevura]” (Exodus 32:18),’ as it is stated: “Israel prevailed [vegavar]” (Exodus 17:11); ‘“and it is not the sound of a cry of weakness” (Exodus 32:18),’ as it is stated: “Joshua weakened [Amalek]” (Exodus 17:13); ‘“the sound of a cry, I hear” (Exodus 32:18).’ Rabbi Asi said: It is the sound of praise of idol worship, I hear. Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Asi: You do not have any generation that did not take one ounce of the calf. (The punishment for this sin is distributed over all the generations.) </p>

This occurred before the Torah was given at Sinai, and therefore proves that the title “the children of Israel” was in use before the Torah was given.

Despite initially intending to only go to the border of Egypt, Jacob was compelled by God to go down to Egypt with all his descendants, including daughters of sons, as it was seen as a place of economic refuge during times of famine.

Perhaps the brothers originally intended only to accompany their father and to see Joseph. Only after Jacob's dream did it become clear to them that G'd approved of their migration to Egypt until such time as it would please Him that they should return to their ancestral homeland (as I explained on verse 4). This is why they agreed only at this point to take their mobile possessions with them. The Torah also alludes to the fact that though the brothers may well have been aware that their journey would lead to their families' eventual exile in Egypt they did not rebel against what appeared to be G'd's decree.</p>

However, all the goods that he had gathered in Padan Aram with Laban, he gave all this to Esau for the share of the cave where all the Patriarchs should be buried. Jacob said: all the money that I have acquired outside the land [of Israel] is not beloved to me. He placed a great pile of gold and silver before Esau and said: take as much as you want, even though Jacob was very stingy with a penny, as we find. He once forgot a small jug of oil and he returned alone for the jug in the field. It is just that we should be stingy with the kosher [properly acquired] money, since the kosher penny is hard to acquire. Similarly, Jacob thought that the false penny that I acquired when I was outside the land and gathered money and livestock, for the sake of which I threw away the holy land of Israel. Therefore, he did not want to have that money. (Rashi, Genesis, 46:6.) </p>

Alternatively, it means that Joseph would close Jacob’s eyes after his death, in which case God is stating that He will bring Jacob back to the Land of Israel eventually, but not in his lifetime (Yefeh To’ar). )  “Jacob arose from Beersheba and the sons of Israel conveyed Jacob their father, and their children, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh sent to convey him” (Genesis 46:5).   “They took their livestock, and their property that they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and they came to Egypt: Jacob, and all his descendants with him” (Genesis 46:6).   “His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his descendants, he brought with him to Egypt” (Genesis 46:7).  “Jacob arose….

              <p>Esau said: How long will I trouble my brother? He arose and went away, as stated (in Gen. 36:6): THEN ESAU TOOK HIS WIVES…. &lt; AND WENT INTO A LAND AWAY FROM HIS BROTHER JACOB &gt;. What did Jacob do? When his children and his flocks had crossed over into the land of Israel, he arose and sold all that he had brought with him from outside of the land. Then he made it into piles of gold. He said to Esau: You have a share with me in the cave of Machpelah. Now what do you want, to receive these piles of gold or to share &lt; the cave &gt; with me? Esau began by saying: What do I want with &lt; a share &gt; of this cave? This gold is what I want. Now where is it shown that Jacob sold all that he had brought from outside of the land and that Esau took it? Where Joseph said so (in Gen. 50:5): MY FATHER HAD ME SWEAR, SAYING: SEE, I AM DYING. IN MY GRAVE WHICH I DUG &lt; IN THE LAND OF CANAAN, THERE YOU SHALL BURY ME &gt;. R. Huna b. R. Abbin the Priest said: When Jacob wanted to come to the land of Israel, what is written (in Gen. 31:18)? AND HE DROVE ALL HIS LIVESTOCK &lt; AND ALL HIS GOODS THAT HE HAD ACQUIRED … IN PADDAN-ARAM &gt;. Now, when he wanted to go down into Egypt, what is written (in Gen. 46:6)? AND THEY TOOK ALONG THEIR LIVESTOCK AND ALL THEIR GOODS, WHICH THEY HAD ACQUIRED IN THE LAND OF CANAAN. Now, in regard to what he had brought from the land of Aram-Naharaim, where was that? You simply learn from here that Jacob had sold it and given it to Esau. (For an alternative explanation of the same tradition, see Gen. R. 100:5; Exod. R. 31:17; Rashi on Gen. 50:5.)  Then would you say that something was lacking? The Holy One simply filled his loss and restored everything to him immediately, as stated (in Gen. 33:18:) NOW JACOB CAME WHOLE.</p>

            <summary>The Torah portrays Egypt as a place of economic refuge during times of famine, where even other nations come to find sustenance (Bereshit 12:10, 46:6, 26:1-2, 41:57).

              <p>וַיֵּ֣רֶד מִצְרַ֔יְמָה Vayered Mitzrayma: “He went down to Egypt.” This comes to teach us that when Jacob said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I must go and see him before I die.” (Gen. 45:28) it was his intention to go down to Egypt but to stop at the border. He thought that Joseph would come up and meet him there. Once Jacob saw Joseph, he would return to the land of Canaan. Immediately after the Torah states, “I will go and see him,” it states, “So Israel set out with all that was his…” (Gen. 46:10), meaning he took what he needed for the trip. It didn’t occur to him to take his herds, flocks, and his possessions, as it said afterwards. “That night God appeared to Jacob and said, “Don’t be afraid to go down to Egypt…” (Gen. 46:3 ) Thus, the statement, “Compelled by the word of God….” teaches us that he was then told that he must go down to Egypt. Only then does it state, “and they took along their livestock and the wealth that they had amassed in Canaan. Thus Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt:” (Gen. 46:6)</p>

              <p>What does the Torah tell us about the geographical entity we call Egypt? First of all, Egypt functions as a place of economic refuge for those living around it. Both Avraham and Ya’akov go to Egypt when confronted with famine (Bereshit 12:10 and Bereshit 46:6). (Bereshit 12:10 and 46:6, respectively.)  Yitzchak would have done the same had he not been prohibited by special Divine mandate (Bereshit 26:1-2). (Ibid., 26:1–2.)  Moreover, we read that other nations would also come to Egypt to find sustenance in times of famine (Bereshit 41:57). (Ibid., 41:57.)  Were we to know nothing else, these passages immediately show us that even when the rest of the region is experiencing drought, Egypt is somehow spared.</p>

Other commentators suggest the term may refer to daughters-in-law or granddaughters, with Rashi mentioning Serach and Yocheved. In the Midrash, Jacob joyfully goes to Egypt to see Joseph, leading to their settlement in Goshen and prosperity, with God promising to bring Jacob back to Israel after his death. The Torah connects Isaac's wells to Jacob's journey to Egypt, highlighting the importance of individuals like Calev and Joshua, as well as the role of women in attachment to Israel. Additionally, Pallu had a son named Eliab, and Ethan had a son named Azariah in the Tanakh, while the Targum mentions Jacob's entire family accompanying him to Egypt.</summary>

              <p>בנותיו ובנות בניו, “his daughters and the daughters of his sons;” Rashi explains this line as referring to Serach, daughter of Asher, and Yocheved, daughter of Levi. This sounds peculiar as it does not explain who Yaakov’s “daughters (pl)” were. We have been told only about one daughter Dinah, born for him by Leah. She was the only daughter listed as descending to Egypt. The twin daughters born to him had all died before that time. Leah’s descendants numbered 33 as stated explicitly. (verse 15) It is possible to include daughters-in-law, but those were not included in the count. My personal problem with this verse are the words (author writing) כל נפש בניו ובנותיו שלושים ושלש, “the total number of souls his sons and daughters were thirty three.” (verse 15) It is not possible to understand this number as including any daughters-in-law, as these were not counted, seeing that they are specifically excluded in verse 26 as not having been included in the count. Maybe that what Rashi had in mind was to teach us that granddaughters were considered like daughters.

Jacob’s “daughters” can be compared to Michal’s “children” (II Sam. 21:8). (Michal’s “children” were in fact the children of Merab. Scripture refers to them as Michal’s children because she raised them. Cf. Sanhedrin. 19b. See also I.E.’s comments on Gen. 36:2 and the notes thereto.)  The same interpretation is to be given to and his sons’ daughters since Jacob had only one granddaughter. (Serah, the daughter of Asher (v. 17).

              <p>The Torah tries to tell us that there were ideological differences between the sons of Jacob. Some agreed willingly to migrate to Egypt and to accept the burden of G'd's decree that their children would become slaves in Egypt. Others strove to delay as long as possible the descent to the land which would be known as the &quot;iron crucible&quot; of the Jewish people. The Torah tries to describe who was who by mentioning separately בניו ובני בניו אתו on the one hand, meaning that those did not have to be persuaded to undertake the journey with Jacob. On the other hand, when the verse continues to speak separately about Jacob bringing with him &quot;his daughters, granddaughters and all his descendants,&quot; these are the people who did not go down to Egypt voluntarily.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>In this connection it is important to pay attention to the statement in Shemot Rabbah 1,5 that as long as any of the people who descended with Jacob at the time remained alive the Jews lived in Egypt as totally free people. This is based on the Torah telling us in Exodus 1,6 that &quot;Joseph and all that generation died.&quot; The words &quot;and all that generation&quot; refer to those who came to Egypt from Canaan. Perhaps the Torah teaches us that the people who had accepted G'd's decree willingly were spared realisation of that decree during their own lifetime. Perhaps the best proof of this is the fact that Yocheved and Serach, daughter of Asher, who both arrived in Egypt with the family of Jacob did experience the enslavement. The reason was that they were not around when a decision had to be made to descend to Egypt. They were still in their mother's wombs (compare Bereshit Rabbah 94,9). It is worth- while to peruse what the Zohar on Vayakhel 198 has to say on the subject. He quotes Psalms 146,5 &quot;hail to him who has the G'd of Jacob for his help, because his hope was in the Lord.&quot;</p>

We also encounter this phenomenon in Chronicles I 2,8 ובני איתן עזריה, “and the sons of Eytan, Azaryah.” Our sages in Baba Batra 143 used these examples as the basis for their statement that if someone says: “my property is to be given to my sons,” and he has a son and a daughter, that the entire property goes to his son. The Talmud there questions: “since when does a father call a solitary son, “my sons?” Answer: indeed this is so as we know from Numbers 26,8 ובני פלוא אליאב “and the sons of Phalu were (was) Eliyav.”</p>

But what will Rashi include in the term, his daughters, [which is also plural, although Jacob only had one daughter, Dinah]? Rather, it is the way of Scripture, when mentioning the genealogy of many people, to refer to an individual in the plural form, as for example, And the sons of Dan: Hushim; (Verse 23 here.)  And the sons of Palu: Eliab. (Numbers 26:8.)  The same is true here: “daughters” refer to Dinah. “His sons’ daughters” refers to Serah the daughter of Asher, but Jochebed [Moses’ mother] is not mentioned by Scripture [as being among the persons who went down to Egypt], as it is said, All the souls were threescore and six.

              <p>Asher’s daughter, Serach and Leivi’s daughter, Yocheved. You might ask: Why does Scripture write “his daughters” in the plural form? He had only Dinah! We cannot answer that this is in accordance with R. Yehudah who said that a twin sister was born with each of Yaakov’s sons, and the sons married them [i.e., each married another’s twin]. This cannot be, for the twin sisters died before coming to Egypt, as Rashi explains on v. 26. Neither can we answer that it is in accordance with R. Nechemiah who said that the wives of Yaakov’s sons were [born of fathers from other nations and mothers who were] Canaanites, and Scripture calls them Yaakov’s “daughters” because people call their sons-in-law “son” and their daughters-in-law “daughter.” Rashi cited these two conflicting opinions on the verse, “All his sons and all his daughters rose to console him” (37:35). Accordingly, [also here] “his daughters” will mean his daughters-in-law. But this cannot be, for Scripture is counting Yaakov’s own offspring here [as it says in v. 26]. It seems the answer is: When Scripture treats the genealogy of many people, it speaks in plural even for one person. [Examples are:] “The sons of Don were Chushim” (v. 23), and, “The sons of Palu were Eliav” (Bamidbar 26:8). Although [it might infer that] “his daughters” means Dinah alone, we still would prefer to include [other descendants] where possible, rather than relying on stretched explanations. Thus Rashi explains [“his granddaughters” as] Serach and Yocheved, [even though Yocheved is not expressly mentioned in this section]. And so it seems from Bava Basra 143b. We need not ask then on the contrary: [If this is true, then] on the verse, “They rose to console him” (37:35), why did R. Yehudah say they were twins, and R. Nechemiah say they were daughters-in-law? Perhaps it was only Dinah! For [the answer is:] It is different there, because it is written, “All his daughters.” Alternatively, it is different in this case, because here it is treating the genealogy of many people, as mentioned above.

              <p>ובנות בניו, “and the daughters of his sons.” According to Rashi the “daughters” mentioned here are Serach, daughter of Asher, and Yocheved, daughter of Levi.
    Nachmanides writes that the expression בנותיו presents a difficulty, seeing that according to Scripture, Yaakov had only one daughter, Dinah. Why then would the Torah speak about בנותיו, “his daughters” (pl.)? We must remember that it is the style of the Torah to treat subjects (such as offspring, children) in the plural mode, as for instance ובני דן חושים, “Dan’s sons were Chushim.” (verse 23) He had only that one son, and no daughters. Or, for instance, ובני פלוא אליאב, “and the sons of Phallu were Eliav.” There is therefore no reason to wonder why the subject of “daughters” should be treated differently. The same applies to the plural mode used for granddaughters, the only one being named in the text being Serach. Yocheved was not mentioned directly, although the Torah speaks about 70 souls of Yaakov’s descendants arriving in Egypt, whereas only 69 (including Joseph and his two sons) have been named.
    Some commentators explain the plural mode as references to daughters-in-law. Many people refer to their daughters-in-law as “daughter.”

For I cannot leave my native ‎land. And behold the Lord spoke unto Jacob: Go down into Egypt and dwell there with all thy ‎household. Fear thou not to go down into Egypt, for I will make thee there to a great nation. ‎And Jacob said in his heart: I will go and see my son, whether the fear of his God is still in his ‎heart amongst all the inhabitants of Egypt. And the Lord said unto Jacob: Fear thou not ‎concerning Joseph, for he still continues in his piety to serve me as it will be pleasant in thine ‎eyes. And Jacob rejoiced exceedingly on account of his son. At that time Jacob commanded his ‎sons and his household to go into Egypt, according to the word of the Lord unto him. And ‎Jacob rose up with his sons and all his household, and they went forth from the land of ‎Canaan, from Beersheba, with joy and a cheerful heart they went into the land of Egypt. And ‎when they came near entering the land of Egypt, Jacob sent Judah before him unto Joseph to ‎direct his face towards his location in Egypt. And Judah did according to the words of his father, ‎and he hastened and ran and he came unto Joseph, and they prepared a place in the land of ‎Goshen, for Jacob and all his household, and Judah returned unto his father on the road. And ‎Joseph made ready his chariot and he called all his mighty men and his servants and all the ‎princes of Egypt to go and receive Jacob his father. And Joseph had it proclaimed in Egypt, ‎saying: Whosoever faileth to go and meet Jacob shall be put to death. And in the morning, ‎Joseph went forth with all Egypt, a great and mighty host, all of them dressed in white and ‎purple garments, and with ornaments of gold and silver and their instruments of war with ‎them. And all of them went forth to meet Jacob with all sorts of musical instruments, the ‎drums and fifes, and they scattered myrrh and aloes all along the road.

And when Jacob ‎and his sons approached Joseph’s camp, and when Jacob beheld the multitude that came to ‎meet him with Joseph his son, it was pleasing in his eyes, and Jacob wondered greatly at the ‎sight. And Jacob said unto Judah: Who is the man whom I see in the Egyptian camp adorned in ‎royal garments with a very red robe around him, and a regal crown upon his head, who hath ‎now stepped down from his chariot to the ground, and who is coming to meet us. Judah ‎answered unto Jacob saying: He is thy son Joseph, the king. And Jacob rejoiced on seeing the ‎glory of his son. And Joseph approached his father and he bowed down before his father, and ‎all the people of his camp with him bowed down before Jacob to the ground.

            <summary>Isaac redug wells in the same region his father had dug, including four of his own, with the last one in Beer-sheba. Jacob, years later, lingered in Beer-sheba on his way to Egypt, where he was promised Divine Providence and assured that his descendants would become a large nation that God would bring back to the land. This connection between generations is similar to the linking of narratives in other books, such as Chronicles and Ezra. The Torah also highlights the importance of certain individuals, such as Calev and Joshua, and the role of women in their attachment to the land of Israel. The Torah also differentiates between those who willingly came to Egypt and those who were more hesitant.</summary>

The Torah again alludes to this distinction when describing the descent of the people who accompanied Jacob.</p>

              <p>כי אם כלב בן יפונה, “except for Calev son of Yefuneh.” The reason the Torah (Hashem) mentioned Calev’s name first is that G’d Himself always mentions his name before that of Joshua (Numbers 13,30) seeing the Torah had reported Calev as being the first one to speak up against the other spies and had displayed more jealousy on behalf of the Lord than had his companion Joshua. Furthermore, G’d had described Calev as עבדי, “My servant,” the highest type of compliment accorded to mortals. Moses, on the other hand, always mentioned Joshua first to indicate that Joshua possessed more wisdom (Ibn Ezra).  The words: “for not a one had remained except for Calev and Joshua,” which are almost impossible to understand, have been interpreted by our sages in Tanchuma Pinchas 7 as stressing the word איש; of the men of military age none survived; many women did survive. The verse teaches that the decree that the generation of the Exodus had to die in the desert applied only to men, not to women. Our sages in the above-mentioned Tanchuma state that “the men hated the land of Israel, not the women.” It was the men who had demanded to appoint a leader to take the people back to Egypt (Numbers 14,4). The women, by contrast, (the daughters of Tzelofchod) demanded to be given a share in the Holy Land. [We have pointed out already in Genesis 46,7 that there is a clear inference that Yaakov’s womenfolk did not move to Egypt of their own free volition. The women had always displayed greater fondness of the land of Israel. Ed.]. Seeing the Jewish women were fond of the land of Israel, the Torah wrote the chapter about the claim of the daughters of Tzelofchod at this juncture.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND THESE ARE THE NAMES OF …. The meaning [of the connective vav — v’eileh, (‘and’ these are) — when it would have sufficed to say, “These are the names of …,”] is that Scripture desires to reckon the subject of the exile from the time they went down to Egypt. It was then that they were the first of the exiles to go into exile, (Amos 6:7.)  as I have explained. (See Note 7 above.)  It is for this reason that He returns to the beginning of the subject [stated in the Book of Genesis], which is the verse, And all his seed he [Jacob] brought with him into Egypt. (Genesis 46:7.)  There it is written afterward, And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, etc. (Ibid., Verse 8.)  This is the very same verse that He repeats here. Even though they are two separate books, the narrative is connected with subjects which follow one another successively. Here, once He mentioned the children of Jacob, He adopted a concise approach to his children’s children and all of his seed [and did not mention them by name as He had done in the Book of Genesis]. Rather, He alluded to them only generally, just as He had said there, All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten. (Ibid., Verse 27. In the same way He said here in Verse 5: And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls.)  A similar case is found in the Book of Chronicles and the Book of Ezra. The Book of Chronicles finishes with the verse: Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the Eternal by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the Eternal stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying: Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, etc. (II Chronicles 36:22-23.)  The author repeated the very language of these two verses at the beginning of the Book of Ezra in order to connect the narrative. However, since they were indeed two books, he completed the first book, [i.e., the Book of Chronicles], with the events that transpired before the building of the Second Sanctuary, and he devoted the second book, [i.e., the Book of Ezra], to the events that happened from the time of the building [of that Sanctuary]. (Ramban’s thesis apparently is that Ezra himself completely authored the two books, Chronicles and Ezra. See, however, Baba Bathra 15a, where it is stated, “Ezra wrote his book and the genealogy of Chronicles up to himself.” This would seem to indicate that only the first chapters of the Book of Chronicles, which deal with the genealogical tables, were written by Ezra, but not the other parts of the book. The key to the understanding of Ramban’s words must lie therefore in grasping his intent, i.e., that Ezra connected the Book of Chronicles with his own book by using the restoration-edict of Cyrus as the linking material, with the object of bringing out the continuity of the events during the two Sanctuaries.)  The same thing occurs in these two books, Bereshith and V’eileh Shemoth.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Although we have already quoted the Midrash according to which Yocheved was born &quot;between the walls,&quot; i.e. at the time Jacob and his family entered Egypt, there is no proof or even hint of this in the Torah. There is no unanimity on that subject amongst our sages seeing that we have the view that the שכינה should be considered as making up the missing number between 69 and 70. If Yocheved were indeed to be included in the count we would then have a total of 71 instead of seventy. Proof of the accuracy of the statement of our sages is found in verse 27 where the Torah mentions that the total number of persons arriving in Egypt was 70. Why would the שכינה be considered as making up the missing number 33 in verse eight, instead of applying equally to the whole family, i.e. accounting for the difference between 69 and 70? Moreover, if Yocheved made up the number 33 in verse 8, then the number mentioned in verse 27 ought to have been 67 instead of 66. This would comprise 33 of Leah, 16 of Zilpah, 11 of Rachel -excluding Joseph and his two sons who were already in Egypt,- plus 7 of Bilhah. Why does the Torah appear to contradict itself by writing: &quot;all the persons were 66,&quot; when in fact there were 67? </p>

              <p>The plain meaning of these verses is undoubtedly that the Torah informs us about two sets of numbers. One count refers to Jacob plus his family, the other to Jacob's descendants by themselves. When Jacob and his children are added up together we have the number 70. When the numbers exclude Jacob we have a total of 69.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>The Torah is quite accurate by explaining that in the first count Jacob is specifically included in verse 8 where the Torah emphasised יעקב ובניו, Jacob and his sons. While the Torah reports on a count which included Jacob himself, the report in verse 8 which arrives at a total of 33 persons for Jacob and the family of Leah is absolutely correct (not including Yocheved). We may even speculate that the word כל was intended to make it clear that Jacob himself is part of that number. The fact that the Torah does not use the word כל when listing the total of Zilpah's family reinforces our belief that the word כל in verse eight refers to Jacob. While it is true that the Torah does use the word כל when listing Rachel's family (verse 22), the reason is that the Torah there wanted to include Joseph's sons who are needed to make up the total listed there and who were in Egypt already. As to the word כל in verse 25 where Bilhah's family is enumerated, the Torah wanted to emphasise by use of that term that altogether they comprised only seven persons.</p>

              <p>It is interesting to observe that the expression &quot;birth&quot; in one form or another appears in connection with the families of Zilpah, Rachel and Bilhah, whereas this expression does not occur in connection with Leah's family. According to our interpretation we can account for this by the fact that not all the persons listed in connection with Leah's family were born to her or to her offspring. Had the Torah mentioned ותלד לאה as it does when describing Bilhah's family, for instance, then the number 33 would have to puzzle us seeing that she was responsible for the birth of only 32 children at that stage. The number 33 therefore is arrived at only by including Jacob himself. </p>

              <p>The Torah even went to the length of changing its syntax in order to make certain we understand its meaning. In verse 25 we read about כל הנפש הבאה לבית יעקב, whereas in verse 27 we read about כל הנפש לבית יעקב הבאה; the difference is clear. In verse 25 the arrival of the family is mentioned before the name Jacob, i.e. it excludes him. In verse 27 the name Jacob appears prior to the statement that the family arrived in Egypt. This means that Jacob himself is included in the count.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>We do not wish to contradict our sages who have said that Yocheved was born between the walls separating Egypt from Canaan. Perhaps the Torah alludes to her birth with the words כל נפש…ובנותיו. Inasmuch as apart from Dinah we do not know of any other daughters in Leah's family, the Torah's use of the plural &quot;his daughters&quot; cannot be justified unless there was at least one additional daughter who arrived in Egypt. This would be Yocheved. The Torah did not include Yocheved in the names of the people who journeyed to Egypt with Jacob since we have already explained that Jacob himself was the one who made up the number 33. There could be an additional reason why Yocheved was not included in the count. Seeing that she was only born when the family arrived in Egypt she would not be a viable human being until thirty days had elapsed. Up until that time she was still in the category of a נפל, an aborted embryo. Do not be bothered by the fact that our explanation appears to contradict that of our sages. We have explained to you repeatedly that whenever the exegesis of our sages does not imply halachic consequences scholars of established reputations are allowed to disagree. Concerning such instances we read in Song of Songs 5,16: חכו ממתקים וכלו מחמדים, &quot;the words of his palate are sweet and He is all delight.&quot;</p>

              <p>ואלה שמות בני ישראל הבאים מצרימה יעקב ובניו, “and these are the names of the children of Israel who arrived in Egypt, Yaakov and his sons.” All the three patriarchs were called “Israel,” (Bereshit Rabbah 63,3). At this point Yitzchak is called “Israel” by the Torah as we read: that the “children of Israel” were none other than “Yaakov and his sons.” This verse clearly indicates that Yitzchak too was called “Israel.” We find proof that Avraham was also called “Israel” in Exodus 12,40: “and the length of time the Israelites had stayed in Egypt was 430 years.” We know that the calculation of the 400 years of which G’d spoke in Genesis 15,13 commenced with the birth of Yitzchak. Seeing the Torah refers to “the children of Israel” at a time when the Israelites left Egypt this makes their founder Avraham also one of the “Israelites.” How else could they be described as the “children of Israel?” This is also why the Talmud (Kidushin 18) calls Esau an “heretic Israelite.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>In point of fact, Rabbi Sternbuch's assertion that our ancestors did not have the status of &quot;newly born children&quot; at Mount Sinai is a matter of some dispute. Rabbi Sternbuch's position echoes that of Maharal of Prague, Gur Aryeh, Parashat Va-Yigash (Genesis 46:8), cited by the author of Shev Shem'atata in section 9 of his introduction to that work. Maharal of Prague is of the opinion that, unlike subsequent proselytes, the recipients of the Torah at Mount Sinai did not acquire status as &quot;newly born children&quot; and, accordingly, they were forbidden to marry close relatives. However, Maharal offers a rationale entirely different from that advanced by Rabbi Sternbuch in explaining why those who became Jews at Mount Sinai were not deemed to be &quot;newly born children.&quot; Acceptance of the commandments at Sinai is described by the Gemara, Shabbat 88a, as having been coerced. Status as &quot;newly born children,&quot; asserts Maharal, is acquired only when acceptance of commandments is voluntary. Nevertheless, R. Meir Simchah of Dvinsk, Meshekh Hokhmah, Parashat Va-Etḥanan (Deuteronomy 5:27), espouses an opposing view in declaring that previously existing consanguineous relationships were not terminated at Sinai as evidenced by the fact that all participants were directed, &quot;Return to your tents&quot; (Deuteronomy 5:27), i.e., they were granted permission to resume conjugal relations prohibited in the preparatory period before receiving the Torah at Mount Sinai. Indeed, Meshekh Hokhmah points to that directive as the biblical source of the talmudic dictum &quot;A proselyte who converts is comparable to a newly born child.&quot; (See R. Zalman Nehemiah Goldberg, Teḥumin, V, 255, note 5.) </p>

              <p>And this prohibition is practiced in every place and at all times by males and females. And one who transgresses it and makes himself a clairvoyant in one of the ways from all the matters we have mentioned or in another matter, and tells people things that he sees through his clairvoyance, is liable for lashes — and that is when he does some act in the thing, as we do not administer lashes without an act. But one who asks [something] from a clairvoyant is not under the liability of lashes. Nonetheless, very disgusting is anyone who fixes his thoughts or expends his time on these vanities. As it is not appropriate for one whom God has graced with knowledge and given the true religion as an inheritance to think about these vanities. Rather, he should fix his thoughts on the service of the Creator, may He be elevated, and not fear the words of the clairvoyant; since God, in His kindnesses will change the system of the stars, and nullify the power of the constellations, [so] as to do good to His pious ones. And it is known that we are the holy people, such that we are not under [the power of] a star or constellation — “the Lord is our inheritance, as He spoke to us.” And [it is] like the matter that we found with the forefathers, that God placed their stature above the ministers above: Like that which is written about Yaakov, “but rather Yisrael will be your name” (Genesis 35:10), “for you have dominated (sarita) with powers, etc.” (Genesis 32:29); meaning that God made him a minister (sar) over the [celestial] ministers. And so [too,] is Yitschak called Yisrael, as it is stated (Genesis 46:8), “these are the Children of Israel that were coming to Egypt, Yaakov and his children.” And so [too,] Avraham is called Yisrael, as we wrote in the Introduction of the book. And this is [the meaning of] what is written about the matter of the disagreement of the prophet, Eliyahu, with the prophets of Baal, as is stated (I Kings 18:31), “like the number of tribes of the children of Yaakov,” whose name was called Yisrael: As he was rebuking them [about] why they were leaving the service of the Master, the Lord of Hosts, who has in His hand to nullify all the actions of the powers and the constellations; and like the matter that He did with the forefathers, such that He put the constellations under their hand. And that is [the meaning] of its stating in that place (I Kings 18:31), “like the number of tribes of the children of Yaakov, to whom was the word of the Lord, saying, ‘Yisrael will be your name,’” — meaning to say, that He made him a minister over the [celestial] ministers, to change their system and their power with his merit. [This is] meaning to say, Israel, who are the children of Yaakov, are also ministers over the celestial ministers; and hence it would be fitting for them to not worship anything besides God alone. And so did we find with Yehoshua, who decreed to the sun and the moon to stand — as it is written in Joshua 10:12, “Sun, be still in Giveon, moon in the Ayalon Valley” — and they stood. And so [too,] several pious ones of Israel who changed the system of the constellations [and their power] with their merit. The matter would [take too] long, to bring [the] several stories that happened in Israel about this matter.</p>

When Cain arose and killed his brother, He ascended from the first firmament to the second; when the generation of Enoch angered Him, He ascended from the second to the third; when the generation of the flood perverted His teaching, He ascended from the third to the fourth; when the generation of the separation (i.e., the Tower of Babel) became arrogant, He went from the fourth to the fifth sphere; when the Sodomites behaved immorally, He went from the fifth to the sixth; and when Amraphel and his companions appeared, He ascended from the sixth to the seventh. However, after Abraham came and performed good deeds, the Shekhinah descended from the seventh to the sixth firmament; after Isaac He went from the sixth to the fifth; after Jacob from the fifth to the fourth; after Levi, his son, from the fourth to the third; after Kohath the son of Levi, from the third to the second; after Amram from the second to the first; and on the day that Moses erected the Tabernacle: The glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle (Exod. 40:34). Scripture states: For the upright shall dwell in the land (Prov. 2:21). This should be read: “They caused the Shekhinah to dwell in the land.”</p>

              <p>Another matter, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances,” Rabbi Abahu said: Every place where ve’eleh is written, it adds to the previous matter, and every place that eleh is written it rejects the previous matter. How so? “This is [eleh] the legacy of the heavens and the earth on the day that they were created” (Genesis 2:4). What did it reject? He had been creating heavens and earth and examining them. They were not pleasing to Him, and He would restore them to emptiness and disorder. When He saw this heavens and earth, they were pleasing to Him. He said: “This is the legacy of the heavens and the earth,” but what came before was not a legacy.  Similarly, “this is [eleh] the legacy of Noah” (Genesis 6:9). What did it reject? It rejected the generation of Enosh, the generation of the Flood, and Keinan and his counterparts. Therefore it says: “The sons of Yefet, Gomer and Magog” (Genesis 10:2). (The Torah enters into great detail when enumerating the descendants of Noah, but not with the preceding generations.)   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:12), adds to the previous matter. Who are they? What is written beforehand, as it is stated: “She bore him (Ketura bore for Abraham.)  Zimran and Yokshan” (Genesis 25:2). Here, too, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Ishmael son of Abraham…the firstborn of Ishmael is Nevayot” (Genesis 25:12–13). They were wicked like them. (The sons of Ishmael were wicked like the sons of Ketura. )   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy [toledot] of Isaac son of Abraham” (Genesis 25:19) adds to the previous matter, to what was written beforehand: “The sons of Ishmael” (Genesis 25:16). Who was it? It was Esau and his sons, for he was a son of Isaac. If so, it may be said that since only “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy” is written, Jacob, too, who was part of the legacy of Isaac, is included with Esau? You find that every [time the word] toledot appears in the Bible it is written defectively, (It is written without a vav between the tav and lamed or without a vav between the dalet  and the tav.)  except for: “This is the legacy [toledot] of the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 2:4), and “this is the legacy [toledot] of Peretz” (Ruth 4:18). And there is a compelling reason why it says: “This is the legacy [toledot] of the heavens and the earth” in full. It is because the Holy One blessed be He created His world and there was no angel of death in the world. That is why it is complete. When Adam and Eve sinned, the Holy One blessed be He minimized all the toledot in the Bible. When Peretz arose, his toledot became full, because the Messiah will emerge from him, in whose days the Holy One blessed be He will eliminate death, as it is stated: “He will eliminate death forever” (Isaiah 25:8). That is the reason that toledot of the heavens and earth and toledot of Peretz are full. This is the reason that toledot of Isaac is defective, to exclude Jacob from the category of the wicked. (The Messiah can also be traced back to Jacob, and therefore the word toledot should have been written regarding Isaac with the vav. It is written without the vav as an indication that it is referring only to Esau and not to Jacob. )   Similarly, “this is [eleh] the legacy of Jacob” (Genesis 37:2), it rejected the chieftains of Esau.  Similarly, “these are [ve’eleh] the names of the children of Israel” (Exodus 1:1), adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: The children of Reuben and the children of Simeon. (This is a reference to the listing of the descendants of Jacob who came down to Egypt (see Genesis 46:8–27). )   Similarly, “this is [ve’eleh] the legacy of Aaron” (Numbers 3:1) adds to the previous matter. Who were they? Those who were written beforehand: “These are the counted, that Moses and Aaron…counted” (Numbers 1:44). Just like those beforehand were righteous, so, too, these were righteous. (Although the verses regarding Aaron proceed to list Nadav and Avihu, who were killed due to the offering of a strange fire before God (see Numbers 3:2–4), on the whole they were still considered righteous. )   Here, too, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances” adds to the previous matter, that which was written beforehand: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances” (Exodus 15:25).  Another matter, “these are [ve’eleh] the ordinances.” What is written before this portion? “They shall judge the people at all times” (Exodus 18:22). And it says here: “These are the ordinances,” and the [Ten] Commandments are in the middle. This is analogous to a noblewoman who was walking, an armed guard on this side and an armed guard on that side, and she was in the middle. So, too, the [giving of the] Torah had justice before it and justice after it and it was in the middle. Likewise it says: “I walk on the path of righteousness” (Proverbs 8:20). The Torah says: In which path do I walk? I will walk in the path of those who perform righteousness. “In the midst of the paths of justice” (Proverbs 8:20), the Torah in the middle and justice before it and after it; before it, as it is stated: “There He instituted for it statutes and ordinances,” justice after it, as it is stated: “These are the ordinances.”</p>

              <p>Why did the Midrash have to mention that Abraham's name was Abraham? Why did the Midrash have to mention that Jacob was called Israel? Both of these facts are recorded in the Torah explicitly! Another difficulty is that since the patriarchs are viewed as a group, why are Jacob and Isaac not also called Abraham? Neither, for that matter, do we find Abraham called Isaac? Why does the Midrash quote the verse from the beginning of the book of Exodus instead of quoting from Parshat Vayigash in which the descent of all the family of Jacob to Egypt is recorded? We find the identical wording to that in Exodus in Genesis 46,8. From that verse it is easier to conclude that Isaac was called Israel than from the verse in Exodus 1,1, since the stress in that latter verse is on the words את יעקב באו, they had come with Jacob. Rabbi Natan's statement emphasizing its profound meaning is puzzling. What profundity is there in his statement?</p>

            <summary>Rashi explains that Levi's descendants were counted from a month old onwards, with Jochebed being born in Egypt but not conceived there, and her birth making up the number of seventy. Shimon and Levi are shown to have different approaches to intermarriage, with Shimon's wife being a Canaanite. Yaakov's arrival brought blessings to Lavan, increasing his flock from 70 to 600,000 or 1.2 million. Rashi questions the need to count the Bnei Yisrael again, while Ramban explains the significance of Jacob being referred to as both Jacob and Israel as his descendants multiply in Egypt.</summary>

Even Lavan himself acknowledged this when he said: in verse 27 נחשתי ויברכני ה' בגללך, “I have been divinely inspired to realise that G’d has blessed me on your account.” According to Bereshit Rabbah 73,8, originally Lavan had handed Yaakov only 70 animals to tend and these had increased by that time to 600.000. Another opinion claims that Lavan’s flocks now amounted to 1,2 million sheep. The number 70 is arrived at by comparing the expression מעט “a few,” in this verse with Deut 26,5 where the meaning of the word is a reference to the 70 people who descended to Egypt with Yaakov at the time the Israelites had left the land of Canaan (Genesis 46,8).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND HE SAID, JACOB, JACOB. After G-d had told him, Thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name, (Above, 35:10.)  it would be proper that He call him by this glorious name, and so he is indeed mentioned three times in this section. (In Verses 1, 2 and 5.)  However, He called him Jacob in order to hint that now he will not contend with G-d and men and prevail, [as the name Israel indicates], (Above, 32:29.)  but he will be in a house of bondage until He will also bring him up again, since the exile now begins with him. This is the meaning of the verse, And these are the names of the children of Israel who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons, (Verse 8 here.)  for they would come there with the appellation, “children of Israel,” since the children would multiply and increase there and their name and glory would extend. However, he is “Jacob” when descending thereto. The reason why Scripture mentions Er and Onan (Verse 12 here.)  together with the children of Israel who came into Egypt, (See Ramban above, 38:8.)  [although they had already died, as clearly stated in Verse 12]; is due to a secret which can be known from the words we have already written. (See Ramban above, 38:8.)  The learned student [of the mystic lore of the Cabala] will understand this, as well as the meaning of the entire Verse [12]. Scripture likewise mentioned them among those numbered (The intent of the Hebrew text may also be that Scripture likewise mentions them “in the book of Numbers,” thus giving this sentence the same format as Ramban’s next sentence, “And in the book of Chronicles….”)  in the desert: The sons of Judah: Er and Onan; and Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Judah after their families were, etc. (Numbers 26:19-20.)  And there, in the book of Chronicles, Scripture enumerates them in another count: The sons of Judah: Er, and Onan and Shelah; which were born unto him of Bath-shua the Canaanitess…And Tamar his daughter-in-law bore him Perez and Zerah. All the sons of Judah were five. (I Chronicles 2:3-4. This is difficult to understand. Since two of his sons died prior to the birth of the youngest two, how does Scripture conclude that they totalled five? Thus there is here also an allusion to that which was referred to above.) </p>

Genesis 46:27 and Rashi thereon), because if you count their number (as set forth in Genesis 46:8—27) you will find that they were one short of seventy, and it was she whose name is not mentioned there who made up the number seventy (cf.

              <p>Though Ya’akov metes out the same warning to both brothers, one can see the possibility that Shimon and Levi are not completely of one mind about intermarriage already in Bereshit. (See Netziv, Bereshit 34:25, who differentiates between the two brothers’ approaches in their zealotry toward Shechem.)  In the list of Ya’akov’s family (Bereshit 46:8-27), there is no mention of his sons’ wives, with two exceptions – one is Yosef, whose wife is already identified due to the unusual circumstances of his marriage. The other is Shimon, whose sixth child is cryptically known as Shaul the son of the Canaanite woman (Bereshit 46:10). Who this woman is and whether she is really a Canaanite (See, for example, Rashi, Bereshit 46:10, who, basing himself on Bereshit Rabba 80:11, says that this is actually a reference to Dinah.)  is secondary; more important is that the Torah identifies Shimon as having a different approach to intermarriage from that of the rest of the brothers, including Levi.</p>

These people were quite numerous, including the twenty four thousand who died during the last year of the wanderings at Shittim as a result of sleeping with Moabite women and having worshipped the deity, Baal Peor of those women. Not a single one of the adult males who had left Egypt and who were alive during that debacle survived the march through the desert. (Numbers 26,64)</p>

        <summary>Simeon's marriage to a Canaanite woman resulted in the birth of Shaul, who was singled out in Scripture due to his mother's nationality, seen as a breach of tradition. In halakhah, the ovum donor is considered the halachic mother in cases of surrogate motherhood, as seen with Dinah, influencing maternal relationships by conception rather than birth. The land was apportioned to those standing on the Plains of Moav due to the destruction of six families, including Simeon's, who buried Dina in Canaan. Different interpretations suggest various sons of Jacob had different approaches to intermarriage, with Shimon and Judah possibly marrying Canaanite women. Simeon's sons are listed in Exodus 6:15, with Shaul being the son of a Canaanite woman according to Targum.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>בן הכנענית, “the son of a Canaanite woman.” This verse testifies to the fact that the respective wives of Yaakov’s sons were of Egyptian, Edomitic, and Midianite descent; the reason that this particular son of Shimon has been singled out as having been born of a Canaanite mother, is that his father is criticised for having married a Canaanite woman, something that had not been considered appropriate already since Avraham’s time. This is also why the premature death of Er and Onan, sons of Yehudah, had been mentioned. According to another interpretation, the reason why Er and Onan have been mentioned here altogether, although they died before the family descended to Egypt, is that if Yehudah had objected to Joseph’s sale, his brothers would have listened to him. [This leaves open the question of what happened to Yehudah’s third son Sheylah, who though apparently not having descended to Egypt, is not listed here by name, though he had the same two parents as Er and Onan. Ed.] G-d’s reasoning had been: you, Yehudah have not taken into account that you caused your father terrible grief by depriving him of Joseph, I will cause you grief at the time when he will rejoice by reminding you of two of your sons and their depriving, and mentioning this here in order to rekindle your pain.</p>

              <p>THE SON OF A CANAANITISH WOMAN. This proves that Jacob’s sons married Aramean, Egyptian, Edomite and Midianite women. (The fact that Scripture singles out Shaul as being the son of a Canaanitish woman indicates that only he was the son of a Canaanitish woman, but not the others mentioned here. That Simeon did wrong in marrying her is obvious since Abraham told his servant not to take a Canaanitish woman for Isaac, and Isaac told the same to Jacob.)  Shaul’s mother’s nationality is singled out in order to indicate that Simeon did wrong in marrying a Canaanitish woman. It is for this reason that Scripture records the death of Er and Onan (v. 12). Scripture records their demise in order to indicate that they died because they were the sons of a Canaanitish woman (Gen. 38:2). (The Canaanite women were evil. Er and Onan followed in their mother’s footsteps and were punished by God. Scripture thus mentions their death as an object lesson (Filwarg).) </p>

              <p>ושאול בם הכנענית, it appears that all of Yaakov’s sons abided by his aversion to intermarry with Canaanites. Even Shimon also honoured this tradition. However, after he had married a woman who was not a Canaanite and had had children by her, he married an additional wife who was a Canaanite. Shaul was a son of that second wife of his. Seeing that this had been a breach of the tradition, the Torah alludes to it in considering this son as the “son of the Canaanite woman.” Our sages on 34,26 took the view that Shimon had taken pity on his sister Dinah who had been raped by a Canaanite, and married her and the son from the rape was the one named Shaul.

    Ibn Ezra explains this puzzling statement by saying that this grandson of Yaakov was the only one born by a Canaanite mother, as none of his other sons married girls of Canaanite parentage.
    Rashi explains the phenomenon as an allusion to this Sha-ul being a son of Dinah who had been raped by the Canaanite Shechem. If so, we are confronted with another difficulty, i.e. how could Shimon marry a sister by his own mother? According to a Midrash [I have not found such a version. Ed.] the problem is resolved as it is presumed that Dinah’s fetus grew predominantly in Rachel’s womb. [The Torah reports Leah only as having “given birth” to Dinah, not as having been pregnant with her. (Genesis 30,21)]

              <p>“Saul the son of a Canaanite woman” [46:10]. The verse says that Jacob came with his household to Egypt. The children of Simeon also came and one son was called Saul, the son of the Canaanite woman. That is, Simeon and Levi took Dinah out of the house of Shechem and Hamor. Dinah did not want to leave, since she would not find a man who would take her as a wife. Simeon swore that he would take her as a wife and had a son with her who was called, Saul the son of the Canaanite woman. (Rashi, Genesis, 46:10.)  That is to say, because Dinah slept with the Canaanite, she was called the Canaanite woman. If you want to ask, how is it that he should take his sister as a wife? The explanation is that we find that with each son of Jacob, a female was born, and each one should marry that sister. The verse does not say this explicitly that they married their twins. It says, “All the persons belonging to Jacob who came to Egypt – his own issue, aside from the wives of Jacob’s sons” [46:26]. This means, all the souls who issued from his flesh and the wives of the children of Jacob. That is to say, one should understand that the wives of his children were not the children of Jacob, and in truth, they were born with the tribes. Each of the tribes took his twin as a wife. The souls were seventy and Jacob. With Jacob, there were seventy-one. So there were seventy elders over Israel in Egypt during the exile. Moses Our Teacher was seventy-one. So too, there were seventy nations in the world. Israel is over the seventy nations. There are also seventy angels around the Throne of Glory in Heaven and the Holy One is over them all.</p>

            <summary>The Tur explains that in a case of surrogate motherhood, the halachic mother is the ovum donor, as seen in the marriage of Shimon to Dinah. Dinah, conceived by Rachel but transferred to Leah's womb, was considered Rachel's daughter, allowing Shimon to marry her without violating halachic laws. This concept of defining motherhood by the woman whose egg forms the fetus is further supported by other sources such as Maharsha, Targum Yonatan, and Kotnot Or, indicating that maternal relationship is established by conception rather than birth, influencing halachic considerations in such cases.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>An argument based upon an aggadic source establishing the opposite conclusion was first advanced by R. Menasheh Grossberg, Sha'arei Torah, Sha'ar Menasheh, XV (5684), no. 3. The Gemara, Berakhot 60a, declares that Dinah was born a female as a result of Leah's prayers during her pregnancy. Knowing that Jacob would become the father of a total of twelve sons and not wishing her sister Rachel to bear their husband fewer sons than the maidservants, Bilhah and Zilpah, Leah prayed that her already conceived fetus be born a female. It is clear from the parallel narrative recorded in the Palestinian Talmud, Berakhot 9:3, that the phenomenon described by the Sages involved an in utero sex change. However, Targum Yonatan, Genesis 30:21, states that what transpired was not a sex change in Leah's fetus but a physical exchange of the fetus from the womb of Leah to the womb of Rachel and vice versa, i.e., Dinah was conceived by Rachel but transferred to the womb of Leah while Joseph was conceived by Leah and transferred to the womb of Rachel. (See also R. Chaim Yosef David Azulai, Devash le-Pi, ma‘arekhet ayin, s.v. ayin ha-ra. This view, attributed to a midrashic source, is also cited by Ba‘alei ha-Tosafot, Moshav Zekenim (London, 5719), Genesis 46:10 and in Peirush ha-Tur he-Arukh, Genesis 30:21. See also Meshekh Ḥokhmah, Parshat Va-Yeḥi, s.v. bnei Raḥel.)  Maharsha, Niddah 31a, asserts that this is also the correct interpretation of the narrative recorded in Berakhot 60a. The liturgical poem &quot;Even Hug,&quot; attributed to R. Eleazar ha-Kalir, which is included in the repetition of the amidah of Shaḥarit on the first day of Rosh ha-Shanah contains a passage predicated upon the identical premise: &quot;Zakhar lah yosher araḥot, ubar le-hamir be-veten aḥot; ḥushavah ke-ha-yom zikhrah le-he'aḥot, siluf Dinah bi-Yehosef le-hanḥot—God remembered her righteous ways and exchanged the fetus in the womb of her sister; on this day was considered her remembrance in reward for her sisterly affection (Or perhaps, “on this day was considered her remembrance to make her equal to her sister.”)  and the exchange of Dinah for Joseph was effected.&quot; Kotnot Or cites Targum Yonatan in resolving a question posed by R. Elijah Mizrahi in the latter's commentary on Genesis 46:10 with regard to the tradition which teaches that Simeon took Dinah as a wife. R. Elijah Mizrahi is troubled by the fact that even a Noachide is forbidden to marry his sister. Kotnot Or points out that only a maternal sister is forbidden to a Noachide; a half-sister who is a paternal sibling is permitted to a Noachide. Kotnot Or observes that, according to Targum Yonatan, Dinah was really the daughter of Rachel and hence not a maternal sister of Simeon. The implication of Kotnot Or's thesis is that the maternal relationship is established by conception rather than birth. (See also R. Yonatan ha-Levi Eibeschutz, Ha-Be’er, VIII (5693), no. 3. A position identical to that of Kotnot Or is espoused by Moshav Zekenim, Genesis 46:10 and tentatively advanced by Peirush ha-Tur he-Arukh, Genesis 46:10.) </p>

              <p>However, the Tur (Peirush Tur Ha’aroch on Bereishit 46:10) explains this midrash in a manner that seemingly indicates the exact opposite, that the ovum donor is the halachic mother in a case of surrogate motherhood. In analyzing the midrash (quoted by Rashi on Bereishit 46:10) that Shimon married his sister, Dinah, the Tur wonders why their union did not constitute incest. After all, Shimon and Dinah were both children of Leah, and marrying a maternal sister was prohibited even before the giving of the Torah. The Tur answers that, as quoted above from Targum Yonatan, Dinah began in Rachel’s womb. Even after she was switched to Leah’s womb, the Halachah still considered her to be Rachel’s daughter, so she and Shimon thus had different mothers. Before the Torah was given, one was allowed to marry a paternal half-sister. (Even nowadays, Noachide Law (Halachah pertaining to non-Jews) permits marrying a paternal half-sister, while a Jew may not marry any half-sister; see Vayikra 18:9, Rambam (Hilchot Melachim 9:5), and Rashi (Bereishit 20:12).)  Therefore, Leah’s son, Shimon, did not violate the Halachah when he married Rachel’s daughter, Dinah. We thus see that according to the Tur, the Halachah defines motherhood by the woman whose egg forms the fetus, even if another woman gives birth to the baby. Of course, Aggadic passages usually cannot serve as definitive halachic proofs. (See Yerushalmi (Pe’ah 2:4), Encyclopedia Talmudit (1:62), Teshuvot Yabia Omer (vol. 8, Even Ha’ezer 21:2), and Nishmat Avraham (3:17).)  Nevertheless, the Tur’s words merit serious halachic consideration, especially because he is explaining how to understand the story from a halachic perspective.</p>

              <p>וישאו אותו בניו, “His sons carried him, etc;” only his sons, not any of his grandsons as they had Canaanite mothers. We have read in the Talmud tractate Pessachim folio 50, “are we to assume that Yehudah’s wife (Genesis 38,2) was really a Canaanite, in spite of the fact that Avraham had gone to great length to insure that Eliezer would not select a Canaanite wife for his son Yitzchok? (Genesis 24,3 Yitzchok) Yitzchok had similarly instructed his son Yaakov. The answer given by the Talmud is that the word Canaanite also means: “trader,” and that the Torah told us in Genesis 38,2 that Yehudah’s wife was the daughter of a well known trader, named Shua. If you were to counter how this can be squared with the opinion expressed on Genesis 37,35 where we read about Yaakov’s “sons and daughters all trying to comfort Yaakov over the disappearance and presumed death of Joseph,” that all of Yaakov’s sons had twin girls born with them, so why did Yehudah not marry one of them or a granddaughter of Yaakov? We must assume that all of these twin daughters died prematurely so that the sons of Yaakov had no other option but to marry Canaanite girls. To the additional question why they could not at least have married the children of Shimon of whom we know that he had a son by a Canaanite woman (Genesis 46,10)? B‘reshit Rabbah 80,10 suggests that Shaul borne to Shimon was actually a son of Sh’chem who had raped Dinah; one opinion offered is that Shimon buried that offspring in the land of Canaan before the brothers descended to Egypt and that this is why he is referred to as son of a Canaanite. Getting back to the question why the grandsons of Yaakov were not part of the pall bearers, of the grandfather; Joseph did not wish to do anything that could arouse jealousies among them, some being biologically qualified others not; seeing that no one would be jealous of Ephrayim and Menashe who were princes, he did not object to their being pall bearers. (They would also be founding fathers of tribes in the future) Moreover, Rashi says that Levi was not among the pall bearers, as he would be carrying the Holy Ark. More questions are raised as to how Moses could carry the coffin of Joseph at the Exodus, seeing that he too was a Levite. A suggestion is offered that Joseph’s coffin, similar to the Holy Ark, did not actually need pall bearers as it carried itself, similar to the Holy Ark which is described as carrying its bearers.

              <p>וכל בנותיו, “and all of his daughters;” according to Rabbi Yehudah, twin sisters had been born for Yaakov with the birth of all of his sons. These had been married by their respective half-brothers, sons of different mothers. According to the opinion of Rabbi Nechemyah, all the sons married wives of Canaanite origin. If he were correct, why does the Torah in our verse not speak of “all his daughter-in-law?“ Rabbi Nechemyah, aware of this, would reply, that in the whole world daughters-in-law are referred to as daughters. (B‘reshit Rabbah 84,21) [Naomi, in the Book of Ruth, certainly is not described as calling her daughters-in-law, “daughters.” Ed.] It is difficult to understand Rabbi Nechemyah, as we all know to what length Avraham had gone to prevent Yitzchok from marrying a wife of Canaanite descent. Yitzchok too had commanded Yaakov not to marry a woman of Canaanite descent and had sent him all the way to Charan to avoid such a union. (Genesis 28,1) Nonetheless, Yehudah married a woman of Canaanite descent. (Genesis 38,2 ברת גבר תגרא, (daughter of a business man, according to Onkelos איש כנעני means business man, traveling salesman) Onkelos therefore accepts the view of Rabbi Yehudah, who said that twin daughters were born with all of Yaakov’s sons.) This is also how we have to understand Genesis 46,10: ושאול בן הכנענית, “and Sha-ul, son of a female merchant.” According to Rabbi Nechemyah’s approach to the subject, there is no need for what sound like far fetched solutions to our problem. The word כנעני or כנענית in either of the verses that bothered us, are simply understood as elsewhere in the Bible, as people of Canaanite descent. We do have a problem if we accept Rabbi Yehudah’s interpretation, an interpretation lacking specific sources in the written text. The Talmud, tractate Yumah folio 28, states that Avaraham had voluntarily observed all the commandments in the written and oral Torah, even including the rabbinic commandment known as eyruv tavshilin, a method of how to prepare food when the day after a festival is a Sabbath, and preparation of food on the festival for the Sabbath is not admissible. He is also supposed to have observed the law of yibbum, marrying the widow of a brother who died without having ever had any children. (Compare Genesis 38,8) where Yehudah, Er’s father, gave Er’s widow Tamar to Onan, his brother, as a wife, in order for him to become posthumously and vicariously a father. If these laws were operative prior to the Torah having been revealed at Mount Sinai to the Jewish people, how could Yaakov have married two sisters while the first sister had still been alive? Also, how could any of the sons of Yaakov have married their sisters? We could answer that although these laws were already known by tradition since Avraham’s time, they had not become obligatory until after revealed at Mount Sinai. Our forefathers were free to choose the parts of the commandments they wished to observe voluntarily even they had been privy to them through the Holy Spirit. When the Talmud in Pessachim, folio 119, tells us that in the future (afterlife) at the meal prepared by G–d for the righteous, that when Yaakov was being honoured presiding over the grace after the meal, he declined the honour, saying that seeing he had wed two sisters while both were alive, he was not worthy of that honour. Clearly he considered what he had done as having been improper. It is possible to argue that having been aware that what he had done would qualify for a penalty if he would do so after the revelation at Mount Sinai, he felt that he deserved at least a minor penalty. If he decided in favour of committing an act deserving of a minor penalty, he did so because he wished to marry only wives who were personally righteous, and these were hard to find, especially considering the age at which he had a chance to get married. As it turned out, even one of these two sisters who was a righteous woman did not by herself bore for him all the twelve tribes.</p>

              <p>וַיֵּ֣רֶד מִצְרַ֔יְמָה Vayered Mitzrayma: “He went down to Egypt.” This comes to teach us that when Jacob said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive! I must go and see him before I die.” (Gen. 45:28) it was his intention to go down to Egypt but to stop at the border. He thought that Joseph would come up and meet him there. Once Jacob saw Joseph, he would return to the land of Canaan. Immediately after the Torah states, “I will go and see him,” it states, “So Israel set out with all that was his…” (Gen. 46:10), meaning he took what he needed for the trip. It didn’t occur to him to take his herds, flocks, and his possessions, as it said afterwards. “That night God appeared to Jacob and said, “Don’t be afraid to go down to Egypt…” (Gen. 46:3 ) Thus, the statement, “Compelled by the word of God….” teaches us that he was then told that he must go down to Egypt. Only then does it state, “and they took along their livestock and the wealth that they had amassed in Canaan. Thus Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt:” (Gen. 46:6)</p>

              <p>ובני ישראל היוצאים מארץ מצרים, and the children of Israel who took part in the Exodus from Egypt. It is quite unclear what the Torah intended with these words. Rabbi Avraham ibn Ezra suggests that the Torah meant that many of the people who were being counted now had actually taken part in the Exodus. Even if he is correct, why would the Torah consider it necessary to tell us about this at this point? Moreover, who needed Rabbi Ibn Ezra to tell us this? It is quite clear that many of the people who were below the age of twenty at the Exodus must have been included in this census! After all, the decree that the generation of the Exodus were to die in the desert after the debacle with the spies had applied only to people who had already reached the age of twenty either at the time of the Exodus or at the time the spies came back with their report! Perhaps it was the intention of the Torah to inform us that the result of this census produced a number equal to that of the census at the time the Israelites left Egypt as opposed to the number which resulted at the time the Israelites were counted at the beginning of the Book of Numbers. At that time the total amounted to 603,550 whereas this time the total was 601,730. In other words, the number was slightly lower than it had been some 38 years ago. The message then would be that Moses was not obligated to hand over to Joshua the same number of fighting men he had been able to muster at the time when he counted them earlier. The important thing was that he could show that he did not hand over fewer men than at the time of the Exodus. The census did prove this. [You will recall that I pointed out that the number at the Exodus included at least approx. 20.000 Levites so that Moses handed over far more men than he had at the time. Ed.] Another meaning of the words in question may be this: The number i.e. the census of Israelites on this occasion followed the same pattern as it had when they left Egypt, i.e. according to the houses of the respective tribal heads; Reuben according to the families of Chanoch, Phalu, Chetzron, and Carmi. Similarly, Shimon according to its tribal heads, i.e. Nemuel, Yamin, Yachin, Zerach and Shaul. This was in contrast to the count at the beginning of the Book of Numbers where the families of the tribes are not featured separately at all.</p>

              <p>בת איש כנעני , “the daughter of a Canaanite man of distinction.” According to Onkelos the word כנעני in this instance refers to a merchant, a trader. Yehudah was certainly true to the tradition of his fathers not to marry girls of Canaanite descent. The respective wives of all the brothers may be presumed to have been of Egyptian descent or of Moabite and Ammonite descent respectively, neighboring peoples who were not from Canaanitic stock. The brothers may also have married descendants of Ishmael or Keturah, Avraham’s second wife who had born him six sons. This is the reason that we are told in 46,10 amongst the list of sons of Shimon that there was someone who is described as שאול בן הכנענית, “Saul the son of a Canaanite woman.” Even when the Torah was so explicit, our sages (Bereshit Rabbah 80:11) still explained that that woman was not a true Canaanite, claiming that the “Canaanite woman” was none other than Dinah who had been raped by a Canaanite and that Shimon had married her and had adopted the son she bore as a result of this rape.</p>

              <p>THE EMIM ABODE THEREIN FORMERLY etc. “You [Moses] might think that this is the land of the Rephaim which I gave to Abraham (Genesis 15:20.)  because the Emim, who are Rephaim, dwelled there formerly, but this [the land of the Moabites] is not the land [that I promised to Abraham], because I drove out those Rephaim from before the children of Lot and settled them in place of the Rephaim. Those Emim were considered Rephaim, (In our texts of Rashi this is marked as a comment upon Verse 11: “They also were accounted Rephaim, even as the Anakim (giants).” This is interpreted by Rashi to mean: “The Emim who formerly lived in the lands of Ammon and Moab were accounted as Rephaim, that is, the Anakim, (giants). But those lands of Ammon and Moab were not the land of the Rephaim which I promised to Abraham.” Therefore Moses was not to wage war against the lands of Ammon and Moab.)  like Anakim (giants) who are called Rephaim [from the root raphoh — weak] because the hands of everyone who sees them become ‘weak.’ Emim [from the root eimah — fear] are so called because their ‘dread’ lays upon people.” This is Rashi’s language. And similarly he wrote [further, in connection with the land of Ammon of which Scripture states], That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: (Further, Verse 20.)  “because the Rephaim dwelled there formerly, but that [land] is not what I gave to Abraham.” But I wonder at the words of the Rabbi! Why should Scripture explain to us concerning the land of Ammon and Moab that it is not the land of Rephaim which He gave to Abraham? Was it to state that it was not due to Israel and was not part of the land which G-d swore to their fathers to give them? [That could not be the reason! On the contrary,] Scripture states only, because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession (Verse 19.)  meaning that, although it was part of Abraham’s inheritance, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave it to the children of Lot for Abraham’s sake. As Rashi himself wrote: (Here on Verse 5.)  “[The lands of] two nations [from among the ten nations originally given to Abraham — Genesis 15:19-21], I gave to the children of Lot [Ammon and Moab] as a reward because Lot went with Abraham to Egypt (Genesis 13:1.)  and kept silent concerning what Abraham said about his wife, ‘she is my sister.’” Moreover, the Rabbi himself wrote with reference to Esau: (Here on Verse 5.)  “[The lands of] ten nations (Ibid., 15:19-21: the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite; and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim; and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.)  I gave to Abraham. Seven of them will be yours. [Concerning the lands of] the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite — which are Ammon and Moab, and Mount Seir — one [i.e., Mount Seir] belongs to Esau, and two of them to the children of Lot.” And if so, the lands of Ammon and Moab, and Mount Seir were certainly of the inheritance of Abraham; why then did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Moses that he should not think that this [land of Ammon and Moab] is the land of Rephaim which was given to Abraham? What difference is there between [the lands of] the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite [which were promised to Abraham but given to the children of Lot and Esau], and [the land of] the Rephaim [which was also promised to Abraham]? (In other words, Rashi wrote of the lands of the Kenite, etc., that, notwithstanding the fact that they were of the inheritance of Abraham, they were still given to the children of Lot for the reason stated by Rashi that Lot protected Abraham’s secret in Egypt. Similarly we could say that the land of the Rephaim, too, was originally destined for Abraham, but that G-d gave it to another nation. Therefore, on what does Rashi base his assertion that this land was not the land of Rephaim promised to Abraham?)  Moreover, the expression Rephaim dwelled there ‘l’phanim’ (of old) (Further, Verse 20.)  indicates that it belongs to them because they dwelled there before anyone else, as in the verse ‘l’phanim’ (of old) Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth (Psalms 102:26.)  [thus raising another question on Rashi’s assertion: If the Rephaim lived there “of old,” why was this land given to the children of Lot]? But the interpretation of the verses is the opposite of the Rabbi’s [Rashi’s] words. It was because the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, Be not at enmity with Moab etc. because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession, (Verse 9.)  Scripture tells that the land was indeed due to the seed of Abraham except that He gave it to the children of Lot. Scripture further says that in that land there dwelled of old a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim, (Verse 10 before us.)  and, therefore, the Moabites called them ‘Emim’ (Verse 11.)  because of the great “dread” which they cast upon those who saw them. Now G-d, in honor of Abraham, performed a miracle for the children of Lot. They defeated [the Emim] and drove them from before them; it is therefore not proper to take from them by force the land which G-d gave them through a miracle. ‘Yeichashvu’ [They were also ‘yeichashvu’ Rephaim] (Verse 11.)  is an expression of importance and esteem, similar to the following: he was despised, and we did not ‘chashavnuhu’ (esteem him); (Isaiah 53:3.)  who shall not ‘yachshovu’ (regard) silver?; (Ibid., 13:17.)  for how little is he ‘nechshav’ (esteemed)? (Ibid., 2:22.)  and so many others. And in the language of the Sages we find the expression adam chashuv (an esteemed person). (Berachoth 19a.)  This is why Scripture placed the statements in proximity to [the verse that discussed the lands of Ammon and Moab, the children of Lot]. And in Seir the Horim abode formerly. (Verse 12.)  It declares that for the same reason He stated [for restraining Israel from attacking] Moab, He likewise withheld them [Israel] from attacking the land of Seir. Because formerly it also belonged to the Horim, and it was part of the gift to Abraham — for the Horite is identical with the Hivite, and they [the Hivites] were of the children of Canaan, as it is said, Esau took his wives of the daughters of ‘Canaan’ etc. and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon ‘the Hivite’ (Genesis 36:1.)  and Zibeon was of the sons of Seir ‘the Horite,’ the inhabitants of the land. (Ibid., Verse 20.)  So, also, wherever the inheritance of Israel is mentioned, the Hivite is always included with the Canaanite among the seven nations, (See further, 7:1, etc.)  because the Hivite is enumerated as the sixth son among the children of Canaan. (See Genesis 10:17.)  You will also see this in the narrative of the war of Amraphel which he fought against the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zebaiim, and Zoar, (See ibid., 14:8-9.)  who were Canaanite kings. They [Amraphel and his associates] smote ‘the Rephaiim’ in Ashteroth-karnaim, (Ibid., Verse 5.)  and ‘the Horite’ in their mountain, Seir, (Ibid., Verse 6.)  for the Horite and the Rephaim belonged to the Canaanite kings. It is possible that [the Horite] was called Hivite [from the term chivi — a snake] because he was like a serpent in the way. (Ibid., 49:17.)  He was also called the Horite from the noun ‘chor’ (the hole of) the asp. (Isaiah 11:8.)  For names [like Horite, Hivite] preserve the meaning and change letters, like Zerach (Zerah) (Numbers 26:13. The Hebrew word Zerach means “shining.”)  and Tzochar (Zohar), (Exodus 6:15. Tzochar and Zerach both are names for the same son of Simeon.)  of the expression: and ‘tzochar’ (white) wool; (Ezekiel 27:18.)  ‘tzchoroth’ (white) asses, (Judges 5:10. Ramban thus shows that the names Zerach and Tzochar (from the words “shining” and “white”) both refer to the same person although the letters in the names interchange.)  [and in the case of the Horite and Hivite, the names were chosen to suggest the treacherous, snake-like nature of the people]. They also assign new names to praise [someone]. Thus the name Ya’akov (Jacob), an expression of guile or of deviousness, (Genesis 27:36. — Ibid., 32:29 [Jacob’s name changed to Israel].)  was changed to Israel [from the word sar (prince)] and they called him Yeshurun (Jeshurun) (Further, 32:15.)  from the expression whole-hearted ‘v’yashar’ (and upright). (Job 1:1.)  Thus Scripture is stating that the Horites [whose land was] given to Abraham (Since the Horites are identical with the Hivites, as explained above, and the Hivites were children of Canaan, and the Canaanite is among the ten nations whose lands were given to Abraham (Genesis 15:21), it follows that the land of the Horites was given to Abraham.)  dwelled formerly in Seir, and the children of Esau who are of the seed of Abraham succeeded them and dwelled in their stead by a miraculous event. The Horites were a populous nation in their land and the children of Esau came to dwell there and overpowered them just as Israel did to the remaining nations [in the land that was] promised to Abraham, that G-d gave them in His great power. Thus G-d divided [the lands of] all these [ten] nations among the seed of Abraham — one to Esau, and the balance to Israel who was the firstborn son. (See Exodus 4:22.)  It is therefore not proper to steal from Esau what G-d caused him to inherit, since G-d would be angry with anyone who would forcibly take from him [Esau] the inheritance that He, blessed be He, caused him to inherit, just as He would be wroth with him who would forcibly take the Land from Israel after He caused him [Israel] to inherit it, just as it says, As for all Mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit. (Jeremiah 12:14.)  This is the sense of the expression mentioned here, as Israel ‘did’ unto the Land of his inheritance, (Verse 12. This would seem to indicate that at the time that Esau conquered his land, Israel had already conquered theirs. But Israel had, at that time, not taken possession of any land.)  when it was not yet done! [But the meaning thereof is as explained: that just as G-d would be wroth with him who would rob Israel of his inheritance after He will have given it to him, in the same way, He does not give Israel the right to take the land of Esau after having given it to him.] Similarly He further said with reference to [the land of] the children of Ammon that it is of the land of the Rephaim [which G-d gave to Abraham] (Genesis 15:20.)  for that, too, belonged first to the Rephaim. The Ammonites called them Zamzummim, (Further, Verse 20.)  from the expression ‘z’mamo (his evil scheme) do not further, (Psalms 140:9.)  except that [the letters zayin and mem] are doubled [in the name “Zamzummim”], which thus indicates “the people from whom nothing is withheld which they purpose to do.” (See Genesis 11:6.) </p>

              <p>L’ZERACH’ (OF ZERAH). “He is [identical with] ‘Tzochar’ [Zohar — mentioned in Genesis 46: 10 as one of the sons of Simeon who went down to Egypt], and it [the name Zerach (Zerah)] is an expression meaning tzohar [‘shining,’ which is also the meaning of Zerach]. But the family of Ohad [the other son of Simeon mentioned ibid., in Genesis] became extinct. Similarly five families of the tribe of Benjamin [had by now ceased to exist], for he [Benjamin] went down to Egypt with ten sons, (Genesis 46:21.)  and here (Further, Verses 38-39.)  Scripture only counts five.” This is Rashi’s language. And Rashi has furthermore written: (In Verse 24.)  “All the families were called by the names of those [of their ancestors] who went down to Egypt, but those who were born after that time were not called families [in their own right and their own names], except for the families of Ephraim and Menasheh, both of whom were born in Egypt, and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela the son of Benjamin. (Further, Verse 40. The meaning of Rashi is as follows: Since Ard and Naaman are mentioned in Genesis 46:21 among the sons of Benjamin who went down to Egypt, and here in Verse 40 they are referred to as sons of Bela, who was himself a son of Benjamin, we must perforce say that the ones referred to here were not the same as those mentioned there [but had the same names]. Furthermore we must perforce say that the Ard and Naaman mentioned here were not amongst those who went down to Egypt, for otherwise Scripture would have mentioned them there in Genesis, in the same way that it counts the grandchildren of Judah and Asher. This is the meaning of Rashi when he wrote: “except for the families of Ephraim and Menasheh, both of whom were born in Egypt, and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela the son of Benjamin.” However, the question then arises: why are Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela, counted here, since they were not amongst those who went down to Egypt? In other words, why were they an exception to the rule? To answer this question Rashi quotes the statement which he found in the work of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher.)  And I have found [it written] in the work of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher (See above in Seder Naso, Note 146.)  that their mother [that of Ard and Naaman — i.e., the wife of Bela] went down to Egypt when she was already pregnant with them [and therefore they formed separate families, since they are also included amongst ‘those who went down’ to Egypt]. Now if this is a tradition, well and good. But if not, I say that Bela had many children, but from each of these two, Ard and Naaman, there came forth a large family, [and therefore they formed families in their own right and in their own names], whereas the descendants of the other sons were called by Bela’s name, and [only] the descendants of these two [Ard and Naaman] were called after their [own] names.” All this is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi], of blessed memory. But I am astonished at [the words of] Rashi. For the difficulty [raised by Rabbi Moshe the Preacher] is not that Scripture counts the family of the Belaites by itself, (Further, Verse 38.)  and [nonetheless counts also] the families of the Ardites and the Naamites his sons, by themselves, (Ibid., Verse 40.)  for that was [indeed] because they became [large] families, as the Rabbi [Rashi] has said. This is the way of Scripture, as in the case of the children of Judah [where it counts Hezron and Hamul, who were grandchildren of Judah, as forming families by themselves], (Verse 21. Hezron and Hamul were the sons of Perez, who was the son of Judah. Although Perez himself formed a family (Verse 20), the verse nonetheless counts independently the two families formed by his sons Hezron and Hamul.)  and [likewise] the children of Menasheh and Ephraim, (Verses 29-32; 36. There too, the grandchildren [and even great-grandchildren] are counted as separate families.)  and likewise the children of Asher. (Verses 44-45. Asher’s grandchildren are counted as separate families.)  However, if we say that Ard and Naaman were born to Bela, the son of Benjamin, after they went down to Egypt, they should not have been counted here as [separate] families! (Ramban’s meaning is as follows. Rashi seems to have understood that Rabbi Moshe the Preacher found it difficult to understand why Ard and Naaman are mentioned as forming separate families, since their father Bela is also mentioned as forming a separate family. To answer this, Rabbi Moshe gave the explanation that their mother was already pregnant with them when she went down to Egypt ; and Rashi himself [because he questioned the authenticity of that tradition] gave a different reason, i.e., that they formed large families in their own right. Ramban is saying that Rabbi Moshe’s difficulty was not why Scripture mentions them as forming separate families, because the answer to that question is clearly that they had large families, which were worthy of constituting separate families and hence were not included in Bela’s family. That this is so we see clearly from the examples of Judah, Menasheh, Ephraim and Asher, as Ramban points out. Yet Rabbi Moshe did not ask about the children of these people, but only about Ard and Naaman, the children of Bela! Clearly this is because Scripture only counts as separate families the children of those who went down to Egypt, [e.g. Judah and Asher] or who were already there when Jacob went down [e.g. Menasheh and Ephraim]. But in the case of Ard and Naaman, there is a difficulty, whether we say that they went down to Egypt with Jacob or not, [as explained further on in Ramban], and it is this difficulty which Rabbi Moshe the Preacher was trying to answer. The question whether they went down to Egypt with Jacob depends, of course, on when they were born. For if we say that they were born to Bela after he went down to Egypt, the question arises: Why are they counted here as separate families, since only those who were among the seventy souls who went down to Egypt with Jacob are counted here as separate families? And if they were born before Jacob’s family went down to Egypt, then since they are not mentioned in Genesis, the total number of people who went down must have been seventy-two, so why does Scripture omit them and count only seventy? In brief it was this difficulty that Rabbi Moshe the Preacher had in understanding the verses, a difficulty which applies only to Ard and Naaman, and not as Rashi assumed his question to be, which would apply to other cases as well.)  And should we say that [Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela] were born to him before [he went down to Egypt], then [the family of Jacob] would consist of more than seventy souls, for then the sons of Benjamin were ten (Genesis 46:21.)  apart from these two sons of Bela [thus the overall total of people who went down to Egypt would be seventy-two, whereas Scripture there only mentions a total of seventy]! (Genesis 46:27.)  It was for this reason [and not for the reason implied by Rashi’s explanation] that Rabbi Moshe the Preacher explained that their mother [the wife of Bela] was already pregnant with them [Ard and Naaman, when the family of Jacob went down to Egypt], and [since they were not yet born] they are not counted there [in the Book of Genesis], but here they are included (Ibid., Verse 40.)  among those born [before the descent into Egypt, because their mother was already pregnant with them when they went into Egypt]. Now if this is a tradition [of the Rabbis, that Bela’s wife was pregnant with Ard and Naaman when she went down into Egypt], we will force ourselves to accept it despite its difficulty. (The difficulty is that in Genesis 46:8-27 the verses do not mention Ard and Naaman amongst the seventy souls that came into Egypt, because although their mother came into Egypt when she was pregnant with them, they were not yet born and thus one cannot say that they ”came into Egypt.” Yet here they are counted as forming separate families, although only the families of those that came into Egypt are counted as separate families, and the reason is because they “came into Egypt” since their mother was pregnant with them! Thus there is an apparent contradition! Furthermore, we will have to differentiate between the case of Jochebed and that of Ard and Naaman, as will be explained further on.)  We will also have to say that Jochebed (See Genesis 46:15 (Vol. I, pp. 554-558.))  was born [whilst they passed] through the walls [of the border-city of Egypt], on the very day that they entered into [Egypt], and therefore she is included amongst the seventy souls [that came into Egypt], whereas these [Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela] were born some months [after Jacob’s family had come to Egypt, and therefore they are not included amongst the seventy souls that came into Egypt with Jacob]! But if it is not a tradition of our Rabbis [but merely a personal opinion of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher] we will reject this theory of his with all our might. But we can say that Ard and Naaman, the sons of Benjamin [as mentioned in Genesis 46:21], died without children, and Bela [their brother] wanted to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, (Deuteronomy 25:7.)  and therefore he gave his sons the names of his brothers who had died. Perhaps Bela [actually] performed the rite of marriage with their wives, since he was the firstborn, (Genesis 46:21: And the sons of Benjamin: Bela etc. — The duty of marrying a childless brother’s wife falls primarily on the eldest of the remaining brothers ; if he refuses the duty devolves upon any other surviving brother (Yebamoth 39a).)  and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela [from these marriages] became heads of families to raise up a name (Deuteronomy 25:7.)  for Ard and Naaman the sons of Benjamin, who were amongst those that went down to Egypt. (Genesis 46:21.)  The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the Naaman and Ard (In Genesis 46:21 they are listed in the following order: And the sons of Benjamin: Bela … and Naaman … and Ard. Ramban now suggests that these two people who are mentioned there in Genesis as the “sons” of Benjamin, are in fact identical with the Ard and Naaman mentioned here in Verse 40, who are described as the sons of Bela, who was the son of Benjamin. Naaman and Ard were thus in fact the grandchildren of Benjamin, and it is the style of Scripture to describe grandchildren as children, as Ramban shows. This explains why Ard and Naaman are counted here as separate families in their own right, since they were amongst those who went down to Egypt [as stated explicitly in Genesis 46:21], and there is thus also no problem about how we reach the number of seventy souls who went down there. In other words, the Ard and Naaman mentioned there in Genesis [as the sons of Benjamin] and here in Verse 40 [as Benjamin’s grandsons] are identical persons.)  who are counted amongst the sons of Benjamin in the section of And these are the names etc., (Genesis 46:8-27.)  were in fact [not the real sons of Benjamin at all, but they were] the sons of his firstborn son Bela, as is stated explicitly here, (Ibid., Verse 40.)  and similarly Scripture counts them [as the sons of Bela] in the Book of Chronicles. (I Chronicles 8:3-4: And Bela had sons, Addar … and Naaman. Addar mentioned is synonymous with Ard.)  Such is the custom of Scripture to speak of grandchildren as children [and therefore in Genesis 46:21 the verse describes them as the ‘sons’ of Benjamin], just as it says, Laban the son of Nahor, (Genesis 29:5. Nahor was actually his grandfather, for Bethuel was his father. See Ramban ibid., Vol. I, p. 360.)  and in the Book of Chronicles it is written, The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram, and Uz, and Hul, and Gether and Meshech, (I Chronicles 1:17.)  although the last four were in fact his grandchildren! (Their father was Aram, the son of Shem — see Genesis 10:22-23.)  And even though Scripture did not treat the sons of Perez [as the “sons” of Judah, their grandfather, (The verse there (46:12) mentions that Perez was the son of Judah; and Hezron and Hamul, the sons of Perez.)  as it did in the case of Ard and Naaman], likewise [it did not treat] the sons of Beriah [as the “sons” of Asher, their grandfather, (The verse there (46:17) mentions that Beriah was the son of Asher, and Heber and Malchiel the sons of Beriah.)  as it did in the case of Ard and Naaman], — this may be because they [Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela], were born upon Benjamin’s knees (See Genesis 50:23.)  [i.e., he brought them up], and therefore they are considered his sons. This is then similar to [the verse], And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses, (Above, 3:1. The explanation of this verse quoted now by Ramban is found in Rashi ibid.)  [where the verse proceeds to mention only the sons of Aaron! The explanation given is that they were in actual fact only the sons of Aaron, but since Moses brought them up and taught them Torah, they are also called his children]. Or it may be that because Benjamin had many sons — for he had eight — therefore Scripture included the few [i.e., his two grandsons, Ard and Naaman] amongst the many [real sons, and therefore spoke of all ten as Benjamin’s sons]. And it is possible also that we suggest as a hypothesis that Scripture here does not count only the families of those who went down to Egypt, [as Rashi explained above], because [we see] that even those who were born in Egypt from that time onwards are also counted as families, such as Scripture does here in the case of [the families of] Ephraim and Menasheh [whose families are counted separately, even though they did not go down to Egypt with Jacob]. (Verses 29 and 35 here. Ephraim and Menasheh of course were not amongst those who went down to Egypt with Jacob, but were born to Joseph beforehand (see Genesis 48:5).)  It is not a [satisfactory] reason for Scripture to do so [as exceptions in their cases only], on the grounds that they were [already] in Egypt [and therefore are included as separate families together with all those who came down afterwards with Jacob], because it is at the time of the [actual] descent [into Egypt] that one ought to count them all in one number, and to make families out of the seventy souls [who actually went down with Jacob, and it is not correct to include Ephraim and Menasheh who were there but did not go down with the others]! (Ramban’s meaning is that since Scripture’s main purpose is to list the seventy people who “went down” to Egypt with Jacob, it ought to include only those who actually went down at that time. But in actual fact only sixty-eight went down, since Ephraim and Menasheh were already there! And one cannot suggest that an exception is made in their case, since Scripture always stresses the factor of actual descent, referring to the seventy souls who went down to Egypt. Hence we must say that in fact Scripture includes in its list not only those who actually went down to Egypt with Jacob, but also those who did not go down then, and even some who were born later, as explained further on. In that case we can understand that Ard and Naaman are included in the list, even though they were born later.)  Similarly Scripture always counts them [Ephraim and Menasheh] together with those who went down to Egypt, [such as in the verse]: Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons (Deuteronomy 10:22. This includes Joseph and his two sons, Menasheh and Ephraim (see Genesis 46:19-20), although they did not go down to Egypt with Jacob.)  So also the sons of Bela [Ard and Naaman] were born afterwards [i.e., after the descent into Egypt, and they are nonetheless counted here as separate families! This proves that the determining factor whether to count a family here separately, is not the criterion of whether its founder was amongst those who went down to Egypt with Jacob, as Rashi said, but must have been some other reason, as will now be explained]. But [we must say that] this matter was [as follows]. It was the custom in Israel [for people] to appoint over themselves “heads of fathers’ houses,” and all the descendants of that man would always trace their lineage back to him, and be called by his name in his honor; just as all the Arabs do to this very day, and as do all the Jews who live in their [the Arabs’] countries, calling themselves by family [names, such as] “Ibn Ezra,” or “Ibn Shushan.” This is the meaning of the verse which says, These are the heads of their fathers’ houses, (Exodus 6:14.)  for from the time that they were fruitful and multiplied (Ibid., 1:7.)  in Egypt, they established heads of families over themselves, to whom they would trace their lineage. Perhaps they initiated this practice in Egypt in order not to mingle themselves with the nations (Psalms 106:35.)  and so that they would be recognized and distinguishable among their tribes, [for it is there in Egypt] whither the tribes went up, even the tribes of the Eternal, as a testimony unto Israel, (Ibid., 122:4.)  and it became a custom in Israel. (Judges 11:39.)  Thus [all] those mentioned here [in this section] were, every one of them, heads of their fathers’ house in Egypt, from whom the family traced its descent. That is why Scripture counts in the house of Machir [the son of Menasheh]: the family of the Machirites and the family of the Gileadites his son, (Further, Verse 29.)  and the family of the Iezerites and that of the Helekites, (Ibid., Verse 30.)  the sons of Gilead and their [other] brothers. (I.e., Asriel, Shechem, Shemida, Hepher (Verses 31-32) — brothers of Iezer and Helek, and sons of Gilead.)  In a similar way [Scripture records] the children of Judah [and also counts Hezron and Hamul, who were the sons of Perez and grandsons of Judah, as separate families] (Further, Verse 21.)  and those of Ephraim, (Verse 36. There Eran, who was the son of Shuthelach and the grandson of Ephraim, is counted as forming a separate family, although his father Shuthelach is also mentioned there as founding a separate family.)  for these children mentioned were great and distinguished people, and became heads [of their families]. But [the reason for them being counted as separate families] is not because they [each] gave birth to a large family, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, because they all begot large families [even those who are not mentioned individually], since they were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty. (Ibid., 1:7.)  But [Scripture named separate families here] as a mark of honor, meaning that [the members of that particular family] had appointed [that person] as their head. Now most of the families when they were in Egypt traced their descent from those who went down to Egypt [with Jacob], because they considered them distinguished ancestors, and the others appointed for themselves heads of houses from those who were born there shortly after [Jacob’s descent to Egypt]. Therefore most of the [people] mentioned here [in this census as forming families] were [amongst] those who went down to Egypt [with Jacob], and therefore these families trace themselves back to those who came down [originally] to Egypt, because it was there that they established them [these people, as the heads of their family-groups].</p>

              <p>AND HIS HOST, AND THOSE THAT WERE NUMBERED OF THEM. The meaning thereof, as well as of all that were numbered of the camp of Judah, (Further, Verse 9.)  and so also all [such verses in this chapter], is that these are the words of G-d to Moses, connected with [the opening statement], And the Eternal spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, (Verse 1.)  since they did not count them now a second time. This is also the sense of the verse, These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel, (Further, Verse 32.)  because He stated [in that same verse] all that were numbered of the camps according to their hosts [which indicates that He is referring to a census which had previously taken place, and not to a new census]. He mentioned all this in order to tell us that from the day of the census [which was on the first of Iyar] (Above, 1:1.)  until the camps were established [according to the four standards] and they so pitched by the standards, and so they set forward (Further, Verse 34.)  [which was on the twentieth of Iyar], (Ibid., 10:11, and see Taanith 29a [“on that day they turned aside” and hence they became subject again to death])  not one man was missing. This was miraculous, in that not one person of this great multitude died [in the period of twenty days]. The change in the name of the father of the prince of the children of Gad [who is called Deuel above in 1: 14, and here in Verse 14 is referred to as Reuel], is because it is customary in the Sacred Language to change names of the same meaning, such as Zerah (I Chronicles 4:24.)  [one of the sons of Shimon], and Zohar (Genesis 46:10.)  [referring to the same son of Shimon, both names meaning “brightness”], of the expression as ‘tzachar’ (white) wool. (Ezekiel 27:18.)  Now [the father of the prince of the children of Gad] was called “Deuel” [of the root dei’ah, “knowledge”] because he “knew” G-d, [and he was also called] “Reuel” [of the root ra’ayon, “thoughts,” or re’uth, “longing” “striving”] because “he set all the thoughts of his heart on G-d,” similar to the expression in these verses: How weighty also are ‘rei’echa’ (Thy thoughts) unto me, O G-d; (Psalms 139:17.)  Thou understandest ‘l’rei’i’ (my thought) afar off. (Ibid., Verse 2.)  Since people used to call that person by two names [e.g. Deuel and Reuel], therefore the Torah mentioned both of them.</p>

              <p>Though Ya’akov metes out the same warning to both brothers, one can see the possibility that Shimon and Levi are not completely of one mind about intermarriage already in Bereshit. (See Netziv, Bereshit 34:25, who differentiates between the two brothers’ approaches in their zealotry toward Shechem.)  In the list of Ya’akov’s family (Bereshit 46:8-27), there is no mention of his sons’ wives, with two exceptions – one is Yosef, whose wife is already identified due to the unusual circumstances of his marriage. The other is Shimon, whose sixth child is cryptically known as Shaul the son of the Canaanite woman (Bereshit 46:10). Who this woman is and whether she is really a Canaanite (See, for example, Rashi, Bereshit 46:10, who, basing himself on Bereshit Rabba 80:11, says that this is actually a reference to Dinah.)  is secondary; more important is that the Torah identifies Shimon as having a different approach to intermarriage from that of the rest of the brothers, including Levi.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>שלשים שנה וארבע מאות שנה FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS — Altogether from the birth of Isaac until now were 400 years, and we must reckon from that event, for only from the time when Abraham had offspring from Sarah could the prophecy (Genesis 15:13) “Thy offspring shall be a stranger” be fulfilled; and there had been 30 years since that decree made at “the convenant between the parts” until the birth of Isaac. It is impossible to say that this means that they were 430 years in the land of Egypt alone, for Kohath was one of those who came into Egypt with Jacob (Genesis 46:11); go and reckon all his years and all the years of Amram his son and the whole eighty years of Moses, the latter’s son, until the Exodus and you will not find that they total to so many; and you must admit that Kohath had already lived many years before he went down to Egypt, and that many of Amram’s years are included in the years of his father Kohath, and that many of the 80 years of Moses are included in the years of his father Amram, so that you see that you will not find 400 years from the time of Israel’s coming into Egypt until the Exodus. You are compelled to admit, even though unwillingly, that the other settlements which the patriarchs made in lands other than Egypt come also under the name of “sojourning as a stranger” (גרות), including also that at Hebron, even though it was in Canaan itself, because it is said, (Genesis 35:27) “[Hebron] where Abraham and Isaac sojourned”, and it says, (Exodus 6:4) “[the land Canaan], the land of their sojournings wherein they sojourned”. Consequently you must necessarily say that the prophecy, “thy offspring shall be strangers… [four hundred years]” began only from the time when he had offspring. And only if you reckon the 400 years from the birth of Isaac will you find that from the time they came into Egypt until the time they left it, was 210 years (as alluded to in Genesis 15:13). This was one of the passages which they altered for king Ptolemy (Mekhilta; Megillah 9a).</p>

        <summary>Er and Onan's deaths in Canaan were due to their sins, highlighting the importance of purity and morality within Judah's family. Judah's failure to complete a mitzva led to negative consequences, as seen in the deaths of his sons and wife. The concept of substitution is exemplified through Tamar, Ruth, and David, showing how impurity can be redeemed and lead to purity. The descendants of Judah, such as Bezalel, were also linked to Judah's lineage, emphasizing the significance of their role in the divine plan.</summary>

            <summary>The inclusion of Er and Onan among the family members who traveled to Egypt is explained by the concept of levirate marriage, with Yehudah bringing Chetzron and Chamul as replacements for Er and Onan. The Torah emphasizes that Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan due to the prevalent sexual perversity, highlighting their unique status as members of the family from which the Messiah will descend. The divine protection of the family is contingent on purity and morality, as seen in the deaths of Er and Onan for their sins. Judah's children Er and Onan are counted among those who went to Egypt due to his sins and role in bringing about the exile.</summary>

              <p>ובני יהודה ער ואונן. And the sons of Yehudah, Er and Onan, etc. Why were people who had died already listed as part of the family which travelled to Egypt? Besides, why did the Torah repeat here again that these sons of Yehudah had died in the land of Caanan, something that we are all familiar with? Furthermore, why does the Torah write: ויהיו בני פרץ חצרון וחמול, instead of the customary ובני פרץ חצרון וחמול? We find all the other grand-children introduced as: ובני…וגו. Perhaps it is all connected with the concept of the levirate marriage. יבום is aimed at re-establishing a presence on earth for the brother who died without leaving children. In our instance Yehudah performed this commandment instead of his son Shelah. It was Yehudah's duty to bring Er and Onan's offspring to Egypt. The Torah tells us by means of an unusual syntax that Yehudah performed this duty by bringing Chetzron and Chamul (his grandchildren) to Egypt. These two were to be considered the replacements of Er and Onan respectively. [If I understand the author correctly, he argues that because Yehudah belonged to a generation prior to that of Shelah the surviving brother of Er and Onan who should have performed the levirate marriage, only the second generation, i.e. Peretz's children, were the reincarnates of Er and Onan. Had Shelah himself performed the rites of יבום, his first two children would have been considered as the reincarnates of Er and Onan. Ed.] All this is hinted at by the word ויהיו.</p>

              <p>Looking at the plain meaning of the verse, the Torah may have explained here that the only reason that Er and Onan committed the sins that caused G'd to kill them was that they lived in the land of Canaan, a country in which sexual perversity had taken root. They had been corrupted by their environment. Apart from this one sin they were not basically bad. G'd killed them so that one should not copy their example, much as the Torah warns the Jewish people not to copy the sexual perversions practiced both in Egypt and the land of Canaan in Leviticus 18,3.</p>

              <p>ובני יהודה ער ואונן ושלה ופרץ וזרח, “and the sons of Yehudah: “Er, Onan, Shelah, Peretz, and Zerach.” The verse includes the two sons Er and Onan, though already deceased, as amongst the seventy people of Yaakov’s family who migrated to Egypt. This is extremely puzzling. How could the Torah include those two amongst those described earlier as “arriving” in Egypt? The answer is provided by the kabbalists (who have elaborated on the theme of migration of the souls) and it is made clearer in Numbers 26,19 where the Torah wrote: “and the sons of Yehudah, Er and Onan; Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.” Immediately following that verse the Torah writes: “The sons of Yehudah according to their families were: Shelah, the family of the Shelanites; Peretz, the family of the Partzites; Zerach, the family of the Zarchites.” This is the mystical dimension of Ruth 4,15; “he (the new born Oved)” shall be for you as a life-restorer. This also explains why Naomi’s neighbours exclaimed at Oved’s birth “a son has been born to Naomi” (remember she had lost both her sons before either one had fathered a child). If not for the approach of the kabbalists, the prophet should have described Oved as having been born to Ruth instead of to Naomi.</p>

              <p>“Judah’s sons: Er, Onan” [46:12]. Hizkuni asks a question. Why does the verse have to count the children of Judah, Er and Onan, since they died before they went to Egypt? The explanation is, because Judah took a wife from foreigners. Therefore, he sinned, so that Er and Onan died. Therefore, the verse here counts Er and Onan among the children who came to Egypt. Hizkuni gives another explanation. It mentions his children, Er and Onan, here, because Judah caused that all the children of Jacob came into the exile of Egypt. If Judah had rebuked his brothers that they should not sell Joseph, then they would not have come to Egypt. The Holy One said to Judah. You did not think that your father was anguished about Joseph. Therefore, when Israel, your father, will be full of joy and happiness, your children who died will be remembered, and you will mourn, because you caused your father to mourn. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:10.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>What the verse said: “For they are life for those who find them…” (Proverbs 4:22) – Rabbi Ḥiyya said: It is a salve for the eye and a remedy for a wound, and a cup of roots for the intestines. A salve for the eyes, as it is written: “The commandment of the Lord is pure, it enlightens the eyes” (Psalms 19:9). A remedy for a wound, as it is written: “It will bring health to your body” (Proverbs 3:8). A cup of roots for the intestines – as it is written: “And an elixir for your bones” (Proverbs 3:8).  Another matter, “for they are life for those who find them [lemotzeihem]” – to one who issues them [lemotzian] out of his mouth. (Studies out loud.)  There was an incident involving a certain disciple of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, who would complete all his learning in one hour. (He did not say the words out loud.)  One time, he fell ill and forgot all his learning. What caused this to befall him? It is because he did not recite it with his mouth. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov prayed on his behalf and all his learning was restored.  Another matter, “for they are life for those who find them [motzeihem]” – for one who imparts it [shemotzian] to others. Alternatively, “for they are life for those who find them [motzeihem]” – for one who completes [shemamtzi] (This is a variation of the word mematze, which means exhausts or completes.)  all the mitzvot. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “All the mitzva” (Deuteronomy 8:1). What is “all the mitzva”? It is until you complete all the mitzvot. &quot;And an elixir for your bones” (Proverbs 3:8), the 248 limbs that you have. That is &quot;For this mitzva.&quot;  Another matter, “for this mitzva” – Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Anyone who begins a mitzva and does not complete it, causes that he will bury his wife and his children. From whom do you derive it? It is from Judah, who began a mitzva but did not complete it. How so? When Joseph came to his brothers and they sought to kill him, as it is stated: “Let us go and kill him” (Genesis 37:20). Judah stood and did not allow them. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “What profit is it if we kill our brother?” (Genesis 37:26). They heeded him because he was king over them. Had he said to them: ‘Let us return him to our father,’ they would have heeded him. Because he began the mitzva but did not complete it, he buried his wife and his children, as it is stated: “Bat Shua, Judah’s wife, died” (Genesis 38:12), and it is written: “Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 46:12).  Another matter, “for this mitzva” – Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: Anyone who begins a mitzva but does not complete it, and another comes and completes it, it is attributed to the one who completed it. How so? Moses began the mitzva, as he took Joseph’s bones with him. From where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Moses took Joseph’s bones with him…” (Exodus 13:19). But because he did not take them into the Land of Israel, it is attributed to Israel, who buried him, as it is stated: “The bones of Joseph that the children of Israel took up from Egypt, they buried in Shekhem” (Joshua 24:32). “That Moses took up from Egypt” is not written here, but rather, “that the children of Israel took up.” Why did they bury him in Shekhem? To what is the matter comparable? It is to thieves who stole a barrel of wine. The homeowner was aware of their presence. He said to them: ‘Enjoy it, but, as you live, after you drink the wine, return the barrel to its place.’ So, when the brothers sold Joseph, they sold him from Shekhem, as it is stated: “Israel said to Joseph: Are your brothers not herding in Shekhem?” (Genesis 37:13). The Holy One blessed be He said to them: ‘You sold him from Shekhem, return him to Shekhem.’ Since they completed the mitzva, it is attributed to them. That is, “for this mitzva.”</p>

(Tanh., Gen. 11:9, specifically states in the parallel account, “It was in Jacob’s heart that Judah had killed him.” See also above.)  From where do you learn that? From Benjamin, about whom Judah said to Joseph (in Gen. 44:32): FOR YOUR SERVANT HAS BECOME SURETY FOR THE LAD. Then, as soon as he had set his mind on Benjamin and Joseph had made himself known, Judah was found to be innocent, as stated (in Is. 11:13): THEN EPHRAIM'S JEALOUSY SHALL DEPART, &lt; AND THOSE WHO HARASS JUDAH SHALL BE CUT OFF &gt;….

Can a man die within another man that it should say: And after that Hezron died in Caleb? This must mean that after Hezron died Caleb came to Ephrath, who was in fact Miriam, through whom Israel increased and multiplied, as it is written: And Azubah died, and Caleb took unto him Ephrath, who bore him Hur.

              <p>Another matter, “see, I have called by name,” this is one of seven people who were called by several names. There were those called by four, such as Elijah; Betzalel, six; Joshua, six; Moses, seven; Mordekhai, two; Daniel, five; Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, four. Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat said: Elijah was a Jerusalemite, from among those who sat in the chamber of Hewn Stone, and was from a city in Judah. His property was in two tribes; five portions in Benjamin, as it is stated: “Tzela, HaElef, and the Yevusites, which is Jerusalem [Givat, Kiryat; fourteen cities and their surrounding areas. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin]” (Joshua 18:28), three in Judah, as it is stated: “Tzenan, Ḥadasha, and Migdal Gad” (Joshua 15:37). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Tzenan, as he was a shield [tzina]; (Elijah shielded Israel from divine punishment. )  Ḥadasha, as the Holy One blessed be He will restore it [meḥadesha] in the future; and Migdal Gad, as from there the Holy One blessed be He will emerge and raze [magdid] the foundations of Esau. Elijah was called four names, as it is written: “Yaareshya, Elijah, and Zikhri, the sons of Yeroḥam” (I Chronicles 8:27). (The midrash regards Yaareshya, Elijah, Zikhri, and Yeroḥam to all refer to the same individual. )  Why was he called these names? It is because when the Holy One blessed be He seeks to shake [leharish] His world, [Elijah] stands and mentions [mazkir] the merit of the ancestors and God has mercy [meraḥem] on His world.  Betzalel was called six names and you trace his lineage from the tribe of Judah, as it is stated: “The sons of Judah: Peretz, Ḥetzron, Karmi, Hur, and Shoval, and Re’aya…” (I Chronicles 4:1–2). Ḥetzron is none other than the grandson of Judah, as it is stated: “The sons of Peretz were Ḥetzron and Ḥamul” (Genesis 46:12). And it is written: “After the death of Ḥetzron in Caleb Efrata” (I Chronicles 2:24). Does a person die in a person, that it is written: “After the death of Ḥetzron in Caleb”? Reish Lakish said: What is “after the death of Ḥetzron in Caleb…”? After Ḥetzron died, Caleb consorted with Efrat, namely Miriam, whose name was Efrat. Why was she called that? It is because the children of Israel were fruitful and multiplied [parim veravim] because of her. (Miriam is identified as one of the Israelite midwives in Egypt (see Shemot Rabba 1:13). )  “She bore him Ḥur, Ḥur begot Uri, and Uri begot Betzalel” (I Chronicles 2:19–20). “Re’aya son of Shoval begot Yahat, and Yaḥat begot Aḥumai and Laḥad. These are the families of the Tzoratites” (I Chronicles 4:2). Betzalel, that is what his nation called him. The Holy One blessed be He called him by five names of endearment after the Tabernacle. Re’aya, as the Holy One blessed be He showed [herahu] him to Moses and to all of Israel and said to them: ‘From the beginning I appointed him to build the Tabernacle.’ Shoval, because he built a dovecote [shovakh] for God; this is the Tabernacle, that would stand like a dovecote. (It stood tall, like a dovecote (Etz Yosef). )  Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: The Holy One blessed be He established a Tabernacle for Israel like a dovecote. (Just as a dovecote protects doves who flock to it, the Israelites would flock to the Tabernacle on the festivals (Etz Yosef). )  Yaḥat, because he imposed fear of Him [ḥitito] upon Israel. Aḥumai, because he united [iḥa] Israel with the Holy One blessed be He, and rendered them like brothers [aḥim] to the Omnipresent. Alternatively, Aḥumai, because he imposed the fear of God upon Israel. Laḥad, because he placed glory and grandeur upon Israel, as the Tabernacle was their glory. Alternatively, Laḥad, because the lowliest of tribes cleaved to him. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Pazi said: You have none greater than the tribe of Judah, and you have no lowlier that the tribe of Dan, as it was from the concubines. And what is written in its regard? “The son of Dan was Ḥushim” (Genesis 46:23). (The fact that Dan had only one son is another reason he was considered of lower status than other tribes (Etz Yosef). Alternatively, the term “son” is written in plural such that a literal rendition of the verse would be: The sons of Dan were Ḥushim. Dan’s only son was referred to in plural as a sign that he was important even though he was from Dan. )  The Holy One blessed be He said: Let him (Dan.)  come and join him, (Judah.)  so that [people] will not demean him and so there will be no person who is arrogant, because the great and the lowly are equal before the Omnipresent. Betzalel was from Judah and Oholiav from Dan, and he joined him. (See Exodus 31:6. )   Rabbi Ḥanina said: The great and the lowly are equal. A person should never forsake his strength. (A person should not think that he cannot be strengthened and aided by an individual of humble lineage. )  The Tabernacle was crafted by these two tribes, and likewise the Temple [was constructed by] Solomon from Judah, and Ḥiram “son of a widowed woman from the tribe of Naphtali” (I Kings 7:14).  The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I am your strength.’ Do not forsake your strength or the strength of your fathers, so, too, do not forsake Him, as it is written: “The Almighty shall be your strength [betzarekha]” (Job 22:25). Make Him your strength so that He will be with you in all distress [betzara] that befalls you, as it is stated: “I will be with him in distress” (Psalms 91:15). Alternatively, betzarekha, that if enemies come, I will be against them, as it is stated: “The Almighty shall be your strength [betzarekha].” (Tzarekha means “your enemies” and therefore the term betzarekha can be understood to mean “against your enemies.”)  Alternatively, He will become your walls, as betzarekha is nothing other than a wall, just as it says: “The fortification [umivtzar] of your towering walls” (Isaiah 25:12). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘In this world I am a wall for you, and likewise in the future when Zion will be rebuilt, I will become a wall for it,’ as it is stated: “I will be for it, the utterance of the Lord, a wall of fire all around, and I will be in its midst for glory” (Zechariah 2:9), and likewise: “I have called your name, you are Mine” (Isaiah 43:1).

              <p>In our portion the word איה in verse 21 is the allusion to such an event in the future. When the Torah discusses the ערכין and תמורה legislation in Leviticus 27,10 we are told: והיה הוא ותמורתו קודש, (if one did substitute one animal for another) &quot;both the one originally vowed and its substitute will be deemed holy.&quot; The word תמורתו can be perceived as symbolizing תמר and ורות whose letters make up the word תמורתו. Both Tamar and Ruth may certainly be viewed as &quot;substitutes,&quot; seeing they had not been deliberately chosen for the role they were destined to play. Our sages also say that when Yishai (David's father) slept with David's mother and David was conceived, this was due to an error on Yishai's part. He had thought that he was sleeping with a maid or concubine (Psalms 51,7 Metzudat David). [The verse reads –David speaking – &quot;Indeed I was born with iniquity; with sin my mother conceived me.&quot; Ed.] David himself then was also a substitute as far as his mother was concerned. All of these extraordinary circumstances were designed by G–d to demonstrate that the impure is capable of being redeemed and becoming pure. The sperm that impregnated the various mothers mentioned originated in purity, could be called זרע קודש, holy seed. [In a gloss the author draws our attention to Ruth 4,7 where we find the expression על הגאולה ועל התמורה, placing the words &quot;redemption and substitution&quot; side by side. He finds a deep significance in this and speculates that it alerts us to the lesson that through the process of תמורה, substitution, the impure can achieve purity.] Er and Onan died because they defiled such sacred seed. Eventually Yehudah himself had to impregnate Tamar in order to enable the dynasty of David to have its beginnings. When, later on in 38,26, Yehudah acknowledged that he was the father of the infant Tamar was carrying, the Torah adds the word ממני, which our sages in Targum Yerushalmi interpret as a Heavenly voice calling out that the outcome conformed with a Heavenly plan and that neither Yehudah nor Tamar were guilty of misconduct.</p>

            <summary>In Genesis 15:16, the &quot;fourth generation&quot; can refer to the descendants of Kehot, Levi's son, who eventually entered the Holy Land. Nachmanides interprets it as the fourth generation of the Emorite, whose sins would lead to their downfall. Some commentators consider father-son-grandson as one generation, leading to Avraham, Yitzchok, and Yaakov being one generation and Salmon being the fourth. In Genesis 38:1, Yehudah separated from his brothers due to being deposed as their leader, with his sons marrying at a young age. In Numbers 13:6, Caleb is identified as the son of Yefuneh, but he is actually the son of Chetzron.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>וירד יהודה מאת אחיו, “Yehudah separated from his brothers;” he could not bear watching the anguish of his father. Rashi here writes that the word וירד, which means: “he descended,” means that he had been deposed from his position of being the brothers’ spokesman and leader by the other brothers. He derives this from the expression: מאת, understanding the meaning of that word as being: על ידי, “through the action of;”You could well ask that seeing that it took only 22 years until the brothers under the leadership of Yehudah went down to Egypt in order to buy grain, how was it possible that during these few years not only did Bat Shua, Yehudah’s wife bear him three sons, Er, Onan, and Shelah, but that two of them had already become married? And a few years after the death of Onan, Yehudah sired twins from his daughterinlaw Tamar, all before the descent of the brothers to Egypt for the first time? The answer to such questions is that in those times girls and boys were able to both sire and conceive and give birth already at the age of seven. According to a historical text accepted by our sages as accurate and reliable, called seder olam, Er, Yehudah’s oldest was born approximately a year after the sale of Joseph. Bat Shua bore Yehudah two more sons in short order, before she died (verse 12). When Er was seven years old he married Tamar. When he died and married Onan, and Onan died, Shelah was still too young to marry. Tamar remained a widow in the house of Yehudah for a year before returning to her mother’s home. When two or three more years had passed and she was not allowed to marry Shelah, she took matters into her own hands and contrived to become pregnant from a member of Yaakov’s family, her dearest desire, i.e. she became pregnant by her fatherinlaw, Yehudah. All of this had only taken about 19 years after Yehudah had been deposed and moved away from his brothers. In the meantime, Peretz, one of the twins Tamar had born to Yehudah had married at the age of seven and had himself become a father of Chetzron and Chamul, (Genesis 46,12) all before Yaakov and his family moved down to Egypt after the brothers’ second trip there. By the time Chetzron and Chamul came to Egypt, only twenty two years had elapsed since the sale of Joseph.[While this is interesting, this Editor cannot reconcile it with G-d having punished both Er and Onan at the tender age of 7 or eight years, for having deliberately failed to produce children (38,7 and 10) Where is the source for the culpability of such young children anywhere? Ed.]</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ודור רביעי ישובו הנה, “but the fourth generation will return to here.” Rashi understands this to mean that after having been in Egypt for three generations the descendants of Avrham would return to the Holy Land. This was true, as when you consider that Yaakov already went into exile in Egypt and consider Yehudah-Peretz-Chetzron-Calev as his descendants in a straight line, Calev did in fact re-enter the land of Canaan and settled there. The problem with this calculation is that Chetzron in common with Yaakov, had traveled from Canaan to the land of Egypt. (Genesis 46,12) Seeing that this is so there were only 2 generations in Egypt. If being an alien in other countries would count, they actually had been in exile for 7 generations according to the calculation. Actually, there is no problem at all. The reason that the calculation begins with Yaakov, although some of his offspring also were exiled with him, is because he was the head of the clan.
    One can also explain the meaning of the words “the fourth generation,” as starting from the people who had been born already in Egypt, i.e. Kehot, son of Levi. He was followed by his son Amram, who was the father of Aaron, who was the father of Eleazar who entered the Holy Land as the High Priest.
    According to Nachmanides, the “fourth generation” mentioned in our verse, refers to the fourth generation of the Emorite, whose sin by that time will have accumulated to a degree which exceeds G’d’s patience and they will be ripe for retribution. This will enable the Jewish people to take over these lands at that time. If they were to repent at that time it would be too late for G’d to change His decree. The reason G’d mentions the “Emorite” instead of “the Canaanite,” was that the Emorite was by far the most powerful and numerous of the Canaanite tribes.
    There are some commentators who claim that father-son and grandson are all considered as one generation, and that we have proof of that from (?) so that three generations are in reality one generation (due to their lives overlapping somewhat). This would mean in our case that Avraham, Yitzchok, and Yaakov are considered as one generation, Yehudah, Peretz and Chetzron as the second generation, followed by Ram, Aminadav, and Nachshon as the third generation. Salmon, who was the fourth generation, belonged to the people who entered the Holy Land.

              </summary>
              <p>Dr. Esh discusses a totally different, and virtually unknown, custom with regard to the reading of Yissokhor, a practice which he finds recorded in Naḥalat Ya'akov, a work devoted to various questions pertaining to the Reading of the Torah. According to this compendium, the name should be vocalized as Yissoskhor in all occurrences prior to Numbers 26:24 and as Yissokhor thereafter. Dr. Esh explains the rationale underlying this uncommon practice. He predicates the custom upon one of the numerous reasons for not pronouncing the second sin of this name. One opinion recorded in Torah Shlemah is that this letter was removed from the name of Issachar in order that it might be added to the name of one of his children. According to this explanation, the name Yashuv, occurring in Numbers 26:24, originally lacked a shin. The person denoted by the name Yashuv is one and the same as Yov, identified in Genesis 46:13 as a son of Issachar. According to some authorities, Yov was also the name of an object of pagan worship. Therefore, Yov requested that a sin be taken from his father's name and added to his name, rendering it Yashuv. This tradition, Torah Shlemah claims, is the basis for the practice in some places of vocalizing the double consonant in Yissokhor throughout Scripture until the point where the sin is recorded as part of the name Yashuv in Numbers 26:24; from this point on, the second sin is not vocalized. Both Dr. Esh and Professor Wiesenberg quote many scholars who reject this custom as being unauthoritative.</p>

              <p>לישוב OF JASHUB — He must be identical with Job (Genesis 46:13) who is mentioned amongst those who went down to Egypt, for all the families were called by the names of those who went down to Egypt. But as for those who were born from that time and onwards their families were not called by their own names, except the families of Ephraim and Manasseh, both of whom wore born in Egypt, and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela the son of Benjamin (v. 40). And I have found in the work of R. Moses the Preacher why this was so in the case of the two latter — that their mother went down to Egypt when she was already pregnant with them so that they may be regarded as being among those who went down to Egypt, and on this account they formed separate families, just as Chamul and Chezron who were grandchildren of Judah (v. 21), and Cheber and Malkiel who were Asher’s grandchildren (v. 45). If this is an Agada, well and good; but if not, then I say that Bela had many grandchildren and that from these two, Ard and Naaman, there issued from each a large family, and the offspring of the other sons were called after Bela’s name, but the offspring of these two were called after their name. So, too, I say about the sons of Machir who formed two different families, one called after his name, and one called after the name of Gilead, his son, because it was a very large family. Five families are missing from Benjamin’s sons as stated before: here (i.e., by the fact that five of the families had become extinct) there was fulfilled part of his mother’s prophecy which is alluded to in the fact that she called him Ben Oni (my unfortunate son), (Genesis 35:18), whilst by the incident of the concubine in Gibea (Judges 20:35), the whole of it was fulfilled for practically the entire tribe was exterminated. This I found in the work of R. Moses the Preacher.</p>

        <summary>The commentary discusses the missing person in Jacob's descendants as Jochebed, explores the possibility of her longevity, and emphasizes hidden miracles in the Torah. The Jewish Thought commentary highlights the surprise attack against the Midianites, led by Joshua and Pinchas, with specific instructions for purification and loot distribution. The Midrash delves into differing perspectives on fetal formation and offerings related to the exodus from Egypt. Ramban clarifies details about Abraham's birth and lineage, while the Talmud establishes Jochebed's age and resolves the discrepancy in Jacob's family count with the birth of a twin sister. The Targum translations list Leah's sons born in Padan Aram, including Dinah, totaling thirty-three souls.</summary>

The reverse is true when the man ejaculates earlier, i.e. that the woman’s seed being last is still in its original strength, resulting in its immediate conception.

The count of the seventy commences with the word “Reuven.” When you count from Reuven to Dinah you obtain a total of thirty-two. The missing person is accounted for by Yocheved who was born between the entrance gates to Egypt as mentioned in Baba Batra 123. The total of seventy is divided here into four segments in accordance with the four wives of Yaakov. The Torah mentions the word נפש each time repeating the word נפש in the singular when summing up the total number of Yaakov’s family. This teaches the indivisibility of the Jewish people. All Jews are members of the same whole. The four times נפש preceding the final word נפש may allude to the four “camps” in the celestial spheres presided over by the four arch angels (compare commentary on verse 27).</p>

This is also why we find the word  בנותיו, “his daughters, (pl.) “as an obscure reference to Yocheved [daughter and granddaughter being lumped together as “daughter.” Serach, being a daughter of Asher who was a son of Zilpah, is mentioned separately as a “sister” in verse 17. Ed.] Both Ibn Ezra and my father wrote that the number 33 is made up by the addition of Yaakov to the total [although he was not anyone’s descendant, so that it is difficult to see him as included in the words בני ישראל in verse 8. Ed.] According to the commentary of these two scholars the words ובנותיו would have to be understood as similar to “ובני דן,” and the sons of Dan, seeing that he is reported as having had only one son by the name of Chushim (verse 23)</p>

              </summary>
              <p>THIRTY AND THREE. But in the above enumeration you will find only thirty-two. However, the one whose name is omitted is Jochebed who was born as they entered the border city, as it is said, Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom [her mother] bore to Levi in Egypt. (Numbers 26:59.)  She was born in Egypt, but she was not conceived in Egypt. This is the principle of our Rabbis. (Baba Bathra 123a. See also Ramban, next Verse.)  But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra replied, saying that “this is surprising. For if so, why did Scripture not mention the wonder that befell her, for she gave birth to Moses when she was one hundred and thirty years old? (Israel stayed in Egypt two hundred and ten years. Since Moses was eighty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, he was thus born one hundred and thirty years after they entered Egypt.)  And why did it mention the case of Sarah who gave birth when she was ninety years old? This distress was not yet sufficient for us so that the poets came and composed liturgic poems for the day of Simchath Torah, (Literally, “Rejoicing of the Law.” On this festival day, which marks the last day of the festival of Succoth, the concluding chapter of the life of Moses is read in the Synagogue. The joyous celebrations on this day are due to the annual completion of the reading of the Torah, as well as to the fact that it is commenced anew.)  wherein they state, ‘Jochebed, my mother, will be comforted after me,’ [implying that Jochebed survived her son], and thus she was two hundred and fifty years old at the death of Moses! (Her age when Moses was born added to Moses’ life span of one hundred and twenty totals two hundred and fifty.)  Is the proof of the poets for this longevity of Jochebed because Ahijah the Shilonite (I Kings 11:29.)  lived a life of great duration? (According to an Agadic tradition, Ahijah the Shilonite was among those who went out of Egypt, and lived to the days of Jeroboam I, king of Israel, a period of about four hundred and fifty years. (Baba Bathra 121b.) On the basis of this tradition, the poets claimed that since longevity was possible for Ahijah, it was possible also for Jochebed, Moses’ mother.)  [If so, this is not a proof, for his longevity is but] an Agadic tradition or the opinion of a single authority.” (The source for Ahijah’s longevity is the Seder Olam, Chapter 1. This book is a chronicle of Biblical times, composed by Rabbi Yosei ben Chalaphtah, a disciple of Rabbi Akiba.)  These are the words of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. Now lest he be wise in his own eyes (Proverbs 26:5.)  in contradicting the words of our Rabbis, I must answer him and say that in any case, there is in the matter of Jochebed a great wonder of the hidden miracles (See Ramban, above, 17:1.)  which constitute the foundation of the Torah. Jochebed was Levi’s actual daughter, and not merely his offspring, as it is written, Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, whom [her mother] bore to Levi, (Numbers 26:59.)  and it is furthermore written, And Amram took himself Jochebed his father’s sister for a wife. (Exodus 6:20.)  [Thus Amram, Levi’s grandson, married Jochebed, Levi’s daughter.] Now if we would say that Levi begot Jochebed in his younger years, just as he begot all his sons, this would place her birth soon after his descent into Egypt, and she would have been very old at the time of Moses’ birth, (Israel stayed in Egypt two hundred and ten years. Since Moses was eighty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, he was thus born one hundred and thirty years after they entered Egypt.)  at or near the age stated by our Rabbis. (In that case the wonder would have been only on the part of Jochebed.)  And if we would say that he begot her after he resided in Egypt for many years — say, for a period of fifty-seven years — then Levi would have been one hundred years old at Jochebed’s birth, for when he went down to Egypt he was forty-three years (Jacob married Leah when he was eighty-four years old. (Bereshith Rabbah 68:5). When Levi, her third son, was born, Jacob was thus eighty-seven. When he stood before Pharaoh, Jacob said that he was one hundred and thirty years old (47:9). Thus Levi was forty-three at that time.)  of age. In that case, there were two great wonders! [Levi, at the time he begot Jochebed], was as old as Abraham, concerning whom Scripture mentions, Shall a child be born to him who is a hundred years old? (Above, 17:17.)  and it is further written, And my lord is old also, (Ibid., 18:12.)  while Jochebed would still have been an elderly woman of seventy-three when Moses was born! And should we further postpone Jochebed’s birth to the end of Levi’s days, the wonder of his begetting a child will be greater than that of Abraham! But I will tell you a true principle, clearly indicated in the Torah. Scripture mentions miracles performed through a prophet and which he previously prophesied, or performed by an angel who is revealed in the course of a Divine mission, but those effected naturally in order to help the righteous or destroy the wicked are not mentioned in the Torah or in the books of the prophets. May this be “hot gold poured into the mouth” (Sanhedrin 92b.)  of this wise man who refuted the words of our Rabbis in the matter of Phinehas (In his Commentary to Numbers 25:12, Ibn Ezra brushes aside the tradition that Phinehas is identical with Elijah.)  and similar matters in many places. Why should Scripture mention hidden miracles when all the foundations of the Torah are hidden miracles. In the entire scope of the Torah there are only miracles, and no nature or custom. All assurances of the Torah are in the form of signs and wonders, as it is not natural that he who has connection with one of the forbidden degrees of marriage or he who eats forbidden fat suffers excision or death. (Ramban here refers to death by heavenly punishment. See, for example, Leviticus 20:17.)  Nor is it by nature that the heavens become as iron (Leviticus 26:19.)  because we have sowed our fields in the Sabbatical year. Similarly, all the assurances of the Torah concerning those blessings [which will result from our observance of the law], and all the good fortune of the righteous ones because of their righteousness, as well as all the prayers of our king David [in the book of Psalms] and all our prayers, all are founded upon miracles and wonders, except that there is no heralded change in the nature of the world, as I have already mentioned, (See Ramban, above, 17:1.)  and I will yet explain it further, (Ibid., Verse 11.)  with the help of G-d. I will give you faithful testimony to that which I have said. We know that from the time Israel came into the Land until the birth of our lord David, about three hundred and seventy years elapsed. (From the Exodus to the building of the Temple, four hundred and eighty years elapsed (I Kings 6:1). Deduct the forty years spent in the desert and the seventy years of David’s lifespan, and the remainder is three hundred and seventy.)  These years are to be divided among four generations: Salmon, Boaz, Obed, and Jesse [David’s father], (Ruth 4: 21-22.)  each one being allotted ninety-three years. Thus when they begot children they were all approximately as old as Abraham was when he begot Isaac. Furthermore, each one begot his son in the year of his death, a most unusual thing, since in their era the general span of life was not a hundred years. And if one of them begot his son in his younger years, as is usual, the others would have had to be much older than Abraham, and thus the wonder concerning them would be exceedingly great since people in the generation of Abraham lived long, and in the days of David the average lifespan was reduced to a half. And perhaps these four generations lived longer than their contemporaries for it is possible that Salmon was already advanced in years when he entered the Land of Israel. It is for this reason that the masters of Tradition, who are the true Sages, have attributed longevity to Obed, (Bereshith Rabbah 96:4: “The Sages have said, Obed lived more than four hundred years.”)  this being a covert miracle which was done to the ancestor of the kingdom [of the house of David], the son of the righteous one [Ruth], who had come to take refuge under the wings of the Divine Presence. (See Ruth 2:12.)  The Sages similarly mention longevity in connection with Obed’s mother, Ruth. (In Baba Bathra 91 b, it is stated that Ruth was still alive in the days of Solomon.)  Now I have already explained (Above, 17:17.)  that the wonder in the case of Abraham was not as the above-mentioned Sage [Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra] and other masters of the Scriptures have thought. (That the wonder was due to Abraham’s advanced age.)  Abraham begot Isaac seventy-five years before his death, prior to the completion of two-thirds of his lifespan, and in all generations, old age does not affect people until three quarters of their lives have passed, just as the doctors have considered the divisions of life to be: childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. In these generations, when the lifespan is about seventy years, doctors do not consider a person aged until after sixty. Moreover, Abraham begot many children (Above, 25: 1-2.)  forty years after the birth of Isaac, and the wonder is thus manifoldly miraculous! And should we say that G-d caused Abraham to revert to his youthful days, it may be asked why Scripture does not mention this great wonder when it was an open and known miracle which is contrary to nature. Moreover, it is known that in this present generation some men beget children until they are full seventy or eighty years old and more, depending upon the extent to which they retain their natural vitality. Women also have no specific time [for ceasing to conceive], as long as they have their period they can give birth. However, the wonder in the case of Abraham and Sarah, as I explained there, (Above, 17:17.)  was due to the fact that they had not begotten children in their younger years, and now together they begot a child. In the case of Sarah there was an additional wonder, i.e., that the manner of women (Ibid., 18:11.)  had ceased with her, and after this happens, women no longer give birth. Now if Jochebed lived as many years as her father Levi had, (One hundred and thirty-seven years (Exodus 6:16).)  and if her vitality remained with her until near her old age, as is the way of women, it would be no wonder if she gave birth at the time set forth by our Rabbis, [namely, at one hundred and thirty years of age]. It is because G-d wanted to redeem Israel though the brothers [Moses and Aaron], and since the time of the redemption had not yet come, He delayed their birth many years until their mother was old. Nothing is too difficult for the Eternal. (See above, 18:14.)  Rabbeinu Shlomo [Rashi] wrote: (Verse 26 here.)  “According to the view that a twin-sister was born with each of Jacob’s sons, we must say that they died before Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt because they are not enumerated here.” There is no necessity for this conclusion, for the Rabbis have said: (Bereshith Rabbah 84:19. See also Ramban, above, 38:2.)  “Rabbi Yehudah says that Jacob’s sons married their sisters.” These twin-sisters were thus the wives of Jacob’s sons, concerning whom Scripture says, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives. (Verse 26 here.)  In fact, Rabbi Yehudah arrived at this opinion on the basis of this verse, since if it refers to Canaanitish women what reason is there for Scripture to say, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, after it had already said, that came out of his loins? (Verse 26 here.)  It is only because his sons’ wives were also of those “that came out of his loins” that Scripture refers to them. It does not, however, divulge them here, just as it did not mention them explicitly when they were born together with Jacob’s sons. Furthermore, Scripture mentions here only those who begot children and increased in Egypt, in order to make known the great miracle which was performed in the mighty increase which they effected in Egypt, for at this juncture, they numbered seventy souls. Thus their wives were not counted because a man and his wife are one.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>(2) Midrash Rabbah Numbers 21, explains that whoever treats the Midianites with mercy, will only wind up being abused by them, as happened to David, when the latter sent messengers to express his condolences at the death of their King Nachash. (ibid). (3) Apparently, G'd had not commanded an immediate campaign, rather at that point the injunction was not to befriend them or make peaceful overtures to them, al tatzor, means &quot;do not besiege.&quot; Here too, only encirclement was the order of the day. Meanwhile the Jewish people were to be counted following the plague that had killed twenty four thousand of them. After that came the problem of the daughters of Tzelofchod and all that was entailed in that. The moral niveau of the Jewish people had not yet recovered to the point where they could have looked forward to a successful defence in the event of a Midianite attack. For that reason, G'ds advice was that they should stage a surprise attack, which would likely result in victory based on normal military considerations not involving hashgachah peratit, Divine intervention. The reason the campaign is referred to well in advance of its actual execution, is to include it with the report about the campaigns against Sichon and Og, which had been fought successfully by men who were morally entitled to wage war. The people were to appreciate that the men chosen for this campaign had to be such as would qualify on a moral basis. The report about distribution of the land of Israel to the men over twenty, plus those who had come out of Egypt, is, as Rashi says, to show that the dead inherited the living. In this way, both the people to be counted at this time as well as the ones who had left Egypt, would jointly share in inheriting the land. (4) Since the count of the warriors was to include only those who were free from sin, and who therefore qualified for entry into the land, Moses considered himself excluded. This is why he did not lead Israel into battle, personally. He had thought that this was a battle in which Joshua had to assume command, until G'd later repeated to him- after the section about the sacrifices and vows, &quot;take revenge for Israel from the Midianites; after that you will die!&quot; The emphasis in that verse is on the fact that he would die only after that had been accomplished, not prior to it. Moses, who had construed the meaning of the word tzaror as an infinitive, not as a directive, delegated Pinchas, who, since he had commenced the mitzvah was to be allowed to complete it. (5) G'd may not have commanded the females to be killed in order to give Moses a chance to still have a major share in carrying out that mitzvah personally. Moses was quite right in chiding the troops who allowed the very people to survive that had caused the plague to happen, and who already had the death of twenty four thousand Israelites on their conscience. Moses had not given such a command before, since he had taken it for granted that this part of the Midianite population would be killed by his warriors. He is not reported as including Pinchas in this reprimand, out of respect for the latter. On the other hand, Pinchas had not wanted to issue such instructions which, if wrong, could not have been corrected at a later date. The reason we have specific instructions for the temey-ey meytim, those who had defiled themselves through contact with corpses, and who have to remain apart from the main body of the people is, that this time only twelve thousand people were involved. Previously, when the whole army had been involved fighting Sichon or Og, and everyone had become defiled through contact with the dead, a separation would not have accomplished anything. Therefore, the legislation about ritual purification of vessels formerly owned by gentiles is in place here. (6+7) The repeated emphasis on the amount of the loot was to remind the people of the extent of the victory, coupled with the fact that they had not suffered any casualties at all. By dividing the loot into 5o% for those who had stayed behind in the camp, and appropriating 1/5ooth from the combatants, the temple treasury would in fact receive one tenth of one percent from the total loot, and the numbers would automatically be equal to the number of thousands listed for all the animals captured etc. The half was recorded to let us know the amount of the 10 per cent that Eleazar was entitled to as a tithe. Altogether, detailing the quantities which twelve thousand men had captured from a nation led by five kings, would remind the people of the impressive nature of their victory. </p>

The Midrash also discusses the lineage of Jacob's children and the significance of offerings presented by Elyasaf son of Deuel in relation to the exodus from Egypt.

              </summary>
              <p>“On the sixth day, prince of the children of Gad, Elyasaf son of Deuel” (Numbers 7:42).  “On the sixth day, prince of the children of Gad, Elyasaf son of Deuel” – because Simeon took his sword and went and waged war with the people of Shekhem on behalf of his sister, and the descendants of Gad crossed the Jordan to help their brethren take possession of the Land, just as it says: “He performed the righteousness of the Lord, and His ordinances with Israel” (Deuteronomy 33:21); therefore, he was privileged to present his offering after Simeon.  “His offering was one silver dish, its weight one hundred and thirty; one silver basin of seventy shekels, in the sacred shekel; both of them full of high quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering” (Numbers 7:43).  “His offering was one silver dish…” – Rabbi Berekhya said: The prince of Gad presented his offering corresponding to the exodus from Egypt. Why did he do so? It is because his father blessed him with regiments, as it is stated: “Gad will recruit a regiment and it will return intact” (Genesis 49:19). Jacob said that statement regarding the fact that he was destined to cross the Jordan as a vanguard into battle, just as it says: “And your servants will cross, all the vanguard [ḥalutz] of the host, before the Lord into battle…” (Numbers 32:27). Regarding the exodus from Egypt, host is written, just as it says: “All the hosts of the Lord departed [from the land of Egypt]” (Exodus 12:41), and it is stated: “The children of Israel ascended armed [ḥamushim] [from the land of Egypt]” (Exodus 13:18); ḥamushim is the same as ḥalutzim. The Land was distributed to those who departed from Egypt, just as it says: “I will give it to you as a heritage, I am the Lord” (Exodus 6:8), and the descendants of Gad aided them until the land was conquered and distributed to all of them, that is why their prince presented his offering regarding the exodus from Egypt.  Rabbi Berekhya said: He began presenting his offering corresponding to what befell them from the day that Jacob and his sons descended to Egypt, until they departed. That is what is written: “His offering was one silver dish,” corresponding to Yokheved, Moses’s mother, in whose regard it is stated: “A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi” (Exodus 2:1); it teaches that Amram divorced her and then took her back. That is why he presented a dish. Do not read it as ke’arat, but rather, as keraat, because she was severed [nikraat] from him. The letters of this are the letters of that. “One silver [kesef],” as Amram longed to take her back as a wife on account of Miriam, Aaron’s sister. That is why it is called kesef, because of the longing, just as it says: “My soul longs [nikhsefa], and also yearns, [for the courtyards of the Lord]” (Psalms 84:3). And it says: “Because you longed [nikhsof nikhsafta] for your father’s house…” (Genesis 31:30).  “One [aḥat],” do not read it as aḥat, but rather, as aḥot, sister, as when she was Aaron’s sister, she prophesied and said to her father that he should take back his wife, who was destined to bear a son who would redeem Israel. In that regard it is stated: “Miriam the prophetess, sister of Aaron…” (Exodus 15:20). Was she Aaron’s sister and not Moses’s sister? It is because Moses had not yet been born, and that is why, when Moses was cast into the Nile, she went and saw what would befall Moses and what would be the fate of her prophecy, just as it says: “His sister stationed herself at a distance [to ascertain what would be done to him]” (Exodus 2:4). That is, “one silver.”  “Its weight one hundred and thirty” (Numbers 7:43), it is because she [Yokheved] was one hundred and thirty years old when Moses was born. How so? It is because Yokheved was born between the walls (Namely, on the border of Egypt.)  when Israel descended to Egypt. That is why she entered into the tally of those who descended to Egypt, as it is stated: “All the people, his sons and his daughters, thirty-three” (Genesis 46:15). In the generalization, you find thirty-three, but in the details, you find only thirty-two. Why? It is because Yokheved was born between the walls, and was among those who arrived in Egypt. Do we not know that she was born in Egypt; after all, her name was not mentioned with the names of those who arrived? It is, rather, to say to you that she was born in Egypt between the walls when they entered Egypt, but her conception was not in Egypt. Go out and reckon: From the day that our ancestors descended to Egypt until the day that Moses was born, there were one hundred and thirty years, as Israel was in Egypt for two hundred and ten years. From where is it derived? “Descend [redu] (The numerical value of redu is reish – 200 + dalet – 4 + vav – 6 = 210.)  there” (Genesis 42:2). Subtract from them eighty years, that was Moses’s age when Israel departed from Egypt; one hundred and thirty remain. We learn that Yokheved was one hundred and thirty years old when Moses was born.  “One silver [kesef] basin [mizrak]” (Numbers 7:43), this is Moses, who was cast into the Nile. (The word kesef is an allusion to the fact that his mother longed [nikhsefa] for him.)  Alternatively, that he was banished [nizrak] from Egypt, as it is stated: “Moses fled…” (Exodus 2:15). “Seventy shekel, in the sacred shekel,” these are the seventy elders whom Moses appointed, all of them prophets, from those that the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “You shall come, you and the elders of Israel to the king…” (Exodus 3:18). Likewise, it says: “Gather to Me seventy men of the elders of Israel…” (Numbers 11:16). “Both of them full of high quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering,” as he and they, all of them were filled with the Divine Spirit, and they were filled with the Divine Spirit from the spirit of Moses, but Moses lacked nothing, like a person who lights one candle from another, the candle is kindled but the other lacks nothing; like a person who smells a citron, he enjoys it, but the citron lacks nothing. “As a meal offering [leminḥa],” just as it says: “It was, as the spirit rested [keno’aḥ] upon them, they prophesied…” (Numbers 11:25).  Another matter, “both of them full,” corresponding to Eldad and Meidad, just as it says: “Two men remained in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, [and the name of the second was Meidad]” (Numbers 11:26). “As a meal offering,” just as it says: “The spirit rested upon them…and they prophesied…” (Numbers 11:26).   “One gold ladle, ten shekels, full of incense” (Numbers 7:44).  “One…ladle [kaf],” as it was at the hand of Moses that the Egyptians were stricken with ten plagues; that is: “gold…ten shekels.” Why were some of the vessels of silver and some of gold? It is to say to you that the latter, that were of gold, correspond to the plunder at the sea, as just as gold is more beautiful and valuable than silver, so, the plunder at the sea was greater than the one in Egypt. Regarding these and those, it is stated: “We will craft you golden earrings” (Song of Songs 1:11); this is the plunder at the sea,“with studs of silver” (Song of Songs 1:11); this is the plunder in Egypt. Likewise, it says: “You came to great beauty [baadi adayim]” (Ezekiel 16:7), (Another meaning of adi is gem or jewel. baadi) , this is the plunder in Egypt, adayim, this is the plunder at the sea. That is “full of incense,” as all Israel were filled with silver, gold, and all sorts of spices. Likewise, it says: “Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates…. Lavender and saffron, lemongrass and cinnamon” (Song of Songs 4:13–14); that is “full of incense.”  Another matter, one hundred and thirty of the dish, seventy of the basin, and ten of the ladle total two hundred and ten, corresponding to the two hundred and ten years that Israel spent in Egypt from the day that Jacob descended to Egypt until they departed from there.  “One young bull, one ram, one lamb in its first year, as a burnt offering” (Numbers 7:45).  “One goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 7:46).  “And for the peace offering, two cattle, five rams, five goats, five sheep in their first year. This was the offering of Elyasaf son of Deuel” (Numbers 7:47).  “One young bull” (Numbers 7:45), it mentioned three species for a burnt offering, corresponding to the three good leaders that the Holy One blessed be He granted Israel, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as it is stated: “I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam” (Micah 6:4). He gave them manna due to the merit of Moses, clouds of glory due to the merit of Aaron, and a spring due to the merit of Miriam.  Another matter, why are three species of burnt offering stated? It is corresponding to the three good attributes that Israel possessed in Egypt, by whose merit they were redeemed: that they did not change their names, they did not change their language, and they separated themselves from licentiousness. “One goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 7:46), corresponding to the paschal offering that the Holy One blessed be He commanded, to perform it with a goat to connote their withdrawal from idol worship. This is because Israel were idol worshippers in Egypt, and the attribute of justice would not have allowed them to be redeemed until they withdrew from it. For the withdrawal from idol worship that they performed, they were redeemed, just as it says: “I will see the blood and I will pass over you…” (Exodus 12:13). That is why they sacrificed a goat as a sin offering corresponding to it, as, for the iniquity of idol worship, they would sacrifice a goat as a sin offering. (See Numbers 15:27.)   “And for the peace offering, two cattle” (Numbers 7:47), corresponding to Jacob and Joseph, by whose merit Israel was redeemed from Egypt, as it is stated: “With Your arm, You redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph, Selah” (Psalms 77:16).  Alternatively, corresponding to Moses and Aaron, as they performed all the wonders, and it is at their hand that they departed, as it is stated: “Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders…” (Exodus 11:10).  “Five rams” (Numbers 7:47), why three species? It is corresponding to the patriarchs, as the Holy One blessed be He remembered the covenant that He made with them, and redeemed them, as it is stated: “God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob” (Exodus 2:24). Why five of each? It is because their tally equals fifteen, corresponding to the patriarchs and the tribes who are fifteen, as, just as the Holy One blessed be He took an oath to the patriarchs, so He took an oath to the tribes, as it is stated: “The oaths said to the tribes, Selah” (Habakkuk 3:9). Alternatively, why fifteen? It is because they were redeemed on the fifteenth of Nisan, as it is stated: “On the day after the paschal offering, [the children of Israel departed]” (Numbers 33:3). And it says: “I acquired her for Me for fifteen silver pieces” (Hosea 3:2). (This verse is expounded to mean that the Holy One blessed be He acquired the children of Israel on the fifteenth of Nisan.)   “This was the offering of Elyasaf” (Numbers 7:47), when the Holy One blessed be He saw that he presented his offering corresponding to the order of the redemption from Egypt, He began lauding his offering: “This was the offering of Elyasaf son of Deuel.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, Beit Shammai say: The formation of the fetus in this world is not like its formation in the World to Come. In this world, it begins with skin and flesh and concludes with sinews and bones. But in the future, it begins with sinews and bones and concludes with skin, as it is written regarding the dead of Ezekiel: “I saw, and behold, there were sinews upon them, and flesh grew, and skin covered them from above, but there was no spirit in them” (Ezekiel 37:8). Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: The portion of Ezekiel is no proof. To what are the dead of Ezekiel comparable? To one who entered a bathhouse – what he removed last, he dons first.   Beit Hillel say: Just as a fetus is formed in this world, it is formed in the World to Come. In this world, it begins with skin and flesh and concludes with sinews and bones, and in the future it is likewise, as Job says: “Please, remember that You have fashioned me like clay” (Job 10:9). “Have You not liquefied [tatikheni] me like milk?” (Job 10:10). It does not say hitakhtani, but rather, tatikheni. (The term hitakhtani is past tense and would have fit more naturally in the verse in Job. The word tatikheni is actually future sense, such that a literal translation is “You will liquify me.” This is taken as an allusion to the future resurrection of the dead. )  “And curdled me [takpieni] like cheese” (Job 10:10); it does not say hikpetani,  but rather, takpieni. (Takpieni is in future tense, whereas hikpetani is past tense. )   “You clothed me [talbisheni] with skin and flesh” (Job 10:11); it does not say hilbashtani,  but rather, talbisheni.  “And covered me [tesokhekheni] with bones and sinews” (Job 10:11); it does not say sokhakhtani, but rather, tesokhekheni.  That is, “You granted me life and grace” (Job 10:12).  A woman’s womb is filled with blood, and from there it emerges and goes to the place of her menstruation. By the will of the Holy One blessed be He, a refined drop goes and falls into it; immediately the fetus is formed. This is analogous to milk that is situated in a bowl. If one places rennet into it, it congeals and sets, and if not, it remains loose.  [This is analogous] to two painters, this one painted the image of that one, and that one painted the image of this one. The female is always from the man and the male is always from the woman. (It is the father who is primarily responsible for the gender of the child when it is a female, and the mother who is primarily responsible for the gender of the child when it is a male. )  From where is it derived that the male is from the woman? As it is stated: “And his Judean wife bore Yered” (I Chronicles 4:18), and it is written: “And his concubine, and her name was Reuma, she too bore [Tevah, Gaham, Tahash, and Raama]” (Genesis 22:24). That is what is written: “When a woman conceives and bears a male child” (Leviticus 12:2). (The verse portrays the woman as the active party in the birth of a male because it is she who is primarily responsible for his gender. )  The female is from the man, as it is stated: “And Betuel begot Rebecca” (Genesis 22:23); “and Dina his daughter” (Genesis 46:15); “And the name of Asher’s daughter, Saraḥ” (Numbers 26:46). (The verse portrays the man in the active party in the birth of a female because it is he who is primarily responsible for her gender. )  Rabbi Avin said: There is no barber who cuts his own hair. This is analogous to two who entered a bathhouse. The one who perspires first, emerges first. (The one who emits seed first completes his or her role in the act of relations and leaves it to the other to determine the gender of the child (cf. Nidda 31a).)   Rabbi Abahu said: The Holy One blessed be He performed a great favor for the woman in this world in that He did not begin formation of the fetus with sinews and bones. Had He so begun, it would have breached her belly and emerged. Although  in this world, the woman gives birth in pain, in the future, what is written? “Before she begins labor, she will give birth; before a pang comes to her, [she will deliver a male child]” (Isaiah 66:7).</p>

              <p>Our sages in Niddah 31 as well as in Berachot 60 are of the opinion that if the woman achieves orgasm first during marital intercourse the baby born from such a union will be male, and that the Torah here informs us of this biological fact. This is why the Torah wrote וילדה זכר as something that is definite. While it is true that Rabbi Tzadok arrived at this conclusion exegetically from Genesis 46,15 ואת דינה בתו, the fact is that the Torah made the birth of a male child dependent on an experience of the mother, and the birth of a female child on the experience of the father during their union. The verse in Genesis does not provide a reason for this linkage to the respective experience of father and mother during their union. [The author of Torah Temimah comments on that verse that the scientific aspect of the matter was an established fact for our sages; they knew that when two factors have to combine to create something it is the last factor which determines the nature of the product. Hence, if the male has spent his reproductive effort before the woman, the result will be a female child corresponding to the reproductive power of the woman. We do not &quot;learn&quot; this from that verse; the verse only alludes to something already known. Ed.] In our verse the Torah explains the reason for this fact of life, namely that the crucial factor is who spends his reproductive power first. The Torah did not need to add the word &quot;first&quot; in our verse for even if the mother were not to expend her reproductive power first she does have to spend it in order to produce a child of either gender. This is why the Torah also had to write the verse in Genesis 46,15 so that from the two verses combined we would know what factors determine the sex of a baby. [The word ואת, &quot;and in addition,&quot; in that verse in Genesis indicates that Leah was last in spending her reproductive power during the union that led to the birth of Dinah. Hence the child was a female. Ed.].</p>

              <p>ויבן ה' אלוקים את הצלע, “the Lord G-d built up the side, etc.” Both names of G-d are used to show that now the world was complete. When the Torah describes the creation of man in detail we also find the words וייצר ה' אלוקים את האדם. This was justified as Adam already incorporated within himself all the potential of the female of the species except that this potential had not become manifest. The potential capability of woman is hidden within the male, whereas the manifestation of man’s potential comes to the fore within woman. This is what is meant when the Torah wrote in Genesis 46,15 אלה בני לאה אשר ילדה ליעקב, “these are the sons of Leah which she bore for Yaakov.” In that verse the sons are attributed to Leah. Immediately following that statement the Torah adds: ואת דינה בתו, “and Dinah his daughter.” We see that the female children are attributed to the father. You will note that the Torah employs similar language in Leviticus 12,2 אשה כי תזריע וילדה זכר, “when a woman fertilizes semen she will give birth to a male.” On the other hand, the Torah continues there ואם נקבה תלד וגו'. “and if she gives birth to a female, etc.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>If we want to round out this picture, remember that the full name of G’d, the tetragram, does not appear in connection with the entire story of creation until after the creation of the human species. In their commentary on Genesis 2,2 and 2,4 וייצר י-ה-ו-ה אלו-הים את האדם, our sages (Bereshit Rabbah 13,3) remark cryptically: “a complete name of G’d applicable to a complete universe.” How is it possible to describe the universe as complete when woman had not yet been created? [We hear about Chavah becoming a separate body only in Genesis 2,22] The answer clearly is that Adam had been equipped with the female hormones, or whatever, to enable him to produce female offspring. This full name of the Lord is used again when G’d is described as building up the side He had removed from Adam into a separate human body, a female, i.e. Chavah. This conveys the idea that Chavah too has been equipped with the potential to reproduce either as male or female. In other words, each human being is theoretically able to determine the gender of the offspring it produces.  We have a complete verse illustrating this concept in Genesis 46,15: אלה בני לאה אשר ילדה ליעקב בפדן ארם ואת דינה בתו כל נפש וגו’, “these were the sons of Leah whom she bore for Yaakov in Padan Aram, and Dinah his daughter; all the persons, etc.” The Torah attributes the male children to the mother and the female children to the father. When we said that the male harbours within him the essence of the female, and the female harbours with her the essence of the male, the meaning is not that as a result of such biological factors a woman can give birth to a female and a male to a male (each unassisted by the other). Our sages in Vayikra Rabbah 14,9 have already said that there is no barber who can shave himself, i.e. man or woman each require a partner of the opposite sex in order to perform the act of procreation.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Kenaz, Timna, and Amalek. From this verse it seems that Timna was a son of Eliphaz, but the Torah (Gen 36:12) says that Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz and that she bore him Amalek! Some explain (cf. Rashi ibid.) that Timna is the mother of Amalek as it says in the Torah, and that she was misbegotten. For Eliphaz had relations with Seir’s wife, the mother of Lotan, and she bore him Timna—either during his lifetime or after his death—and Ezra made a subtle observation in the Torah that there is a paseq after “Timna,” so that the intent is: “Gatam, Kenaz, and Timna” (Gen 36:11–12), meaning that she too was his daughter. Afterward, though, she became his concubine and bore him Amalek. It is for this reason, then, that the text says, “and Lotan’s sister was Timna” (Gen 36:22, I Chr 1:39)—not “Seir’s daughter,” but rather “Lotan’s sister.” But this interpretation is midrashic: had Timna been the daughter of Eliphaz, the text would not have included her in the list of sons; for Scripture does not do this without saying so explicitly, as in: “and his daughter Dinah” (Gen 46:15), and: “and their sister Serah” (Gen 46:17). In my view the text adopts an abridged style: because Ezra did not need to be explicit, inasmuch as the matter is explicit in the Torah, he presented the genealogical lines in abridged form. He was similarly brief concerning the sons of Shem, recording Shem’s grandsons in the list of sons for the purpose of brevity, so that when the text says “Aram [and Uz and Hul]” (1 Chr 1:17) it is as though it says, “Aram’s sons were Uz and Hul.” Here too, then, he was brief in writing “Timna.” Indeed, he could have been even briefer and written “Zepho, Gatam, Kenaz, and Amalek”; but because Amalek was not equal to the other sons—for they were sons of wives whereas he was the son of a concubine—he separated them by mentioning his mother. And it was adequate for him just to write “Timna,” because the matter is laid out in the Torah.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND THE WHOLE CONGREGATION OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL MURMURED AGAINST MOSES. Scripture should have first narrated the nature of the complaint just as it did in Marah (Above 15:23-24, And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter…. And the people murmured against Moses.)  and Rephidim, (Further, 17:1-2. And they encamped in Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink. And the people strove with Moses.)  and at all other complaints — and stated here first: “and there was no flesh to eat, nor bread for them to the full, and the people were famished for bread.” Now Rashi explained that the reason Scripture specifically mentions [that the date of their arrival in the wilderness of Sin] was on the fifteenth day of the second month (Verse 1.)  is in order “to make this encampment unique. On that day, there came to an end the provision which the Israelites took along with them from Egypt, and they now needed the manna. It thus informs you that they ate sixty-one meals (The manna first came down on the sixteenth day of Iyar, the second month (see Verse 4), thirty-one days after the exodus. Since two meals are ordinarily eaten daily (see Verse 8), this period required sixty-two meals. The first meal, however, was taken in Egypt on the night of the fifteenth day of Nisan, thus leaving sixty-one meals, which were furnished by the provisions they brought out of Egypt.)  of the remains of the dough [which they had baked in Egypt on the day of the exodus].” (Above 12:39.)  [Thus far the language of Rashi.] This is a tradition received by our Rabbis, (Mechilta on Verse 1 here.)  and the reason that Scripture did not [first] explain the nature of their complaint was that it had not elaborated on this miracle which was done for them secretively, [i.e., that the remains of the dough furnished sixty-one meals]. And it is as I have already written in Seder Vayigash concerning the reason [that Scripture is disposed to be silent on hidden miracles]. (See Vol. I, pp. 556-558.)  Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that Scripture records the date on the fifteenth day of the second month in order to explain that a month’s time had already elapsed since their departure from Egypt. In the meantime, they consumed the bread they took out of Egypt as well as their cattle, since they were a great multitude of people. This was the reason for the murmuring. In my opinion, the reason for their complaint is to be found in the Scriptural expression, and they came… unto the wilderness of Sin. (Verse 1.)  When they came to that wilderness far away from Egypt, they began saying: “What shall we eat? What will this great wilderness into which we have come supply us with?” It may be that at first they had thought that after a few days they would come to the cities round about them. Now that a month had gone by and they found no city of habitation, (Psalms 107:4.)  they said, “We will all die in the great wilderness into which we have come.” This then is the meaning of the verse, And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness, the murmuring being because of the wilderness. And so likewise the people said, for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to put to death this whole assembly by famine. (Verse 3.)  Thus they mentioned “the wilderness’ and “the assembly,” therein stating that a large assembly such as this will undoubtedly die of hunger in this great wilderness. The Holy One, blessed be He, hearkened unto them, and He now began to prepare a table for them in the wilderness (Psalms 78:19.)  until they came to a land inhabited. (Further, Verse 35.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND HARAN DIED IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS FATHER TERAH IN THE LAND OF HIS BIRTH IN UR OF THE CHALDEES. In accordance with the words of our Rabbis, Rashi wrote, “Terah accused his son Abram before Nimrod of having broken his idols, and he cast him into a fiery furnace. Meanwhile Haran waited and said to himself, ‘if Abram proves triumphant I will be on his side, and if Nimrod wins I shall be on his.’ When Abram was saved, they said to Haran, ‘On whose side are you?’ He replied, ‘I am on Abram’s side.’ They therefore cast him into the fiery furnace, and he was burnt to death. It is to this event that the name Ur Kasdim (fire of the Chaldees) alludes. Menachem ben Saruk, (Menachem ben Saruk was a great grammarian who lived in the middle of the tenth century in southern Spain. He composed the first dictionary covering the entire field of the Biblical language. His work is called Machbereth (literally, “a joining of words”). Rashi, in his commentary on the Torah and other books of the Bible, made great use of this work.)  however, explained the word ur as meaning ‘valley.’ So also, Therefore glorify ye the Eternal ‘ba’urim’ (in the valleys), (Isaiah 24:15.)  and also, ‘me’urath’ (the den of) the basilisk. (Ibid., 11:8.)  Every hole or deep cleft may be called ur.” This matter received by our Rabbis through tradition is the truth, and I will elucidate it. Our father Abraham was not born in the land of Chaldaea. His ancestors were descendants of Shem, and Chaldaea and the whole land of Shinar were countries inhabited by the sons of Ham, (See above, 10:10-12.)  and Scripture states, And he told to Abram the ‘Hebrew,’ (Further, 14:13.)  not Abram the Chaldean. And it is further written, Your fathers dwelt in days of old beyond the river, Terah the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor, (Joshua 24:2.)  the word mei’olam (of old) teaching that his origins were always from there. And again Scripture states, And I took your father Abraham from beyond the river. (Ibid. 3.)  Proof of the matter is that we find Nahor [Abraham’s brother] in Haran. (Genesis 29:4-5.)  Now if Terah’s place were in Ur of the Chaldees in the land of Shinar and Scripture relates that upon Terah’s going forth from Ur of the Chaldees he took with him only his son Abram, his grandson Lot the son of Haran, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, (Verse 31 here.)  then Nahor was left in the land of Chaldaea, [and yet we find that he was in Haran, (Genesis 29:4-5.)  which is in the land of Mesopotamia, as explained further]. But the truth of the matter is that the country of the birth of Abraham’s ancestors was the land of Aram, which is beyond the River Euphrates; this was always the habitat of his ancestors. Thus Scripture says concerning the children of Shem, And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, unto the mountain of the east, (Above, 10:30.)  this being a generic name applicable to all their countries, as it is written there, in their land, after their nations, (Above, 10:31.)  and again it is written, From Aram Balak bringeth me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the east, (Numbers 23:7.)  [proving that Aram is in the land of “the mountains of the east”]. Thus it is clear that Abram and his ancestors always lived in the land of Aram. Furthermore, we find in the Talmud (Baba Bathra 91a.)  that Abraham was imprisoned [by Nimrod because he broke the idols] in Cuthah, and that city is not in the land of Chaldaea, for it is written, And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath, (II Kings 17:24.)  and it is further written, And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal. (Ibid., Verse 30.)  But it would appear that Cuthah is a city beyond the river, in the land of Mesopotamia, for Haran is the name of a city in the land of Mesopotamia, as it is written, And he went to Aram-naharaim [Mesopotamia], unto the city of Nahor, (Genesis 24:10.)  which is Haran. Furthermore, we have investigated and know it from the word of many students (This alludes to the time during the last three years of his life when Ramban lived in the land of Israel and there gathered around him students from nearby countries. It was from these students, who came from the eastern countries, that he sought first-hand knowledge to illumine the problems he had in his commentary. Concerning this fascinating period in the life of Ramban, see his biography, pp. 191-206 in my Hebrew work, pp. 60-65 in the English edition.)  who lived in that country that Cuthah is a large city between Haran and Assyria, far from the country of Babylon. The distance between it and Haran is about that of a six-day journey. It is, however, included in the term, “beyond the river,” (Ibid. 3.)  because it lies between Mesopotamia and the River Euphrates — which is the border of the land of Israel (Genesis 15:18.)  — and the Tigris which goeth towards the east of Assyria. (Above, 2:14.)  Thus Terah begot his older sons, Abraham and Nahor, in the area “beyond the river,” the land of his ancestors. He then went with his son Abram to the land of Chaldaea, where his youngest son, Haran, was born. His son Nahor, however, remained “beyond the river,” in the city of Haran. It may be that he was born there or that he came to settle there from Cuthah. This is the meaning of [the verse here which says of Haran], in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, since that was the birthplace of Haran alone [among Terah’s children]. This matter received through tradition [that Cuthah was the birthplace of Abraham] is also found in a book called The Antiquities of the Nations, as the Rabbi (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Rambam or Maimonides). See Seder Bereshith, Note 139.)  wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim (III, 29. Ramban is following Al-Charizi’s translation, and not Ibn Tibbon’s. See notes in my Hebrew commentary, pp. 72-73.)  that in the book of Egyptian Agriculture it is mentioned that Abraham, who was born (“Born.” Ibn Tibbon has, “grew up.”)  in Cuthah, differed with the opinion of the people who worshipped the sun, and the king put him in prison, but he continued to argue against them for many days. At last the king was afraid that he might corrupt his land and turn the people away from their religion, and so he expelled him to the far land of Canaan, after confiscating all his wealth. Thus in any case it was in this place, the land of Chaldaea, that a miracle — or more exactly a hidden miracle (See Ramban further, 17:1, concerning the two kinds of miracles.)  — was done to our father Abraham, for G-d put it into the heart of that king to save him and not to kill him, and so he released him from prison to go where he desires. It may be that it was an overt miracle, (See Ramban further, 17:1, concerning the two kinds of miracles.)  i.e., that the king threw him into a fiery furnace, and he was saved, as our Rabbis have stated. (As mentioned in Rashi, quoted at the beginning of this verse.)  Let not Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra mislead you with his questions, (In Verse 26.)  saying that Scripture has not narrated this wonder, for I will yet give you (See Ramban further, 46:15.)  a reason for the omission and proof of the verity of this and other miracles like it. These peoples, however, did not mention it in their books because they differed with his [the Patriarch’s] opinion, and they thought his miracle was a deed of sorcery, just as was the case with our teacher Moses in his confrontation with the Egyptians at the beginning of his deeds. It is on account of this that Scripture no longer mentions this miracle [of Abraham] for it would have had to mention the words of those who differed with him, as it mentioned the words of the Egyptian magicians, and Abraham’s words were not as openly verified to them as were ultimately the words of our teacher Moses, [which were established by ten clearly revealed miracles]. Thus Scripture says, I am the Eternal that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it, (Genesis 15:7.)  for the word hotzeisicha (brought thee out) points to a miracle. It does not say, “that took thee from Ur of the Chaldees;” instead it says, that brought thee out, meaning that He brought out a prisoner from the dungeon (See Isaiah 42:7.)  just as in the verse: that brought thee out from the land of Egypt. (Exodus 20:2.)  And He said to Abraham, to give thee this land to inherit it, (Genesis 15:7.)  because from the time that G-d brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, it was His Will, exalted be He, to make him into a great nation and to give him this land of Canaan. From that day on which Abraham was saved, Terah — his father — and Abraham had in mind to go to the land of Canaan, a distant point far from the land of Chaldaea, out of fear of the king, since Haran, [the city of their inhabitance], was near them [the Chaldeans], and they were one people with one language since Aramaic was their common language. They [Terah and Abraham] wanted to go to a nation where their speech would not be understood by that king and his people. This is the meaning of the verse, And they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan, and they came unto Haran (Verse 31 here.)  where their families and ancestors ever lived, and they settled among them, staying there for many days. It was there that Abraham was commanded to do what he had intended, i.e., to go to the land of Canaan, and so he left his father, who later died there in Haran, (Verse 32.)  his country, and went with his wife and Lot, his brother’s son, to the land of Canaan. (Further, 12:5.)  Thus Scripture says, And I took your father Abraham from beyond the river, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, (Ibid. 3.)  for Abraham was commanded concerning this when he was yet “beyond the river,” and from there G-d took him and led him throughout all the land of Canaan. Now according to the opinion of our Rabbis [that Nimrod threw Abraham into a fiery furnace, the name] Ur Kasdim will be understood as the plain meaning indicates, [namely, “Fires of the Chaldees”], from the same expression: I am warm, I have seen ‘ur’ (the fire). (Isaiah 44:16.)  Scripture thus says, And they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, (Verse 31 here.)  even though Terah did not go forth from the fiery furnace. However, since Abram is the main [person of interest, it mentions Ur Kasdim although the name has reference to him alone]. It may be that on account of the miracle the place came to be so called, just as we find, And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, (Deuteronomy 9:22. — These places were so named because of the events that occurred there. See Numbers 11:3, 34. Exodus 17:7.)  and others. Scripture thus alludes that when Abram went forth from the fiery furnace, they all fled from that country. And the meaning of the verse, Glorify ye the Eternal ‘ba’urim,’ (Isaiah 24:15.)  is in my opinion consonant with that which the Rabbis have said [concerning Ur Kasdim, namely, that it means “the Fire of the Chaldees”], for urim are the high mountains on which they make fires and “kindle the flares” (Rosh Hashana 22b. The subject there concerns the kindling of flares on the tops of the hills to declare that the day of the New Moon had been declared.)  to make the new events known quickly in distant places, even as it says [in the second half of the verse]: In the isles of the sea, the name of the Eternal, the G-d of Israel. (Isaiah 24:15.)  The sense of that verse is thus that for the glory of G-d they should let the whole world know the miracle and the wonder which had been done to them. So also, ‘Me’urath’ the basilisk (Ibid., 11:8.)  means his [the serpent’s] hole, where his fire and great heat are, just as he is indeed called saraph [the serpent, but literally, “the burning one”]. And I have seen in the Midrash: (Pesikta d’Rabbi Kahana, 21.)  “Arise, ‘uri’ (shine). (Isaiah 60:1.)  Therefore glorify ye the Eternal ‘ba’urim.’ (Isaiah 24:15.)  How do you glorify Him? Rabbi Yeivo bar Kahana said, ‘With these torches such as the lanterns which burn in synagogues (This is one of the earliest sources for establishing the religious duty of kindling lights in a synagogue. See my edition of Kithvei Rabbeinu Bechaya, pp. 89-90.)  in all places, even in the isles of the sea, (Isaiah 24:15.)  to the glory of G-d.’” Thus it is clear that the Rabbis understood the word ba’urim as an expression of fire, in accordance with its simple sense.</p>

              <p>AND THESE ARE THE CHILDREN OF ANAH: DISHON AND OHOLIBAMAH THE DAUGHTER OF ANAH. Such is the way of Scripture when referring to daughters, as in the expression, and his daughter Dinah. (Further, 46:15.)  Now this Anah was the fourth son of Se’ir the Horite, enumerated above, (Verse 20 here.)  after Zibeon his brother, for the section enumerates seven sons (Verses 20-21 here.)  of Se’ir the Horite in the order of their birth. This Anah had another son also called by the name Dishon as was his uncle, (Verse 21 here.)  and he had a daughter called Oholibamah, which was also the name of her relative, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon. (Verse 2 here.)  This is why Scripture says concerning Esau’s wife, Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, (Verse 2 here.)  in order to relate that she was the daughter of Anah who had found the mules, and granddaughter of Zibeon, not Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the son of Se’ir the Horite, Zibeon’s brother. However, in the opinion of some of our Rabbis (Pesachim 54a.)  there is in this entire section only one man called Anah, and he was Zibeon’s son. (Verse 24 here.)  Since Zibeon committed incest with his mother, the wife of Se’ir the Horite, Scripture thus enumerates Anah among Se’ir the Horite’s sons (Verse 20 here.)  because people considered him as Se’ir’s son and called him “Anah the son of Se’ir,” and he grew up among his sons because Se’ir thought he was his son. Scripture, however, enumerates him a second time as Zibeon’s son (Verse 24 here.)  in keeping with the true facts. This is the interpretation of the symbolizing interpreters as is mentioned in Tractate Pesachim, (Pesachim 54a.)  but it is not the consensus of opinion in the Gemara and is not at all the plain meaning of Scripture.</p>

              <p>Mushy. [Rashi knows this] because it should only say: “When a woman gives birth to a male child.” [Why does it add “conceives”?] Rather, this comes to include even [when the embryo] is born mushy. One should not object: [The Rabbis taught (Berachos 60a)]: This teaches that if a woman emits seed first [the child will be a male, thus,] it is needed for that! [The answer is:] If so, it should say: “כי תזריע האשה וילדה זכר.” Rather, it juxtaposes “conception” to “giving birth” and writes וילדה זכר with a ו, which indicates certainty, and does not write “if,” the way it does (v. 5): “If she gives birth to a female.” Perforce you have both [explanations]. [You might ask:] Rashi explains above in Parshas Vayigash (Bereishis 46:15): “These are the sons of Leah... along with his daughter Deenah.” — “The males are attributed to Leah while the females are attributed to Yaakov, to teach you that if the woman emits seed first then she will give birth to a male [and if the man emits seed first then she will give birth to a female].” Why is this needed? It is derived from here! The answer is: From here we can only derive that a woman who emits seed [first] gives birth [to a male], however, [it is inconclusive in the event] the man emits seed first or they both emit simultaneously, that she will give birth to a female. Therefore, Scripture lets us know: “along with his daughter Deenah,” that if they [both] emit seed simultaneously they each cancel the other [and she will give birth to a male or female]. And from there alone, however, it cannot be derived, because we can say Scripture attributes the males to Leah because it cannot attribute them to Yaakov, who had other male children, [and if it said “these are the sons of Yaakov” I might think that these alone are the sons of Yaakov]. The female [Deenah] was attributed to him, though, since he had no other daughter besides her. [Thus,] from both [verses] it is derived well. Re’m dwelt at length on this but I shortened it (Minchas Yehudah). </p>

              <p>ואלה בני ענה, דישון ואהלבימה בת ענה, “this is the offspring of Anah; Dishon and Oholivamah daughter of Anah.” This is the way the Bible lists names of girls, as for instance in Genesis 46,15 ואת דינה בתו, “and his daughter Dinah.” This Anah was the fourth son of Seir, being a brother of Tzivon; he is listed after Tzivon, as they are listed in order of their prominence, not their ages. He had another son, named Dishon, the same name as that of his uncle, and this son had a daughter whose name was Oholivamah, the same name as her relative the Oholivamah who was a daughter of Anah, son of Tzivon. In order to avoid confusion, the Torah writes in connection with Oholivamah the wife of Esau, that she was the daughter of Anah who was the son of Tzivon, seeing that she had been the daughter of the Anah who had discovered the mules. In other words, she was a granddaughter of Tzivon. She was not the Oholivamah who was the daughter of Anah, who was the son of Seir the Chivi, a brother of Tzivon.
    Ibn Ezra writes that “Oholivamah the daughter of Anah,” does not refer to the Anah mentioned at the end of the verse (24 as the father of Oholivamah), for if it had been, there would have been no reason to mention him once more. He must therefore be the one mentioned at the end of the first verse, and there was only one Oholivamah.
    Our sages explain that there was only one man called Anah, the result of his father Tzivon having slept with his mother. This Anah was raised in the house of Seir the Chori together with his other sons. This is why he is enumerated together with the sons of Tzivon, seeing he was his son.
    Rabbeinu Tam believes that Anah was a woman and proves it from the line “Oholivamah, daughter of Anah” (verse 13). Anah herself was a daughter of Tzivon. As to the apparent contradiction, seeing the Torah writes: &quot;הוא ענה&quot; which means “he is the Anah, etc.;” this means that she inherited part of Seir’s estate together with Tzivon, her uncle’s other sons. (compare Talmud Baba Batra 116)
    Rashi claims that the reason why Oholivamah is described as the daughter of Anah was because Anah slept with his mother the wife of Tzivon and that he sired Oholivamah from that union. This is why she was referred to as “the daughter of Anah.and the daughter of Tzivon.”

Abba Ḥalifa Karoya asked Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: In the total tally of Jacob’s family members who descended to Egypt, you find seventy, as stated in the verse: “All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy” (Genesis 46:27). By contrast, in their individual listing, when the family members of each of his sons are listed by name, you find seventy-less-one. How can this be resolved? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to him: A twin sister was born with Dinah, as it is written: “And [ve’et] his daughter Dinah” (Genesis 46:15). The term et implies an unspecified additional person. Abba Ḥalifa Karoya replied: If that is so, one would have to say that a twin sister was born with Benjamin, as it is written:</p>

              <p>The Sages taught: At first, people would say that if the woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male, and if the man emits seed first, she gives birth to a female. But the Sages did not explain from which verse this matter is derived, until Rabbi Tzadok came and explained that it is derived from the following verse: “These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah” (Genesis 46:15). From the fact that the verse attributes the males to the females, as the males are called: The sons of Leah, and it attributes the females to the males,in that Dinah is called: His daughter, it is derived that if the woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male, whereas if the man emits seed first, she bears a female.</p>

              <p>The verse is referring to Jochebed as “a daughter of Levi” (Exodus 2:1). The Gemara asks: Is it possible that this is Jochebed? Jochebed was then 130 years old and the verse still calls her a daughter? Jochebed’s age is established based on a tradition concerning the number of the descendants of Jacob who came to Egypt, as follows: While the verse states that Leah had thirty-three descendants (Genesis 46:15), only thirty-two were enumerated. This was explained as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: The “daughter of Levi” is Jochebed, whose conception was on the road, as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, and she was born between the walls, i.e., in Egypt, as it is stated: “And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt” (Numbers 26:59).</p>

              <p>לאזני, &quot;to Ozni, etc.&quot; Rashi says: &quot;this was the family of Etzbaun, and I do not know why he is not called by the same name as he appears in Genesis 46,16.&quot; Thus far Rashi. I do not see why he had to invent something without giving a reason for it, especially when we have no tradition concerning this amongst the writings of our sages. Moreover, you will find the following comment in Midrash Tanchuma item 4 on our Parshah: &quot;When you examine the list of the children of Gad you will find seven names although Etzbaun does not appear seeing he was missing having followed Bileam's advice.&quot; According to the Midrash then, Ozni must have been a different family which originated with Gad but did not appear in the list in Genesis 46,16. This in itself would not be unusual as surely all the tribes had more families than the ones enumerated here, but these were known by the family names of their more numerous brothers. When these sub-categories became numerous they in turn were given separate names. I have found the following in the Pessikta: Ozni is identical with the Etzbaun mentioned in Genesis 46,16. The name is derived from &quot;Atzit&quot; and &quot;he-ezin.&quot; Thus far the Pessikta. Accordingly, it was a proper name and the Torah did not care listing the same person here under a different name. Rashi must have been divinely inspired having guessed what the sages have stated [which he did not quote because he had no access to these writings. Ed.]</p>

Our sages (Bereshit Rabbah 19,20) said that four people commenced their words with the word אף and they all perished. They were: the serpent who had seduced Chavah, the chief of the bakers (Genesis 46,16), the congregation which joined Korach in his rebellion (Numbers 16,14) and Haman (Esther 5,12).

              <p>וסרח אחותם, “and their sister Serach.” Some commentators claim that seeing the Torah did not use the customary “and Search, his daughter,” as for instance “and Dinah his daughter,” but defined her as someone’s “sister,” that this is proof that Serach had not been sired by Asher at all, but had been born to his wife. This view is also held by Onkelos in his translation of our verse, where he adds the word: “his wife.”
    I fail to understand the validity of such a commentary as how could she then have been included in what were specifically described in verse 5 of our chapter as “the names of the descendants (biological) who made up the Children of Israel who arrived in Egypt?” The end of the chapter repeats “all the people who were biologically related to Yaakov’s offspring, etc.” We can only explain all this by again referring to the style of the Torah when narrating such details, i.e. that daughters are lumped together with their brothers when the Torah relates family relationships. Another prominent example of the style of the Torah in this regard is the line:ואחות לוטן תמנע, “Lotan had a sister named Timna.” The Torah does not describe Timna’s father as having a daughter by that name.
    Rashi writes that according to the view of the sage that the brothers all married half sisters who were born as twins with their male counterparts, that now, at the time when the family moved to Egypt, they were not enumerated in the list of seventy descendants as they had all died before this point in time.
    Nachmanides writes that we do not need to fall back on such an unlikely scenario as the brothers all having married half sisters by the father who had died before they could have reached the age of 40 or so, but that the meaning of Rabbi Yehudah (Bereshit Rabbah 84,21) who claims that Yaakov’s sons married their “sisters” who had been born as twins of their brothers, is that their names had not needed to be listed, except with the words מלבד נשי בני יעקב, “not including the wives of Yaakov’s sons,” adequately covered the subject. If the sons of Yaakov had indeed married Canaanite women, why would the Torah in Genesis 37,33 mention these women as Yaakov’s daughters? Unless they had been biologically related to Yaakov, such as being twin daughters, there would have been no point in referring to them in this entire chapter. Their names were not mentioned in this chapter just as they had not been mentioned at the time they had been born. The main purpose of the Torah listing the incredibly small number of people who came to Egypt with Yaakov, i.e. 70, was to show that these formed the nucleus of a great nation which developed into millions, counting wives and children who were minors, by the time they left Egypt 210 years later. It was in order to alert us to this miraculous population explosion of the Jewish people while they were on Egyptian soil. Man and wife are considered as one unit, as only as a pair can they sire offspring.

When the well disappeared, it was Year 40, and it was the first of the month of Nissan, there in the episode when Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the King of Edom (ibid. 20:14), and Israel made [themselves] there for 3 months. Aaron the Priest went up etc., and Aaron was 123 years old when he died at the hill of the mountain (ibid. 33). When Aaron died, the clouds of glory disappeared, and the Canaanites came to make war against Israel. The Canaanites, King of Arad, heard etc. (ibid. 33:40), but what hearing did he hear? He heard that Aaron died, and he the greatest scout traveled among them, and the cloud of glory disappeared, for he had fought for them, and he came to fight with them, and they retreated seven stations and camped at Moserah, for it says &quot;The Israelites traveled from Be'erot Beney Ya'akan towards Moserah; there Aaron died&quot; (Deuteronomy 10:6). Did Aaron die in Moserah? Lo, did he not die at the hill of the mountain? Rather, starting from the location where Aaron died, they retreated seven stations, until they encamped at Moserah, and, from there they traveled towards HaGidgad, etc. (ibid. 10:7), and, from there, towards Be'er etc. (Numbers 21:16), which is the well to which they returned. The Israelites traveled and encamped in Avot, and they traveled from Avot and encamped in Iyyey Ha'avarim etc., and from there they traveled and encamped at the Wadi Zered, and from there they traveled and encamped beyond Arnon etc. (ibid.). There they fought with Sihon, and Israel struck him with the sword etc., and they turned and arose on the path of Bashan etc., &quot;and the Lord said to Moses: 'Do not fear him etc.' and they struck him and his children etc.&quot; (ibid.). &quot;The Israelites traveled and encamped at Arvot Mo'av etc.&quot; (ibid. 22:1). &quot;It was after the plague etc.&quot; (ibid. 26:19), &quot;for these the land shall be divided etc.&quot; (ibid. 26:53), and, when staying in Arvot Mo'av, the children retreated to their parents, and their parents retracted and gave inheritance to their children. Serah bat Asher was among those who came to Egypt and those who left it. [She was] from those who came to Egypt, as it is written, &quot;And Serah their sister&quot; (Genesis 46:17), and [she was] from those who came to the Land [of Israel], as it says, &quot;And there was the daughter of Asher, Serah&quot; (Numbers 26:46).

              <p>.ושם בת אשר שרח, “whereas the name of Asher’s daughter was Serach.” We would have expected the Torah to write simply בת אשר סרח, “Asher’s daughter was Serach.” It appears that the reason why the Torah chose this longwinded version of saying the same thing was because it wished to give us a reason for why she was called “Serach.” She was generally referred to as “Asher’s daughter,” seeing she had grown up in his house although she was not biologically his daughter but his wife’s daughter. This also seems to be confirmed by the Targum who wrote: “and the name of Asher’s wife daughter was Serach.” The question remains open what was the name of her mother, if one of the sons of Yaakov had sired her, why did he not give her his name? If she was sired by a gentile, why was she counted as part of Yaakov’s offspring in Genesis chapter 46 and as a sister to Asher’s sons?Perhaps we may speculate that since she was known by her first name primarily as she had performed many worthy deeds, the title: “and her name was,” preceded her actual name, as a compliment. In the list of Yaakov’s offspring who went down to Egypt with Yaakov her name is listed preceding her status. (Genesis 46,17). This may have been due to her being much older than her younger brothers. The word: ושם, “and the name of,” before her actual name, suggests that “her name preceded her,” she had been well known for her deeds of charity, etc.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Kenaz, Timna, and Amalek. From this verse it seems that Timna was a son of Eliphaz, but the Torah (Gen 36:12) says that Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz and that she bore him Amalek! Some explain (cf. Rashi ibid.) that Timna is the mother of Amalek as it says in the Torah, and that she was misbegotten. For Eliphaz had relations with Seir’s wife, the mother of Lotan, and she bore him Timna—either during his lifetime or after his death—and Ezra made a subtle observation in the Torah that there is a paseq after “Timna,” so that the intent is: “Gatam, Kenaz, and Timna” (Gen 36:11–12), meaning that she too was his daughter. Afterward, though, she became his concubine and bore him Amalek. It is for this reason, then, that the text says, “and Lotan’s sister was Timna” (Gen 36:22, I Chr 1:39)—not “Seir’s daughter,” but rather “Lotan’s sister.” But this interpretation is midrashic: had Timna been the daughter of Eliphaz, the text would not have included her in the list of sons; for Scripture does not do this without saying so explicitly, as in: “and his daughter Dinah” (Gen 46:15), and: “and their sister Serah” (Gen 46:17). In my view the text adopts an abridged style: because Ezra did not need to be explicit, inasmuch as the matter is explicit in the Torah, he presented the genealogical lines in abridged form. He was similarly brief concerning the sons of Shem, recording Shem’s grandsons in the list of sons for the purpose of brevity, so that when the text says “Aram [and Uz and Hul]” (1 Chr 1:17) it is as though it says, “Aram’s sons were Uz and Hul.” Here too, then, he was brief in writing “Timna.” Indeed, he could have been even briefer and written “Zepho, Gatam, Kenaz, and Amalek”; but because Amalek was not equal to the other sons—for they were sons of wives whereas he was the son of a concubine—he separated them by mentioning his mother. And it was adequate for him just to write “Timna,” because the matter is laid out in the Torah.</p>

              <p>AND LOTAN’s SISTER WAS TIMNA. This is analogous to the verses: And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah; (Above, 4:22. )  And their sisters were Zeruiah and Abigail; (I Chronicles 2:16.)  And Tamar was their sister; (Ibid., 3:9.)  and Serah their sister. (Genesis, 46:17.)  It is the custom of Scripture to trace the genealogy of a daughter through the brothers. Now it would have been proper that Timna be enumerated above with the sons of Se’ir by saying, “And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan (Verse 21 here.)  and their sister Timna.” But since she was Lotan’s sister both paternally and maternally, and not the maternal sister of the other brothers, Scripture therefore wanted to trace her genealogy through Lotan. It may be that she was Lotan’s maternal but not paternal sister and she was not the daughter of Se’ir the Horite, [and therefore could not be listed among his children].</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND THE NAME OF THE DAUGHTER OF ASHER WAS SERACH. “Because she was still alive [at the end of Israel’s period of bondage in Egypt, and after forty years in the desert, and was one of the seventy people mentioned in Genesis 46 who went down to Egypt with Jacob], Scripture mentions her here.” This is Rashi’s language. And Onkelos translated [the verse as follows]: “and the name of the daughter of Asher’s wife, was Serach.” By this he intended to say that she was a daughter that possesseth an inheritance (Further, 36:8.)  [in the Land in her own right], and therefore Scripture mentions her here just as it mentions the daughters of Zelophehad, (Further, 27:7.)  for she [Serach] is included amongst [those referred to in the verse], Unto these the Land shall be divided. (Verse 53.)  Now had she been the daughter of Asher himself, she would not have inherited [a portion in the Land], since he had male children [as stated in Verse 44]. But she [Serach] was the daughter of his [Asher’s] wife from another man [namely Asher’s wife’s first husband], who did not have a son; therefore his inheritance [in the Land] passed to his daughter. In that case, the reason [why Scripture uses the phrase] and Serach their sister (Genesis 46:17. The verse reads: And the sons of Asher: Imnah and Ishvah and Ishvi and Beriah and Serach their sister. Ramban here is pointing out that the verse avoids calling her Asher’s daughter, and describes her especially as the sister of his sons, because she was in actual fact not his daughter at all, but only their half-sister.)  is because she was a [half-]sister to Asher’s sons, but was not his daughter. And therefore it says [here], And the name of the daughter of Asher was Serach, and it does not say “and Asher’s daughter [was Serach],” because [the intention of the verse] is to say that her name was [i.e., she was known as] “Asher’s daughter,” and she was [actually] called Serach. (The meaning of the verse is thus: “And the name of the person known as ‘the daughter of Asher’ was Serach.”)  Now if she were still alive [at the end of the period of Israel’s sojourn in the desert], as Rashi explained, then she was like the daughters of Zelophehad as regards [receiving] an inheritance [in the Land in her own right], but if she had died [by then, Scripture mentions her here to indicate that] her family received [a portion in the Land] because of her [since she was amongst those who went down to Egypt]. According to the simple meaning of Scripture, Serach had a large family which was called by her name, and she is included in the phrase, These are the families of the sons of Asher according to those that were numbered. (Verse 47.)  Scripture, however, did not want to trace their ancestry to a woman, by saying: “Of Serach, the family of the Serachites,” but instead alluded to this matter [briefly].</p>

              <p>Also Etzbon of Gad… You might ask: Surely Rashi himself comments later regarding Ozni (v. 16) “I say that this was the family of Etzbon”. The answer is that his explanation here is according to the teaching that seven families became extinct, however Rashi himself does not agree to this. [There is another difficulty] according to Rashi’s explanation later (v. 24) that only those who went down to Egypt are referred to as “families,” for Ozni was not one of those who went down to Egypt. Thus why was he mentioned? One cannot say that Ozni refers to Etzbon since there is no commonality between [the names] Ozni and Etzbon. Rather, one must say that when Rashi explains, “Also Etzbon of Gad” this is according to the teaching in the Yerushalmi that there were seven families missing. And Rashi also disagrees with the teaching in the Yerushalmi that only those who went down to Egypt are referred to as families. With this we can answer the inquiry of Re’m who writes: “However there is a difficulty, for surely Rashi himself writes later that all the families were named after those who went down to Egypt, but those who were born from then on were not referred to by their own names. If this is so, how could the Torah count Ozni, for he was not one of those who came to Egypt? The matter requires investigation.” There are those who explain that, “Also Etzbon from Gad” means that one should not be surprised at the change of Zerach’s name, given that Etzbon of Gad from the tribe of Gad also had his name changed. [You might ask:] Rashi writes, “So there are seven families,” however accordingly there are only six. The answer is that when Rashi says, “So there are seven” this refers to the family of Yishvah, one of the sons of Asher. For here the Torah only counts Yishvi while in Parshas Vayigash it writes (Bereishis 46:17) “Yishvah and Yishvi.” This was what Rashi meant when he said “seven families.”</p>

              <p>ושם בת אשר,”and the name of the daughter of Asher, etc.” Rashi writes that the reason that lady was singled out by name as the only daughter of whom there must have been many, was that she was still alive at the time when this census was taken.     Nachmanides writes that if that were the reason, why did Onkelos translate this verse as ושום בת אחת אשר, “and the name of Asher’s only daughter was Shum.” [This is not the version of Onkelos that appears in our editions where we have ושום בת אשר סרח, “Asher’s daughter’s name was Serach.” Ed.]       According to Nachmanides her name was mentioned because seeing that he had only a daughter and no sons, she inherited her father’s portion of the ancestral land when Joshua distributed same. She was mentioned for the same reason that Tzelofchod’s daughters were mentioned by name. If Serach had been the daughter (instead of granddaughter or great granddaughter) she would not have qualified for such an inheritance seeing that Asher did have sons of his own as we know from Genesis 46,17 where 4 sons and their sister Serach are listed. What made her different was that although Asher’s wife was her mother, she did not have the same father as had Asher’s sons who were listed as her “brothers” i.e. half-brothers. This is why the Torah does not simply introduce her as ובת אשר, “and Asher’s daughter, but with the prefix “and the name of Asher’s daughter.” She was known as Asher’s daughter, her name being Serach, although Asher was not her biological father..     I do not understand his words (our author concerning Nachmanides) for the mystery deepens as we do not know who the man was who fathered Serach, and on the strength of her father not having any sons she inherited her father’s portion of the land. After all, Serach was of the people who took part in the Exodus and the people who descended to Egypt were only seventy in number and all of Yaakov’s sons had sons so that they qualified as males. Furthermore, seeing she is listed as being alive when the Israelites arrived in Egypt she must have survived past the Exodus (210 years +) in order to qualify under the heading of the generation that left Egypt.     According to the plain meaning of the text, Serach presumably had a great and numerous family, all of whose members were known by the name of their matriarch. The Torah decided to include her in the list of the families of the sons of Asher for purposes of the census, but the Torah did not want to list their genealogy as descended from a female i.e. לסרח משפחת סרח, and that is why the Torah abbreviated here. All of the tribes are listed in the same order as they had been listed in Parshat Bamidbar, i.e. in the order in which the tribes were encamped around the Tabernacle. The only change is that in this census Menashe is mentioned ahead of Ephrayim.     Ibn Ezra writes that this change of the order in which Ephrayim and Menashe are listed is because the members of the tribe of Ephrayim had decreased by approximately 8000 souls during the 40 years in the desert. Previously, the members of the tribe of Ephrayim had outnumbered those of the tribe of Menashe by approximately 10000, whereas now the members of Ephrayim numbered approximately 20000 fewer than those of Menashe.     26, 54. </p>

THE SONS OF RACHEL JACOB’s WIFE, etc. It is customary for Scripture to first enumerate the sons of the mistresses together, just as it said in the Seder Vayishlach Yaakov (Above, 35: 23-26.)  and in the Seder V’eileh Shmoth bnei Yisrael, (Exodus 1: 2-4.)  or else to enumerate them according to the order of their birth, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, (Above, 43:33.)  as Scripture did when they were blessed by Jacob in the Seder Vayechi Yaakov. (See my Hebrew Commentary (p. 295) where the point is made that Ramban refers only to Joseph and Benjamin. Either Scripture mentions them at first together with the sons of Leah, as it did in Seder Vayishlach and in Shmoth, or according to their age, as it did in Vayechi. Ramban is attempting to explain why they are mentioned here after Zilpah’s children.)  Here, however, because Scripture’s purpose was to enumerate their numbers and to state that with seventy souls they went down to Egypt, it gave precedence to those who were more numerous. This was why Scripture mentioned Rachel among the concubines, and hence it was necessary to mention her with respect, saying, Jacob’s wife, as I have mentioned above. (Above, 37:2.) </p>

              <p>“The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel” [46:19]. It does not say about any of the wives that she was the wife of Jacob, but only for Rachel does it say that she was the wife of Jacob. The explanation is, because Jacob loved Rachel very much, more than the other wives. (Rashi, Genesis, 46:19.) </p>

            <summary>In Bereshit Rabbah 73:2, it is explained that God remembered Rachel, symbolizing kindness and faithfulness to the house of Israel, specifically Abraham and Jacob. Rachel was the pillar of Jacob's household, as evidenced by the unique mention of her children in Genesis. In Bamidbar Rabbah 14:8, the offering of Benjamin is analyzed in detail, with each element corresponding to aspects of Benjamin's life, such as his birth and the righteousness of his descendants. The offering also symbolizes the establishment of the Temple in Benjamin's portion in Jerusalem and the atonement for sins committed there.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>“On the ninth day, prince of the children of Benjamin, Avidan son of Gidoni” (Numbers 7:60).  “On the ninth day, prince of the children of Benjamin, Avidan son of Gidoni” – why did Benjamin present his offering after Joseph’s sons? It is because, just as the Divine Presence was in Joseph’s portion in Shilo, so, it rested in Benjamin’s portion in the Temple in Jerusalem. Alternatively, it is based on what the verse said: “Rouse Your might before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, and come to our rescue” (Psalms 80:3). (The midrash here is based on the fact that Ephraim and Manasseh cannot be separated; see section 6.)  “His offering was one silver dish, its weight one hundred and thirty; one silver basin of seventy shekels, in the sacred shekel; both of them full of high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering” (Numbers 7:61).  “His offering was one silver dish [kaarat]…” – do not read it as kaarat, but rather as akeret, corresponding to Rachel, who was the pillar of the household; she was the principal [ikar] of Jacob’s household, as it is stated: “The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin” (Genesis 46:19). And it says: “Rachel died on me” (Genesis 48:7). “One silver” – as on the basis of her prayer, Benjamin was born, as it is stated: “She called his name Joseph, saying: May the Lord add another son for me” (Genesis 30:24). In her regard it is stated: “The tongue of the righteous is choice silver” (Proverbs 10:20) – the tongue of a righteous woman. “Its weight one hundred and thirty” – as Benjamin was born when Jacob was one hundred years old. That is why he was named Benjamin [Binyamin], (Son of yamin, whose numerical value is: Yod – 10; mem – 40; nun – 50; which sum to 100. In many verses there is only one yod in the word Binyamin.)  as he was born when his father was one hundred years old. And he was thirty years old when he descended to Egypt. That is one hundred and thirty.  “One silver basin” – it is a basin, it is a goblet, corresponding to Joseph, who assessed the righteousness of his brothers regarding Benjamin by means of the goblet. When Joseph saw that Judah sacrificed himself on behalf of Benjamin, he recognized his brothers’ righteousness and made himself known to them. Because Joseph would drink wine [yayin], whose numerical value is seventy, (Yod – 10; yod – 10; nun – 50; which sum to 70.)  from the goblet, therefore, the weight of the basin was “seventy…in the sacred shekel.” “Both of them full” – both of them were equal, Joseph and Benjamin, as the Tabernacle was established in Joseph’s portion in Shilo, and the Temple in Benjamin’s portion in Jerusalem. That is, “high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering.”   “One gold ladle of ten shekels, filled with incense” (Numbers 7:62).  “One gold ladle of ten shekels, filled with incense” – corresponding to ten sons that Benjamin had when he descended to Egypt, as it is stated: “The sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Bekher, [and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Eḥi, and Rosh, Mupim, and Hupim, and Ard]” (Genesis 46:21), and they were all righteous. That is, “filled with incense.”  “One young bull, one ram, one lamb in its first year, as a burnt offering” (Numbers 7:63).  “One goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 7:64).  “One young bull, [one ram, one lamb]” – these are three species of burnt offering corresponding to the three times that the Temple is built in his portion: one in the era of Solomon, one in the era of those who ascended from the exile, and the third, in the Messianic Era. “One goat as a sin offering” – it corresponds to the structure that Herod built, which was built by a sinful king, and whose construction served as atonement for him for having killed the Sages of Israel. (See Bava Batra 4a.)  “And for the peace offering, two bulls, five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Avidan son of Gidoni” (Numbers 7:65).  “And for the peace offering, two bulls” – corresponding to two kings who emerged from Benjamin, Saul and Ish Boshet. Alternatively, it corresponds to the two redeemers who emerged from him, Mordekhai and Esther.  “Five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year” – there are three species, five of each, corresponding to the three advantages of five each that Benjamin received; they were: “Benjamin’s gift was five times greater that the gifts of all of them” (Genesis 43:34). “To Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of garments” (Genesis 45:22). The third, this is Mordekhai, who was from Benjamin, and who was privileged to don five royal garments, as it is stated: “Mordekhai went out from before the king in royal garments of sky-blue and white, with a great golden crown, and a cloak of fine linen and purple wool” (Esther 8:15).   “This was the offering of Avidan…” – since he presented the offering in this order, the Holy One blessed be He began lauding his offering: “This was the offering of Avidan…”</p>

Who was the house of our patriarch Jacob? Was it not Rachel? Regarding all of them it is written: “The children of Leah, the firstborn of Jacob, Reuben” (Genesis 35:23); “the children of Zilpa, maidservant of Leah, Gad and Asher” (Genesis 35:26); “the children of Bilha, maidservant of Rachel, Dan and Naphtali” (Genesis 35:25).

            <summary>Rabbeinu Bahya explains that the word תורה has a numerical value of 611, representing the commandments taught by Moses to the Jewish people, with the first two commandments given directly by G'd. The phrase מורשה קהלת יעקב includes converts, and Torah is seen as a crown that can be acquired by anyone. Ramban discusses Laban entering the tents of Jacob, Leah, and Rachel, with separate tents for each wife for modesty reasons. He also explains that Jacob's love for Benjamin stems from Benjamin being the only son of Rachel, whom Jacob married out of love. Rachel is mentioned before Leah to highlight her importance as Jacob's wife.</summary>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Devarim 33:4:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>A Midrashic approach (Makkot 23-24): the numerical value of the letters in the word תורה add up to 611, i.e. the number of commandments taught and commanded the Jewish people by means of their leader Moses. The other two commandments, i.e. the first two commandments in the Decalogue, the people had heard directly from the mouth of G’d at Mount Sinai. The expression מורשה קהלת יעקב is understood as including all those who have become part of the Jewish people, קהלה, through conversion. Our sages (Yuma 72) state further that there are “three crowns,” the crown of Torah (not hereditary), the crown of the priesthood, exclusive to descendants of Aaron, and the crown of the kingship, inherited only by descendants of King David. The “crown” of Torah must be perceived as if lying neglected in an out of the way corner, something which can be picked up by anyone desirous of acquiring it.  Another Midrashic approach understands the Torah’s choice of the word מורשה instead of ירושה, as a hint that it could also be read as מאורשה, “betrothed,” i.e. that the purpose of giving us the Torah was to make us the Lord’s “betrothed.”  A kabbalistic approach also understands as above, that the words מורשה קהלת יעקב as if the spelling had been מאורשה קהלת יעקב. Seeing that Torah is also known as רחל in terms of kabbalistic parlance, a departure (absence) of the Shechinah from the Jewish people is described by Jeremiah 31,14 as “Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted for her absent children.” At a time when G’d considers the Jewish people in a state of grace Rachel is described as “the wife of Yaakov” (Genesis 46,19).</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Genesis 31:33:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>IN THE TENT OF JACOB AND IN THE TENT OF LEAH. Rashi comments: “In the tent of Jacob — this was Rachel’s tent, for he was constantly with her. And so also Scripture says, The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife, (Further, 46:19.)  while in the case of the other wives it does not say ‘Jacob’s wife.’ And he entered into Rachel’s tent. When Laban left Leah’s tent he returned again to Rachel’s tent before he searched the tent of the two maid-servants. And why did he feel compelled to do all this? Because he knew her to be inclined to touch everything.” But in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it is not correct for the same tent to be called by two names, [i.e., “the tent of Jacob” and “the tent of Rachel”] in one verse. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that Laban entered into the tent of Jacob, the tent of Leah, and the tent of the two maid-servants [the singular form “tent” being used] since one tent served both. Afterwards he came back a second time to Leah’s tent, and after that he entered into Rachel’s tent. But this too is incorrect. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra further wrote: “The feasible interpretation appears to me to be that Scripture followed here a way of brevity and delayed mentioning the tent of Rachel in order to state concerning all of the others, but he found them not, as they were not there. Scripture then returns and explains that when he went out of Leah’s tent he came into Rachel’s tent where the teraphim were.” That is the correct interpretation. It is true that there were separate tents for all of the wives for this was due to the righteous man’s regard for modesty. Thus each one of the wives (The above mentioned opinion that one tent served the two maid-servants was that of Ibn Ezra; Ramban however differs.)  had a separate tent so that one should not know when he came to the other. It is also a matter forbidden by Torah law, as the Sages have mentioned in Tractate Niddah. (17a.)  And Jacob had a special tent, in which he would eat at his table with his children and people of the household. And the reason why Scripture mentions Jacob’s wife (Further, 46:19.)  in connection with Rachel in my opinion, according to its simple sense, is that she is mentioned in that chapter among the concubines. For this reason Scripture does not say so in the Seder Vayishlach Yaakov, (Further, 35:23-26.)  for there it mentions Leah and Rachel and then the maid-servants.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>YE KNOW THAT MY WIFE BORE ME TWO SONS. If we say [that Jacob’s intention was to point out] that Benjamin is the only one left to his mother, why is this a reason [for his saying that if some harm will befall him] it will bring down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave? (Verse 29 here.)  After all, he has many sons and grandchildren, and Benjamin’s mother has already died, and she would no longer weep over him in Jacob’s presence. The meaning of the verse, however, is that Jacob took only Rachel as a wife on his own initiative. This is the sense of the words, my wife bore me: “for from a woman that was my wife of my own will there have been only two sons born to me, and I have bestowed my love upon them as if they were my only ones, the rest being to me as if they were children of concubines. And with his brother Joseph dead, this one alone is my only son whom I have loved.” It is for this reason that Scripture mentions Rachel before Leah: Like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; (Ruth 4:11.)  And he called Rachel and Leah to the field. (Above, 31:4.)  Rachel took precedence in his mind. The commentators (See Rashi further 46:19.)  have said that the reason why Scripture in this Seder says, The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife, (Further, 46:19.)  is that she is called his wife in truth, without any deception. In my opinion, however, this is because Rachel is mentioned there among the handmaids, as I have already so mentioned. (Above, 31:33 and 37:2. Ramban agrees with the principle as he himself explains it in connection with the verse above, 31:4. However, he points out that in the verse further, 46:19, the term, Jacob’s wife, is independently justified.) </p>

Such nuances ‎in the Torah reveal to us that not all souls originate in the same ‎region of the diagram portraying the emanations.‎ When Esau, at this point questions his father if he has only ‎ברכה אתת‎, he asks whether his father cannot dispense a blessing ‎for people whose origin is not in the holy section of the ‎emanations, the section known as ‎אחת‎. He feels, that surely ‎seeing that he is his father’s son, his father must also be able to ‎have reserved a blessing for him! By asking this question he ‎contradicted the words of his father who had told him that the ‎blessing he had already bestowed on Yaakov that made him senior ‎to his older brother, i.e. ‎הוה גביר לאחיך‎, made this impossible. If he ‎were to give Esau a similar blessing he would in effect deprive ‎Yaakov of the blessing he had just given him. When Yitzchok ‎heard what Esau demanded of him, seeing that he had told him ‎that in his blessing he had made Yaakov the senior of the two, he ‎realized the full extent of Esau’s wickedness, and that is why he ‎added, now, without reservation, ‎גם ברוך יהיה‎, “he shall also ‎remain blessed!” Up until that moment Yitzchok had not realized ‎that Esau was a product of the ‎סטרא אחרא‎, the “left side” of the ‎scheme of emanations. Having found that out, he now gave Esau ‎a blessing that was in keeping with the “blessings” perceived as ‎such by souls that originate in that realm, i.e. ‎על חרבך תחיה‎, ‎‎“seeing that you are loyal to the principle that might is right,” ‎the principle espoused by people whose souls originate in the left ‎side of the emanations, people who believe in the survival of the ‎fittest, Yitzchok could only bless his son Esau by wishing him ‎‎“success” (death) when he would be involved in such lethal ‎encounters. He meant it in the sense that “until you pay the ‎price with your physical life you will not be able to secure for ‎yourself any life in the hereafter”. When such people lose their ‎lives when engaged in what they perceive as a “holy” war, they ‎may redeem themselves and secure life in the hereafter. ‎‎[This editor has often wondered it the concept of our ‎sages of a Mashiach ben Yoseph, a messiah who will die in battle ‎before the advent of the Mashiach ben David, the ultimate ‎redeemer, may not originate among the gentiles and earn his ‎right to his hereafter in the manner just described. Ed.]‎ Genesis 27,40. Let us turn now to the next part of Yitzchok’s ‎‎“blessing” to Easu, the words ‎והיה כאשר תריד ופרקת עולו מעל ‏צוארך‎, “but when you humble yourself you will be able to ‎remove the his yoke from around your neck.” ‎‎ According to Or Hachayim on our verse the word ‎והיה‎ in ‎the above verse is to be interpreted as a form of joy, ‎שמחה‎. ‎Contrary to the accepted translation of this line, Rashi ‎understands the word ‎תריד‎, as “when you will suffer pain.” ‎According to Proverbs 11,10 ‎באבוד רשעים רנה‎ “when the wicked ‎perish there is jubilation.” Isaiah 1,3 speaks about the ox ‎recognizing his owner. The fact is that when the ox wears a yoke ‎he does not recognize (in the sense of welcoming) his master ‎voluntarily, but only because he is forced to wear a yoke. When ‎the yoke is removed he will honour his master by still respecting ‎and welcoming him. Something parallel occurs in history about ‎the Israel/Esau relationship. As long as the Temple in Jerusalem ‎was standing, the gentile nations paid reluctant respect to the ‎Jewish people. Nowadays, when there is no longer a Temple in ‎Jerusalem, the yoke which had restrained the Gentiles has been ‎lifted from them, although their obligation, as a free willed ‎creature created in the image of G’d to respect G’d’s people has ‎not been lessened. G’d, after all, created this universe only for the ‎sake of His people, the Jewish people. According to Isaiah 40,17 ‎כל ‏האומות כעין נגדו מאפס ותוהו נחשבו לו‎, “All nations are as naught in ‎His sight; He accounts them as less than nothing.” This is in ‎essence what Yitzchok told Esau when he said ‎ופרקתו עולו מעל ‏צווארך‎, “even when you will divest yourself of the yoke of Yaakov, ‎in times when the Jewish people are in exile, as Rashi explains, ‎you will only remove this yoke from your neck, i.e. temporarily ‎during the time Israel is in exile, but inherently, your duty ‎toward G’d, whose representative on earth the Jewish people are, ‎will continue, just as an ox knows his master regardless if he is ‎restrained by a physical yoke or not.” Upon hearing this, Esau ‎raised his voice and wept, feeling frustrated that his father would ‎not give him a blessing that would neutralize the one he had ‎given to Yaakov. He had fully understood all the implications of ‎the few words Yitzchok had said to him.‎</p>

            <summary>Rabbi Pinḥas explains that the kings of the nations praised God for the Torah given to Israel, as it emphasized values like honoring parents and not stealing from the sacred. David, realizing the importance of kindness, ensured a proper burial for Saul and his sons, leading to acts of kindness throughout Israel and ultimately, divine mercy in the form of rain. This act also led to the conversion of many proselytes, showing how God draws the distant near and supports them.</summary>

                <h4>Bamidbar Rabbah 8:4</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>“A man or woman...” – this is what is written: “All the kings of the earth will praise You [yodukha], Lord, as they heard the words of Your mouth” (Psalms 138:4). Rabbi Pinḥas said: The kings of the nations of the world heard three matters from the Holy One blessed be He, and they stood from their thrones and praised [vehodu]. When the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah to Israel and said: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), the kings of the nations of the world said: He is saying as we would. What king would want another to reject him? Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He, when He said: “You shall have no [other gods]” (Exodus 20:3), they said: What king would want to have a partner? Likewise, when He said: “You shall not take [the name of the Lord your God in vain]” (Exodus 20:7), they said: What king would want people taking oaths in his name and lying? Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He, when He said: “Remember the Shabbat day” (Exodus 20:8), they said: What king would want people not to honor the day that he rested? But when He said: “Honor [your father and your mother]” (Exodus 20:12), they said: According to our protocols, anyone who registers himself to be subservient to the king, he renounces his parents; but this One declares and says: “Honor your father and your mother”? They arose from their thrones and praised him. (All the more so they praised him regarding the prohibitions against murder, adultery, stealing, bearing false testimony, and coveting.)   When the Holy One blessed be He said: “For what he misappropriated from the sacred he shall pay” (Leviticus 5:16), they said: According to our protocols, anyone who misappropriates a spinning hook from the emperor must give him the blade of a plow, (He is punished much more severely than a person who stole from a commoner, whereas the punishment for one who steals from the sacred (Leviticus 5:16) and one who steals from a commoner (Leviticus 5:24) is the same.)  but this One declares and says: “For what he misappropriated from the sacred he shall pay”? Moreover, He was more stringent regarding [sins against] with the commoner than He was regarding [sins against] the Most High, as regarding the Most High it is written: “A person who will commit a trespass, [and sins unwittingly]…” (Leviticus 5:15), and regarding a commoner it is written: “A person who shall sin, [and commit a trespass against the Lord]” (Leviticus 5:21); the Torah renders it as though it were intentional. (Although in both cases, one incurs liability to bring an offering only if the act was unwitting, regarding the trespass against the commoner, the word unwitting is not mentioned.)  Moreover, regarding this one, it precedes trespass to sin, while regarding that one, it precedes sin to trespass. This is true not only regarding an Israelite, but it is so even regarding one who robs a proselyte. Who is a God like this who loves those who love Him, and draws near the distant like those who come near in His name? They stood from their thrones and praised him.  Do not say it is only righteous proselytes who converted for the sake of Heaven that the Holy One blessed be He draws near; but even those who converted not for the sake of Heaven, the Holy One blessed be He demands an accounting for the affront to them. That is what is written: “There was a famine in the days of David [for three years, year after year, and David entreated of the Lord. The Lord said: For Saul, and for the bloody house, in that he put the Givonites to death]” (II Samuel 21:1). What is “year after year”? It teaches that they were three consecutive years. When David saw that the famine began to come in his days, he said: Due to the iniquity of five matters rain does not fall: It is due to the iniquity of idolaters, of engagers in illicit relations, of shedders of blood, of pledgers of charity in public who do not give, and due to the iniquity of those who do not distribute their tithes properly.   Due to the iniquity of idolaters, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Beware, lest your heart be seduced [and you stray and serve other gods]” (Deuteronomy 11:16), and it says: “The wrath of the Lord will be enflamed against you, [and He will restrain the heavens and there will be no rain]” (Deuteronomy 11:17).  Due to the iniquity of engagers in illicit relations, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “You defiled the land with your licentiousness…” (Jeremiah 3:2), and it says: “Raindrops were withheld and [there was no] late rain” (Jeremiah 3:3).  Due to the iniquity of shedders of blood, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “For blood defiles [yaḥanif] the land” (Numbers 35:33); blood will cause wrath to settle [yiḥan af] upon the land. (From the previous derivation, the result of wrath is: ”And He will restrain the heavens and there will be no rain.”)   Due to the iniquity of pledgers of charity in public who do not give, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Clouds and wind but no rain” (Proverbs 25:14). Why? [Because of] “a man who glories in a false gift” (Proverbs 25:14).  Due to the iniquity of those who do not distribute their tithes properly, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Bring all the tithe to the storehouse…[test Me now with this…if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out an endless blessing for you]” (Malachi 3:10).  During the first year, David began admonishing his generation during the pilgrimage festival, and he said to them: Are there, perhaps, people among you who are idolaters, as the heavens are restrained from having rain fall only due to that iniquity? They went out and sought, but did not find. The second year, he said to them: Are there, perhaps, illicit sexual relations among you, as the heavens are restrained only due to that? They went out and sought, but did not find. The third year, he said to them: Are there, perhaps, shedders of blood, pledgers of charity in public who do not give, or withholders of tithes among you, as the heavens are restrained only due to them? They went out and sought, but did not find.  From then on, David said: The matter is dependent solely upon me. He began consulting the Urim and the Tumim. That is what is written: “David entreated of the Lord” (II Samuel 21:1). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: That [indicates] he consulted the Urim and the Tumim. Rabbi Elazar said that the source of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish is that he derives a verbal analogy: penei, penei. Here it is written: “David entreated of the Lord [penei Hashem],” and there it is written: “Before [velifnei] Elazar the priest he shall stand, and he will inquire for him [regarding the judgment of the Urim before the Lord]” (Numbers 27:21).   The Holy One blessed be He said to him: David, you are protected from sin; rather, it is due to Saul and the bloody house. That is what is written: “The Lord said: For Saul, and for the bloody house, [in that he put the Givonites to death]” (II Samuel 21:1). “For Saul” – because you did not perform kindness with him and he was not eulogized properly. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: David, is he not Saul who was anointed with the anointing oil? Is he not Saul, who, during his reign, no idol worship was performed in Israel? Is he not Saul, whose portion is with Samuel the prophet, and you are in the land [of Israel] and he is outside the land? (He is buried in Yavesh Gilad, which is located east of the Jordan River.)   “And for the bloody house in that he put the Givonites to death” (II Samuel 21:1) – Where do we find that he put the Givonites to death? Rather, due to the fact that he killed [the residents] of Nov, the city of priests, to whom they would supply water and food, the verse ascribes to him as though he put them to death. (The Givonites would earn their livelihood by supplying food and water to Nov.)  Rabbi Elazar said: It is written: “Seek the Lord, all you humble of the earth, who have performed his judgment” (Zephaniah 2:3). What is “who performed his judgment”? It is that he implements His judgment and His reward for performance simultaneously. You find the Holy One blessed be He demanding justice for the Givonites from Saul, and remembering Saul’s deeds in order to pay him a good reward.  At that moment, David said: Is it on behalf of these proselytes that the Holy One blessed be He did so to His people? The Holy One blessed be He said to him: If you distance the distant, ultimately, you will distance those who are near. Come and learn from your master Joshua, who, when the Givonites said: “Come up to us quickly, and save us and help us” (Joshua 10:6), Joshua said: Will we burden the community on behalf of these proselytes? The Holy One blessed be He said to Joshua: If you distance the distant, ultimately, you will distance those who are near. Go out and learn from where are your origins? Are they not from strangers, as it is stated: “To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born…[Manasseh and Ephraim]” (Genesis 46:20), and it is written: “For the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea (Hoshea is Joshua (Numbers 13:16).)  son of Nun (Numbers 13:8)?  Immediately, “the king summoned the Givonites and spoke with them. The Givonites [were not of the children of Israel…and the children of Israel had taken an oath to them]” (II Samuel 21:2). “The Givonites were not of the children of Israel” – how is this matter relevant here? Rather, this is what the verse is saying: Because David summoned the Givonites and spoke with them, but they did not accept it (His offer of compensation.)  from him, that is why “the Givonites were not of the children of Israel,” as David arose and distanced them that they may not marry with the congregation [of Israel]. That is what we learned: The netinim (This is a reference to the Givonites, based on the verse: “Joshua rendered them [vayitnem] that day hewers of wood and drawers of water” (Joshua 9:27).)  may not enter the congregation. (See Mishna Yevamot (78:2).)  At that moment, David said: The Holy One blessed be He gave three gifts to Israel: Being merciful, self-effacing, and performers of acts of kindness. Merciful, as it is stated: “He will give you mercy, and He will be merciful to you, and He will increase you” (Deuteronomy 13:18). Self-effacing, as it is written: “So that His fear will be on your faces, so that you will not sin” (Exodus 20:17) – this is a sign for the self-effacing that they do not sin. Anyone who does not have the quality of self-effacement, it is a certainty that his ancestors did not stand at Mount Sinai. Performers of acts of kindness, as it is stated: “So that he shall command his children and his household [after him…to perform righteousness and justice]” (Genesis 18:19), and it is written: “The Lord your God will maintain for you the covenant and the kindness” (Deuteronomy 7:12). And these have none of these qualities in them. Immediately, he arose and distanced them. That is what is written: “The Givonites were not of the children of Israel” – they are not worthy to become intermingled with them. Even though they are proselytes, their ancestors did not stand at Mount Sinai, because they are considered to be of the Canaanites. That is what is written: “But rather from the remnant of the Emorites” (II Samuel 21:2). What is written in their regard? “You shall not marry them” (Deuteronomy 7:3). These too, like them, are not worthy to cleave to Israel.  One verse says: “The men of Israel said to the Hivites…” (Joshua 9:7), but here, it calls them Emorites. Rather, they were from the Emorites. Why, then, does it call them Hivite? It is because they performed the act of the serpent. (Serpent is ḥivya in Aramaic.)  The serpent said: I know that the Holy One blessed be He said to you: “As on the day that you eat of it you will die” (Genesis 2:17). Rather, I will go and deceive them. They will eat and be punished, and I will inherit the earth for myself. The Givonites did the same. They said: We know that the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: “Rather, you shall destroy them, the Hittites, the Emorites…” (Deuteronomy 20:17), “You shall not make a covenant with them…” (Deuteronomy 7:2). Rather, we will go and deceive them, and they will make a covenant with us. Perforce, either they will put us to death and will violate the oath or they will sustain us and will violate the decree. In any case they will be punished, and we will inherit the land for ourselves. Therefore, when Joshua saw that this was so, he said to them: “Why did you deceive us…?” (Joshua 9:23). Joshua said to them: You performed the act of the serpent; therefore, you will receive the retribution of the serpent. Rabbi Elazar said: He cursed them like the serpent, as it is written: “Now, you are accursed” (Joshua 9:23), just as it is written regarding the serpent: “You are more accursed than all the animals” (Genesis 3:14).  What is, “the children of Israel took an oath to them” (II Samuel 21:2)? David said: When the children of Israel took an oath to them, they left the matter dependent upon me, so that if I wish to distance them or to draw them near, I have license to do so. I am distancing them. From where is it derived that they left the matter dependent upon David? It is written: “Joshua rendered them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water [for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord to this day, in the place that He would choose]” (Joshua 9:27). Rabbi Ami said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: After it said: “For the congregation and for the altar of the Lord,” what need was there to say: “In the place that He would choose [yivḥar]”? Rather, Joshua left it dependent upon David. He said: I will neither draw them near nor distance them. Rather, the one who is destined to build the Temple [beit habeḥira], if he arrives at the decision to draw them near, he will draw them near; to distance them, he will distance them. When David came and saw that they were cruel, he distanced them. Ezra, too, distanced them, as it is written: “The netinim lived in the Ofel…” (Nehemiah 11:21). (They were distinct from the rest of Israel.)  In the future, too, the Holy One blessed be He will distance them, as it is stated: “Those who labor in the city, (The midrash is explaining that “those who labor in the city” refers to the Givonites, who were drawers of water and hewers of wood for the altar in Jerusalem.)  will till it [yaavduhu], from all the tribes of Israel.” (Ezekiel 48:19) – they will be eradicated [ye’abeduhu] from all the tribes of Israel.   “Saul sought to smite them” (II Samuel 21:2) – even though he did not smite them, they acted cruelly toward him. This is to teach you that David did not distance them for naught. “In his zeal on behalf of the children of Israel and Judah” (II Samuel 21:2) – even though Saul became angry at them only due to the zeal that he had on behalf of Israel and Judah, and he did so not due to hatred that he hated them. Nevertheless, they did not have mercy on his offspring. What is that zeal? It is due to the fact that they did not reveal to him where David was hiding.  Immediately, David sent and summoned them: What is with you and the house of Saul? They said to him: It is because he put an end to our livelihood, and he put seven of our people to death; two hewers of wood, two drawers of water, an official, a scribe, and an attendant. He said to them: What do you seek now? That is what is written: “David said to the Givonites: “What shall I do for you? With what shall I atone, so that you will bless the inheritance of the Lord” (II Samuel 21:3)? He said to them: What benefit will there be for you if you kill a person from the house of Saul? Rather, tell me with what remedy shall I provide you so you will be placated? How much silver and gold shall I give you as ransom for your lives? “With what shall I atone [akhaper],” just as it says: “When ransom [kofer] is imposed upon him, he shall give redemption of his life” (Exodus 21:30), so that the famine will cease? That is what is written: “So that you will bless the inheritance of the Lord”; just as it says: “Jacob blessed Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:7), he blessed him that the famine would cease.   “The Givonites said to him: We have [lanu] no silver or gold with Saul or with his house” (II Samuel 21:4) – li is written, but it is read lanu. (Li means “I have,” whereas lanu means “we have.”)  Why is it so? David said to them: ‘What benefit would there be for you in their being killed? Take silver and gold for yourselves.’ They said to him: ‘We do not seek silver and gold from Saul and from his house. He did not owe us any money so that we should take money from him, but rather, he owes us lives and we seek lives.’ David said: Perhaps this half of them is intimidated by the other half. He took each one separately and sought to placate him by himself. He said to him: ‘What benefit would there be for you in their being killed? Take money.’ He said to him: ‘I have no silver or gold with Saul or with his house. We have no interest in seeking any others, but only him, as his servants did not wish to extend their hand against the priests, nor against us,’ as it is stated: “But the king's servants were unwilling to extend their hand to harm the priests of the Lord” (I Samuel 22:17). That is, “We would not have any man in Israel put to death” (II Samuel 21:4).  When David saw that they did not accept it from him, he said to them: ‘What do you say that I should do for you? If it is lives that you seek, I will do it.’ That is what is written: “What do you say that I shall do for you?” (II Samuel 21:4). When David said that to them, they said to him: ‘We do not seek to exact retribution against him for his full measure. He sought to destroy us all, so we would have no standing within the entire boundary of Israel; we are not demanding all his offspring, but only seven, corresponding to the seven that he killed from us.’ That is what is written: “They said to the king: The man who eradicated us [asher kilanu], and who devised against us, [so that we would be destroyed from standing within the entire border of Israel]” (II Samuel 21:5). Asher kilanu contains seven letters, corresponding to the seven people among them whom he put to death. “Let seven men of his offspring be given to us, and we will impale them before the Lord in Giva of Saul, chosen of the Lord” (II Samuel 21:6) – so that the entire world will see, will be afraid, and will no longer continue to mistreat proselytes. That is why it is written: “Before the Lord,” as He commanded to treat proselytes well, but he mistreated them. Why in Giva of Saul? So that they will know that if the Holy One blessed be He did not show favor to the king, all the more so to commoners.  “Chosen of the Lord” (II Samuel 21:6)? They are denouncing him and calling him “chosen of the Lord”? Rather, they said: “In Giva of Saul,” and a Divine Voice emerged and said: “Chosen of the Lord.”  When David saw that his problem was a problem, he told them: ‘I will give.’ That is what is written: “The king said: I will give” (II Samuel 21:6). “The king had compassion for Mefivoshet son of Yonatan [son of Saul]” (II Samuel 21:7) – because he was a great Torah personality, David set his sights on rescuing him from their hand. David said: I will pass them before the altar. Anyone whom the altar accepts will be under its auspices. He passed them before the altar and prayed on his behalf, and the altar went and accepted him. That is what is written: “I cry out to God Most High, to the Almighty who accomplishes for me” (Psalms 57:3); the Holy One blessed be He agreed with David. “The king took the two sons of Ritzpa daughter of Aya, whom she bore to Saul…[and the five sons of Mikhal daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel son of Barzilai the Meḥolatite]” (II Samuel 21:8). But is it not written: “Mikhal daughter of Saul did not have a child until the day of her death” (II Samuel 6:23)? And where is Merav? (Merav was married to Adriel (I Samuel 18:19).)  Say now that they were the sons of Merav, but Mikhal raised them and they are attributed to her name. “He gave them into the hand of the Givonites, and they impaled them on the mountain before the Lord. The seven of them [shevatam] fell together” (II Samuel 21:9). Shevatam is written without a yod; (As opposed to shivatayim.)  this is Mefivoshet, who was spared, who was lacking from the seven.  “And they were put to death during the first days of harvest, at the beginning of barley harvest” (II Samuel 21:9) – it teaches that they were killed on the sixteenth of Nisan, the day on which the omer is sacrificed.  “Ritzpa daughter of Aya took sackcloth, and spread it for herself over the rock [hatzur]” (II Samuel 21:10) – what is “over the rock”? Rabbi Hoshaya said: “As she would say: “The Rock, His deeds are perfect” (Deuteronomy 32:4).  “From the beginning of harvest until water dripped upon them from the heavens” (II Samuel 21:10) – Rabbi Aḥa bar Zevina said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya the Great: Sanctifying the Name is greater than profaning the Name. Regarding profaning the Name, it is written: “His corpse shall not remain overnight upon the tree” (Deuteronomy 21:23). (Leaving a corpse hanging on the tree for an extended time is considered to be profaning the Name. See Rashi on Deuteronomy 21:23.)  Regarding sanctifying the Name, it is written: “From the beginning of harvest until water dripped upon them from the heavens.” (The sanctification of the Name caused by leaving them on the tree for an extended period outweighs the profanation of the Name caused by leaving them.)  It teaches that they remained hanging from the sixteenth of Nisan until the seventeenth of Marḥeshvan.  But is it not written: “Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, [and sons shall not be put to death for the fathers]” (Deuteronomy 24:16)? But sons died for the sin of their father. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is preferable for one letter to be uprooted from the Torah than to have the name of Heaven profaned in public. The nations of the world were saying: The Torah of these is fraudulent; it is written in their Torah: “His corpse shall not remain overnight” (Deuteronomy 21:23), and these are hanging for seven months. It is written in their Torah: Two are not sentenced on one day, (Mishna Sanhedrin 45b.)  and these seven were [sentenced] together. It is written in the Torah: “Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, [and sons shall not be put to death for the fathers],” but these were killed for the sin of their fathers. They were asking: What did these do that the attribute of justice was altered in their regard? Israel would say to them: ‘It is because their ancestors extended their hand to mistreat unsought proselytes.’ They said to them: ‘What is their nature?’ They [Israel] said to them: ‘These are the proselytes who converted in the days of Joshua.’ They said to them: ‘It is on behalf of these accursed unsought proselytes that the Holy One blessed be He did so to His people? If this is so for the sons of kings, all the more so for commoners. If for these who did not convert for the sake of Heaven, see how the Holy One blessed be He exacted punishment for their blood, one who converts for the sake of Heaven, all the more so. Certainly, there is no god like their God, and there is no nation like their nation, and we should cleave only to this nation, whose God is greater than any god.’ Immediately, many proselytes converted from the nations of the world, at that moment, one hundred fifty thousand, as it is stated: “Solomon counted all the proselytes who were in the Land of Israel, after the count that David his father counted them; and they were found to be one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred” (II Chronicles 2:16). Solomon rendered from among them seventy thousand porters and eighty thousand quarriers in the mountains, as it is stated: “Solomon counted seventy thousand porters [and eighty thousand quarriers in the mountains.]” (II Chronicles 2:1).  Why to that extent? It is to inform that the Holy One blessed be He draws the distant near and supports the distant like the near. Moreover, he gives precedence to the distant over the near, as it is stated: “Peace, peace, for the distant and the near” (Isaiah 57:19). That is, “until water dripped upon them from the heavens” (II Samuel 21:10).   What is “she did not allow the birds of the heavens to rest upon them” (II Samuel 21:10)? Come and see the kindness that Ritzpa daughter of Aya performed on their behalf, as she protected them during the day from the birds of the heavens and at night from the beasts of the field, for seven months. Although the Holy One blessed be He had said to David that it was for Saul, because he was not eulogized properly and he is buried outside the land, David was dilatory regarding the eulogy, as he said: Twelve months of the year have passed already, and it is not customary to mourn for him. When they told him of the actions of Ritzpa daughter of Aya, he reasoned an a fortiori inference himself: If she, who is a woman, acted so in performance of kindness, I, who am king, all the more so. Immediately, he went to perform kindness for them. That is what is written: “It was reported to David what [Ritzpa daughter of Aya] had done.… David went and took the bones of Saul [and the bones of Yonatan his son].… He took up from there the bones of Saul [and the bones of Yonatan his son, and they collected the bones of the impaled]’ (II Samuel 21:11–13). What did David do? He stood and assembled all the elders of Israel and the eminent among them, and they crossed the Jordan and came to Yavesh Gilad. They located the bones of Saul and Yonatan, placed them in a coffin, and crossed the Jordan, as it is stated: “They buried the bones of Saul and Yehonatan his son [in the land of Benjamin in Tzela, in the grave of Kish his father. They did everything that the king commanded]” (II Samuel 21:14). What is “in Tzela, in the grave of Kish his father”? It teaches that they brought him to the border of Jerusalem and buried him there, as Tzela is alongside Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And Tzela, HaElef, and the Yevusite, which is Jerusalem…” (Joshua 18:28).  “They did everything that the king commanded” (II Samuel 21:14) – what did the king command? He commanded that they should circulate Saul’s coffin to each and every tribe. The tribe into which Saul’s coffin entered would emerge, they, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, and they performed kindness for Saul and his sons, so that all of Israel would fulfill their obligation with the performance of acts of kindness. They did so until they reached his ancestral land, to the border of Jerusalem.   When the Holy One blessed be He saw that all of Israel had performed acts of kindness for him and had executed justice for the Givonites, He immediately became filled with mercy and provided rain on the land, as it is stated: “God acceded to the entreaty of the land thereafter” (II Samuel 21:14). We learned the extent to which the Holy One blessed be He draws the distant near, even though they converted not for the sake of Heaven, and it goes without saying regarding righteous proselytes. That is, “all kings of the earth will praise You, Lord…” (Psalms 138:4).</p>

            <summary>Rashi explains that the word הוסדה in Exodus 9:18 means &quot;when it was founded&quot; and notes that verbs with a first root-letter of י, like יסד, ילד, ידע, and יסר, change to a ו in the Hithpael sense.

        <summary>Naaman, a son of Benjamin, had ten sons whose names reflected his connection to his lost brother Joseph, showing various aspects of their relationship and eventual reconciliation. The families of Ard and Naaman are considered separate due to their mother being pregnant when they went to Egypt. Benjamin's ten sons are seen as a blessing from God, fulfilling the destiny of the twelve tribes originally meant for Joseph. The descendants of Benjamin were divided into clans, with additional interpretations of their names provided in Targum Jonathan. Joseph's improper emission of semen led to Benjamin having ten sons named after Joseph instead of the twelve tribes descending from him, as explained in the Talmud.</summary>

            <summary>Naaman was a son of Benjamin, not to be confused with his grandson also named Naaman. The sons of Benjamin listed in Genesis 46:21 are Bela, Bekher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Mupim, Hupim, and Ard. The discrepancy in the number of Benjamin's sons can be explained by the birth of an additional son after their descent to Egypt. The vowel kametz is used in the vocalization of the letter ו in the name Ard.</summary>

              <p>בלע ובכר, we must not make an issue of the number of Binyamin’s sons, as according to the report in Chronicles I 8,15 there were 11 sons. We must simply assume that at the time when Binyamin descended to Egypt the eleventh son had not yet been born. The difference in some of their names may also be accounted as due to their being listed once more. This is something we find also in other instances where the Bible records the same people more than once.</p>

            <summary>Judah tries to prove Benjamin's innocence by discussing the names of his sons, which reflect his love for his lost brother Joseph. Benjamin's ten sons' names are based on Joseph's experiences, showing his connection to his lost brother. Benjamin's sons' names reflect various aspects of his relationship with Joseph, such as being swallowed up, being taken captive, and not seeing each other's wedding canopies. Benjamin's sons' names also reflect Joseph's righteousness and the eventual reconciliation between Joseph and his brothers. Benjamin's ten sons are seen as a blessing from God, as an addition that is greater than the original gift. Benjamin's offering in the Temple is also seen as significant, reflecting his righteousness and connection to Joseph.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>“On the ninth day, prince of the children of Benjamin, Avidan son of Gidoni” (Numbers 7:60).  “On the ninth day, prince of the children of Benjamin, Avidan son of Gidoni” – why did Benjamin present his offering after Joseph’s sons? It is because, just as the Divine Presence was in Joseph’s portion in Shilo, so, it rested in Benjamin’s portion in the Temple in Jerusalem. Alternatively, it is based on what the verse said: “Rouse Your might before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, and come to our rescue” (Psalms 80:3). (The midrash here is based on the fact that Ephraim and Manasseh cannot be separated; see section 6.)  “His offering was one silver dish, its weight one hundred and thirty; one silver basin of seventy shekels, in the sacred shekel; both of them full of high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering” (Numbers 7:61).  “His offering was one silver dish [kaarat]…” – do not read it as kaarat, but rather as akeret, corresponding to Rachel, who was the pillar of the household; she was the principal [ikar] of Jacob’s household, as it is stated: “The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin” (Genesis 46:19). And it says: “Rachel died on me” (Genesis 48:7). “One silver” – as on the basis of her prayer, Benjamin was born, as it is stated: “She called his name Joseph, saying: May the Lord add another son for me” (Genesis 30:24). In her regard it is stated: “The tongue of the righteous is choice silver” (Proverbs 10:20) – the tongue of a righteous woman. “Its weight one hundred and thirty” – as Benjamin was born when Jacob was one hundred years old. That is why he was named Benjamin [Binyamin], (Son of yamin, whose numerical value is: Yod – 10; mem – 40; nun – 50; which sum to 100. In many verses there is only one yod in the word Binyamin.)  as he was born when his father was one hundred years old. And he was thirty years old when he descended to Egypt. That is one hundred and thirty.  “One silver basin” – it is a basin, it is a goblet, corresponding to Joseph, who assessed the righteousness of his brothers regarding Benjamin by means of the goblet. When Joseph saw that Judah sacrificed himself on behalf of Benjamin, he recognized his brothers’ righteousness and made himself known to them. Because Joseph would drink wine [yayin], whose numerical value is seventy, (Yod – 10; yod – 10; nun – 50; which sum to 70.)  from the goblet, therefore, the weight of the basin was “seventy…in the sacred shekel.” “Both of them full” – both of them were equal, Joseph and Benjamin, as the Tabernacle was established in Joseph’s portion in Shilo, and the Temple in Benjamin’s portion in Jerusalem. That is, “high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering.”   “One gold ladle of ten shekels, filled with incense” (Numbers 7:62).  “One gold ladle of ten shekels, filled with incense” – corresponding to ten sons that Benjamin had when he descended to Egypt, as it is stated: “The sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Bekher, [and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Eḥi, and Rosh, Mupim, and Hupim, and Ard]” (Genesis 46:21), and they were all righteous. That is, “filled with incense.”  “One young bull, one ram, one lamb in its first year, as a burnt offering” (Numbers 7:63).  “One goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 7:64).  “One young bull, [one ram, one lamb]” – these are three species of burnt offering corresponding to the three times that the Temple is built in his portion: one in the era of Solomon, one in the era of those who ascended from the exile, and the third, in the Messianic Era. “One goat as a sin offering” – it corresponds to the structure that Herod built, which was built by a sinful king, and whose construction served as atonement for him for having killed the Sages of Israel. (See Bava Batra 4a.)  “And for the peace offering, two bulls, five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Avidan son of Gidoni” (Numbers 7:65).  “And for the peace offering, two bulls” – corresponding to two kings who emerged from Benjamin, Saul and Ish Boshet. Alternatively, it corresponds to the two redeemers who emerged from him, Mordekhai and Esther.  “Five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year” – there are three species, five of each, corresponding to the three advantages of five each that Benjamin received; they were: “Benjamin’s gift was five times greater that the gifts of all of them” (Genesis 43:34). “To Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of garments” (Genesis 45:22). The third, this is Mordekhai, who was from Benjamin, and who was privileged to don five royal garments, as it is stated: “Mordekhai went out from before the king in royal garments of sky-blue and white, with a great golden crown, and a cloak of fine linen and purple wool” (Esther 8:15).   “This was the offering of Avidan…” – since he presented the offering in this order, the Holy One blessed be He began lauding his offering: “This was the offering of Avidan…”</p>

              <p>“To these the land shall be distributed [as an inheritance, according to the number of names]” (Numbers 26:53) – who were they? It was to the people standing at the plains of Moav. But was the land not divided to those who departed from Egypt, as it is written: “I will give it you as a heritage” (Exodus 6:8)? Why did He not divide it among them? It is because it was foreseen before the Holy One blessed be He that ultimately, families are destined to be eliminated from them. Who were they? Those who are written above: “The sons of Simeon: Yemuel, and Yamin, and Ohad, and Yakhin, and Tzoḥar, and Shaul son of the Canaanite woman” (Genesis 46:10) – they are six. When you read: “For Nemuel, the Nemuelite family, [for Yamin…Yakhin…Zeraḥ…Shaul]” (Numbers 26:12), one of them is missing. Likewise regarding Benjamin: “The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Bekher, [Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Eḥi, Rosh, Mupim, Ḥupim, and Ard” (Genesis 46:21) – they are ten. When you came to count them: “For Bela, the Balite family, [for Ashbel…Aḥiram…Shefufam…Ḥufam]” (Numbers 26:38–39) – five of the sons are missing. These are six families, because of the harlotry at the counsel of Bilam. There is never a case [of harlotry] where it does not have its effect. (A plague.)  That is why the Holy One blessed be He said: Why would I distribute the land to people who are destined to die? When they came to the plains of Moav and stood in their entirety, the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “To these the land shall be distributed.”</p>

              <p>“And her name was Ketura” – Rav said: This is Hagar. Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: ‘But is it not written “[Abraham took] another [vayosef]”?’ He said to him: ‘[That means only that] he married her on the basis of a divine command, just as it says: “The Lord continued [vayosef] speaking to me again, saying”’ (Isaiah 8:5). He said to him: ‘But is it not written “and her name was Ketura”?’ He said to him: ‘That is because she was perfumed [mekuteret] with mitzvot and good deeds.’ [He said to him:] But is it not written: “And to the sons of the concubines (Plural. If Hagar and Ketura were one and the same, Abraham would have had only one concubine.)  of Abraham [Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he was still alive…]”?’ (Genesis 25:6). He said to him: ‘Pilagsham (The omission of the yud intimates that the word could be interpreted as a single concubine.)  is written. “While he was still alive [ḥai]” – [this alludes to Hagar] the one who had sat by the well and said to the One who lives [ḥai] forever: See my misery.’  Rabbi Berekhya said: Even though it says: “She [Hagar] went off and wandered in the wilderness…” (Genesis 21:14), lest you say that perhaps some person was suspected [of becoming immorally involved] with her, the verse states: “And her name was Ketura” – from the word ‘bound up’ [ketar]; she was like one who seals a treasure and takes it out bound and sealed. (Her name indicates that she was chaste after leaving Abraham.)   Bar Kappara said: Additions [tosafto] that are granted by the Holy One blessed be He are even greater than the original item. Cain was the original son [of Eve], and Abel, because he was considered an addition, as it is written: “She continued [vatosef] giving birth…[to Abel]” (Genesis 4:2) – he was born with his two twin sisters. (Whereas Cain was born with just one twin sister (see Bereshit Rabba 22:2).)    Joseph was the original son [of Rachel], and Benjamin, because addition is written in his regard, (See Genesis 30:24.)  he produced ten children, as it is written: “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Bekher…” (Genesis 46:21).   Er was the original son [of Judah], and Shela, because an expression of addition is used for him, (See Genesis 38:5.)  he produced ten courts. That is what is written in Chronicles: “The sons of Shela son of Judah: Er, father (The term father in this passage refers to the head of a court.)  of Lekha; and Lada father of Maresha; and the families of the house of the craft of fine linen, of the house of Ashbe’a...” (I Chronicles 4:21–23).  Job’s age was originally (Before he began to suffer from his afflictions.)  only seventy years, and one hundred and forty years were added to his life, as it is written: “After this, Job lived for one hundred and forty years” (Job 42:16).  Hezekiah’s original reign (Before being reprimanded by Isaiah and praying for forgiveness (Isaiah 38:1–3).)  was only fourteen years, but fifteen years were added to it, as it is stated: “Behold, I am adding fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5).  Ishmael was the original son, and the sons of Ketura, because an expression of addition is used regarding them (Genesis 25:1.)  [the verse tells us] “She bore him Zimran…” (Genesis 25:2).

His actions were fine and pleasant, and he was taken captive from me, and I gave them names based on his experience. “Bela” – as he was swallowed [nivla] up from me; “Bekher” – as he was my firstborn [bekhor] [brother]; “Ashbel” – as he was taken captive [nishba] from me; “Gera” – as he resides [gar] in another land; “Naaman” – as his actions were fine [na’im] and pleasant [ne’imim]; “Eḥi” – as he was my full-fledged brother [aḥi]; “and Rosh” – as he was a leader [rosh] for me, and he was the head [roshan] of his brothers, as it is stated: “May his blessing rest on the head of [lerosh] Joseph” (Deuteronomy 33:16); “Mupim” – as he was very fine [yafeh] in all respects, and all the halakhot that Shem and Ever transmitted to Jacob, he transmitted to him.

(They would break idols, and make cutting remarks and disdainful facial expressions about idolatry (see Yefeh To’ar; Etz Yosef). However, see Matnot Kehuna, where these statements are interpreted to mean that they fashioned idols and made disparaging comments toward God. )  “And Guni” – they spoke in derogatory [megunim] language. “And Yetzer” – their [evil] inclination was stronger than that of all [other] people. “And Shilem” – they were devoted [mushlamim] to their inclination (Alternatively, they were devoted to God despite their strong evil inclination (Yefeh To’ar). )  and would repay [umshalmin] goodness with evil.</p>

              <p>“The Lord, God of your fathers [shall add to you one thousand times as you are…]” (Deuteronomy 1:11) – Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov said: In considering Moses’s blessings, they contain [unlimited blessing] from one end of the world to the other. What is written? “One thousand times [pe’amim]” – “one thousand times [paam]” is not written here, but rather, “one thousand times [pe’amim].” (The plural term pe’amim is employed, rather than the singular paam. This is  expounded to mean one thousand times one thousand.)   Another matter, “shall add to you…as you are” – Rabbi Aḥa said: Israel could have said to him: ‘Our master Moses, are we responsible for any of the matters regarding which you are rebuking us?’ (They could have responded to him that he was rebuking them for the sins of their parents, for which they were not responsible (Etz Yosef). )  Nevertheless, they accepted his rebukes and were silent. (Translation based on the textual emendation suggested in Etz Yosef. )  That is why it says: “As you are” – righteous like you, who receive rebukes and are silent.  Another matter, why did he bless them with an expression of addition? It is because the addition of the Holy One, blessed be He, is larger than the principal. The way of the world is that a person takes from another a litra of meat, and says to him: ‘Add more for me.’ How much does he add for him? One ounce. But the Holy One blessed be He, His addition is larger than the principal. How so? Isaac was the principal son for Abraham. But what He added for [Abraham] was more numerous than the principal, as it is stated: “Abraham took an additional wife” (Genesis 25:1). (Abraham’s additional wife, Keturah, bore him six sons (see Genesis 25:2); many more than the one son, Isaac, who was his principal son. )   Joseph was the principal son for Rachel, Benjamin was an addition. From where is this derived? As it is written: “May the Lord add another son for me” (Genesis 30:24). What is written? “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Bekher, and Ashbel…” (Genesis 46:21) – they are more than Joseph. (Benjamin had ten sons, many more than Joseph, who had only two sons. )   Hezekiah’s principal reign was fourteen years. What the Holy One blessed be He added for him was more numerous than the principal. From where is this derived? As it is stated: “I will add fifteen years to your days” (Isaiah 38:5) – the addition of the Holy One blessed be He was more numerous than the principal. That is why [Moses] blessed them with an expression of addition.   “And He will bless you” (Deuteronomy 1:11) – Rabbi Levi said: To what is the matter comparable? To a king who told the commander of his army to distribute to each of his soldiers a litra of gold. (There are one hundred gold pieces in a litra.)  He went and gave some of them five gold pieces and some of them ten gold pieces. They said to him: ‘The king told you to give each of us a litra of gold, and you gave each of us five gold pieces?’ He said to them: ‘These are from what is mine; when the king comes, he will give you from what is his.’ So Israel said to Moses: ‘The Holy One blessed be He did not set a limit for our blessings, and you said one thousand times?’ He said to them: ‘What I blessed you, I blessed you from my own; the Holy One blessed be He will bless you “as He spoke to you”’ (Deuteronomy 1:11).</p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 30:24): MAY THE LORD ADD (yosef) [ANOTHER SON FOR ME. Resh Laqish said:] The addition of the Holy One is greater than the original &lt; gift &gt;. (Above, 5:10; see Gen. R. 61:4.)  From whom do you learn this? From Hezekiah, whose reign was fourteen years; but, when the Holy One made an addition for him, he added fifteen years. Thus it is stated (in II Kings 20:6): AND I WILL ADD FIFTEEN YEARS TO YOUR LIFE. Ergo, the addition is greater than the original. And so you find in the case of Benjamin, when his mother said to him (in Gen. 30:24): MAY THE LORD ADD (yosef) ANOTHER SON FOR ME, the Holy One also added for her ten tribes from him and two tribes from Joseph. (Thus the addition (Benjamin) was five times greater than the original (Joseph). Gen. R. 61:4 cites the list of Benjamin’s ten sons in Gen. 46:21.)  R. Samuel bar Nahman said: The Holy One raised up twelve tribes from Rachel, ten from Benjamin and two from Joseph. And where is it shown that &lt; the ten &gt; were sons of Benjamin? Where it is written (in I Sam. 9:21): THEN SAUL ANSWERED AND SAID: AM I NOT A BENJAMINITE, FROM THE SMALLEST OF THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL, [AND MY CLAN THE SMALLEST OF THE CLANS OF THE TRIBES OF BENJAMIN]? And another verse says (in Jud. 20:12): AND {SAUL} [THE TRIBES OF ISRAEL] SENT [PEOPLE] AMONG ALL THE TRIBES OF BENJAMIN, SAYING. When the prophets saw that the addition was greater than the original, they began to bless Israel with the addition (rt.: YSP). Moses our Master said (in Deut. 1:11): MAY THE LORD GOD OF YOUR ANCESTORS ADD (rt.: YSP) TO YOUR NUMBERS &lt; A THOUSAND TIMES &gt; MORE THAN YOU ARE.

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): When Judah saw that Joseph was not appeased, he began saying to his brothers: [Why] are we standing around? We will begin with this one and wind up with Pharaoh! Now they did not know that Joseph understood their language, as stated (in Gen. 42:23): NOW THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT JOSEPH UNDERSTOOD. When Joseph saw that, he began to talk to them with supplications and with gentle language. He said to them: About this Benjamin, I want only to know who &lt; it was that &gt; advised him to steal the goblet. Did you perhaps advise him to steal the goblet? When Benjamin heard that, he said: They did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. He said to them: Swear to me. He began to swear to him. By what did he swear to him? By the separation of my brother Joseph from me, (This clause may also be translated as follows: “By the scriptural section on the separation of my brother Joseph from me (in Gen. 37:18-36).”)  I did not touch it. Now &lt; I swear &gt; neither by the launching of arrows which were sent against him, as stated (in Gen. 49:23): ARCHERS HAVE HATED HIM (Joseph); nor by the stripping with which they stripped him, as stated (in Gen. 37:23): THEY STRIPPED JOSEPH OF HIS TUNIC; nor by the throwing with which they threw him into the cistern, as stated (in Gen. 37:24): AND THEY CAST HIM INTO THE PIT; nor by the selling with which they sold him to the Ishmaelites (in vs. 28); nor by the dipping with which they dipped his tunic in the blood (in vs. 31). &lt; By none of these do I swear &gt; that they did not give me advice, and I did not touch the goblet. Joseph said: Who will make known to me that you are swearing truthfully about your brothers? He said to him: You can know how much I love him from the names of my sons, since I set names for them on the basis of what I feared for &lt; each one &gt;. (Sot. 36b (bar); Gen. R. 93:7; Tanh., Gen. 11:40.)  He said to him: And what were the names of your sons? He said to him (in agreement with Gen. 46:21): BELA, BECHER, ASHBEL, GERA, NAAMAN, EHI, ROSH, MUPPIM, HUPPIM, AND ARD. He said to him: Why Bela (BL')? He said to him: Because my brother was swallowed up (rt.: BL') from me. Becher (BKR)? Because he was my mother's first-born (rt.: BKR). Ashbel ('ShBL)? Because my brother was captured (NShBH). Gera? Because my brother was a sojourner (ger) with &lt; merely &gt; the privileges of a transient. (Gk.: xenia, i.e., “rights of a foreigner” or “guest privileges.”)  Naaman (N'M)? Because his words were pleasing (N'M). Ehi ('HY)? Because he was my brother ('HY) from &lt; the same &gt; mother, and I had none but him. Rosh (which means &quot;head&quot;)? Because he was older than I. Muppim (MPYM)? Because he learned Torah from our father's mouth (MPY) and taught it to me. When all his brothers would return to shepherding, he would sit with my father and learn the traditions which he had received from Shem and Eber. Huppim (rt.: HPP)? Because he has been covered over (rt.: HPP) until this day. Another interpretation of Huppim: Because I did not see his wedding canopy (huppah) nor did he see my wedding canopy. Another interpretation of Huppim (rt.: HPP): Because until now I have been mourning over him and going barefoot (rt.: YHP). And Ard ('RD)? Because he brought (rt.: YRD) all of us down here. Another interpretation of ARD (from Gen. 37:35): NO, I WILL GO DOWN ('RD) MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL. Will you please not bring down ('RD) Daddy to Sheol through grief! And so Judah said (in Gen. 44:34): FOR HOW SHALL I GO UP UNTO MY FATHER &lt; IF THE LAD IS NOT WITH ME &gt;? When Joseph heard that, he was not able to suppress his compassion, as stated (in Gen. 45:1-3): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF…. AND HE WEPT ALOUD…. THEN JOSEPH SAID UNTO HIS BROTHERS: I AM JOSEPH. When he said to them: I AM {YOUR BROTHER JOSEPH} … (in vs. 3, cont.): HIS BROTHERS COULD NOT ANSWER HIM BECAUSE THEY WERE DISMAYED BECAUSE OF HIM. R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon said in the name of R. Eleazar ben Azariah: (Gen. R. 93:11.)  Now, if in the case of Joseph, when he said to his brothers: I am Joseph, they knew what they had done with him and were unable to answer him; how much the less will a creature be able to stand when the Holy One comes to dispute with each and every one of &lt; his &gt; creatures and to tell him his deeds, just as it is written (in Amos 4:13): FOR BEHOLD, THE ONE WHO FORMS THE MOUNTAINS, &lt; CREATES THE WIND, AND TELLS ONE WHAT HIS THOUGHT IS &gt; … !</p>

              <p>וזאת ליהודה, “”and this for Yehudah;” i.e. “and this is the blessing for Yehudah. Moses means that the blessing he had just given to Reuven will also apply to Yehudah. He prayed that they both be extraordinarily successful in that war. The reason he also singled out Yehudah for such a blessing was that that tribe usually was always at the head of the army. (Compare Judges 1,2) In that verse G–d had answered t]he people’s query who should lead them in war now that Joshua had died. Our sages in the Talmud, tractate Sotah folio 7 state that the bones of Yehudah were rattling in their coffin all the years that the Israelites wandered in the desert, the reason being that he had said to his father Yaakov before obtaining permission to take Binyamin to Egypt, that he would consider himself as having sinned unforgivably against him for all his life if he did not bring him back safe and sound. (Genesis 43,9). Even though it appears at first glance as if Binyamin had descended with the rest of Yaakov’s family (Genesis 46,21) when a wise man utters a curse, even a conditional one, it comes true at some time [Yaakov had cursed the anonymous person who had stolen Lavan’s t’raphim if he would be found, and although he never found that person Rachel died prematurely on account of that as she had stolen them. Ed.] (compare Talmud, tractate Makkot, folio 11) The Talmud there describes that at the time when David dug the hole known as shitin, under the site where the Temple would stand in the future, the subterranean waters started rising from the depths and threatened to flood the earth. At that point, when Achitofel did not rule on the subject though he had been openly invited to do so, David reasoned as follows before writing the holy name of G–d on a shard commanding the waters to stop rising. If in the case of a woman suspected of infidelity by her husband, the priest dissolves a parchment with the Holy Name of the Lord in order to help restore marital harmony, when the life of the whole of humanity is at stake, surely I am not only allowed but I have the duty to try and save mankind by that means. (Compare Numbers 5, 11-31) When Achitophel saw that his advice concerning the rebellion of Avshalom had not been followed, he went home and arranged his affairs, and hung himself. (see beginning of chapter 17). [Achitofel, according to tradition was the outstanding Torah scholar of his generation, and at one time David’s tutor. Ed.] The Talmud Makkot quoted before comes to the conclusion that Moses when wondering why the bones of Reuven did not rattle in their coffin whereas those of Yehudah, his brother did not, especially since it had been Yehudah’s public confession of having fathered Tamar’s children which had caused Reuven to also publicly confess that he had committed an indiscretion with Bilhah, and remains with a question, else he would not have commenced Yehudah’s blessing with the words he did. He did not bless Shimon, just as his father had also not given him a blessing on his deathbed, as in addition to the deceit and violence at Sh’chem, as the leader of that tribe, Zimri had added to his sin by sleeping provocatively with a Midianite princess, as reported in Numbers 25,6. Although Levi had been Shimon’s partner in the killing of the male population of Sh’chem, his descendants had rehabilitated themselves when, to a man, none of them participated in worshipping the golden calf. (Compare Exodus 32,26) Moses at least hinted at a blessing for Yehudah, according to the Talmud in Makkot there.</p>

              <p>Benjamin begot Bela his first-born, Ashbel the second. The text says “Ashbel the second” when he was really the third; for the sons of Benjamin were Bela, Becher, and Ashbel (Gen 46:21). Indeed, above it does say “Bela, Becher” (7:6). But because it does not mention Becher [here], it says “Ashbel the second.” It does not mention Becher here much as it does not mention him in parashat Pineḥas—just: “Of Bela, the clan of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the clan of the Ashbelites” (Num 26:38). Now in parashat Vayyiggash (Gen 46:21) the text lists ten sons for Benjamin, whereas in Pineḥas (Numbers 26:38–39) it only lists five! Perhaps these five were the clan chiefs for Benjamin. That would also be why it does not list Becher here even though it lists him in the first account. Also, in Vayyiggash (Gen 46:21) the text lists Ard and Naaman among the sons of Benjamin, whereas in Pineḥas (Numbers 26:40) it lists them among the sons of Bela! Perhaps in Vayyiggash it includes grandsons with sons. Alternatively, it says “The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman” because Bela named his sons for his brothers. In Pineḥas, the text also presents the names differently from the way it presents them in Vayyiggash, as this book does [here] and in many places besides it, as we have written (1 Chr 6:18). But our Sages, of blessed memory (Numbers Rabbah 21:8), say that those families missing in Pineḥas perished in the wilderness in the affair of Balaam. What will they say, though, concerning Becher, who is not mentioned in Pineḥas but is mentioned above in this book (7:8–9)—himself, his family, and the numbers they reached in the time of David?</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Numbers 26:13:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>L’ZERACH’ (OF ZERAH). “He is [identical with] ‘Tzochar’ [Zohar — mentioned in Genesis 46: 10 as one of the sons of Simeon who went down to Egypt], and it [the name Zerach (Zerah)] is an expression meaning tzohar [‘shining,’ which is also the meaning of Zerach]. But the family of Ohad [the other son of Simeon mentioned ibid., in Genesis] became extinct. Similarly five families of the tribe of Benjamin [had by now ceased to exist], for he [Benjamin] went down to Egypt with ten sons, (Genesis 46:21.)  and here (Further, Verses 38-39.)  Scripture only counts five.” This is Rashi’s language. And Rashi has furthermore written: (In Verse 24.)  “All the families were called by the names of those [of their ancestors] who went down to Egypt, but those who were born after that time were not called families [in their own right and their own names], except for the families of Ephraim and Menasheh, both of whom were born in Egypt, and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela the son of Benjamin. (Further, Verse 40. The meaning of Rashi is as follows: Since Ard and Naaman are mentioned in Genesis 46:21 among the sons of Benjamin who went down to Egypt, and here in Verse 40 they are referred to as sons of Bela, who was himself a son of Benjamin, we must perforce say that the ones referred to here were not the same as those mentioned there [but had the same names]. Furthermore we must perforce say that the Ard and Naaman mentioned here were not amongst those who went down to Egypt, for otherwise Scripture would have mentioned them there in Genesis, in the same way that it counts the grandchildren of Judah and Asher. This is the meaning of Rashi when he wrote: “except for the families of Ephraim and Menasheh, both of whom were born in Egypt, and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela the son of Benjamin.” However, the question then arises: why are Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela, counted here, since they were not amongst those who went down to Egypt? In other words, why were they an exception to the rule? To answer this question Rashi quotes the statement which he found in the work of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher.)  And I have found [it written] in the work of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher (See above in Seder Naso, Note 146.)  that their mother [that of Ard and Naaman — i.e., the wife of Bela] went down to Egypt when she was already pregnant with them [and therefore they formed separate families, since they are also included amongst ‘those who went down’ to Egypt]. Now if this is a tradition, well and good. But if not, I say that Bela had many children, but from each of these two, Ard and Naaman, there came forth a large family, [and therefore they formed families in their own right and in their own names], whereas the descendants of the other sons were called by Bela’s name, and [only] the descendants of these two [Ard and Naaman] were called after their [own] names.” All this is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi], of blessed memory. But I am astonished at [the words of] Rashi. For the difficulty [raised by Rabbi Moshe the Preacher] is not that Scripture counts the family of the Belaites by itself, (Further, Verse 38.)  and [nonetheless counts also] the families of the Ardites and the Naamites his sons, by themselves, (Ibid., Verse 40.)  for that was [indeed] because they became [large] families, as the Rabbi [Rashi] has said. This is the way of Scripture, as in the case of the children of Judah [where it counts Hezron and Hamul, who were grandchildren of Judah, as forming families by themselves], (Verse 21. Hezron and Hamul were the sons of Perez, who was the son of Judah. Although Perez himself formed a family (Verse 20), the verse nonetheless counts independently the two families formed by his sons Hezron and Hamul.)  and [likewise] the children of Menasheh and Ephraim, (Verses 29-32; 36. There too, the grandchildren [and even great-grandchildren] are counted as separate families.)  and likewise the children of Asher. (Verses 44-45. Asher’s grandchildren are counted as separate families.)  However, if we say that Ard and Naaman were born to Bela, the son of Benjamin, after they went down to Egypt, they should not have been counted here as [separate] families! (Ramban’s meaning is as follows. Rashi seems to have understood that Rabbi Moshe the Preacher found it difficult to understand why Ard and Naaman are mentioned as forming separate families, since their father Bela is also mentioned as forming a separate family. To answer this, Rabbi Moshe gave the explanation that their mother was already pregnant with them when she went down to Egypt ; and Rashi himself [because he questioned the authenticity of that tradition] gave a different reason, i.e., that they formed large families in their own right. Ramban is saying that Rabbi Moshe’s difficulty was not why Scripture mentions them as forming separate families, because the answer to that question is clearly that they had large families, which were worthy of constituting separate families and hence were not included in Bela’s family. That this is so we see clearly from the examples of Judah, Menasheh, Ephraim and Asher, as Ramban points out. Yet Rabbi Moshe did not ask about the children of these people, but only about Ard and Naaman, the children of Bela! Clearly this is because Scripture only counts as separate families the children of those who went down to Egypt, [e.g. Judah and Asher] or who were already there when Jacob went down [e.g. Menasheh and Ephraim]. But in the case of Ard and Naaman, there is a difficulty, whether we say that they went down to Egypt with Jacob or not, [as explained further on in Ramban], and it is this difficulty which Rabbi Moshe the Preacher was trying to answer. The question whether they went down to Egypt with Jacob depends, of course, on when they were born. For if we say that they were born to Bela after he went down to Egypt, the question arises: Why are they counted here as separate families, since only those who were among the seventy souls who went down to Egypt with Jacob are counted here as separate families? And if they were born before Jacob’s family went down to Egypt, then since they are not mentioned in Genesis, the total number of people who went down must have been seventy-two, so why does Scripture omit them and count only seventy? In brief it was this difficulty that Rabbi Moshe the Preacher had in understanding the verses, a difficulty which applies only to Ard and Naaman, and not as Rashi assumed his question to be, which would apply to other cases as well.)  And should we say that [Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela] were born to him before [he went down to Egypt], then [the family of Jacob] would consist of more than seventy souls, for then the sons of Benjamin were ten (Genesis 46:21.)  apart from these two sons of Bela [thus the overall total of people who went down to Egypt would be seventy-two, whereas Scripture there only mentions a total of seventy]! (Genesis 46:27.)  It was for this reason [and not for the reason implied by Rashi’s explanation] that Rabbi Moshe the Preacher explained that their mother [the wife of Bela] was already pregnant with them [Ard and Naaman, when the family of Jacob went down to Egypt], and [since they were not yet born] they are not counted there [in the Book of Genesis], but here they are included (Ibid., Verse 40.)  among those born [before the descent into Egypt, because their mother was already pregnant with them when they went into Egypt]. Now if this is a tradition [of the Rabbis, that Bela’s wife was pregnant with Ard and Naaman when she went down into Egypt], we will force ourselves to accept it despite its difficulty. (The difficulty is that in Genesis 46:8-27 the verses do not mention Ard and Naaman amongst the seventy souls that came into Egypt, because although their mother came into Egypt when she was pregnant with them, they were not yet born and thus one cannot say that they ”came into Egypt.” Yet here they are counted as forming separate families, although only the families of those that came into Egypt are counted as separate families, and the reason is because they “came into Egypt” since their mother was pregnant with them! Thus there is an apparent contradition! Furthermore, we will have to differentiate between the case of Jochebed and that of Ard and Naaman, as will be explained further on.)  We will also have to say that Jochebed (See Genesis 46:15 (Vol. I, pp. 554-558.))  was born [whilst they passed] through the walls [of the border-city of Egypt], on the very day that they entered into [Egypt], and therefore she is included amongst the seventy souls [that came into Egypt], whereas these [Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela] were born some months [after Jacob’s family had come to Egypt, and therefore they are not included amongst the seventy souls that came into Egypt with Jacob]! But if it is not a tradition of our Rabbis [but merely a personal opinion of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher] we will reject this theory of his with all our might. But we can say that Ard and Naaman, the sons of Benjamin [as mentioned in Genesis 46:21], died without children, and Bela [their brother] wanted to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, (Deuteronomy 25:7.)  and therefore he gave his sons the names of his brothers who had died. Perhaps Bela [actually] performed the rite of marriage with their wives, since he was the firstborn, (Genesis 46:21: And the sons of Benjamin: Bela etc. — The duty of marrying a childless brother’s wife falls primarily on the eldest of the remaining brothers ; if he refuses the duty devolves upon any other surviving brother (Yebamoth 39a).)  and Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela [from these marriages] became heads of families to raise up a name (Deuteronomy 25:7.)  for Ard and Naaman the sons of Benjamin, who were amongst those that went down to Egypt. (Genesis 46:21.)  The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the Naaman and Ard (In Genesis 46:21 they are listed in the following order: And the sons of Benjamin: Bela … and Naaman … and Ard. Ramban now suggests that these two people who are mentioned there in Genesis as the “sons” of Benjamin, are in fact identical with the Ard and Naaman mentioned here in Verse 40, who are described as the sons of Bela, who was the son of Benjamin. Naaman and Ard were thus in fact the grandchildren of Benjamin, and it is the style of Scripture to describe grandchildren as children, as Ramban shows. This explains why Ard and Naaman are counted here as separate families in their own right, since they were amongst those who went down to Egypt [as stated explicitly in Genesis 46:21], and there is thus also no problem about how we reach the number of seventy souls who went down there. In other words, the Ard and Naaman mentioned there in Genesis [as the sons of Benjamin] and here in Verse 40 [as Benjamin’s grandsons] are identical persons.)  who are counted amongst the sons of Benjamin in the section of And these are the names etc., (Genesis 46:8-27.)  were in fact [not the real sons of Benjamin at all, but they were] the sons of his firstborn son Bela, as is stated explicitly here, (Ibid., Verse 40.)  and similarly Scripture counts them [as the sons of Bela] in the Book of Chronicles. (I Chronicles 8:3-4: And Bela had sons, Addar … and Naaman. Addar mentioned is synonymous with Ard.)  Such is the custom of Scripture to speak of grandchildren as children [and therefore in Genesis 46:21 the verse describes them as the ‘sons’ of Benjamin], just as it says, Laban the son of Nahor, (Genesis 29:5. Nahor was actually his grandfather, for Bethuel was his father. See Ramban ibid., Vol. I, p. 360.)  and in the Book of Chronicles it is written, The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram, and Uz, and Hul, and Gether and Meshech, (I Chronicles 1:17.)  although the last four were in fact his grandchildren! (Their father was Aram, the son of Shem — see Genesis 10:22-23.)  And even though Scripture did not treat the sons of Perez [as the “sons” of Judah, their grandfather, (The verse there (46:12) mentions that Perez was the son of Judah; and Hezron and Hamul, the sons of Perez.)  as it did in the case of Ard and Naaman], likewise [it did not treat] the sons of Beriah [as the “sons” of Asher, their grandfather, (The verse there (46:17) mentions that Beriah was the son of Asher, and Heber and Malchiel the sons of Beriah.)  as it did in the case of Ard and Naaman], — this may be because they [Ard and Naaman, the sons of Bela], were born upon Benjamin’s knees (See Genesis 50:23.)  [i.e., he brought them up], and therefore they are considered his sons. This is then similar to [the verse], And these are the generations of Aaron and Moses, (Above, 3:1. The explanation of this verse quoted now by Ramban is found in Rashi ibid.)  [where the verse proceeds to mention only the sons of Aaron! The explanation given is that they were in actual fact only the sons of Aaron, but since Moses brought them up and taught them Torah, they are also called his children]. Or it may be that because Benjamin had many sons — for he had eight — therefore Scripture included the few [i.e., his two grandsons, Ard and Naaman] amongst the many [real sons, and therefore spoke of all ten as Benjamin’s sons]. And it is possible also that we suggest as a hypothesis that Scripture here does not count only the families of those who went down to Egypt, [as Rashi explained above], because [we see] that even those who were born in Egypt from that time onwards are also counted as families, such as Scripture does here in the case of [the families of] Ephraim and Menasheh [whose families are counted separately, even though they did not go down to Egypt with Jacob]. (Verses 29 and 35 here. Ephraim and Menasheh of course were not amongst those who went down to Egypt with Jacob, but were born to Joseph beforehand (see Genesis 48:5).)  It is not a [satisfactory] reason for Scripture to do so [as exceptions in their cases only], on the grounds that they were [already] in Egypt [and therefore are included as separate families together with all those who came down afterwards with Jacob], because it is at the time of the [actual] descent [into Egypt] that one ought to count them all in one number, and to make families out of the seventy souls [who actually went down with Jacob, and it is not correct to include Ephraim and Menasheh who were there but did not go down with the others]! (Ramban’s meaning is that since Scripture’s main purpose is to list the seventy people who “went down” to Egypt with Jacob, it ought to include only those who actually went down at that time. But in actual fact only sixty-eight went down, since Ephraim and Menasheh were already there! And one cannot suggest that an exception is made in their case, since Scripture always stresses the factor of actual descent, referring to the seventy souls who went down to Egypt. Hence we must say that in fact Scripture includes in its list not only those who actually went down to Egypt with Jacob, but also those who did not go down then, and even some who were born later, as explained further on. In that case we can understand that Ard and Naaman are included in the list, even though they were born later.)  Similarly Scripture always counts them [Ephraim and Menasheh] together with those who went down to Egypt, [such as in the verse]: Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons (Deuteronomy 10:22. This includes Joseph and his two sons, Menasheh and Ephraim (see Genesis 46:19-20), although they did not go down to Egypt with Jacob.)  So also the sons of Bela [Ard and Naaman] were born afterwards [i.e., after the descent into Egypt, and they are nonetheless counted here as separate families! This proves that the determining factor whether to count a family here separately, is not the criterion of whether its founder was amongst those who went down to Egypt with Jacob, as Rashi said, but must have been some other reason, as will now be explained]. But [we must say that] this matter was [as follows]. It was the custom in Israel [for people] to appoint over themselves “heads of fathers’ houses,” and all the descendants of that man would always trace their lineage back to him, and be called by his name in his honor; just as all the Arabs do to this very day, and as do all the Jews who live in their [the Arabs’] countries, calling themselves by family [names, such as] “Ibn Ezra,” or “Ibn Shushan.” This is the meaning of the verse which says, These are the heads of their fathers’ houses, (Exodus 6:14.)  for from the time that they were fruitful and multiplied (Ibid., 1:7.)  in Egypt, they established heads of families over themselves, to whom they would trace their lineage. Perhaps they initiated this practice in Egypt in order not to mingle themselves with the nations (Psalms 106:35.)  and so that they would be recognized and distinguishable among their tribes, [for it is there in Egypt] whither the tribes went up, even the tribes of the Eternal, as a testimony unto Israel, (Ibid., 122:4.)  and it became a custom in Israel. (Judges 11:39.)  Thus [all] those mentioned here [in this section] were, every one of them, heads of their fathers’ house in Egypt, from whom the family traced its descent. That is why Scripture counts in the house of Machir [the son of Menasheh]: the family of the Machirites and the family of the Gileadites his son, (Further, Verse 29.)  and the family of the Iezerites and that of the Helekites, (Ibid., Verse 30.)  the sons of Gilead and their [other] brothers. (I.e., Asriel, Shechem, Shemida, Hepher (Verses 31-32) — brothers of Iezer and Helek, and sons of Gilead.)  In a similar way [Scripture records] the children of Judah [and also counts Hezron and Hamul, who were the sons of Perez and grandsons of Judah, as separate families] (Further, Verse 21.)  and those of Ephraim, (Verse 36. There Eran, who was the son of Shuthelach and the grandson of Ephraim, is counted as forming a separate family, although his father Shuthelach is also mentioned there as founding a separate family.)  for these children mentioned were great and distinguished people, and became heads [of their families]. But [the reason for them being counted as separate families] is not because they [each] gave birth to a large family, as the Rabbi [Rashi] wrote, because they all begot large families [even those who are not mentioned individually], since they were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceedingly mighty. (Ibid., 1:7.)  But [Scripture named separate families here] as a mark of honor, meaning that [the members of that particular family] had appointed [that person] as their head. Now most of the families when they were in Egypt traced their descent from those who went down to Egypt [with Jacob], because they considered them distinguished ancestors, and the others appointed for themselves heads of houses from those who were born there shortly after [Jacob’s descent to Egypt]. Therefore most of the [people] mentioned here [in this census as forming families] were [amongst] those who went down to Egypt [with Jacob], and therefore these families trace themselves back to those who came down [originally] to Egypt, because it was there that they established them [these people, as the heads of their family-groups].</p>

              <p>לזרח OF ZERAH — He is identical with Zohar (mentioned in Exodus 6:15 as a son of Simeon), which is an expression equivalent to צהר, shining (a synonym of זרח). However, the family of אהוד (mentioned there) had ceased to exist by now. The same was the case with five families of the tribe of Benjamin, for with ten sons did Benjamin go down to Egypt and here it enumerates only five. Similarly with Ezbon of the tribe of Gad. So you have seven families that had become extinct (cf. Midrash Tanchuma, Pinchas 5). — And I have found in the Talmud Yerushalmi Yoma 1:2 the reason why these seven families were now extinct: that when Aaron died the clouds of glory departed and the Canaanites came to wage war against Israel. These therefore set their hearts on returning to Egypt and turned back eight stages from Mount Hor to Moserah, as it is said, (Deuteronomy 10:6) “And the children of Israel journeyed from Bene Jaakon to Moserah; there Aaron died”. But did he not die at Mount Hor and from Moserah to Mount Hor there were eight stages in a backward direction? But the explanation is that they turned back, and the Levites pursued them to force them to return and slew of them seven families. And besides these, of the sons of Levi there fell four families: the families of Shimei and Uzzieli, and of the three sons of Izhar (Exodus 6:21) only the family of one son, Korah, is enumerated here, v. 58, so that the family of Izhar may be regarded as extinct — making three families missing. And as regards the fourth family I do not know which of those mentioned in 3:21, 27, 33, it was that had become extinct by now (Talmud Yerushalmi Sotah 1:10; Yoma 1:1). But Rabbi Tanchuma (Midrash Tanchuma, Pinchas 5) explained that they (the families not mentioned here) died by the plague in the matter of Balaam. But this can hardly be so, because according to the deficiency that shows itself in the tribe of Simeon in this census, as compared with the first census in the wilderness of Sinai (1:23), it would appear that all the twenty four thousand who died of that plague (Numbers 25:9) must have fallen from the tribe of Simeon.</p>

And even so, the offspring that were meant to descend from him descended from his brother Benjamin, who had ten sons.

This means as I will cut off the one who gives from his seed to Molech in secret or in public if the people of the land do not kill him, so will I cut off the one who strays from me and turns to ghosts. We find the term nefashim (souls) (Ezek. 20:13) in Scripture. (Nefashim (souls) is masculine. Nefesh (soul) is usually feminine. However, our verse reads, ve-hikhratti oto (and will cut him [the soul] off). It thus treats nefesh as masculine. I.E. therefore points out that nefesh is sometimes treated as a masculine in Scripture.)  We also find all the souls (nefesh) were fourteen (arba’ah asar) (Arba’ah asar (fourteen) is masculine. Thus Gen. 46:22 treats nefesh as masculine.)  (Gen. 46:22). We similarly read, (In our verse.)  and will cut him (The soul.)  (oto) off.</p>

(Since Scripture used sons of with regard to the other children, it employs the same form here for the sake of consistency (Weiser). Nahmanides (v. 7) writes, “It is Biblical style to refer to an individual in the plural form when mentioning the genealogy of any people.

And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him…” – Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Have you ever in your days seen a person give another sixty-six cups, and then give him another three, and he counts them as seventy? Rather, this is Yokheved, who completed the tally of Israel in Egypt. (The verses list a total of sixty-nine people but it then states that the total was seventy. This is an allusion to Yokheved, who was born as they arrived in Egypt, and is counted in the final tally even though she is not listed by name. )  Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Yokheved was conceived in the land of Canaan, and born in the land of Egypt. That is what is written: “The name of Amram's wife was Yokheved, [daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt]” (Numbers 26:59) – she was born at the gates of Egypt.   And Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: The Holy One blessed be He is accustomed to count this tribe while it is still in its mother’s womb. That is what is written: “For Yedutun, the sons of Yedutun: Gedalyahu, and Tzeri, and Yeshayahu, Ḥashavyahu, and Matityahu, [six]” (I Chronicles 25:3) – they are five [who are mentioned] specifically, but a total of six. However, there is “Shimi” (I Chronicles 25:17). The Holy One blessed be He counted him while he was still in his mother’s womb. And were a person to say to you: “The tenth was Shimi” (I Chronicles 25:17), say to him: Tenth for the platform. (This is regarding the order in which they would perform their role as singers on the platform in the Temple.)   And Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: [From the time] our patriarch Jacob would engage in conjugal relations, the Holy One blessed be He would call [his future children] souls. That is what is written: “Or tallied one-quarter [rova] (Rova is understood as a reference to the sexual act (see, similarly, Leviticus 18:23). The Holy One blessed be He counts them even before conception.)  of Israel” (Numbers 23:10). Rabbi Berekhya said: It is like sap, which is absorbed even before it has emerged.  Some say: Jacob completed the tally with them. (The final tally of seventy includes Jacob himself.)  Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is analogous to two of the emperor’s legions, the Decumani and the Augustiani. When the emperor is counted with these they are deemed complete, and when the emperor is counted with those, as well, they are deemed complete. (Since the emperor is sometimes found with each legion, he is included in their official number. )   Some say: The Holy One blessed be He completed the tally with them. (The final tally of seventy includes God Himself, who accompanied Jacob and his family into exile in Egypt.)   Some say: Ḥushim son of Dan completed the tally with them. (The verse states: “The sons of Dan: Ḥushim” (Genesis 46:23) – it says “the sons” in plural, because Ḥushim was counted as two. This is because he had many offspring.)  In Rabbi Meir’s Torah they found it written: “The son of Dan: Ḥushim.” (The word “son” appeared in the singular rather than in the plural. Some explain that this means that Rabbi Meir wrote the word “son” on the side of his scroll next to the word “sons” as an explanatory note, so that it would not be understood that Dan actually had more than just one son. This supports the idea that the word “sons” is written in plural to indicate that Ḥushim counted as two in the count of the seventy members of Jacob’s family (Yefeh To’ar). )  That is what is written: “They came to the Gilad, and to the land of Taḥtim Ḥodshi, [and they came to Dan Yaan]” (II Samuel 24:6) – Beit Yeraḥ, Yeraḥ Sinim. (These were the names of these places in the talmudic period.)  A measure for a measure: (This is the way the midrash expounds the word Yaan that is appended to the name Dan, as this word means “because” and indicates a “measure for measure” cause and effect. See, similarly, Leviticus 26:43. )  Dan entered in his darkened state (With just one son, who was deaf.)  before his father, and was blessed with seventy thousand. (In the two censuses in the Book of Numbers, the tribe of Dan numbered between sixty and seventy thousand (see Numbers 1:39, 26:43). )  Benjamin entered with ten, and was blessed with forty thousand. (Although Benjamin had ten sons, his tribe numbered only around thirty-five thousand and forty-five thousand respectively during the two censuses in the Book of Numbers (see Numbers 1:37, 26:41). )   Some say: Seraḥ daughter of Asher completed the tally with them. That is what is written: “A wise woman called from the city…. He approached her, and the woman said: Are you Yoav?” (II Samuel 20:16–17). She said to him: ‘Your name is Yoav, to say that you are a father [av] to Israel, but you are nothing but a reaper, (A killer.)  and you do not correspond to your name. Are you and David not versed in Torah, or has Torah now ceased [to be in effect]? Is it not written: “When you approach a city to wage war against it, you shall call to it for peace”?’ (Deuteronomy 20:10). He said to her: ‘Who are you?’ She said to him: “I am the peaceful [shelumei] and loyal [emunei] of Israel” (II Samuel 20:19) (The plural terms shelumei and emunei are difficult in context, and the midrash therefore expounds these terms. )  – I am the one who completed [shehishlamti] the tally [minyanan] of Israel in Egypt. I am the one who delivered the loyal to the loyal – Joseph to Moses. (Seraḥ showed Moses where Joseph was buried so that he could take Joseph’s bones from Egypt to the Land of Israel (Sota 13a). )  Why “do you seek to destroy a city” (II Samuel 20:19), and I, who am “a mother in Israel”? (II Samuel 20:19). Immediately, “Yoav answered and said: Far be it, far be it from me [that I would ruin or destroy]” (II Samuel 20:20). “Far be it, far be it,” twice – far be it from David, far be it from Yoav, far be it from the kingdom of the house of David. “[The matter] is not so. Rather, a man from Mount Ephraim, Sheva son of Bikhri is his name, has raised his hand against the king, against David (II Samuel 20:21) – if [he already said] “against the king,” why [did he also say] “against David”; if “against David,” why “against the king”? Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: Anyone who is impudent to a king, it is as though he was impudent to a Torah scholar; all the more so, [if he is impudent] to a king and a Torah scholar. Rabbi Yudan said: Anyone who is impudent to a king, it is as though he is impudent to the Divine Presence.   “[The woman] said…Behold, his head will be cast to you” (II Samuel 20:21). How did she know? (How did she know she would be able to apprehend Sheva ben Bikhri.)  It is because she said: ‘Anyone who is impudent to the kingdom of the house of David, will be beheaded from above.’ (God will ensure that he is apprehended. )  Immediately, “the woman came to all the people, in her wisdom” (II Samuel 20:22). She said to them: ‘Do you not know the exploits of David? What nation stood against him? What kingdom stood against him?’ They said to her: ‘What does he want?’ She said to them: ‘One thousand men; are one thousand men not preferable to destroying your entire city?’ They said to her: ‘Let each and every one give in accordance with what he has.’ (Each household will turn over a proportion of its members. )  She said to them: ‘Perhaps, as the result of appeasement, he will forgo a bit.’ She made herself out as though she was going to appease and returned; from one thousand to five hundred, (She made them believe she had negotiated Yoav down from the one thousand men that he demanded to only five hundred. )  to one hundred, to ten, to one, and he is a guest. ‘Who is it?’ ‘It is Sheva son of Bikhri.’ Immediately, they severed his head.   It is taught: A group of people to whom the gentiles said: ‘Give us one of you and we will kill him, and if not, we will kill all of you,’ they shall all be killed, and they shall not deliver one soul of Israel. But if they designated him for them, like Sheva son of Bikhri, they shall give, and all of them shall not be killed. Rabbi Yehuda said: In what case are these matters stated? It is when he is inside and they are outside. (When he is trapped by the besieging army but they are not totally trapped, it is possible they will escape the army even if they do not deliver him to the army. Consequently, they may not turn him over. )  But if he is inside and they are inside, since he will be killed and they will be killed, they shall deliver him to them and all of them will not be killed. Like it says: “The woman came to all the people” (II Samuel 20:22) – since he will be killed and you will be killed, give him to them and let you all not be killed. Rabbi Shimon says: Anyone who revolts against the kingdom of the house of David is liable to death.   Ulla ben Kishar was sought by the empire. He rose and fled to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to Lod. They sent a messenger after him. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi approached [Ulla ben Kishar] and appeased him. He said to him: ‘It is preferable that this man [i.e. you] be killed, and let the entire community not be punished on his account.’ He appeased him and he delivered him to [the messenger]. Elijah was accustomed to speak with [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi]. Once he did this, [Elijah] did not come to him any longer. He fasted over him for thirty days, and he appeared to him. [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi] said to him: ‘What is the reason that my master absented himself?’ He said to him: ‘Do I associate with informers?’ He said to him: ‘Is it not a baraita: A group of people…’ He said to him: ‘Is that a mishna of the pious? That act should have been performed by others and not by you.’   It is taught: When Nebuchadnezzar ascended to conquer Yehoyakim, he ascended and encamped at Daphne at Antioch. The Great Sanhedrin descended to greet him. They said to him: ‘Has the time arrived for this house to be destroyed?’ He said to them: ‘No, but Yehoyakim king of Judah has revolted against me. Give him to me and I will go.’ They went and said to Yehoyakim: ‘Nebuchadnezzar wants you.’ He said to them: ‘Is this how one acts? Does one disregard one life in favor of another life? Is it not so written: “You shall not hand over a slave to his master”?’ (Deuteronomy 23:16). They said to him: ‘Is this not what your ancestor did to Sheva son of Bikhri? That is what is written: “Behold, his head is cast to you over the wall”’ (II Samuel 20:21). When [Yehoyakim] did not heed them, they rose, took him, and lowered him [to Nebuchadnezzar], who dismembered him.</p>

              <p>R. Abba the son of Hiyya (In text: R. Ada the son of Hiyya.)  said: He was called Lahad because the lowliest (hadal) of the tribes was associated (in the building of the Tabernacle) with him. He was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. R. Hanina the son of Pazzi said: No tribe was greater than Judah, and none was more lowly than Dan, which descended from one of the maidservants, as it says: And the sons of Dan: Hushim (Gen. 46:23). The Holy One, blessed be He, declared: Let him come and join with Judah so that no tribe might become arrogant, for both the great and the lowly are equal in the sight of the Holy One, blessed be He. R. Hanina maintained: No man should become arrogant because of the honors bestowed upon him. The Tabernacle and the Sanctuary were erected by these two tribes, for Solomon was of the tribe of Judah, and Hiram was of the tribe of Dan, as it is said: The son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali (I Kings 7:4), and in the Book of Chronicles: The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan (II Chron. 2:12). These verses indicate that his father was of the tribe of Naphtali and his mother of the tribe of Dan. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: In this world you erected a Tabernacle and a Sanctuary which were walled about, but in the world-to-come I will build a Sanctuary that will be encircled by a wall of fire, as it is said: For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire (Zech. 2:9).</p>

              <p>Another matter, “see, I have called by name,” this is one of seven people who were called by several names. There were those called by four, such as Elijah; Betzalel, six; Joshua, six; Moses, seven; Mordekhai, two; Daniel, five; Ḥananya, Mishael, and Azarya, four. Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat said: Elijah was a Jerusalemite, from among those who sat in the chamber of Hewn Stone, and was from a city in Judah. His property was in two tribes; five portions in Benjamin, as it is stated: “Tzela, HaElef, and the Yevusites, which is Jerusalem [Givat, Kiryat; fourteen cities and their surrounding areas. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin]” (Joshua 18:28), three in Judah, as it is stated: “Tzenan, Ḥadasha, and Migdal Gad” (Joshua 15:37). Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Tzenan, as he was a shield [tzina]; (Elijah shielded Israel from divine punishment. )  Ḥadasha, as the Holy One blessed be He will restore it [meḥadesha] in the future; and Migdal Gad, as from there the Holy One blessed be He will emerge and raze [magdid] the foundations of Esau. Elijah was called four names, as it is written: “Yaareshya, Elijah, and Zikhri, the sons of Yeroḥam” (I Chronicles 8:27). (The midrash regards Yaareshya, Elijah, Zikhri, and Yeroḥam to all refer to the same individual. )  Why was he called these names? It is because when the Holy One blessed be He seeks to shake [leharish] His world, [Elijah] stands and mentions [mazkir] the merit of the ancestors and God has mercy [meraḥem] on His world.  Betzalel was called six names and you trace his lineage from the tribe of Judah, as it is stated: “The sons of Judah: Peretz, Ḥetzron, Karmi, Hur, and Shoval, and Re’aya…” (I Chronicles 4:1–2). Ḥetzron is none other than the grandson of Judah, as it is stated: “The sons of Peretz were Ḥetzron and Ḥamul” (Genesis 46:12). And it is written: “After the death of Ḥetzron in Caleb Efrata” (I Chronicles 2:24). Does a person die in a person, that it is written: “After the death of Ḥetzron in Caleb”? Reish Lakish said: What is “after the death of Ḥetzron in Caleb…”? After Ḥetzron died, Caleb consorted with Efrat, namely Miriam, whose name was Efrat. Why was she called that? It is because the children of Israel were fruitful and multiplied [parim veravim] because of her. (Miriam is identified as one of the Israelite midwives in Egypt (see Shemot Rabba 1:13). )  “She bore him Ḥur, Ḥur begot Uri, and Uri begot Betzalel” (I Chronicles 2:19–20). “Re’aya son of Shoval begot Yahat, and Yaḥat begot Aḥumai and Laḥad. These are the families of the Tzoratites” (I Chronicles 4:2). Betzalel, that is what his nation called him. The Holy One blessed be He called him by five names of endearment after the Tabernacle. Re’aya, as the Holy One blessed be He showed [herahu] him to Moses and to all of Israel and said to them: ‘From the beginning I appointed him to build the Tabernacle.’ Shoval, because he built a dovecote [shovakh] for God; this is the Tabernacle, that would stand like a dovecote. (It stood tall, like a dovecote (Etz Yosef). )  Rabbi Yehuda bar Rabbi Simon said: The Holy One blessed be He established a Tabernacle for Israel like a dovecote. (Just as a dovecote protects doves who flock to it, the Israelites would flock to the Tabernacle on the festivals (Etz Yosef). )  Yaḥat, because he imposed fear of Him [ḥitito] upon Israel. Aḥumai, because he united [iḥa] Israel with the Holy One blessed be He, and rendered them like brothers [aḥim] to the Omnipresent. Alternatively, Aḥumai, because he imposed the fear of God upon Israel. Laḥad, because he placed glory and grandeur upon Israel, as the Tabernacle was their glory. Alternatively, Laḥad, because the lowliest of tribes cleaved to him. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Pazi said: You have none greater than the tribe of Judah, and you have no lowlier that the tribe of Dan, as it was from the concubines. And what is written in its regard? “The son of Dan was Ḥushim” (Genesis 46:23). (The fact that Dan had only one son is another reason he was considered of lower status than other tribes (Etz Yosef). Alternatively, the term “son” is written in plural such that a literal rendition of the verse would be: The sons of Dan were Ḥushim. Dan’s only son was referred to in plural as a sign that he was important even though he was from Dan. )  The Holy One blessed be He said: Let him (Dan.)  come and join him, (Judah.)  so that [people] will not demean him and so there will be no person who is arrogant, because the great and the lowly are equal before the Omnipresent. Betzalel was from Judah and Oholiav from Dan, and he joined him. (See Exodus 31:6. )   Rabbi Ḥanina said: The great and the lowly are equal. A person should never forsake his strength. (A person should not think that he cannot be strengthened and aided by an individual of humble lineage. )  The Tabernacle was crafted by these two tribes, and likewise the Temple [was constructed by] Solomon from Judah, and Ḥiram “son of a widowed woman from the tribe of Naphtali” (I Kings 7:14).  The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I am your strength.’ Do not forsake your strength or the strength of your fathers, so, too, do not forsake Him, as it is written: “The Almighty shall be your strength [betzarekha]” (Job 22:25). Make Him your strength so that He will be with you in all distress [betzara] that befalls you, as it is stated: “I will be with him in distress” (Psalms 91:15). Alternatively, betzarekha, that if enemies come, I will be against them, as it is stated: “The Almighty shall be your strength [betzarekha].” (Tzarekha means “your enemies” and therefore the term betzarekha can be understood to mean “against your enemies.”)  Alternatively, He will become your walls, as betzarekha is nothing other than a wall, just as it says: “The fortification [umivtzar] of your towering walls” (Isaiah 25:12). The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘In this world I am a wall for you, and likewise in the future when Zion will be rebuilt, I will become a wall for it,’ as it is stated: “I will be for it, the utterance of the Lord, a wall of fire all around, and I will be in its midst for glory” (Zechariah 2:9), and likewise: “I have called your name, you are Mine” (Isaiah 43:1). (The subsequent verses discuss how God will protect Israel. ) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>We read in Chronicles I 16,27: הוד והדר לפניו, עז וחדוה במקומו, &quot;Glory and majesty are before Him, strength and joy are in His place.&quot; This verse contains a lesson about the exiles of the Jewish people, i.e. that they are for the good of the Jewish people. The chapter quoted describes an ongoing activity, i.e. בשרו מיום אל יום ישועתו, that even the redemption that has not occurred yet should be spoken of daily, or better still, it refers to a period of over one thousand years. Considering that in our eyes G–d's day is equal to a millenium, it follows that this is why Adam died on the day he ate from the tree (as he was warned he would in Genesis 2,17), though he lived close to one thousand years, the verse quoted in Chronicles, clearly refers to a period of exile. Lamentations 1,13, which describes the exile as already lasting כל היום,-at least one thousand years,- prompts the Zohar to comment that &quot;my very glory,&quot; הודי, has proven to be my ruin.&quot; When you re-arrange the letter of the word הוד, you get דוה, as in כל היום דוה, &quot;suffering constantly&quot; (ibid.). I have already elaborated on this elsewhere, where I wrote that the word &quot;הדר,&quot; is derived from &quot;היפוך, i.e. &quot;turning something around, reversing it,&quot; similar to the meaning of the expression &quot;הדרן עלך,&quot; i.e. הפוך בה והפוך בה,&quot; (keep reviewing it, keep busy with it). What the Zohar meant was that the original &quot;הוד,&quot; glory, will eventually lead to an even greater degree of &quot;הוד&quot; in the messianic future, just because that &quot;הוד&quot; had been converted to &quot;דוה.&quot; We are told of that day in the future that ישמח ה' במעשיו, &quot;that G–d will delight in His works&quot; (Psalms 104,31). When you re-arrange the letters of the word ישמח, you have the word משיח, a reference to when that time will come. Concerning that day, the Midrash says that the Messiah will be given the combined “הוד, glory of Moses and הדר (its reversal) of Joshua, meaning that from the time of Joshua the spiritual decline set in, and the glory, הוד, kept turning into progressively more דוה, suffering. The הדר, decline would then reverse itself, i.e. the meaning of that term would no longer be negative. This process will lead to the cessation and disappearance of the iniquity due to the pollutants that the serpent spread throughout the world, and will enable the Messiah to make his appearance, and the new dimension of &quot;light,&quot; the glory of the Messiah to manifest itself. The הדר (reduced measure of majesty in relation to Moses) of the new leader Joshua will be reversed at that time, a time described in Ezra 2,63 as the period when there is once again a High Priest who can stand in front of the אורים ותומים, the time when Elijah will have appeared. This period is alluded to when the Torah tells us in Numbers 27,21 that the new leader of the Jewish people will have to consult G–d by means of the אורים ותומים, i.e. the Ineffable Name worn by the High Priest Elazar in his breast plate. We also find an allusion to messianic times when the Jewish people are counted in our portion; the name of the son of Dan is given as שוחם (26,42), whereas in Parshat Vayigash, (Genesis 46,23) it is given as חשים. I have found that the Ari comments on this that the reason why the letter ו is missing in the spelling of that name in Genesis is to allude to the letters in the word משיח. In the time immediately preceding the arrival of the Messiah, one of the descendants of Dan will conduct a great battle. All this is mentioned in the Zohar's commentary on Parshat Balak (page 68-69, Sullam edition). It is based on Genesis 49,17: &quot;Dan shall be a serpent (נחש) by the road, a viper (שפיפון) by the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider is thrown backwards.&quot; According to the Zohar, the &quot;serpent&quot; is a reference to Shimshon whereas the &quot;viper&quot; is a reference to Elijah who rescued Tzaliah a descendant of Dan when the latter &quot;flew&quot; in pursuit of Bileam. The latter, escaped by means of sorcery and Tzaliah was at a loss what to do. When Numbers 23,3 describes Bileam as וילך שפי, this is a reference to Bileam's profound identification with the negative forces in this world as symbolized by the serpent. Jacob's blessing to Dan referred to above and resulted in two descendants of Dan referred to as Tzaliah and Ira asserting mastery over the evil forces of this world. Ira was one of David's warriors. This is what is alluded to in Samuel II 8,4: &quot;David hamstrung all the horses (of his adversary)…&quot;The רכב referred to in that verse alludes to Genesis 49,17, i.e. an exploit of Dan. The words ויפול רוכבו אחור in that same verse refer to someone called Shalyah from the tribe of Dan who will assist the משיח בן יוסף in the war preceding the coming of the Messiah. The verse in Genesis concludes with the word לישועתך קויתי השם, to indicate that looking forward to imminent redemption at that time will be justified. The reason why the son of Dan here is referred to as שוחם is to express the hope that this descendant of Dan at the time mentioned will be equivalent to the משוח מלחמה, the Priest whose special task it was to accompany Israel in battle (Sotah 42 on Deuteronomy 20,2). [Active participation in war was certainly not the Priest's normal function. In fact any priest who had killed a person was no longer fit to perform Service in the Temple. Ed.] Pinchas too, seeing that he was descended maternally from the tribe of Joseph, whose descendants will play the leading role in the battle preceding the coming of the Messiah, was such a משוח מלחמה. At a later stage this very שוחם is &quot;transformed&quot; into a חומש. When someone has inadvertently used sacred property, i.e. Temple property, for personal or mundane purposes, he must make restitution of the principal amount plus twenty per cent so that the total amount paid back is twenty percent (חומש) larger than the original. The people of Israel are considered as קדש לשם &quot;sacred to the Lord,&quot; as Rashi explains on Song of Songs 8,12: האלף לך שלמה, ומאתים לנוטרים את פריו. Israel is considered G–d's vineyard, and anything stolen from it must not only be replaced, but the חומש, in this case מאתים, must be added to make the restitution legal.</p>

Above (2:3), the text began to present the lines of the tribes; but it interrupted with Levi, presenting their lines and their dwelling-places according to their cities. So now, it returns to provide the lines of the tribes and the numbers that they totaled in the time of King David of Israel. As for those that it leaves out and does not mention here, it mentions them along with all the rest when it relates how they joined David in Hebron in order to coronate him (1 Chr 12:24–39). The text does not, however, provide the lines of Dan and his sons. Some say, though (cf. the commentary attributed to a student of Saadia), that “Ḥushim the sons of aḥer” mentioned near the sons of Naphtali (v. 12) refers to Hushim son of Dan (Gen 46:23). In the case of Naphtali also, it does not provide his progeny beyond his sons (v. 13): perhaps [Ezra] did not find their lines recorded, nor was it told to him by tradition. Alternatively, it includes the genealogies that it left out when it says at the end, “All Israel was registered by genealogies; and these are in the book of the kings of Israel” (1 Chr 9:1).</p>

              <p>Because of the murder of the sons of Jehoiada the priest. Perhaps when [the people] killed Zechariah (vv. 21–22) they also killed the rest of Jehoiada’s sons. Alternatively, Jehoiada had no sons then except for Zechariah, because the rest of his sons—to whom the text alludes when it says “and he fathered sons and daughters” (v. 3)—had already died. So the only one of Jehoiada’s sons left was Zechariah—whom they killed—and it says “because of the murder of the sons of Jehoiada” in the same sense as “The sons of Dan: Hushim” (Gen 46:23).</p>

              <p>AND HIS SONS’ DAUGHTERS. These were Serah, the daughter of Asher, and Jochebed, the daughter of Levi. This is the language of Rashi. But what will Rashi include in the term, his daughters, [which is also plural, although Jacob only had one daughter, Dinah]? Rather, it is the way of Scripture, when mentioning the genealogy of many people, to refer to an individual in the plural form, as for example, And the sons of Dan: Hushim; (Verse 23 here.)  And the sons of Palu: Eliab. (Numbers 26:8.)  The same is true here: “daughters” refer to Dinah. “His sons’ daughters” refers to Serah the daughter of Asher, but Jochebed [Moses’ mother] is not mentioned by Scripture [as being among the persons who went down to Egypt], as it is said, All the souls were threescore and six. (Verse 26 here.)  She is, however, hinted at, according to the opinion of our Rabbis. (Baba Bathra 123a. See also Ramban, next Verse.) </p>

              <p>Dasan and Aviram and On the son of Peles. So that one does not explain “the sons of Reuvein” as referring to Peles alone, and that he was [identical with] Palu son of Reuvein. We find this language elsewhere, as in “the sons of Dan are Chushim” (Bereishis 46:23) and “the sons of Palu are Eliav” (Bamidbar 26:8) where the Torah refers to them in the plural form even though there was only one son. Therefore Rashi explains that the sons of Reuvein were “Dasan and Aviram and On son of Peles,” meaning that Peles was also one of the descendants of Reuvein. We need not ask how one might have thought that Peles was [another name for] Palu when, if so, the Torah should have placed On before Dasan and Aviram, given that they were sons of Eliav son of Palu whereas On was the son of Palu himself! This is not a difficulty because the Torah merely places first those who were more vociferous in the dispute. You might ask: Perhaps he was really the son of Palu, and how does Rashi know that he was not? It appears that Rashi was careful to state “and On son of Peles” because the Torah should have just said “Dasan, Aviram and On.” Why does Scripture write “son of Peles”? This is Rashi’s inference. Furthermore, the Torah writes “On son of Peles” while it should have written “the sons of Eliav, and On, the sons of Peles, son of Reuvein” given that Eliav and On would have been brothers, both sons of Peles, if he had been Palu. Finally, it should not have said “the sons of Reuvein” instead of “son [of Reuvein]” and “son [of Peles]” instead of “sons [of Peles].” Rather “sons” must mean “from the family of Reuvein” and therefore Rashi adds “and On the son of Peles.” R. Yaakov Triosh. Re’m writes: There are opinions that Rashi means to say that “the sons of Reuvein” refers back to “Dasan and Aviram” alone, and not to On, as if the Torah had said that Dasan and Aviram were from the sons of Reuvein, but that On was a son of Peles and not from the sons of Reuvein. There are also opinions that Rashi’s intention is just the opposite and that it also refers back to On, in order that one not say that “the sons of Reuven” refers to Dasan and Aviram but not to On. This might be so, given that neither On nor Peles are ever mentioned along with the sons of Reuvein. Re’m rejects both of these opinions, and I have written what appears most correct to me.</p>

              <p>Appointed over them. Rashi is answering the question: The verses contradict each other, because here it says “by the instruction of Aharon and his sons” and afterwards it writes (v.28) “under the supervision of Isamar son of Aharon the Kohein.” He answers that the second verse explains the previous one — which of his sons was appointed over them? [the second verse] explains that it was Isamar son of Aharon. You might ask: Since only Isamar was appointed, why did it write ובניו (lit. and his sons) in the plural. However this is not a question because in many places we see the plural used for a single son, for example “ובני (lit. and the sons) of Don is Chushim” (Bereishis 46:23) and “ובני (lit. and the sons) of Palu is Eliav” (Bamidbar 26:8).</p>

Rava said to Abaye: Perhaps this verse should be understood as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught, that Hushim is not the name of Dan’s son but that they, Dan’s sons, were as numerous as the groups [ḥushim] of reeds. Rather, Rava said: One can prove this usage of the term sons in the verse: “And the sons of Pallu: Eliab” (Numbers 26:8). Rav Yosef said: This can be proven from another verse: “And the sons of Ethan: Azariah” (I Chronicles 2:8).</p>

Bereshit Rabbati 46:25) that the text mentions Bilhah to praise her, because she married Jacob willingly; for concerning her, it does not say “she took” as with Zilpah (Gen 30:9), but only “she gave” (Gen 30:4).</p>

Zilpah had a total of 16, including Chever and Malkiel. Rachel’s descendants at that time were 14, and Bilhah’s were seven. You have to deduct Joseph and his two sons as well as Yocheved, [who did not descend. Ed.], as explained by Rashi. Compare verse 46 according to which the number is made up of people having left the land of Canaan. The words: יוצאי ירך יעקב, “biological offspring of Yaakov,” have been added to tell us that the wives of both Yaakov and his sons were not included. [Our author may have added these words as otherwise we would have to assume that both Bilhah and Zilpah had already died. Ed.]</p>

              <p>יוצאי ירכו מלבד נשי בני יעקב, “his biological descendants aside from the wives of Yaakov’s sons.” According to our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 84,19 where Rabbi Yehudah claimed that a twin sister was born to each one of Yaakov’s sons, the words יוצאי ירכו here are an allusion to the fact that the wives of the sons of Yaakov were each one of those twins. What would be the point of the Torah writing: “apart from the wives of the sons of Yaakov,” if the reference had been to Canaanite women whom the brothers married? Who would ever have thought that Canaanites would have been included in the count? The Torah had to mention that these women were not included in the count of seventy precisely because they were descendants of Yaakov. When the Torah here concludes with the words כל נפש ששים ושש, “all the persons sixty-six,” this is because only sixty-six were included in the ones previously described as הבאים מצרימה, arriving in Egypt. Joseph and his two sons as well as Yocheved (who did not make the journey as she had not been born yet) made up the missing four from the number seventy. The Torah testified in Numbers 26,59 that “Yocheved was born for Levi in Egypt.”</p>

              <p>כל הנפש הבאה, we are told about number of the members of Yaakov’s household appearing with the masculine ending twice, such as the number fourteen in verse 22, and the number seven in verse 25. On the other hand, in verse 15 the Torah uses the feminine ending for the number 33 (שלושים ושלוש) and in verse 18 it uses the feminine ending for the number 16 (שש עשרה). The reason for this apparent anomaly is that the noun נפש mentioned in verse 26, for instance is feminine, hence the number associated with that noun has to be in the feminine mode also. The word בני being in the masculine mode, however, determines that the adjective or attribute accompanying it be in the same mode, i.e. masculine.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>כל הנפש הבאה ליעקב EVERY SOUL THAT WAS COMING WITH JACOB — every soul that left Canaan to go to Egypt The word הבאה, here, is not a perfect tense, but a participle with a relative present sense — just as (Ester 2:4) “In the evening she (באה) was coming” and (Genesis 29:7) “and, behold, Rachel his daughter is coming (באה)” and therefore the accent is on the last syllable, on the א, because when they left, coming from the land of Canaan, they were only sixty-six. But at the second mention of this word (Genesis 46:27) — “every soul of the house of Jacob, which came (הבאה) into Egypt were seventy” — it is a perfect tense and therefore it is accented on the last but one syllable, on the ב. The reason is, that when they came there, they were seventy, for they found Joseph and his two sons there, and Jochebed was added to their number “between the walls”. According to the view of the Rabbi (i. e. R. Jehudah, cf. Genesis Rabbah 84) who stated that with each of Jacob’s sons a twin-sister was born, we must say that these died before they (Jacob and his family) went down to Egypt, because they are not enumerated here. In Vayikra Rabbah 4:6 I found the following: When he left Canaan (cf. Genesis 36:6) Esau’s family consisted of only six (himself and his five sons), and Scripture calls them “the souls of his house” (in the plural) and this is because they worshipped many gods (each serving a different god and having as it were, a different soul or religious feeling). But the family of Jacob when he came to Egypt consisted of seventy and Scripture calls them “soul”, in the singular, because they all served One God. </p>

              <p>“Every male” – why “every male,” and it does not mention every female? It is because the glory of the Holy One blessed be He is exalted by the males. David said: “Behold, sons are a portion of the Lord; a reward, the fruit of one’s womb.” (Psalms 127:3). “Behold, sons are a portion of the Lord” – these are the males, but if the females came, they too are a reward.  “From one month old and above you shall count them” – why “from one month old and above”? Are they able to guard the Tent of Meeting from one month old? He Himself requests those who should guard it; why does He count “from one month old”? Rabbi Huna HaKohen said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Ze’eira: It is in order to double their reward. Why? You find that they approach to serve only from thirty years old. Why then does He count them from one month old? It is so they will receive reward while they are still one month old.  Rabbi Huna HaKohen said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Ze’eira: You find written in Samuel’s regard: “Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life” (I Samuel 7:15). Did Samuel judge Israel “all the days of his life”? But all the days of his life were only fifty-two years, and you find two during which he was nursing, forty years during which Eli was alive and judging, in which Samuel was unable to judge before his teacher, and two years that Saul ruled; that is forty-two. Ten years remained there; that is, he bore the burden of Israel for only ten years, but it is written: “Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.” Rather, the Holy One blessed be He said: I am writing in his regard “all the days of his life” so that he will receive reward for all the days that he existed in the world. Regarding the tribe of Levi, too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses that he should count them from one month old and above, so that their reward would be calculated for them from one month old. That is, “from one month old and above you shall count them.”  Another matter: “From one month old” – Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi bar Rabbi Shalom said: The Holy One blessed be He is accustomed to be counting this tribe everywhere from when they are still young. From where is it derived? When the Holy One blessed be He said to Jacob to descend to Egypt, at that moment he counted his offspring; they all totaled sixty-six, as it is stated: “All the people were sixty-six” (Genesis 46:26). The two sons of Joseph and Joseph, that is sixty-nine. But it says: “All the people of the house of Jacob who came to Egypt were seventy” (Genesis 46:27). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The Holy One blessed be He is accustomed to count this tribe while they are still in their mother’s womb. Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen bar Rabbi said: This resin does not begin to emerge before one absorbs it; (As soon as it appears it is taken. Similarly as soon as the Levite appears, he is counted.)  so, Yokheved, her mother was pregnant with her at that moment, and she was in her mother’s womb and she was counted. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: Before her mother entered into the threshold of Egypt, she gave birth to her. That is why it is stated in her regard: “With seventy people your ancestors descended to Egypt.” (Deuteronomy 10:22). Regarding the children of her children as well: “Every male from one month old and above, you shall count them.” Why is it so? It is because this tribe is always beloved before the Holy One blessed be He. Of all the tribes, it is only this tribe alone that was chosen, as it is stated: “And chose it from all the tribes of Israel to be priests for Me” (I Samuel 2:28).  Rabbi Levi said: You find that there are many items that the Holy One blessed be He created in the world and he selected one of them for Himself. He created seven days, and the Holy One blessed be He chose Shabbat, as it is stated: “God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it” (Genesis 2:3). He created years, and selected one for Himself, as it is stated: “The land shall observe a Shabbat for the Lord; [.…the seventh year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land]” (Leviticus 25:2–4). He created seven-year cycles and selected one for Himself, as it is stated: “You shall sanctify the fiftieth year” (Leviticus 25:10). He created lands, and selected one of them for Himself, the Land of Israel, as it is stated: “The eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it” (Deuteronomy 11:12). Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He characterizes it as His land: “They divided My land” (Joel 4:2). He created heavens, and selected one of them for Himself; this is the highest heaven, as it is stated: “Praise Him who rides in the highest heavens” (Psalms 68:5). He created nations, and selected one of them for Himself; this is Israel, as it is stated: “And the Lord has chosen you to be a treasured people for Him” (Deuteronomy 14:2). He created tribes, and selected one of them for Himself; this is the tribe of Levi, as it is stated: “And chose it from all the tribes of Israel” (I Samuel 2:28). That is why the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses to count them from one month old, because He is exceedingly fond of them.  They raised an objection: According to these reasons, He should have counted them from one day old. Our Rabbis of blessed memory said: Why was it necessary to count them from one month old? It is because a one-day-old is not viable, but it is known that a one-month-old is viable; therefore, “from one month old and above you shall count them.” Alternatively, why were they counted from one month old? It is because the Levites were counted in this census only in order to redeem the firstborn of Israel. Just as the firstborn are redeemed from one month old, so the Levites were counted from one month old.</p>

              <p>“All the people who were coming with Jacob to Egypt, the products of his loins, aside from the wives of Jacob's sons; all the people were sixty-six” (Genesis 46:26).  “And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two people; all the people of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, were seventy” (Genesis 46:27).  “All the people who were coming…. And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him…” – Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Have you ever in your days seen a person give another sixty-six cups, and then give him another three, and he counts them as seventy? Rather, this is Yokheved, who completed the tally of Israel in Egypt. (The verses list a total of sixty-nine people but it then states that the total was seventy. This is an allusion to Yokheved, who was born as they arrived in Egypt, and is counted in the final tally even though she is not listed by name. )  Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Yokheved was conceived in the land of Canaan, and born in the land of Egypt. That is what is written: “The name of Amram's wife was Yokheved, [daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt]” (Numbers 26:59) – she was born at the gates of Egypt.   And Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: The Holy One blessed be He is accustomed to count this tribe while it is still in its mother’s womb. That is what is written: “For Yedutun, the sons of Yedutun: Gedalyahu, and Tzeri, and Yeshayahu, Ḥashavyahu, and Matityahu, [six]” (I Chronicles 25:3) – they are five [who are mentioned] specifically, but a total of six. However, there is “Shimi” (I Chronicles 25:17). The Holy One blessed be He counted him while he was still in his mother’s womb. And were a person to say to you: “The tenth was Shimi” (I Chronicles 25:17), say to him: Tenth for the platform. (This is regarding the order in which they would perform their role as singers on the platform in the Temple.)   And Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: [From the time] our patriarch Jacob would engage in conjugal relations, the Holy One blessed be He would call [his future children] souls. That is what is written: “Or tallied one-quarter [rova] (Rova is understood as a reference to the sexual act (see, similarly, Leviticus 18:23). The Holy One blessed be He counts them even before conception.)  of Israel” (Numbers 23:10). Rabbi Berekhya said: It is like sap, which is absorbed even before it has emerged.  Some say: Jacob completed the tally with them. (The final tally of seventy includes Jacob himself.)  Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is analogous to two of the emperor’s legions, the Decumani and the Augustiani. When the emperor is counted with these they are deemed complete, and when the emperor is counted with those, as well, they are deemed complete. (Since the emperor is sometimes found with each legion, he is included in their official number. )   Some say: The Holy One blessed be He completed the tally with them. (The final tally of seventy includes God Himself, who accompanied Jacob and his family into exile in Egypt.)   Some say: Ḥushim son of Dan completed the tally with them. (The verse states: “The sons of Dan: Ḥushim” (Genesis 46:23) – it says “the sons” in plural, because Ḥushim was counted as two. This is because he had many offspring.)  In Rabbi Meir’s Torah they found it written: “The son of Dan: Ḥushim.” (The word “son” appeared in the singular rather than in the plural. Some explain that this means that Rabbi Meir wrote the word “son” on the side of his scroll next to the word “sons” as an explanatory note, so that it would not be understood that Dan actually had more than just one son. This supports the idea that the word “sons” is written in plural to indicate that Ḥushim counted as two in the count of the seventy members of Jacob’s family (Yefeh To’ar). )  That is what is written: “They came to the Gilad, and to the land of Taḥtim Ḥodshi, [and they came to Dan Yaan]” (II Samuel 24:6) – Beit Yeraḥ, Yeraḥ Sinim. (These were the names of these places in the talmudic period.)  A measure for a measure: (This is the way the midrash expounds the word Yaan that is appended to the name Dan, as this word means “because” and indicates a “measure for measure” cause and effect. See, similarly, Leviticus 26:43. )  Dan entered in his darkened state (With just one son, who was deaf.)  before his father, and was blessed with seventy thousand. (In the two censuses in the Book of Numbers, the tribe of Dan numbered between sixty and seventy thousand (see Numbers 1:39, 26:43). )  Benjamin entered with ten, and was blessed with forty thousand. (Although Benjamin had ten sons, his tribe numbered only around thirty-five thousand and forty-five thousand respectively during the two censuses in the Book of Numbers (see Numbers 1:37, 26:41). )   Some say: Seraḥ daughter of Asher completed the tally with them. That is what is written: “A wise woman called from the city…. He approached her, and the woman said: Are you Yoav?” (II Samuel 20:16–17). She said to him: ‘Your name is Yoav, to say that you are a father [av] to Israel, but you are nothing but a reaper, (A killer.)  and you do not correspond to your name. Are you and David not versed in Torah, or has Torah now ceased [to be in effect]? Is it not written: “When you approach a city to wage war against it, you shall call to it for peace”?’ (Deuteronomy 20:10). He said to her: ‘Who are you?’ She said to him: “I am the peaceful [shelumei] and loyal [emunei] of Israel” (II Samuel 20:19) (The plural terms shelumei and emunei are difficult in context, and the midrash therefore expounds these terms. )  – I am the one who completed [shehishlamti] the tally [minyanan] of Israel in Egypt. I am the one who delivered the loyal to the loyal – Joseph to Moses. (Seraḥ showed Moses where Joseph was buried so that he could take Joseph’s bones from Egypt to the Land of Israel (Sota 13a). )  Why “do you seek to destroy a city” (II Samuel 20:19), and I, who am “a mother in Israel”? (II Samuel 20:19). Immediately, “Yoav answered and said: Far be it, far be it from me [that I would ruin or destroy]” (II Samuel 20:20). “Far be it, far be it,” twice – far be it from David, far be it from Yoav, far be it from the kingdom of the house of David. “[The matter] is not so. Rather, a man from Mount Ephraim, Sheva son of Bikhri is his name, has raised his hand against the king, against David (II Samuel 20:21) – if [he already said] “against the king,” why [did he also say] “against David”; if “against David,” why “against the king”? Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: Anyone who is impudent to a king, it is as though he was impudent to a Torah scholar; all the more so, [if he is impudent] to a king and a Torah scholar. Rabbi Yudan said: Anyone who is impudent to a king, it is as though he is impudent to the Divine Presence.   “[The woman] said…Behold, his head will be cast to you” (II Samuel 20:21). How did she know? (How did she know she would be able to apprehend Sheva ben Bikhri.)  It is because she said: ‘Anyone who is impudent to the kingdom of the house of David, will be beheaded from above.’ (God will ensure that he is apprehended. )  Immediately, “the woman came to all the people, in her wisdom” (II Samuel 20:22). She said to them: ‘Do you not know the exploits of David? What nation stood against him? What kingdom stood against him?’ They said to her: ‘What does he want?’ She said to them: ‘One thousand men; are one thousand men not preferable to destroying your entire city?’ They said to her: ‘Let each and every one give in accordance with what he has.’ (Each household will turn over a proportion of its members. )  She said to them: ‘Perhaps, as the result of appeasement, he will forgo a bit.’ She made herself out as though she was going to appease and returned; from one thousand to five hundred, (She made them believe she had negotiated Yoav down from the one thousand men that he demanded to only five hundred. )  to one hundred, to ten, to one, and he is a guest. ‘Who is it?’ ‘It is Sheva son of Bikhri.’ Immediately, they severed his head.   It is taught: A group of people to whom the gentiles said: ‘Give us one of you and we will kill him, and if not, we will kill all of you,’ they shall all be killed, and they shall not deliver one soul of Israel. But if they designated him for them, like Sheva son of Bikhri, they shall give, and all of them shall not be killed. Rabbi Yehuda said: In what case are these matters stated? It is when he is inside and they are outside. (When he is trapped by the besieging army but they are not totally trapped, it is possible they will escape the army even if they do not deliver him to the army. Consequently, they may not turn him over. )  But if he is inside and they are inside, since he will be killed and they will be killed, they shall deliver him to them and all of them will not be killed. Like it says: “The woman came to all the people” (II Samuel 20:22) – since he will be killed and you will be killed, give him to them and let you all not be killed. Rabbi Shimon says: Anyone who revolts against the kingdom of the house of David is liable to death.   Ulla ben Kishar was sought by the empire. He rose and fled to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to Lod. They sent a messenger after him. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi approached [Ulla ben Kishar] and appeased him. He said to him: ‘It is preferable that this man [i.e. you] be killed, and let the entire community not be punished on his account.’ He appeased him and he delivered him to [the messenger]. Elijah was accustomed to speak with [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi]. Once he did this, [Elijah] did not come to him any longer. He fasted over him for thirty days, and he appeared to him. [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi] said to him: ‘What is the reason that my master absented himself?’ He said to him: ‘Do I associate with informers?’ He said to him: ‘Is it not a baraita: A group of people…’ He said to him: ‘Is that a mishna of the pious? That act should have been performed by others and not by you.’   It is taught: When Nebuchadnezzar ascended to conquer Yehoyakim, he ascended and encamped at Daphne at Antioch. The Great Sanhedrin descended to greet him. They said to him: ‘Has the time arrived for this house to be destroyed?’ He said to them: ‘No, but Yehoyakim king of Judah has revolted against me. Give him to me and I will go.’ They went and said to Yehoyakim: ‘Nebuchadnezzar wants you.’ He said to them: ‘Is this how one acts? Does one disregard one life in favor of another life? Is it not so written: “You shall not hand over a slave to his master”?’ (Deuteronomy 23:16). They said to him: ‘Is this not what your ancestor did to Sheva son of Bikhri? That is what is written: “Behold, his head is cast to you over the wall”’ (II Samuel 20:21). When [Yehoyakim] did not heed them, they rose, took him, and lowered him [to Nebuchadnezzar], who dismembered him.</p>

It is simply that the Holy One said: In as much as they have given their souls to me, go and number them separately. Now when had they given their souls to the Holy One? When Israel had committed that act (of the golden calf). It is so stated (in Exod. 32:26): SO MOSES STOOD UP IN THE GATE OF THE CAMP [AND SAID: WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD,  TO ME.

Buber, n. 154, who notes that the Oxford MS, Michael 577, No. 155 (described on pp. 141-142 of his introduction), reads, betsidqam, i.e., “in their righteousness.” Buber, however, prefers the better-attested reading, bemumehen, which can also mean “by some things of theirs” and which he interprets as the equivalent of “by their vow.” Still the simple translation, “in their blemishes” could mean that the Levites were deficient in not having been enrolled for the Holy One and that their enrollment now made them whole.)  go and number them. (In the words of Numb. 3:15): ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI. R. Judah bar Shallum says: The Holy One is accustomed to numbering  this tribe in every case while they are young. (Numb. R. 3:8.)  How is it shown? When the Holy One told Jacob to go down to Egypt, at that time he numbered Israel and his children; and all of them were found  sixty-six, [as stated (in Gen. 46:26): AND ALL THE SOULS… WERE SIXTY-SIX.] In addition were Joseph's two sons, plus Joseph, for a total of seventy minus one. But it says (in vs. 27): ALL THE SOULS OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB, WHICH CAME TO EGYPT, WERE SEVENTY. R. Levi said: R. Samuel bar Nahman said: The Holy One customarily numbers this tribe while they are in their mother's womb. (Gen. R. 94:9 and M. Pss. 92:12.)  R. Berekhyah [the Priest Berabbi] said: There is not enough resin to flow out before they collect it. (Rt.: SPG; cf. the Gk.: spoggos (“sponges”).)  So it was in the case of Jochebed.

Resh Laqish said: While her mother was entering the gate of Egypt, her mother gave birth to her. The statement is therefore made concerning seventy souls (in Gen. 46:27). And also concerning her children's children, the Holy One said to Moses (in Numb. 3:15): [YOU SHALL ENROLL] EVERY MALE FROM THE AGE OF A MONTH AND UPWARD. Moses said to him: Am I able to persevere and go around into their courtyards and into the midst of their houses to number each and every one of them, when you say (ibid.): EVERY MALE FROM THE AGE OF A MONTH AND UPWARD?

              <p>(Numb. 3:15:) “Enroll the Children of Levi….” This text is related (to Ps. 68:7), “God causes individuals to dwell in a home.” A certain matron (Lat.: matrona.)  asked R. Jose ben Halafta, “In how many days [did the Holy One, blessed be He, create the world?” He said to her, “In six days, as stated (in Exod. 31:17), ‘for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth.’” (Gen. R. 68:4; Lev. R. 8:1; Numb. R. 3:6; PRK 2:4; below, Numb. 9:9; cf. above, Gen. 1:2.)  She said to him, “Ever since the world was created, what does He do?” “He sits [there] arranging marriages and issuing decrees. So He says, ‘So-and-so shall marry so-and-so.’” (Ps. 68:7), “God causes individuals to dwell in a home.” Who are they? This was Amram and his wife Yochebed, since through their merit the Holy One, blessed be He, brought Israel out of Egypt, where they had been enslaved with clay and bricks. (The Exodus theme is suggested by what follows in Ps. 68:7): HE BRINGS OUT THE PRISONERS INTO PROSPERITY, Cf. M. Pss. 68:4.)  What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He married Yochebed to Amram in order to raise up from them a redeemer for Israel and from them to raise up high priests. It is therefore stated (ibid.), “God causes individuals to dwell in a home.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In as much as this tribe is accustomed to be raising up redeemers, go and number them.” (Numb. 3:15:) “Enroll the Children of Levi….” But it is written in another place (i.e., in Numb. 1:49), “However, you shall not enroll the tribe of Levi, nor shall you take a census of them.” (Cf. Numb. R. 3:7.)  When Israel had made the calf, what is written there (in Exod. 32:26)? “So Moses stood up in the gate of the camp and said, ‘Whoever is for the Lord, to me!’ And all of the sons of Levi gathered to him.” Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, (in the words of Numb. 3:15), “Enroll the Children of Levi.” R. Judah bar Shallum said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, is accustomed to numbering [the children of] this tribe in every case while they are young. (Numb. R. 3:8.)  How is it shown? When the Holy One, blessed be He, told Jacob to go down to Egypt, at that time he numbered Israel and his children; and all of them were found [to number] sixty-six, as stated (in Gen. 46:26), “And all the souls of the House of Jacob that came that came to Egypt… were sixty-six.” [In addition were] Joseph's two sons, plus Joseph, for a total of seventy minus one. But it says (in vs. 27), “all the souls of the House of Jacob, which came to Egypt, were seventy.” R. Levi said that R.

              <p>And in order to set one's mind at rest in this, I have thought it fit to introduce an exalted thought here which is rooted in the Yerushalmi adduced by Semag, that if one were walking on the road and struck one of his feet with the other and, in doing so, fell to the ground and hurt his body, his face and also that foot — aside from the fact that it would never enter his mind to take revenge of that foot by [desisting] from healing it, he would also harbor no hatred whatsoever against it. For what is the foot and what are his body and his face — they all are one [body], but divided into organs. Rather, he would reason that his sins caused this. Here, too, if it happened that his friend did not benefit him with a certain good that he asked of him, or even if he grieved or insulted him in some way, he should not avenge himself and harbor hatred against him. For who is his friend and who is he? Both are from one root, as it is written (I Chronicles 17:21): &quot;And who is like Your people, Israel, one nation in the land?&quot; And it is written [Bereshith 46:27): &quot;All of the soul of the house of Jacob that came etc.&quot; It is not written &quot;souls,&quot; to teach us that all the souls of Israel above are reckoned as one soul. It is just that each one is an entity in itself. As with a man in his entirety — even though, as a whole, he is one man, still, he has organs which are &quot;heads&quot; to him, like the head and the heart; and there are those beneath these, like the hand and the foot. And it is also into one rest that all of Israel will gather in the end — under the Throne of Glory — as it is written (I Samuel 25:29): &quot;And the soul of my lord will be bound in the bond of life with the L-rd your G-d, etc.&quot; It is just that because in this world, where everyone is clothed in his own matter by himself, and because each of his affairs and undertakings is an entity in itself that a man imagines himself to be a distinct person and not &quot;one&quot; with his fellow Jew at all — but this is not so.</p>

              <p>כהן-לוים-ישראלים, in descending order, are similar to נשמה-רוח-נפש. The Torah describes &quot;Adam&quot; on three levels, Genesis 2,7, ויהי אדם לנפש חיה. In Genesis 6,3, we find רוח האדם. Finally, in Genesis 2,7, we find him also as נשמת האדם. Kabbalists have described this parallel relationship and have claimed that this is the source for our reciting one hundred benedictions daily. The Israelite, who represents the נפש level, gives ten percent of his harvest to the Levite, who represents the רוח level. The Levite in turn, gives ten percent of what he has received to the Priest, who represents the נשמה level. This means the Priest is entitled to the &quot;number&quot; one (one out of a hundred). The author of Shaarey Orah as well as the author of Tolaat Yaakov have elaborated on the significance of these various numbers in the alphabet. We find the whole Jewish people referred to as נפש (singular), when Jacob and his family moved to Egypt (Genesis 46,27).</p>

              <p>We read in 12,48 that any male convert who wants to participate in the celebration of the Passover [in later years, after the Exodus. Ed.] must first circumcise himself. The same applies to a slave owned by a Jewish master (12,44). The reason is simply that as long as the powers of impurity are still a tangible part of such a male by reason of the presence of his foreskin he is not fit to approach the Presence of G–d. It is only by revealing the sign of the holy covenant that he becomes fit, and the Divine Presence is viewed as if drawing nourishment from that sanctified spot of the Covenant. There is another dimension to the inability of Israel to be redeemed except by the combination of the blood of circumcision and the blood of the Passover lamb. I have elaborated on this in the treatise cited above; here I will only summarize. A major component of the experience in Egypt was the need to re-instate the Holy Covenant and to repair the damage of the 130 years during which Adam had not maintained marital relations but had emitted semen which resulted in the creation of destructive agents in this world. This is why the redeemer (Moses) was born only 130 yars after the family of Jacob came to Egypt. Yochevet was 130 years old when Amram re-married her and when Moses was born, and she herself was conceived in the land of Canaan, but was not born until Jacob and his family arrived in Egypt, [viz: Rashi when reconciling the numbers of the Israelites who came down to Egypt as counted in Genesis 46,26. Ed.] I have alluded to this fact already several times in פרשת שמות.</p>

              <p>The entire nation is considered as if it were one person; this is why the Torah refers to the people as נפש, person (singular) already at the time Jacob descended into Egypt (Genesis 46,26, et al.). The significance of this lies in the fact that כי חלק ה' עמו, &quot;that His people Israel are part of G–d Himself&quot; (32,9). The remainder of mankind was divided into 70 nations, each one with a representative in the Celestial Regions, i.e. a horoscope presided over by a שר, &quot;Minister,&quot; as we know from 4,19: &quot;which the Lord your G–d assigned to all the nations; He took you and removed you from the iron crucible, from Egypt, to be for Him His very own nation, as is now the case&quot; (4,20). The Jewish people's fortunes are not guided by intermediaries such as horoscopes. The 70 nations were divided from one another as we know from 32,8: &quot;When the most High gave nations their homes and set the divisions of man, He fixed the boundaries of peoples in relation to Israel's numbers.&quot; The relationship (common denominator) between the &quot;numbers&quot; of Israel and that of the nations of the world is that Israel numbered 70 when they first went down to Egypt. The difference is only that the 70 Israelites that came to Egypt are all described as נפש, a single person. Any part of the Jewish nation is compared to the entire nation. Because Israel is part of G–d, it has an eternal future, as pointed out in Sanhedrin 90a: &quot;Every Israelite has a share in the World to Come.&quot;</p>

              <p>ואהבת לרעך כמוך . Philosophically speaking, we have demonstrated that the Jewish people are considered as a single unit; the seventy souls that came to Egypt are described as נפש, a single composite soul (Genesis 46,27), as distinct from the clan of Esau whose members are always described in the plural, to emphasize their diversity (Genesis chapter 36). You may well ask how you can be expected to love your fellow Jew just as yourself (19,18), when the reason you are to admonish him is that he commits transgressions which are apt to make you share in his punishment? The answer may be that we find many times that a person breaks his own hand or damages his own eyesight. He did not do so willingly, but the fact that it happened was a punishment for him. One does not stop loving oneself because one has caused oneself the loss of a hand or the loss of an eye. Similarly, one must not stop loving a fellow Jew who may have been or may become instrumental in causing one damage.</p>

              <p>We always proceed from the premise that all of Israel is considered נפש אחת, a single soul, life-force. Israel as a whole is called by the title אדם. As a reminder of this fact the family members of Jacob, 66 in number, who moved from the land of Canaan to Egypt in Genesis 46,26 are referred to as נפש, soul, or person, in the singular. Just as a body possesses 248 limbs, so the Jewish national body, known as אדם, comprises a great number of parts. The Zohar refers to these parts as שייפא דגופא, shavings or splinters of a body There are, of course, different levels of importance among the various parts of a regular body. The same is true when we describe the parts of the body which make up the Jewish nation. There is a head, a heart, an eye, a hand, etc. However, just as all the parts of the body combine to make a whole human being, so all the parts of the Jewish nation combine to make it one unit. The unit created by these many parts in turn combines to form the chariot, מרכבה, of the spiritual counterpart of terrestrial man in the Celestial Regions. This celestial אדם is perceived as sitting on the throne which is one of the 248 spiritual limbs that form the root of the 248 positive commandments, which, if performed by terrestrial man, are his true source of life (אשר יעשה אותם האדם וחי בהם Leviticus 18, 5).</p>

Tze'enah Ure'enah contrasts the treatment of Esau's family, referred to as many people due to idol worship, with Jacob's family, referred to as one soul due to their unity in serving one God.

We may have to understand this in connection with Isaiah 60 that all the Jewish souls originate in the same place as we have been told by Vayikra Rabbah 4,6 on Genesis 46,26 where all the 70 souls of the family of Jacob are described as כל הנפש, &quot;the whole soul&quot; (singular), as opposed to the souls of Esau which are described in the plural (Genesis 36). When the Torah writes that &quot;G'd will blot out his name from under the heaven, this means that G'd will not take action against this man and consign him to the forces of the קליפה which is here called רעה, &quot;evil,&quot; until He has separated his soul. This &quot;separation&quot; implies certain restrictions G'd imposes on the forces of the קליפה concerning the soul of this person. G'd makes it a point to always set some limits on the forces of destruction though He Himself allocated to these forces the parameters within which they may operate. We have quoted an example of such restrictions placed on the forces of destruction when Rava's father warned his son not to sleep in his bed in order not to be killed by these forces ( Taanit 24).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>SHALL I AND THY MOTHER AND THY BRETHREN INDEED COME TO PROSTRATE OURSELVES TO THEE TO THE EARTH? “Is not your mother long since dead?” Jacob, however, was not aware that the matter alluded to Bilhah who had raised him as if she were his mother. From here, our Rabbis derived the principle that there is no dream that does not contain invalid matters. Jacob’s intention in pointing out the invalidity of the dream was to cause his sons to forget the matter so that they should not be envious of him because of it. Jacob said to Joseph: “Just as it is impossible for the dream to be fulfilled with respect to your mother, so is the remainder invalid.” Thus the language of Rashi. In my opinion, at the time when Jacob went down to Egypt, Bilhah and Zilpah had already died (See Ramban 46:15.)  since, in enumerating the seventy souls that went down to Egypt, Scripture states, Besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, (Further, 46:26.)  and it does not say “besides Jacob’s wives and his sons’ wives.” (Thus, there is proof that Bilhah had already died at the time Jacob went down to Egypt. So how then could Rashi say that the mother in the dream, symbolized by the moon, who was to bow before Joseph in Egypt, referred to Bilhah?)  And if you say that because they were concubines Scripture does not want to say “besides Jacob’s sons’ wives and his concubines,” yet we find that they are referred to as his father’s wives. (Above, Verse 2. Why then does Scripture not say “besides Jacob’s wives and his sons’ wives?” Thus it is clear that they had already died.)  Besides, it is unlikely that “the moon” in the dream alludes to his concubine. Instead, my opinion concerning the matter of the dream is that the sun is an allusion to Jacob, and the moon alludes to the children of his household and all his wives, which comprised Jacob’s seed. Thus, the moon alludes to the fact that all his seed will prostrate themselves to Joseph, these being all the seventy souls that issued from his loins, since they all prostrated themselves when they came before him. The eleven stars represent the brothers who bowed down before him separately, (This explains why the brothers are singled out from all of Jacob’s seed, alluded to by the moon.)  before their father arrived, as it is written, And when Joseph came into the house, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and prostrated themselves to him to the earth.

            <summary>The issue of the count of 70 individuals from the house of Jacob who came to Egypt is debated among commentators. Some suggest that Jacob is included in the count, others argue that Dinah's son or Yocheved was born after arrival. The number 70 is seen as a rounded figure, common in the Bible. The spiritual significance of the number 70 is also discussed, relating to celestial angels and the Jewish people. Ibn Ezra argues that Jacob is included in the count, while Radak notes the inaccuracy of the family arriving in Egypt rather than Goshen. Steinsaltz suggests the count is rounded up from 69, and Da'at Zekenim emphasizes the importance of including Jacob in the count. Chizkuni includes Joseph, his sons, and Yocheved in the count, noting minor inaccuracies are not a concern for the Torah.</summary>

              <p>הבאה מצרימה שבעים, “who had arrived in Egypt, (were) seventy.” This number includes Joseph, his two sons, and Yocheved, (Moses’ mother). The Torah does not worry about minor inaccuracies as it concerns itself with the overwhelming majority. There are many examples of this rule having been applied. [Perhaps the best known examples are when Moses refers to the Jewish people comprising six hundred thousand men of the ages 2060, as well as when during the census, each time with a single exception, the total of the numbers of each tribe always ends with the digit zero, i.e. have been rounded off. Ed.] The only females in the count above are: Dinah, Yocheved, Serach. [In the author’s text which this editor works from, there appear four more names of males at this point, all grandsons of Yaakov. I have not been able to figure out why these names appear there. Ed.] According to a view expressed in the Midrash, that twin sisters were born with all of Yaakov’s sons, we would have to assume that they had all died before the family’s descent to Egypt, with the exception of twin of Dinah.</p>

              <p>הבאה מצרימה שבעים, “the ones who had arrived in Egypt numbered seventy.” The Torah, in this verse, meant to include Yaakov himself. The beginning of the subject proves that this is so, as in verse 8 we have been told: “the following are the names of the Children of Israel who came to Egypt, ‘Yaakov’ and his sons, his first born son being Reuven. The word “Yaakov” in this verse is superfluous unless it was meant to include him in the count. The reason why Yaakov was included in the count with Leah’s children was that only 32 names were mentioned and he was needed to make up the number 33 at the end of that paragraph. Not only that, it was certainly fitting that the founding father should be included in the first of the four groups of people counted. If you wanted to know the precise number of Yaakov’s family in Egypt i.e. seventy, counting Joseph and his family, [assuming Joseph’s wife was Dinah’s offspring Ed.] this is how it was composed. If you wish to accept my interpretation that G–d made up the missing umber, you do not have to include Yaakov himself in the number.

              </summary>
              <p>[ALL THE SOULS OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB, THAT CAME INTO EGYPT, WERE THREESCORE AND TEN.] An exegate says that three score and ten is a round number, since in fact they numbered sixty-nine. (The names of Jacob’s descendants listed in our chapter come to 69, not 70.)  However, this commentator erred, since we find Scripture stating, with regard to Leah’s offspring who numbered thirty-two, all the souls of his sons and daughters were thirty and three (v. 15).  (Verses 8-14 list the children of Leah and their offspring. Thirty-two individuals are listed by name. However, in giving their total Scripture says they were thirty-three. Now 70 is a round number with regard to 69. However, 33 is not a round number with regard to 32. It should be noted that it is the one person missing from the list of Leah’s offspring that is missing from our list of 70; i.e., if Leah’s thirty-three were listed here, we would have 70.)  The Midrash tries to solve the problem by saying that Jochebed was born between the ramparts when they entered Egypt.  (Baba Batra 123a-b. The point being that when Jacob was going down to Egypt, Jochebed was yet in her mother’s womb and could not be counted as a person. However, as soon as the Israelites come to Egypt she was born. Hence 70 descendants of Jacob came to Egypt.)  However, this, too, presents a problem, viz., why doesn’t Scripture record the great wonder of Jochebed giving birth to Moses when she was one hundred and thirty years old? (According to Talmudic tradition the Israelites were in Egypt for 210 years (Seder Olam). Moses was 80 at the time of the Exodus (Ex. 7:7); thus Moses was born 130 years after the descent into Egypt. If his mother was born at the beginning of the descent then she had to be 130 years old at the time of Moses’ birth.)  Furthermore, why does Scripture note that Sarah was ninety when she bore a son? (When the Torah doesn’t see fit to note that Jochebed was 130 when she brought a child into the world.)  And as if we didn’t have enough problems with the above, the liturgical poets composed a hymn for Simchat Torah reading, Jochebed my mother will be comforted after me thereby indicating that Jochebed was two hundred and fifty years old at the time of Moses’ death. (If this is really so, why wasn’t Jochebed’s longevity mentioned in Scripture?)  As to the Midrash which states that Ahijah the Shilonite lived for hundreds of years, (Cf. Baba Batra 121b and Seder Olam 1. There it is stated that the prophet Ahijah, who prophesied during the reign of King Jeroboam, saw Amram the father of Moses. Ahijah thus lived close to 600 years. This is therefore a greater miracle than that of Jochebed, and yet Scripture doesn’t mention it. Hence this Midrash can serve as support for the liturgical poets that Scripture omits certain miracles (Cherez). Krinsky explains that the liturgical poets can argue that if Ahijah could live 600 years, why is it hard to believe that Jochebed was still alive at the time of Moses’ death?)  it is an aggadic statement or an individual opinion. (It is therefore not binding and cannot be offered as proof.)  I believe that the way to solve our problem is by recognizing the fact that the Bible includes Jacob among the seventy who came into Egypt and starts the count of the seventy from him. The verse (15) is to be interpreted as if it read: all the souls of his sons and his daughters plus himself were thirty-three. Proof that this is the way to interpret this verse is that Scripture previously states, And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons (v. 8). (We thus see that Jacob is included in the number of those who came to Egypt.)  Should one argue and say, “Does not Scripture explicitly state, And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls (Ex. 1:5)? (Jacob obviously cannot be included in those that came out of his loins.)  Know that Scripture isn’t concerned with noting that one of the seventy did not come from Jacob’s loins, as it didn’t bother to leave out Benjamin when it said, These are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram (Gen. 35:26), even though Benjamin was not born there. We have two proofs in our own Torah portion that this is the style of Scripture. First, the Pentateuch states, And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons (v. 8). The Torah thus includes Jacob among the sons of Israel. It does so because Scripture speaks of the majority of those who came to Egypt. Secondly, Scripture states, all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were three score and ten (Gen. 46:27). However, Manasseh and Ephraim did not come into Egypt, they were there to begin with, having been born in Egypt. (Yet Scripture lists them among those who came to Egypt (v. 20).)  In the same vein another verse (So Vat. Ebr. 38.)  reads, Thy fathers went down into Egypt with three score and ten souls (Deut. 10:22). (Nefesh has been translated as souls, in keeping with I.E.’s translation.)  However, as noted, Manasseh and Ephraim did not go down to Egypt. This verse (The reference is either to verse 27 (Krinsky) or both verse 27 and Deut. 10:22 (Cherez), or possibly only to Deut. 10:22.)  is also proof that Jacob is counted among the seventy, for he had a soul (All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were three score and ten. Since Jacob had a soul he is included in the souls that came into Egypt and similarly with Deut. 10:22.)  and he was the most important of them all. (Hence it is unlikely that he would not be included in the number of those that went down (Weiser).) </p>

              <p>כל הנפש לבית יעקב הבאה מצרימה שבעים , “all the people of Yaakov’s household who came to Egypt — seventy.” They were seventy without Yaakov. This is why they have been described as “descendants of Yaakov” (Exodus 1,5), Yaakov included there were 71. This is also the reason that when G’d responded to Moses’ request to have executive help, G’d ordered him to assemble seventy men so that together with him there would be a total of seventy-one elders. The Jewish Supreme Court later on also consisted of seventy-one members. The number seventy when applied to the nations of the earth also excludes the Jewish people so that all in all there are seventy-one nations.  These numbers are all patterned after what goes on in the celestial regions where seventy angels surround G’d’s throne. When combined with G’d Himself, this amounts to seventy-one and is known in Rabbinical parlance as the בית דין של מעלה, the Heavenly Tribunal. This may be the reason why the Torah did not add the word ליעקב, when speaking of it as it did in verse twenty-six but here it speaks about לבית יעקב, the household of Yaakov; this is to show that Yaakov together with the seventy members of his household amounted to 71 just as the Heavenly Tribunal including G’d amounts to seventy-one members. From all the above we can deduce the spiritual power of Yaakov who transmitted a great portion of this to 600,000 of his descendants. In fact, until this number of his descendants formed a nation, G’d did not see fit to reveal Himself to Israel and to give His Torah to that nation. The number 600,000 also corresponds to a similar number in the celestial regions. Once that number of Israelites had been reached, the inhabitants of these celestial regions all consented to the Torah being transferred to earth. Furthermore, unless this number of Israelites is present the שכינה does not rest on Israel on an ongoing basis.  During the existence of the second Temple the שכינה did not rest over it and the Jewish people as it had during the first Temple (Yuma 21). This does not mean that G’d’s Presence was not present in that Temple at all; seeing that we have evidence of the שכינה manifesting itself in the presence of 22,000 Jews. (based on Numbers 10,36: “Return, O Lord, You who are Israel’s myriads of thousands!”) We also have a verse in Psalms 68,18 where the psalmist makes a similar point by saying: “G’d’s chariots are myriads upon myriads The Lord is among them as in Sinai in holiness.” There is therefore no need to prove that the Presence of G’d hovers over Israel when there are 40,000 of them, i.e. the approximate number of Jews returning to Zion under the leadership of Zerubabel (Ezra 2,64 mentions 42,360). The prophet Chagai 1,8 specifically promises G’d’s Presence when he writes: ”Go up to the hills and get timber, and rebuild the House; then I will look on it with favor and I will be glorified- said the Lord.” The difference between the conditions prevailing during the first and the second Temple respectively was that during the former G’d’s שכינה was “at home” in the Temple whereas during the latter it was only “visiting.” Our sages in Yuma 21 have characterized the difference by citing the absence of the following five items during the existence of the second Temple. There was no Holy Ark, no oil (the special mixture of ingredients listed in Exodus 30,31-33) for anointing the High Priest and other holy vessels. There was no heavenly fire which descended on the altar to consume sacrifices; there was no Shechinah; and there were no urim vetumim, (the means of direct communication between the High Priest and G’d) A look at the spelling of the wording of the verse we quoted from Chagai illustrates the point of our sages. The prophet wrote ואכבד (“and I will be glorified”), whereas we read ואכבדה. This is a hint of the five items that G’d said would be missing in that second Temple He asked Chagai to build. You will note again the crucial role of the letter ה in matters pertaining to the intervention of that attribute of G’d in the affairs of man, or rather when the welfare of the Jews is involved. Expressed differently, whereas the second Temple enjoyed a measure of שכינה, it did not enjoy the presence of G’d’s תפארת, “glory.” Moses described such irregular presence of the שכינה by using the word חופף, “hovering” to describe it in Deut. 33,12 when he blessed Binyamin.  In the future, after the redemption, a time of which the prophet says that the number of the children of Israel will parallel that of the sand of the shores of the sea (Hoseah 2,1) the situation will change drastically. The prophet does not speak of the “number of descendants of Israel;” rather, he speaks of מספר בני ישראל, “those who had once been counted as ‘the children of Israel;” i.e. the males of over 20 years of age, they will bring back the element תפארת, “glory,” that has not been seen in Jerusalem since the destruction of the first Temple. This is what Isaiah 60,1 speaks of when he writes: “Arise! Shine!, for your light has dawned; the Presence of the Lord has shone upon you!”</p>

    Some commentators are not at all perturbed by the round number 70 being used although there were only 69, seeing that there are numerous examples throughout the Bible in which round numbers are used, although when you examine them in detail you will find that they are just that, “rounded off” numbers.
    Personally, I do not know what all the fuss is about. Why could these commentators not have been satisfied with the solution provided for us by our sages in earlier periods that Yocheved was conceived in the land of Canaan but not born until the family was just at the border of Egypt, בין החומות, between the walled fortifications, as they phrase it. [at this point the author voices sharp rebuke at Ibn Ezra saying that Nachmanides already refuted all that he said on the subject. Ed.]

              <p>For from the quarrelsome words of the immature grain, a thorn has spread among the brethren and rebellion like the sin of witchcraft (I Sam. 15:23). When the time comes she raises her wings on high (Job 39:18). God know the days of the perfect (Ps. 37:18) and the way of the righteous (Ps. 1:6), and raises up from the dust (Ps. 113:7) and the far distant sea (Ps. 65:6) all the souls of the house of Jacob (Gen. 46:27). They all eagerly desire to hear the word of God and the ancient records (I Chron. 4:22). However, [until] now they have not seen the clear light of [Him who dwells] in the skies. For from the top of the Rocks I see Him (Num. 23:9), and among those who turn the many to righteousness (Dan. 12:3) I behold Him. Grace is poured upon their lips (Ps. 45:3)  like roses (Song 5:13). Their waters are more sure than the garden spring, a well of living waters (Song 4:15). Like doves [going] to their cotes (Isa. 60:8) they have drunk spices. They call to God, and He answers them (Ps. 99:6). This one says, I am the Lord’s (Isa. 44:5), answer me with broad spaces (Ps. 118:5), for my heart does not rest at night (Eccles. 2;23), nor does my spirit within me (Isa. 26:9). This one writes with his hand to the Lord (Isa. 44:5) from that which had preceded him [at] Sinai, and on the skins of kid goats (Gen. 27:16) they set up their signs (Ps. 74:4) which they wrote to instruct them for their generations, an eternal covenant (Exod. 31:16).</p>

              <p>“These are those who were counted of the children of Israel by their patrilineal house; all those counted of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred and three thousand, and five hundred and fifty” (Numbers 2:32).   “These are those who were counted of the children of Israel by their patrilineal house…” In ten places Israel was counted: One, upon their descent to Egypt: “With seventy people, your ancestors descended to Egypt…” (Deuteronomy 10:22). One upon their ascent: “The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Sukot, some six hundred thousand men on foot” (Exodus 12:37). One after the deed of the calf: (The sin of the Golden Calf.)  “When you take a census of the children of Israel…” (Exodus 30:12). Two in the book of Numbers; once with the banners, and once with the division of the land. Two in the days of Saul: “He counted them in Tela’im” (I Samuel 15:4), “he counted them in Bazek” (I Samuel 11:8); when they were wealthy, with these lambs, (The word tela’im is also the Hebrew word for lambs. According to the midrash they were not counted in a place called Tela'im, rather they were counted by means of lambs.)  and when they were poor, with these pebbles. (That is the translation of bazek.)  One in the days of David: “Yoav gave the sum of the number [mispar] of the census [mifkad] of the people [to the king]” (II Samuel 24:9). If mispar, why mifkad; if mifkad, why mispar? (Mispar and mifkad have similar meanings.)  Rather, he prepared two notes, a large sum and a small sum. The small one he showed to David; the large one he did not show him. (David and the people were punished for conducting the census. Yoav though that by keeping the larger sum from David, fewer people would be harmed.)  That is why it wrote et mispar mifkad. One in the days of Ezra: “The entire congregation together was forty[-two] thousand [three hundred and sixty]” (Ezra 2:64). And one in the future: “The flock will pass again under the hands of one who counts” (Jeremiah 33:13).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>“Every male” – why “every male,” and it does not mention every female? It is because the glory of the Holy One blessed be He is exalted by the males. David said: “Behold, sons are a portion of the Lord; a reward, the fruit of one’s womb.” (Psalms 127:3). “Behold, sons are a portion of the Lord” – these are the males, but if the females came, they too are a reward.  “From one month old and above you shall count them” – why “from one month old and above”? Are they able to guard the Tent of Meeting from one month old? He Himself requests those who should guard it; why does He count “from one month old”? Rabbi Huna HaKohen said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Ze’eira: It is in order to double their reward. Why? You find that they approach to serve only from thirty years old. Why then does He count them from one month old? It is so they will receive reward while they are still one month old.  Rabbi Huna HaKohen said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Ze’eira: You find written in Samuel’s regard: “Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life” (I Samuel 7:15). Did Samuel judge Israel “all the days of his life”? But all the days of his life were only fifty-two years, and you find two during which he was nursing, forty years during which Eli was alive and judging, in which Samuel was unable to judge before his teacher, and two years that Saul ruled; that is forty-two. Ten years remained there; that is, he bore the burden of Israel for only ten years, but it is written: “Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.” Rather, the Holy One blessed be He said: I am writing in his regard “all the days of his life” so that he will receive reward for all the days that he existed in the world. Regarding the tribe of Levi, too, the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses that he should count them from one month old and above, so that their reward would be calculated for them from one month old. That is, “from one month old and above you shall count them.”  Another matter: “From one month old” – Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi bar Rabbi Shalom said: The Holy One blessed be He is accustomed to be counting this tribe everywhere from when they are still young. From where is it derived? When the Holy One blessed be He said to Jacob to descend to Egypt, at that moment he counted his offspring; they all totaled sixty-six, as it is stated: “All the people were sixty-six” (Genesis 46:26). The two sons of Joseph and Joseph, that is sixty-nine. But it says: “All the people of the house of Jacob who came to Egypt were seventy” (Genesis 46:27). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: The Holy One blessed be He is accustomed to count this tribe while they are still in their mother’s womb. Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen bar Rabbi said: This resin does not begin to emerge before one absorbs it; (As soon as it appears it is taken. Similarly as soon as the Levite appears, he is counted.)  so, Yokheved, her mother was pregnant with her at that moment, and she was in her mother’s womb and she was counted. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: Before her mother entered into the threshold of Egypt, she gave birth to her. That is why it is stated in her regard: “With seventy people your ancestors descended to Egypt.” (Deuteronomy 10:22). Regarding the children of her children as well: “Every male from one month old and above, you shall count them.” Why is it so? It is because this tribe is always beloved before the Holy One blessed be He. Of all the tribes, it is only this tribe alone that was chosen, as it is stated: “And chose it from all the tribes of Israel to be priests for Me” (I Samuel 2:28).  Rabbi Levi said: You find that there are many items that the Holy One blessed be He created in the world and he selected one of them for Himself. He created seven days, and the Holy One blessed be He chose Shabbat, as it is stated: “God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it” (Genesis 2:3). He created years, and selected one for Himself, as it is stated: “The land shall observe a Shabbat for the Lord; [.…the seventh year shall be a Shabbat of solemn rest for the land]” (Leviticus 25:2–4). He created seven-year cycles and selected one for Himself, as it is stated: “You shall sanctify the fiftieth year” (Leviticus 25:10). He created lands, and selected one of them for Himself, the Land of Israel, as it is stated: “The eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it” (Deuteronomy 11:12). Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He characterizes it as His land: “They divided My land” (Joel 4:2). He created heavens, and selected one of them for Himself; this is the highest heaven, as it is stated: “Praise Him who rides in the highest heavens” (Psalms 68:5). He created nations, and selected one of them for Himself; this is Israel, as it is stated: “And the Lord has chosen you to be a treasured people for Him” (Deuteronomy 14:2). He created tribes, and selected one of them for Himself; this is the tribe of Levi, as it is stated: “And chose it from all the tribes of Israel” (I Samuel 2:28). That is why the Holy One blessed be He said to Moses to count them from one month old, because He is exceedingly fond of them.  They raised an objection: According to these reasons, He should have counted them from one day old. Our Rabbis of blessed memory said: Why was it necessary to count them from one month old? It is because a one-day-old is not viable, but it is known that a one-month-old is viable; therefore, “from one month old and above you shall count them.” Alternatively, why were they counted from one month old? It is because the Levites were counted in this census only in order to redeem the firstborn of Israel. Just as the firstborn are redeemed from one month old, so the Levites were counted from one month old.</p>

              <p>“The priest shall take sacred water in an earthenware vessel, and from the dirt that is on the floor of the Tabernacle the priest shall take, and he shall place it into the water” (Numbers 5:17).  “The priest shall take sacred water” – sacred water is nothing other than water that was sanctified in a vessel, and it is the water of the basin. Why was the water from the basin? It is because the basin was crafted only from the women’s mirrors, as it is stated: “He crafted the basin of bronze…[with the mirrors of the assembled women who assembled at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting]” (Exodus 38:8). It is those women who said: God testifies on our behalf that we departed from Egypt pure. When Moses came to craft the basin, God said to him: Craft it from these mirrors, as they were not utilized for the purpose of harlotry, and with them, their daughters will be examined whether they are as pure as their mothers.  Another matter: God said: Were they not redeemed from Egypt only due to the merit of this mitzva, because they guarded themselves from harlotry? Likewise, you find that all the miracles that God performed on behalf of Israel in Egypt, He did so only because they guarded themselves from licentiousness. The Egyptian would lower his bucket; and the Jew would lower his bucket; that would be filled with blood, and this would be filled with water. Both of them drink from the barrel; that one would drink blood, and this one would drink water. A frog sees a Jew and flees, and sees an Egyptian and leaps upon him. Their animals graze together; the hail spares these and kills those. See the wonders that were there. It was likewise for all ten plagues. They came to the sea and He did on their behalf more than in Egypt. In Egypt, it is written: “Behold, the hand of the Lord is” (Exodus 9:3), and at the sea, the great hand is written, as it is stated: “Israel saw the great hand” (Exodus 14:31). Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Is there a great hand and is there a small hand? Rather, greater than what He performed in Egypt, He performed at the sea. He congealed one-third of the sea, as it is stated: “The depths congealed in the heart of the sea” (Exodus 15:8), and the heart is one-third of man. (From the heart to the top of the head is approximately one-third of a person's height.)  They walked within it on dry land. What is written there? “Peoples heard, they were agitated” (Exodus 15:14). The nations of the world were critical and were saying: There is favoritism here. We are uncircumcised and they are uncircumcised. For them, “the Lord saved Israel on that day…” (Exodus 14:30), but for us, “He hurled Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea” (Psalms 136:15). By what merit does He perform all these miracles on their behalf?  The Holy One blessed be He said to them: “They are sixty queens, and eighty concubines” (Song of Songs 6:8); that is one hundred and forty. But we find only seventy: thirty, the descendants of Ḥam; fourteen, the descendants of Yefet; twenty-six, the descendants of Shem, as it is stated: “He set the borders of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 32:8). How many were they? “All the people of the house of Jacob who came to Egypt were seventy” (Genesis 46:27). The nations are seventy, but you say one hundred and forty? Rather, there are sixty families in the world who know their father but do not know their mothers, and they are called “queens.” And there are eighty families in the world who know their mothers but do not know their father, and they are called concubines, as the concubines are suspect. The rest know neither their father nor their mother, but are shrouded in mystery [me’ulamim]. In their regard it is stated: “And young women [vaalamot] without number,” but Israel, “unique is my faultless dove” (Song of Songs 6:9). They grew in Egypt, “[whose flesh is] the flesh of donkeys [and whose issue is the issue of horses]” (Ezekiel 23:20), but [also] they, “a locked garden is my sister…” (Song of Songs 4:12). There is one who was corrupted there, and the verse publicized her, as it is stated: “The son of an Israelite woman, and he was the son of an Egyptian man” (Leviticus 24:10). He was the son of the Egyptian who Moses killed so that the matter would not be publicized among the Egyptians, as it is stated: “[And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man] he smote the Egyptian [and hid him in the sand]” (Exodus 2:12). But Israel: “Render to the Lord, families of peoples” (Psalms 96:7).  Once they saw that it was so, (When the nations of the world saw that Israel know their lineage, they praised Israel.)  “Girls see her and laud her, [queens and concubines, and praise her]” (Song of Songs 6:9). They set out on their journey, “The Lord was going before them [by day in a pillar of cloud, to guide them on the way and by night in a pillar of fire, to illuminate for them; to go day and night. The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night] would not move [from before the people]” (Exodus 13:21–22). The manna fell, and the spring rose to the mountains for them. The manna fell from the heavens, the water from the ground, and meat from the sea, “and swept quails [from the sea]” (Numbers 11:31), what had not been done for any creature in the world. The nations sensed it and said: “Who is she who appears…” (Song of Songs 6:10)? They said to them: (The nations said one to another.)  ‘These are the children of God.’ They said to them: ‘Are they not the children of Egyptians? Did the Egyptians not enslave the women just as they enslaved the men?’ Immediately, the Divine Speech sprang upon Moses. He said to him: Count My children and they will know that the children are the children of their fathers, as it is stated: “Take a census…” (Numbers 1:2) – “the children of Reuben…” (Numbers 1:20), “for the children of Simeon…” (Numbers 1:22), and likewise regarding them all. The Holy One blessed be He said to the sotot: Your mothers grew up among the impure, but were beyond suspicion, and you grew among the pure, and you are suspect. Therefore, let the handiwork of those who grew among the impure, but were pure, examine and prove regarding those who grew among the pure and were defiled. That is why the water is from the basin.</p>

The proper interpretation is that he examined the differences in his household between the pre-Jacob era and since Jacob arrived.)  “and the Lord has blessed me on your account.”   “He said: Stipulate your wages for me, and I will give them” (Genesis 30:28).  “He said: Stipulate your wages for me” – calculate, quantify, and state .  “He said to him: You know how I have served you, and how your livestock was with me” (Genesis 30:29).  “For the little that you had before me has increased abundantly and the Lord has blessed you on my account and now, when will I, too, provide for my household?” (Genesis 30:30).  “He said to him: You know…For the little [me’at] that you had…has increased abundantly” – Rabbi Yehuda said in the name of Rabbi Simon in the name of Rabbi Ḥizkiya: Me’at – seventy heads [of livestock]. Me’at is stated here and me’at is stated elsewhere: “[He went down to Egypt with] few in number [bimtei me’at]” (Deuteronomy 26:5). Just as there it is seventy people, (“All the people of the house of Jacob who came to Egypt were seventy” (Genesis 46:27).)  so, too, here, it is seventy heads.  “The Lord has blessed you on my account” – everywhere the righteous go, blessing is sent. Isaac descended to Gerar, blessing came on his account, as it is stated: “Isaac planted in that land and found in [that] year…and God blessed him.” (Genesis 26:12). Jacob descended to Laban and blessing came on his account, as it is stated: “The Lord has blessed you on my account.” Joseph descended to Potiphar, blessing came on his account, as it is stated: “The Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian” (Genesis 39:5).  “Now, when will I, too, provide for my household?” – Reuben requires a house, Simeon requires a house.</p>

              <p>“All the people who were coming with Jacob to Egypt, the products of his loins, aside from the wives of Jacob's sons; all the people were sixty-six” (Genesis 46:26).  “And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two people; all the people of the house of Jacob, who came to Egypt, were seventy” (Genesis 46:27).  “All the people who were coming…. And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him…” – Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Have you ever in your days seen a person give another sixty-six cups, and then give him another three, and he counts them as seventy? Rather, this is Yokheved, who completed the tally of Israel in Egypt. (The verses list a total of sixty-nine people but it then states that the total was seventy. This is an allusion to Yokheved, who was born as they arrived in Egypt, and is counted in the final tally even though she is not listed by name. )  Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: Yokheved was conceived in the land of Canaan, and born in the land of Egypt. That is what is written: “The name of Amram's wife was Yokheved, [daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt]” (Numbers 26:59) – she was born at the gates of Egypt.   And Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: The Holy One blessed be He is accustomed to count this tribe while it is still in its mother’s womb. That is what is written: “For Yedutun, the sons of Yedutun: Gedalyahu, and Tzeri, and Yeshayahu, Ḥashavyahu, and Matityahu, [six]” (I Chronicles 25:3) – they are five [who are mentioned] specifically, but a total of six. However, there is “Shimi” (I Chronicles 25:17). The Holy One blessed be He counted him while he was still in his mother’s womb. And were a person to say to you: “The tenth was Shimi” (I Chronicles 25:17), say to him: Tenth for the platform. (This is regarding the order in which they would perform their role as singers on the platform in the Temple.)   And Rabbi Levi in the name of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman: [From the time] our patriarch Jacob would engage in conjugal relations, the Holy One blessed be He would call [his future children] souls. That is what is written: “Or tallied one-quarter [rova] (Rova is understood as a reference to the sexual act (see, similarly, Leviticus 18:23). The Holy One blessed be He counts them even before conception.)  of Israel” (Numbers 23:10). Rabbi Berekhya said: It is like sap, which is absorbed even before it has emerged.  Some say: Jacob completed the tally with them. (The final tally of seventy includes Jacob himself.)  Rabbi Yitzḥak said: This is analogous to two of the emperor’s legions, the Decumani and the Augustiani. When the emperor is counted with these they are deemed complete, and when the emperor is counted with those, as well, they are deemed complete. (Since the emperor is sometimes found with each legion, he is included in their official number. )   Some say: The Holy One blessed be He completed the tally with them. (The final tally of seventy includes God Himself, who accompanied Jacob and his family into exile in Egypt.)   Some say: Ḥushim son of Dan completed the tally with them. (The verse states: “The sons of Dan: Ḥushim” (Genesis 46:23) – it says “the sons” in plural, because Ḥushim was counted as two. This is because he had many offspring.)  In Rabbi Meir’s Torah they found it written: “The son of Dan: Ḥushim.” (The word “son” appeared in the singular rather than in the plural. Some explain that this means that Rabbi Meir wrote the word “son” on the side of his scroll next to the word “sons” as an explanatory note, so that it would not be understood that Dan actually had more than just one son. This supports the idea that the word “sons” is written in plural to indicate that Ḥushim counted as two in the count of the seventy members of Jacob’s family (Yefeh To’ar). )  That is what is written: “They came to the Gilad, and to the land of Taḥtim Ḥodshi, [and they came to Dan Yaan]” (II Samuel 24:6) – Beit Yeraḥ, Yeraḥ Sinim. (These were the names of these places in the talmudic period.)  A measure for a measure: (This is the way the midrash expounds the word Yaan that is appended to the name Dan, as this word means “because” and indicates a “measure for measure” cause and effect. See, similarly, Leviticus 26:43. )  Dan entered in his darkened state (With just one son, who was deaf.)  before his father, and was blessed with seventy thousand. (In the two censuses in the Book of Numbers, the tribe of Dan numbered between sixty and seventy thousand (see Numbers 1:39, 26:43). )  Benjamin entered with ten, and was blessed with forty thousand. (Although Benjamin had ten sons, his tribe numbered only around thirty-five thousand and forty-five thousand respectively during the two censuses in the Book of Numbers (see Numbers 1:37, 26:41). )   Some say: Seraḥ daughter of Asher completed the tally with them. That is what is written: “A wise woman called from the city…. He approached her, and the woman said: Are you Yoav?” (II Samuel 20:16–17). She said to him: ‘Your name is Yoav, to say that you are a father [av] to Israel, but you are nothing but a reaper, (A killer.)  and you do not correspond to your name. Are you and David not versed in Torah, or has Torah now ceased [to be in effect]? Is it not written: “When you approach a city to wage war against it, you shall call to it for peace”?’ (Deuteronomy 20:10). He said to her: ‘Who are you?’ She said to him: “I am the peaceful [shelumei] and loyal [emunei] of Israel” (II Samuel 20:19) (The plural terms shelumei and emunei are difficult in context, and the midrash therefore expounds these terms. )  – I am the one who completed [shehishlamti] the tally [minyanan] of Israel in Egypt. I am the one who delivered the loyal to the loyal – Joseph to Moses. (Seraḥ showed Moses where Joseph was buried so that he could take Joseph’s bones from Egypt to the Land of Israel (Sota 13a). )  Why “do you seek to destroy a city” (II Samuel 20:19), and I, who am “a mother in Israel”? (II Samuel 20:19). Immediately, “Yoav answered and said: Far be it, far be it from me [that I would ruin or destroy]” (II Samuel 20:20). “Far be it, far be it,” twice – far be it from David, far be it from Yoav, far be it from the kingdom of the house of David. “[The matter] is not so. Rather, a man from Mount Ephraim, Sheva son of Bikhri is his name, has raised his hand against the king, against David (II Samuel 20:21) – if [he already said] “against the king,” why [did he also say] “against David”; if “against David,” why “against the king”? Rabbi Azarya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Simon: Anyone who is impudent to a king, it is as though he was impudent to a Torah scholar; all the more so, [if he is impudent] to a king and a Torah scholar. Rabbi Yudan said: Anyone who is impudent to a king, it is as though he is impudent to the Divine Presence.   “[The woman] said…Behold, his head will be cast to you” (II Samuel 20:21). How did she know? (How did she know she would be able to apprehend Sheva ben Bikhri.)  It is because she said: ‘Anyone who is impudent to the kingdom of the house of David, will be beheaded from above.’ (God will ensure that he is apprehended. )  Immediately, “the woman came to all the people, in her wisdom” (II Samuel 20:22). She said to them: ‘Do you not know the exploits of David? What nation stood against him? What kingdom stood against him?’ They said to her: ‘What does he want?’ She said to them: ‘One thousand men; are one thousand men not preferable to destroying your entire city?’ They said to her: ‘Let each and every one give in accordance with what he has.’ (Each household will turn over a proportion of its members. )  She said to them: ‘Perhaps, as the result of appeasement, he will forgo a bit.’ She made herself out as though she was going to appease and returned; from one thousand to five hundred, (She made them believe she had negotiated Yoav down from the one thousand men that he demanded to only five hundred. )  to one hundred, to ten, to one, and he is a guest. ‘Who is it?’ ‘It is Sheva son of Bikhri.’ Immediately, they severed his head.   It is taught: A group of people to whom the gentiles said: ‘Give us one of you and we will kill him, and if not, we will kill all of you,’ they shall all be killed, and they shall not deliver one soul of Israel. But if they designated him for them, like Sheva son of Bikhri, they shall give, and all of them shall not be killed. Rabbi Yehuda said: In what case are these matters stated? It is when he is inside and they are outside. (When he is trapped by the besieging army but they are not totally trapped, it is possible they will escape the army even if they do not deliver him to the army. Consequently, they may not turn him over. )  But if he is inside and they are inside, since he will be killed and they will be killed, they shall deliver him to them and all of them will not be killed. Like it says: “The woman came to all the people” (II Samuel 20:22) – since he will be killed and you will be killed, give him to them and let you all not be killed. Rabbi Shimon says: Anyone who revolts against the kingdom of the house of David is liable to death.   Ulla ben Kishar was sought by the empire. He rose and fled to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi to Lod. They sent a messenger after him. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi approached [Ulla ben Kishar] and appeased him. He said to him: ‘It is preferable that this man [i.e. you] be killed, and let the entire community not be punished on his account.’ He appeased him and he delivered him to [the messenger]. Elijah was accustomed to speak with [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi]. Once he did this, [Elijah] did not come to him any longer. He fasted over him for thirty days, and he appeared to him. [Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi] said to him: ‘What is the reason that my master absented himself?’ He said to him: ‘Do I associate with informers?’ He said to him: ‘Is it not a baraita: A group of people…’ He said to him: ‘Is that a mishna of the pious? That act should have been performed by others and not by you.’   It is taught: When Nebuchadnezzar ascended to conquer Yehoyakim, he ascended and encamped at Daphne at Antioch. The Great Sanhedrin descended to greet him. They said to him: ‘Has the time arrived for this house to be destroyed?’ He said to them: ‘No, but Yehoyakim king of Judah has revolted against me. Give him to me and I will go.’ They went and said to Yehoyakim: ‘Nebuchadnezzar wants you.’ He said to them: ‘Is this how one acts? Does one disregard one life in favor of another life? Is it not so written: “You shall not hand over a slave to his master”?’ (Deuteronomy 23:16). They said to him: ‘Is this not what your ancestor did to Sheva son of Bikhri? That is what is written: “Behold, his head is cast to you over the wall”’ (II Samuel 20:21). When [Yehoyakim] did not heed them, they rose, took him, and lowered him [to Nebuchadnezzar], who dismembered him.</p>

              <p>Another interpretation (of Numb. 3:15): ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI. But it is written in another place (i.e., in Numb. 1:49): HOWEVER, YOU SHALL NOT ENROLL THE TRIBE OF LEVI, NOR SHALL YOU TAKE A CENSUS OF THEM. (Tanh., Numb., 1:16, cont.; cf. Numb. R. 3:7.)  It is simply that the Holy One said: In as much as they have given their souls to me, go and number them separately. Now when had they given their souls to the Holy One? When Israel had committed that act (of the golden calf). It is so stated (in Exod. 32:26): SO MOSES STOOD UP IN THE GATE OF THE CAMP [AND SAID: WHOEVER IS FOR THE LORD,  TO ME. THEN ALL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI GATHERED UNTO HIM]. The Holy One said to Moses: In as much as they are standing in their blemishes, (Bemumehen. Cf. Buber, n. 154, who notes that the Oxford MS, Michael 577, No. 155 (described on pp. 141-142 of his introduction), reads, betsidqam, i.e., “in their righteousness.” Buber, however, prefers the better-attested reading, bemumehen, which can also mean “by some things of theirs” and which he interprets as the equivalent of “by their vow.” Still the simple translation, “in their blemishes” could mean that the Levites were deficient in not having been enrolled for the Holy One and that their enrollment now made them whole.)  go and number them. (In the words of Numb. 3:15): ENROLL THE CHILDREN OF LEVI. R. Judah bar Shallum says: The Holy One is accustomed to numbering  this tribe in every case while they are young. (Numb. R. 3:8.)  How is it shown? When the Holy One told Jacob to go down to Egypt, at that time he numbered Israel and his children; and all of them were found  sixty-six, [as stated (in Gen. 46:26): AND ALL THE SOULS… WERE SIXTY-SIX.] In addition were Joseph's two sons, plus Joseph, for a total of seventy minus one. But it says (in vs. 27): ALL THE SOULS OF THE HOUSE OF JACOB, WHICH CAME TO EGYPT, WERE SEVENTY. R. Levi said: R. Samuel bar Nahman said: The Holy One customarily numbers this tribe while they are in their mother's womb. (Gen. R. 94:9 and M. Pss. 92:12.)  R. Berekhyah [the Priest Berabbi] said: There is not enough resin to flow out before they collect it. (Rt.: SPG; cf. the Gk.: spoggos (“sponges”).)  So it was in the case of Jochebed. Her mother was pregnant with her; and while she was in her mother's womb, she was numbered together with her. Resh Laqish said: While her mother was entering the gate of Egypt, her mother gave birth to her. The statement is therefore made concerning seventy souls (in Gen. 46:27). And also concerning her children's children, the Holy One said to Moses (in Numb. 3:15): [YOU SHALL ENROLL] EVERY MALE FROM THE AGE OF A MONTH AND UPWARD. Moses said to him: Am I able to persevere and go around into their courtyards and into the midst of their houses to number each and every one of them, when you say (ibid.): EVERY MALE FROM THE AGE OF A MONTH AND UPWARD? (Numb. R. 1:9.)  The Holy One said to Moses: You do your , and I will do my . R. Judah bar Shallum the Levite said: Moses would go and stand at the gate of the tent . Then the Divine Presence would draw near and say to him: There are five infants in this tent; there are ten infants in that tent. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Numb. 3:16): SO MOSES ENROLLED THEM ACCORDING TO THE WORD (literally: ACCORDING TO THE MOUTH) OF THE LORD AS HE HAD BEEN COMMANDED,  just as the Divine Presence told him.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 18:25): FAR BE IT FROM YOU! Abraham said: Sovereign of the World, I see through the Holy Spirit that a certain woman is going to deliver an entire town. (See Gen. R. 94:9; Eccl.. R. 9:18:2; M. Sam. 32.)  So am I not worthy to deliver these five cities? Which woman was that? That was Serah bat Asher, in the time that Sheba ben Bichri rebelled against David and came to Abel, as stated (in II Sam. 20:15): [THEN THEY CAME AND BESIEGED HIM IN ABEL] … AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE WITH JOAB WERE DESTROYING THE WALL TO THROW IT DOWN. When Serah perceived the situation, she began to cry out &lt; for Joab &gt;. They called Joab to her. When Joab came, she said (in vs. 17): ARE YOU JOAB? AND HE SAID: YES. You are a sage, since the Scripture praises you (in II Sam. 23:8) as ONE WHO SITS IN THE SEAT OF WISDOM (i.e., in the academy)….  (These words are commonly understood as the proper name, JOSHEB-BASSHEBETH, A TAHCHEMONITE; but this midrash, along with Numb. R. 23:13 and PR 11:3, understands the passage as translated here. The attribution of the verse to Joab, the head of David’s army, is assumed because the person depicted here comes first in a listing of David’s mighty men and is identified as the chief of David’s captains. Moreover, although the listing contains no specific mention of Joab, it does contain the names of Joab’s brothers (in vss. 18 &amp; 24) and even his armor bearer (in vs. 37).)  Have you not read in the Torah (in Deut. 20:10): WHEN YOU DRAW NEAR UNTO A CITY &lt; TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE UNTO IT &gt; ? Thus, was it not up to you to do so? (II Sam. 20:18:) {YOU} [THEY] USED TO SPEAK IN EARLY TIMES, SAYING: LET THEM SURELY ASK IN ABEL. (Deut. 20:10f.:) YOU SHALL OFFER TERMS OF PEACE UNTO IT (a hostile city). &lt; THEN IT SHALL BE, IF IT MAKES YOU AN ANSWER OF PEACE &gt;…. (II Sam. 20:18f.:) &lt; LET THEM SURELY ASK &gt; IN ABEL; AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE MATTER…. SO WHY WOULD YOU DEVOUR THE LORD'S HERITAGE? When he heard that, Joab became afraid and said: There is a requirement here, as stated (in vs. 20): {THEN JOAB SAID:} [THEN JOAB ANSWERED AND SAID: FAR BE IT], FAR BE IT (Note that these words return the argument to Gen. 18:25, in which the same expression also occurs.)  FROM ME &lt; THAT I SHOULD DEVOUR &gt;…. But you, since you are a merciful &lt; God &gt;, is it pleasing for you to destroy these? (Gen. 18:25:) FAR BE IT FROM YOU TO DO SUCH A THING, &lt; TO PUT TO DEATH A RIGHTEOUS PERSON ALONG WITH A WICKED ONE, SO THAT THE RIGHTEOUS ONE FARES LIKE THE WICKED! FAR BE IT FROM YOU &gt; ! Now what did Joab say to her? (II Sam. 20:21:) THE SITUATION IS NOT THE SAME, FOR A MAN FROM THE HILLS OF EPHRAIM NAMED SHEBA BEN BICHRI &lt; HAS RAISED HIS HAND AGAINST KING DAVID &gt;…. Sheba is a man with a blemish, one who serves idols. (II Sam. 20:1:) NOW THERE HAPPENED TO BE THERE A MAN OF BELIAL WHOSE NAME IS SHEBA BEN BICHRI. She said to him (in vs. 19): I AM THE SHELUME (rt.: ShLM) OF THE FAITHFUL IN ISRAEL. (Cf. the new JPSA translation here: I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO SEEK THE WELFARE OF THE FAITHFUL IN ISRAEL.)  I am the one who completed (rt.: ShLM) the number of Israel, as stated (in Numb. 26:46): AND THE NAME OF ASHER'S DAUGHTER WAS SERAH. (According to Gen. 46:27, THE TOTAL OF JACOB’S HOUSE WHO CAME INTO EGYPT WAS SEVENTY PERSONS, but those named number only sixty-nine including Joseph, his two sons, and Serah. The extra person comes from counting Serah twice because of her long life. Numb. 26:46 shows that she was still alive at the time of the Exodus. Moreover, it was not too difficult to imagine that so old a woman had lived even longer into the reign of David and identify her with the wise woman of II Sam. 20:16. See the version of this tradition in PRK 11:13.)  Just stay in your place, and I will make peace (rt.: ShLM). Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 20:21): BEHOLD, HIS HEAD WILL BE THROWN TO YOU OVER THE WALL. And so she had confidence in herself that she would deliver his head to Joab. But see what she did (according to vs. 22)! THEN THE WOMAN CAME UNTO [ALL] THE PEOPLE IN HER WISDOM. What is the meaning of IN HER WISDOM? Simply that she said to them: Understand that Joab and all Israel are standing outside to kill us, our sons, and our daughters. They said to her: Why? She said to them: He would take a hundred people and go. They said to her: Let him take two hundred. She said to them: He only wants fifty people. They said to her: Let him take a hundred. She said to them: He only wants five: They said to her: Let him take ten. She said to them: He only wants one whose name is Sheba ben Bichri. When they heard that, they immediately went and cut off his head. Thus it is stated (in II Sam. 20:22, cont.): SO THEY CUT OFF THE HEAD OF SHEBA BEN BICHRI. Look at the wisdom of this woman! In the same way Abraham came in wisdom before the Holy One. He came &lt; down &gt; from fifty to forty, from forty to thirty, from thirty to twenty, and from twenty to ten. So also with this woman (according to II Sam. 20:22): THEN THE WOMAN CAME UNTO [ALL] THE PEOPLE IN HER WISDOM. Regarding her Solomon gave praise (Gk.: kalos.)  (in Eccl. 9:18): WISDOM IS BETTER THAN INSTRUMENTS OF WAR. The wisdom of Serah was better than the instruments of war that were in the hands of Joab. When Joab received the head of Sheba ben Bichri, he immediately went back without touching the city. Abraham said to the Holy One: Sovereign of the World, now if Joab, when he took the head of one person who was guilty, left the city alone, would you, who are merciful, destroy everyone? (Gen. 18:25:) FAR BE IT FROM YOU!</p>

              <p>(Numb. 3:15:) “Enroll the Children of Levi….” This text is related (to Ps. 68:7), “God causes individuals to dwell in a home.” A certain matron (Lat.: matrona.)  asked R. Jose ben Halafta, “In how many days [did the Holy One, blessed be He, create the world?” He said to her, “In six days, as stated (in Exod. 31:17), ‘for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth.’” (Gen. R. 68:4; Lev. R. 8:1; Numb. R. 3:6; PRK 2:4; below, Numb. 9:9; cf. above, Gen. 1:2.)  She said to him, “Ever since the world was created, what does He do?” “He sits [there] arranging marriages and issuing decrees. So He says, ‘So-and-so shall marry so-and-so.’” (Ps. 68:7), “God causes individuals to dwell in a home.” Who are they? This was Amram and his wife Yochebed, since through their merit the Holy One, blessed be He, brought Israel out of Egypt, where they had been enslaved with clay and bricks. (The Exodus theme is suggested by what follows in Ps. 68:7): HE BRINGS OUT THE PRISONERS INTO PROSPERITY, Cf. M. Pss. 68:4.)  What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He married Yochebed to Amram in order to raise up from them a redeemer for Israel and from them to raise up high priests. It is therefore stated (ibid.), “God causes individuals to dwell in a home.” The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In as much as this tribe is accustomed to be raising up redeemers, go and number them.” (Numb. 3:15:) “Enroll the Children of Levi….” But it is written in another place (i.e., in Numb. 1:49), “However, you shall not enroll the tribe of Levi, nor shall you take a census of them.” (Cf. Numb. R. 3:7.)  When Israel had made the calf, what is written there (in Exod. 32:26)? “So Moses stood up in the gate of the camp and said, ‘Whoever is for the Lord, to me!’ And all of the sons of Levi gathered to him.” Hence the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, (in the words of Numb. 3:15), “Enroll the Children of Levi.” R. Judah bar Shallum said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, is accustomed to numbering [the children of] this tribe in every case while they are young. (Numb. R. 3:8.)  How is it shown? When the Holy One, blessed be He, told Jacob to go down to Egypt, at that time he numbered Israel and his children; and all of them were found [to number] sixty-six, as stated (in Gen. 46:26), “And all the souls of the House of Jacob that came that came to Egypt… were sixty-six.” [In addition were] Joseph's two sons, plus Joseph, for a total of seventy minus one. But it says (in vs. 27), “all the souls of the House of Jacob, which came to Egypt, were seventy.” R. Levi said that R. Samuel bar Nahman said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, customarily numbers this tribe while they are in their mother's womb.” (Gen. R. 94:9 and M. Pss. 92:12.)  R. Berekhyah the Priest said, “There is not enough resin to flow out before they collect it. (Rt.: SPG; cf. the Gk.: spoggos (“sponges”).)  So it was in the case of Jochebed. Her mother was pregnant with her; and while she was in her mother's womb, she was numbered together with her.” Resh Laqish said, “While her mother was entering the gate of Egypt, her mother gave birth to her. The statement is therefore made concerning seventy souls (in Gen. 46:27).” And also concerning her children's children, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses (in Numb. 3:15), “you shall enroll every male from the age of a month and upward.” Moses said to him, “Am I able to persevere and go around into their courtyards and into the midst of their houses to number each and every one of them, when You say (ibid.), ‘every male from the age of a month and upward?’” (Numb. R. 1:9.)  The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, “You do your [part], and I will do my [part].” R. Judah bar Shalom the Levite said, “Moses would go and stand at the gate of the tent [in question]. Then the Divine Presence would draw near and say to him, ‘There are five infants in this tent; there are ten infants in that tent.’” Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Numb. 3:16), “So Moses enrolled them according to the word (literally, according to the mouth) of the Lord, as he had been commanded,” [i.e.,] just as the Divine Presence told him.</p>

              <p>And in order to set one's mind at rest in this, I have thought it fit to introduce an exalted thought here which is rooted in the Yerushalmi adduced by Semag, that if one were walking on the road and struck one of his feet with the other and, in doing so, fell to the ground and hurt his body, his face and also that foot — aside from the fact that it would never enter his mind to take revenge of that foot by [desisting] from healing it, he would also harbor no hatred whatsoever against it. For what is the foot and what are his body and his face — they all are one [body], but divided into organs. Rather, he would reason that his sins caused this. Here, too, if it happened that his friend did not benefit him with a certain good that he asked of him, or even if he grieved or insulted him in some way, he should not avenge himself and harbor hatred against him. For who is his friend and who is he? Both are from one root, as it is written (I Chronicles 17:21): &quot;And who is like Your people, Israel, one nation in the land?&quot; And it is written [Bereshith 46:27): &quot;All of the soul of the house of Jacob that came etc.&quot; It is not written &quot;souls,&quot; to teach us that all the souls of Israel above are reckoned as one soul. It is just that each one is an entity in itself. As with a man in his entirety — even though, as a whole, he is one man, still, he has organs which are &quot;heads&quot; to him, like the head and the heart; and there are those beneath these, like the hand and the foot. And it is also into one rest that all of Israel will gather in the end — under the Throne of Glory — as it is written (I Samuel 25:29): &quot;And the soul of my lord will be bound in the bond of life with the L-rd your G-d, etc.&quot; It is just that because in this world, where everyone is clothed in his own matter by himself, and because each of his affairs and undertakings is an entity in itself that a man imagines himself to be a distinct person and not &quot;one&quot; with his fellow Jew at all — but this is not so.</p>

              <p>כהן-לוים-ישראלים, in descending order, are similar to נשמה-רוח-נפש. The Torah describes &quot;Adam&quot; on three levels, Genesis 2,7, ויהי אדם לנפש חיה. In Genesis 6,3, we find רוח האדם. Finally, in Genesis 2,7, we find him also as נשמת האדם. Kabbalists have described this parallel relationship and have claimed that this is the source for our reciting one hundred benedictions daily. The Israelite, who represents the נפש level, gives ten percent of his harvest to the Levite, who represents the רוח level. The Levite in turn, gives ten percent of what he has received to the Priest, who represents the נשמה level. This means the Priest is entitled to the &quot;number&quot; one (one out of a hundred). The author of Shaarey Orah as well as the author of Tolaat Yaakov have elaborated on the significance of these various numbers in the alphabet. We find the whole Jewish people referred to as נפש (singular), when Jacob and his family moved to Egypt (Genesis 46,27).</p>

              <p>ואהבת לרעך כמוך . Philosophically speaking, we have demonstrated that the Jewish people are considered as a single unit; the seventy souls that came to Egypt are described as נפש, a single composite soul (Genesis 46,27), as distinct from the clan of Esau whose members are always described in the plural, to emphasize their diversity (Genesis chapter 36). You may well ask how you can be expected to love your fellow Jew just as yourself (19,18), when the reason you are to admonish him is that he commits transgressions which are apt to make you share in his punishment? The answer may be that we find many times that a person breaks his own hand or damages his own eyesight. He did not do so willingly, but the fact that it happened was a punishment for him. One does not stop loving oneself because one has caused oneself the loss of a hand or the loss of an eye. Similarly, one must not stop loving a fellow Jew who may have been or may become instrumental in causing one damage.</p>

            <summary>The book of Exodus is presented as a continuation of the Genesis saga, with the first five verses echoing and compressing the information about Yaakov's family descent into Egypt. The main subject matter of the chapter, life and death, is central to the thematic content of Genesis. The Torah counts 70 people brought to Egypt by Yaakov, even though only 69 names are listed, with the discrepancy explained by the birth of Moses' mother at the border of Egypt. The verse in Deuteronomy 10 emphasizes that only the worthy truly count, highlighting the connection between the early generation that entered Egypt and those preparing to enter Canaan.</summary>

              <p>אשר יולד לו בפדן ארם, “that had been born for him in Padan Arom.” This statement begs the question that as we have just heard, Binyamin had not been born in Padan Arom?We have to understand the verse as meaning that Binyamin had been born as a result of Rachel’s having prayed to G-d to give her another son while she had still been in Padan Arom (Compare Genesis 30,23. This is why the Torah here, 7 years later, describes Binyamin’s birth as dating back to that time.) A different exegesis of this puzzling statement: Seeing that almost all of Yaakov’s children had been born while he was in Padan Arom, the Torah applies the Talmudic statement of רובם ככולם, “if the majority had been distinguished by a certain detail we view all of the ones referred to in that context as if they possessed the same distinguishing features.” We find this principle applied by the Torah also in Genesis 46,27, where 70 people are reported to have been brought to Egypt by Yaakov, although only 69 names are listed, three of them being Joseph and his two sons. The Midrash (B‘reshit Rabbah 94,9) claims that seeing that Moses’ mother was born at the border of Egypt, her birth completes the number 70.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>In this case the proof text quotes not only the first part of the verse in Deuteronomy 10: “With seventy people” which seems to prove the verse from Deuteronomy 26, but it quotes the last part as well “God has made you as numerous…” Why does the Haggadah include the entire verse when the first part should have been enough? The answer to this question can be found in the choice of verses used to answer this question. Deuteronomy 10 says that Israel went down with only seventy but they have become a nation as numerous as the stars in the sky. Yet this is also a troubling verse. First, we know that there were far more Israelites in Egypt than there were in the wilderness. A Midrash teaches us that only one fifth of the Israelites left Egypt at the time of the Exodus. So, in a sense, this verse is wrong. The people of Israel were not as numerous as they had been in Egypt. So why does Moses describe the nation this way at the end of the desert sojourn and not earlier? The answer can be found in a comment by Rashi on the opening verse of the book of Exodus. He wonders why the Torah makes a point of counting the children once again in this verse since the Torah had already done so earlier in the book of Genesis. Rashi compares Israel to the stars, which God “takes out and brings in by number and by their name.” Similarly, God discounted the years of exile in Egypt and only counted the people as they entered Egypt and after they had left and received the Torah. Even though they were more numerous during their years in Egypt they were not worthy of being counted. The verse in Deuteronomy 26, then, says that they dwelled there few in number because God only counts the seventy righteous people who entered Egypt and not those who were born there. And He did not count them again until after they received the Torah. The verse from Deuteronomy 10 with its reference to the stars hints at why our verse says they dwelled there few in number!  Why choose a verse from Deuteronomy as a proof text when a verse from Genesis would have been more direct and appropriate: “Thus the total number of Jacob’s household who came to Egypt was seventy persons.” (Genesis 46:27). What the verse in Deuteronomy 10 teaches us is that only the worthy truly count. This Midrash is not just about numbers, but about righteousness. The verse in Genesis simply tells us how many people went down to Egypt, while Deuteronomy 10 makes us aware of the connection between the early generation that entered Egypt and those who now prepare to enter the land of Canaan!  Maybe another way of putting this is that God looks for quality and not quantity.</p>

              <p>And there Israel became a nation – this teaches that the Israelites were distinctive there.  Great – as it says: “And the children of Israel were fruitful, increased greatly, multiplied and became very, very mighty; and the land was filled with them.” (Exodus 1:7). The words, Gadol (great), Atzum, (mighty), and Rav (populous) all have the same meaning. What does this seeming repetition of synonyms add to our understanding of the verse? The first word Gadol refers to the quality of the nation; they became a great nation because they were a distinctive people with their own customs and practices that connected them to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The word Atzum refers to the quantitative nature of the nation; they became mighty because they were so numerous.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ואלה תולדת בני נח, שם חם ויפת, “And these are the descendants of Noach: Shem, Cham, and Yaphet.” Starting with this verse and including chapter 11 verse 1, you will find the names of seventy individuals. All of them are descendants of Noach and at the end of that paragraph the Torah states: אלה משפחות בני נח לתולדותם בגויהם ומאלה נפרדו הגוים בארץ אחר המבול “These are the families of Noach’s descendants, according to their generations by their nations; and from these the nations were separated on the earth after the flood.” We learn from this verse that the world comprises 70 nations each with its own language. Chapter 11 verse 8 tells us that the various people at the time of the Tower of Babel were scattered and that each group would have its own language The reason the Torah makes a point of enumerating seventy different nations is to contrast this fact with the seventy people, all descendants of Yaakov, who descended with him to Egypt (Genesis 46,27). This is also what Moses had in mind at the time when he blessed the Jewish people shortly before his death (Deut. 32,8), and said בהנחל עליון גוים, בהפרידו בני אדם. “When the Supreme One gave the nations their inheritance, when He separated the children of man.” The nations Moses referred to are the ones mentioned in our chapter. Starting with that period in human history, G’d allocated boundaries, גבולות, to the various nations. All of this was to correspond to the founding members of the Jewish nation who went down to Egypt. The reason Moses said in Deut. 32,8 יצב גבולות עמים למספר בני ישראל , “He established the boundaries of the nations according to the number of the children of Israel,” instead of saying למספר בני יעקב , “according to the number of the sons of Yaakov,” was to stress that the children of Israel consisted of twelve separate tribes.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>בשבעים נפש ירדו אבותיך מצרימה, “Your forefathers comprised only 70 people when they descended to Egypt.” Moses enumerates some of the great and wonderful acts performed by G’d for this nation. It is these which entitle G’d to be loved by this people. Although only 70 people emigrated to Egypt, their number by now had increased to be like the stars in heaven. This is why in the next verse Moses demands that the people love “the Lord your G’d and observe His commandments. Here Moses mentions the number of Israelites descending to Egypt as being 70 whereas if you will check the number given in Genesis 46,27 you will find that actually only 69 are listed as leaving. Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 94,9 have already pointed out that the discrepancy is accounted for by Yocheved, who was conceived by her mother on the way but was not born until Yaakov and family arrived in Egypt.  Some sources claim that the discrepancy is accounted for by Serach, daughter of Asher. They base this on Samuel II 20,19: “I am one of those who seek the welfare of the faithful in Israel.” The words שלומי אמוני in that verse are understood as “completed their number.”  I have seen in Pessikta D'Rav Kahane that it was the Lord Himself Who made complete the number 70 as He said (Genesis 46,4) “I am going down with you (Yaakov) to Egypt.” [In other words 69 members of Yaakov’s family as listed in chapter 46 in Genesis plus the Shechinah went down to Egypt. Ed.]. The author of that Midrash cites our verse: “for He is your praise and your G’d,” in the same verse as Moses making reference to this number as proof that it was the fact that G’d personally accompanied the Israelites on their descent to Egypt as the reason that they can use Him as “their praise.” A similar approach is taken by the Midrash in Pirke d'Rabbi Eliezer chapter 39 where the words כשש מאות אלף, “about 600,000 foot soldiers” instead of “600,000 foot soldiers (Exodus 12,37) are also interpreted as the Israelites being 1 shy of that number with G’d Himself making up the number 600,000. If we accept this interpretation G’d made up the requisite number both when the Israelites descended to Egypt and when they ascended from Egypt. This would correspond to precisely what G’d said to Yaakov in Genesis 46,4: “I will go down with you and I will also surely bring you up.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>כל הנפש הבאה ליעקב EVERY SOUL THAT WAS COMING WITH JACOB — every soul that left Canaan to go to Egypt The word הבאה, here, is not a perfect tense, but a participle with a relative present sense — just as (Ester 2:4) “In the evening she (באה) was coming” and (Genesis 29:7) “and, behold, Rachel his daughter is coming (באה)” and therefore the accent is on the last syllable, on the א, because when they left, coming from the land of Canaan, they were only sixty-six. But at the second mention of this word (Genesis 46:27) — “every soul of the house of Jacob, which came (הבאה) into Egypt were seventy” — it is a perfect tense and therefore it is accented on the last but one syllable, on the ב. The reason is, that when they came there, they were seventy, for they found Joseph and his two sons there, and Jochebed was added to their number “between the walls”. According to the view of the Rabbi (i. e. R. Jehudah, cf. Genesis Rabbah 84) who stated that with each of Jacob’s sons a twin-sister was born, we must say that these died before they (Jacob and his family) went down to Egypt, because they are not enumerated here. In Vayikra Rabbah 4:6 I found the following: When he left Canaan (cf. Genesis 36:6) Esau’s family consisted of only six (himself and his five sons), and Scripture calls them “the souls of his house” (in the plural) and this is because they worshipped many gods (each serving a different god and having as it were, a different soul or religious feeling). But the family of Jacob when he came to Egypt consisted of seventy and Scripture calls them “soul”, in the singular, because they all served One God. </p>

Genesis 46:27 and Rashi thereon), because if you count their number (as set forth in Genesis 46:8—27) you will find that they were one short of seventy, and it was she whose name is not mentioned there who made up the number seventy (cf.

              <p>.ואת יהודה שלח לפניו אל יוסף , “and he sent Yehudah ahead of him to Joseph.” He sent Yehudah ahead to prepare living quarters for him in Goshen; he picked Yehudah as the most capable one of his sons.  Our sages (Tanchuma Vayigash 11) paid especial attention to the unusual word להורות in this verse stating that Yaakov’s purpose in sending Yehudah ahead was for him to establish a Torah academy so that Torah study could take place as soon as Yaakov and his family would arrive in Goshen. This is not nearly as strange as it sounds at first glance as we have a tradition that Yaakov had been instructing his son Joseph in Torah and that at the time he had sent him on that fateful errand they had studied the subject of eglah arufah together, a subject dealing with a town’s expiation for a murder committed in its vicinity by a murderer or murderers unknown. When Yaakov had seen the עגלות his son sent him for transportation, he realized that his son had not forgotten this last lesson and that is what made his spirit revive (45,27). Another Midrash (Tanchuma Vayigash 8) on the same verse draws attention to the miraculous reconciliation between two brothers. Only yesterday the ox and the lion had been crossing swords, whereas already now Yaakov sends Yehudah to Joseph as his emissary. This is an example of what Isaiah had in mind when he wrote (Isaiah 65,25): “the wolf and the lamb shall graze together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.” The wolf in that verse is a reference to Binyamin, based on Genesis 49,27: “Binyamin is a predatory wolf.” The lamb in Isaiah is a reference to the tribes of Israel as Jeremiah 50,17 describes the tribes as “Israel are scattered sheep.” The words: “the lion and the ox will eat straw,” are a reference to Yehudah and Joseph. Joseph has been compared to an ox in Deut. 33,17, ”like a firstling bull in his majesty.” Yehudah symbolizes the lion as we know from Genesis 49,9 “Yehudah is a lion cub.” They have been described as sharing the same meal in Genesis 43,33: “he seated them, the oldest according to his birthright, etc.” The fact that Yaakov sent Yehudah ahead to Joseph is proof that the brothers had reconciled completely.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>After this mighty man (In several places - e.g., Bava Batra 15a and Rosh HaShanah 11a - our Sages referred to Abraham with this expression.)  was weaned, (Nedarim 32a states: &quot;Abraham was three when he recognized his Creator.&quot; Although the Rambam states that it was not until Abraham was forty that he gained true awareness of God, his process of search began at age three.)  he began to explore and think. Though he was a child, he began to think [incessantly] throughout the day and night, wondering: How is it possible for the sphere to continue to revolve without having anyone controlling it? (Note the Midrash HaGadol (Parashat Lech Lecha), which explains that Abraham questioned: Why should we bow down to idols, gods that we ourselves make? We should bow to the earth, for it produces crops that sustain us. Therefore, he began to worship the earth. Then he saw that the earth needs rain, and began to worship the sky. Later, he saw that the most brilliant creation in the sky was the sun, and began to worship it. Afterwards, when the sun set and the moon rose, he began to worship the moon. When the sun rose the next morning, he did not know what to do. He did not see which was stronger: the sun or the moon. So Abraham continued in a quandary, questioning who was the true God.)  Who is causing it to revolve? Surely, it does not cause itself to revolve. (Interestingly, in Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 1:5, the Rambam uses the same concept as a proof for the existence of God. He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. -Bereshit Rabbah 61:1 elaborates on the lack of instruction that was available to Abraham. Note the Ra'avad and the Kessef Mishneh, who question why Noach, Shem, and Ever (all of whom were alive at this time) did not try to nullify the worship of idols and why they did not instruct Abraham. They offer two explanations. The first is that they were afraid and hid from the idolaters. (See Midrash Tehillim 118. Note, however, teachings which state that these righteous men also protested the worship of false gods, Tanna Devei Eliyahu Rabba, Chapters 20 and 25.) Alternatively, Shem and Ever lived in the land of Canaan, while Abraham lived in Babylon. The question remains, however, why did Abraham not seek out these righteous men (Kinat Eliyahu).)  He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. Rather, he was mired in Ur Kasdim among the foolish idolaters. His father, mother, and all the people [around him] were idol worshipers, (Indeed, our Sages relate that his father had a shop where idols were sold.)  and he would worship with them. (See Bereshit Rabbah 39:8, which states that Abraham was always worried that God would not absolve him from his sin of worshiping idols.)  [However,] his heart was exploring and [gaining] understanding. Ultimately, he appreciated the way of truth (an awareness of God)  and understood the path of righteousness (an ethical approach to behavior, which reflected his spiritual awareness)  through his accurate comprehension. He realized that there was one God who controlled the sphere, that He created everything, and that there is no other God among all the other entities. (These are the fundamental principles of the Jewish faith, as explained in Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 1:1-6.)  He knew that the entire world was making a mistake. What caused them to err was their service of the stars and images, which made them lose awareness of the truth. (Their worship of idols dulled their sensitivity to spirituality to the point where they lost all awareness of God.)  Abraham was forty years old when he became aware of his Creator. (Note Bereshit Rabbah 64:4, which mentions two opinions regarding when Abraham became aware of God: one when he was three and one when he was forty eight. It is possible that the Rambam's text of the Midrash read &quot;forty&quot; instead of &quot;forty eight.&quot; As explained above, the opinions are not necessarily contradictory. Abraham's process of inquiry could have begun at age three, while at forty he gained greater understanding, and at forty eight, he achieved an even higher level of awareness. Avot 5:21 states: &quot;At forty, one achieves understanding.&quot; By associating Abraham's apreciation of the Creator with this age, the Rambam implies that this awareness can come as a product of our own thought and meditation.)  When he recognized and knew Him, (Bereshit Rabbah 39:1 explains Abraham's process of thought with a parable. A person saw a brightly lit palace. He wondered: Could this palace exist without an owner? Immediately, the owner revealed himself to him. Similarly, Abraham wondered: Is it possible for the world to exist without one who controls? Immediately, God revealed himself to him.)  he began to formulate replies to the inhabitants of Ur Kasdim and debate with them, telling them that they were not following a proper path. (by serving the stars and idols.)  He broke their idols and began to teach the people that it is fitting to serve only the God of the world. (Our Sages relate that after breaking his father's idols, he put a stick in the hands of the largest idol. When his father asked him why he destroyed the idols, he replied that he didn't do it; the idol holding the stick did. His father curtly dismissed his reply: &quot;That idol is only metal. It cannot do anything,&quot; he roared at his son. &quot;If so, why do you worship it?&quot; Abraham replied.)  To Him [alone] is it fitting to bow down, sacrifice, and offer libations, so that the people of future [generations] would recognize Him. (The Rambam's words imply that the value of offering sacrifices at this time (before the Torah commanded that they be offered) was not as the acts of service of God, but in the educational effect they had on the people and the awareness of God they inspired.)  [Conversely,] it is fitting to destroy and break all the images, lest all the people err concerning them, like those people who thought that there are no other gods besides these [images]. When he overcame them through the strength of his arguments, the king (Nimrod (Pesachim 118a) desired to kill him - by tossing him into a burning furnace. He was [saved through] a miracle - Interestingly, when the Rambam lists the ten trials that Abraham endured in his Commentary on the Mishnah, Avot 5:3, he does not mention this episode at all. and left for Charan. - See Genesis 11:31. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam mentions Abraham's exile from his native land as the first of his ten trials. [There,] - he did not encounter any of the formal opposition he had faced in Babylonia and he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country - On the phrase, Genesis 12:5, &quot;the people they had gathered in Charan,&quot; Bereshit Rabbah 39:21 comments, &quot;These are the converts they made. Abraham would convert the men and Sarah would convert the women.&quot; until he came to the land of Canaan - See Genesis, Chapter 12, which describes Abraham's journeys within the land of Canaan. proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: &quot;And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God.&quot; - Sotah 10a states: &quot;Do not read 'And he called.' Read 'And he had others call' - i.e., Abraham motivated others to become aware of God and call out to Him. When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the men of the house of Abraham. - The Rabbis question the fate of all these people. We do not find any mention of the perpetuation of their faith in God. Perhaps the cultural influences of the surrounding environment were too powerful. If the children of Israel themselves turned to idol worship after two generations in Egypt, could any more be expected from these individuals? He planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed texts about it - Most commentaries point to Avodah Zarah 14b, which relates that Abraham composed a four-hundred-chapter text against the worship of false gods. Kinat Eliyahu notes that here, the Rambam is not referring to the negation of idol worship, but to the propagation of the faith in one God. Therefore, he suggests that the reference is to the Kabbalistic tradition (Zohar, Vol. II, 275b) that Sefer Yetzirah was composed by Abraham. (See also Kiryat Melech.) and taught it to Isaac, his son. - Note Genesis 18:19: &quot;I have known him that he will command his children and household after him, and they will keep the way of God....&quot; Isaac also taught others and turned [their hearts to God]. He also taught Jacob - Jacob also studied under Shem and Ever (See Rashi, Genesis 25:27, Bereishit Rabbah 25:16). and appointed him as a teacher - i.e., he and not Esau would convey the spiritual heritage of Abraham. [Jacob] taught others and turned [the hearts] of all those who gathered around him [to God]. He also taught all of his children. - In contrast to Abraham and Isaac, all of Jacob's children were righteous. (See Hilchot Kri'at Shema 1:4.) He selected Levi and appointed him as the leader. - The Torah itself does not mention Jacob's selection of Levi as a leader. A number of sources in the oral tradition (Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer, Chapter 39; Shemot Rabbah 15:27), however, reveal this concept. He established him [as the head of] the academy - The Midrash Tanchuma (Vayigash) interprets Genesis 46:28: &quot;And Jacob sent Judah before him,&quot; to mean that he charged him with founding a yeshiva. Similarly, Yoma 28b states that this Talmudic academy continued throughout the Egyptian exile. to teach them the way of God - Note Hilchot De'ot 1:7, which explains that the expression, &quot;the way of God,&quot; refers to ethics, emulating the qualities of spirit which God has revealed. and observe the mitzvot of Abraham. - In this context, note the Rambam's statements in Hilchot Melachim 9:1. After relating the seven universal laws given to Noach and his descendants, the Rambam states: In addition to these, Abraham was commanded regarding circumcision. He instituted the morning prayer. Isaac separated tithes and added another prayer service towards evening. Jacob added the prohibition against eating the gid hanasheh, the &quot;displaced nerve,&quot; and instituted the evening prayers. [Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from the descendants of Levi - Thus, the mantle of leadership passed to Kehat and then to Amram, Moses' father. so that the teachings would not be forgotten. This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation within the world which knew God. - This describes the initial period of the Jews' stay in Egypt, when they prospered both spiritually and materially. When the Jews extended their stay in Egypt - The entire period of the Egyptian exile lasted 210 years. As long as Jacob's sons were living, the Jews preserved the heritage of their fathers and were treated with honor by the Egyptians. The last of Jacob's sons to die was Levi. After his death, the spiritual level of the Jews descended. Levi lived 127 years. He was 44 when he entered Egypt. Thus, this spiritual descent occurred 83 years after the Jews entered Egypt. however, they learned from the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did - When the Jews adopted Egyptian values - as a reflection of their spiritual state - they were enslaved by the Egyptians. with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods. - The tribe of Levi was also the only tribe which perpetuated the mitzvah of circumcision (Sifre, Berachah). As a result of their spiritual fortitude, the tribe of Levi was never enslaved. Within a short time, the fundamental principle that Abraham had planted would have been uprooted and the descendants of Jacob would have returned to the errors of the world and their crookedness. - Our Sages relate that, in the Egyptian exile, the Jews had descended to the forty-ninth degree of impurity. Had they descended another level, it would have been impossible for us ever to be redeemed. Because of God's love for us, and to uphold the oath He made to Abraham, our patriarch - This is a reference to Deuteronomy 7:7-8: &quot;It is not because of your greatness over all the other nations that God desired you and chose you..., but it was because of God's love for you and because He kept the oath He swore to your fathers.&quot; He brought forth Moses, our teacher - Rav David Arameah notes that the word עשה, rendered as &quot;brought forth,&quot; literally means &quot;made.&quot; He explains that from Moses' birth, God granted him the potential to develop unique spiritual awareness. Although the Rambam also accepts this concept (see the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. II, Chapter 32), it is more likely that he chose this expression as a reference to I Samuel 12:6 (Rav Kapach). the master of all prophets - See Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 7:6, where the Rambam elaborates on the advantages Moses had over all the other prophets. Indeed, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to Chapter 10 of Sanhedrin), he includes belief in the supremacy of Moses' prophecy as the seventh of his Thirteen Principles of Faith. and sent him [to redeem the Jews] - after 117 years of idol worship and slavery. After Moses, our teacher, prophesied, and God chose Israel as His inheritance, He crowned them with mitzvot and informed them of the path to serve Him - by [teaching them] - the Torah which reveals the judgement prescribed for idol-worship and all those who stray after it - as will be explained in the subsequent chapters. The Rambam's elaboration on the negative experience of our people in Egypt and the giving of the Torah has the following implication. Although man can appreciate the futile nature of idol worship and the greatness of God with his own intellect, because man is fallable, it is necessary to have these principles institutionalized in an objective, unchanging religious code (Likkutei Sichot, Vol. 20).)  desired to kill him. He was [saved through] a miracle and left for Charan. [There,] he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world and it is proper to serve Him. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country, until he came to the land of Canaan - proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: &quot;And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God.&quot; When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the men of the house of Abraham. He planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed texts about it, and taught it to Isaac, his son. Isaac also taught others and turned [their hearts to God]. He also taught Jacob and appointed him as a teacher. [Jacob] taught others and turned [the hearts] of all those who gathered around him [to God]. He also taught all of his children. He selected Levi and appointed him as the leader. He established him [as the head of] the academy to teach them the way of God and observe the mitzvot of Abraham. [Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from the descendants of Levi, so that the teachings would not be forgotten.

And a poor and wise man was found in it (Ecclesiastes 9:15), this is Adam, as it is said 'And the man called his wife's name Eve' etc. (Genesis 3:20). And if he had been in the Garden of Eden when the serpent deceived Eve, they would not have eaten from the tree. And he saved her (Ecclesiastes 9:15), 'the woman whom you gave to be with me' etc. and ate (Genesis 3:12), for if he had not confessed to eating, God would have destroyed the Garden of Eden for their sake. But because he confessed, he was expelled from the Garden of Eden, as it is said 'And he drove out and completed' (Ecclesiastes 9:15).

              <p>[6] Another interpretation: &quot;זאב וטלה [ירעו כאחד]&quot; - &quot;The wolf and the lamb shall graze together&quot; (Isaiah 65:25). From the time that Joseph was sold, Benjamin did not leave his father's side, as he was compared to a lamb and the tribes were compared to a wolf. As it is written, &quot;Israel is scattered sheep&quot; (Jeremiah 50:17) and &quot;Your brothers will not come down with you&quot; (Genesis 42:34). Once Joseph revealed himself to them, he went down with them, as it is written, &quot;Then he lifted his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother&quot; (Genesis 43:29). &quot;The lion shall eat straw like the ox&quot; (Isaiah 11:7) and &quot;His firstborn ox has majesty&quot; (Deuteronomy 33:17), and the lion will be sent among the cattle, as it is written, &quot;And he sent Judah ahead of him&quot; (Genesis 46:28) and &quot;The lion shall eat straw like the ox&quot; (Isaiah 11:7). Why is there no longer jealousy between them? As it is written, &quot;Ephraim shall turn from envy&quot; (Isaiah 11:13). Similarly, in the future, when the Messiah, son of Joseph, will rise from Joseph, and the Messiah, son of David, will rise from Judah, Ephraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will not oppress Ephraim (Isaiah 11:13).

              <p>“He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to guide him to Goshen, and they came to the land of Goshen” (Genesis 46:28).  “He sent Judah before him to Joseph.” It is written: “Wolf and lamb will graze as one, and a lion, like cattle, will eat straw” (Isaiah 65:25). Come and see that everything that the Holy One blessed be He has struck in this world, He will heal in the future. The blind will be healed, as it is stated: “Then the eyes of the blind will be opened” (Isaiah 35:5). The lame will be healed, as it is stated: “Then the lame will leap like a deer and the tongue of the dumb will sing” (Isaiah 35:6). Just as a person departs, so he returns. (A person will return to life at the resurrection of the dead, as he was when he died. )  If he departs blind he returns blind; [if he was] deaf, he returns deaf; [if he was] mute, he returns mute. Just as he goes [to the grave] clothed, so he returns clothed. From whom do you derive it? It is from Samuel, who was seen by Saul. (This is not meant literally, as it was the woman conjurer who saw Samuel, while Saul himself did not see him (see I Samuel 28:11–14; Vayikra Rabba 26:7). The meaning is that Saul initiated the incident in which Samuel was seen by the conjurer. )  What did [Saul] say to the woman? “What is his appearance? She said: An old man…and he is clad in a robe” (I Samuel 28:14), as so he was clad, as it is stated: “His mother made him a small robe” (I Samuel 2:19).   Why is it that just as a person departs, so he returns? It is so [people] do not say: ‘When they were alive He did not heal them; did the Holy One blessed be He heal them when they were dead and then bring them back? It seems that these are not they, but others.’ The Holy One blessed be He says: ‘If so, let these stand as they departed, and then I will heal them.’ Why? “[So that you may know and believe Me and understand that I am He;] before Me no god was formed” (Isaiah 43:10), so I will heal them. The beasts will also be cured, as it is stated: “Wolf and lamb will graze as one” (Isaiah 65:25). All will be healed, but the one who brought harm upon all will not be healed, but rather, “and a serpent, dust will be its food” (Isaiah 65:25). Why? Because he took the creations down to the dust.  Another matter, “wolf and lamb.” “Wolf” – this is Benjamin. (See Genesis 49:27.)  “And lamb” – these are the tribes, as it is stated: “Israel are scattered sheep” (Jeremiah 50:17). “Will graze as one” – when? It was when Benjamin descended with them, and Jacob was saying to them: “My son will not descend with you” (Genesis 42:38). When the time arrived and he descended with them, they placed him between them and were guarding him. Likewise, regarding Joseph, it says: “He lifted his eyes, and saw Benjamin” (Genesis 43:29). (He was able to see him only after lifting his eyes because the brothers surrounded him.)  “A lion” – this is Judah; “Judah is a lion cub” (Genesis 49:9). “Like cattle” – this is Joseph; “A firstborn bull is his majesty” (Deuteronomy 33:17). They were found eating together – “they sat before him…he gave gifts” (Genesis 43:33–34). That is, “and a lion, like cattle, will eat straw” (Isaiah 65:25). That is why “he sent Judah before him.” (This was a demonstration that Judah and Joseph were now at peace. ) </p>

              <p>Another matter, “he sent Judah before him.” Rabbi Ḥanina son of Rabbi Aḥa, and Rabbi Ḥanina, one said: To arrange a residence for him. And one said: To arrange an academy in which he would teach Torah matters and in which the tribes would study. Know that it is so; when Joseph departed from him, he knew at which chapter that he was teaching him he left him. When Joseph’s brothers came to him and said to him: “Joseph is still alive… his heart was faint [because he did not believe them]” (Genesis 45:26). He remembered at which chapter he left him, and said to himself: I know that it was at the chapter of the beheaded calf [egla arufa] that Joseph left me. He said to them: ‘If you know at what chapter Joseph left me, I will believe you.’ Joseph, too, knew at what chapter he left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons [agalot], as it is stated: “Joseph gave them wagons by Pharaoh’s order” (Genesis 45:21). This is to teach you that everywhere Jacob would settle he would study Torah, just as his fathers would.  At this point, the Torah had not been given, but it is written of Abraham: “[Because Abraham heeded My voice,] and he kept My charge, [My commands, My decrees, and My Torahs]” (Genesis 26:5) – from where did Abraham learn the Torah? Rabban Shimon says: His two kidneys became like two jugs of water and they would gush Torah. From where is it derived that it is so? As it is stated: “Even on nights [my kidneys] instruct me” (Psalms 16:7). Rabbi Levi said: He studied Torah on his own, as it is stated: “The dissembler in his heart shall have his fill from his own ways, and a good man shall be satisfied from himself” (Proverbs 14:14). Rabbi Yonatan Sar HaBira said: Abraham knew even the joining of cooked foods, as it is stated: “Because Abraham heeded…” (Genesis 26:5). (The end of the verse mentions “My Torahs,” in plural, implying both the written and oral Torahs. The oral Torah includes even rabbinic laws, like the joining of cooked foods [eruv tavshilin]. The rabbis forbade cooking on a festival day for Shabbat unless one prepares two cooked items for Shabbat before the festival day (see Beitza 15b).)   How old was Abraham when he recognized his Creator? He recognized his Creator at the age of forty-eight years old. Reish Lakish said: At the age of three years old, as “ekev” is written, the numerical value of ekev, and Abraham lived one hundred and seventy-five years. (The verse states “because [ekev] Abraham heeded My voice…” The numerical value of the word ekev is one hundred and seventy-two, implying that Abraham heeded God’s voice for one hundred and seventy-two years. )  You learn from this that at age three, he recognized his Creator. He would observe the details of the Torah and would teach his children, as it is stated: “For I have loved him, [so that he will command his children and his household after him and they will observe the way of the Lord]” (Genesis 18:19).

              <p>Another matter, “there was a small city” – this is Egypt, “and few men in it” – these are Joseph’s brothers, “and a great king came against it and surrounded it” – this is Joseph, “and built a great siege upon it” – these are the three edicts that he issued: That no slave shall enter Egypt, no person may enter with two donkeys, and no person may enter whose name and his father’s name, and his grandfather’s name, and his grandmother’s name are not documented. (Joseph issued these edicts so that his brothers would have to come to Egypt themselves to procure food, and not send their slaves; so that they would all have to come, instead of sending just some of them; and so that he would be able to identify them (Etz Yosef).)  “He found in it a poor, wise man” – this is Judah, “and he saved the city in his wisdom” – as he said: “I will guarantee him…” (Genesis 43:9). Moreover, he said to Joseph: “Now please, let your servant remain instead of the lad…” (Genesis 44:33). (Thus, Judah saved the extended family from starvation by convincing Jacob to allow Benjamin to travel to Egypt, and he saved Benjamin from slavery by offering himself as a slave to Joseph instead.)  “But no one remembered that poor man” – the Holy One blessed be He said: You did not remember him; I remember him, as it is stated: “He sent Judah before him…” (Genesis 46:28). (God ensured that Judah would still play a lead role among the brothers when they moved to Egypt.) </p>

              <p>(Gen. 46:28:) NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM UNTO JOSEPH TO TEACH BEFORE HIM. (This interpretation is assumed in the midrash.)  What is the meaning of &lt; TO TEACH BEFORE HIM &gt;? R. Nehemiah said: To establish an academy for him where he would teach Torah so that the tribes might study Torah. (Gen. R. 95:3; Tanh., Gen. 11:11; also Gen. R. 94:3.)  You know that this is so; &lt; for &gt;, when Joseph had left him, Jacob knew at what chapter he had left him because he had taught him. When Joseph's brothers came and said to him (in Gen. 44:26): JOSEPH IS STILL ALIVE &lt; … &gt; HIS HEART GREW FAINT, because he did not believe it, as stated (ibid.): FOR HE DID NOT BELIEVE THEM. Jacob recalled at what chapter Joseph had left him. He said to them: Did he give you a sign (Gk.: semeion.)  &lt; indicating &gt; at what chapter Joseph left me? Jacob said in his heart: I know that he left me at the chapter on the heifer ('GLH, i.e., Deut. 21:1-9). He said to them: Say at what chapter he left me, and I will believe you. Joseph also recalled at what chapter he had left him. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons ('GLH in the singular), as stated (in Gen. 45:21): SO JOSEPH GAVE THEM WAGONS. &lt; This verse is &gt; to teach you that in every place that he went he was busy at Torah, just as his ancestors had been, even though the Torah had not yet been given. Ergo, it is written of Abraham (in Gen. 26:5): AND HE KEPT MY CHARGE: MY COMMANDMENTS, MY STATUTES, AND MY TORAHS. From where did Abraham learn the Torah? R. Simeon ben Johay says: &lt; His &gt; two kidneys became like two full vessels which spouted forth Torah. And where is it shown? Where it says so (in Ps. 16:17): EVEN IN THE NIGHTS MY KIDNEYS ADMONISH ME. R. Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of R. Jonathan ben Eleazar Ish haBirah: Our father Abraham even knew the eruvim of cooked foods. (See above, 3:14; also 3:1.)  Thus it is stated (in Gen. 26:5): BECAUSE ('QB 'ShR) ABRAHAM HEEDED MY VOICE, &lt; AND KEPT MY CHARGE &gt;…. Now at the age of three Abraham recognized his Creator, as stated (through the first word of this verse): 'QB (with a numerical value of 172). Since all the days of Abraham were one hundred and seventy-five, from here (Gen. 26:5) you learn (by simple subtraction) that at the age of three he had recognized him and that he was even keeping the fine points of Torah. He also taught his children, as stated (in Gen. 18:19): FOR I HAVE CHOSEN HIM SO THAT HE MAY CHARGE &lt; HIS CHILDREN AND HIS HOUSEHOLD AFTER HIM TO KEEP THE WAY OF THE LORD, TO PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS AND JUSTICE &gt;…. The Holy One said to him: You have taught your children Torah in this world, but in the world to come I in my glory will teach them the Torah, as stated (in Is. 54:13): AND ALL YOUR CHILDREN SHALL BE TAUGHT BY THE LORD, AND GREAT SHALL BE YOUR CHILDREN'S PROSPERITY.</p>

              <p>(Gen. 46:28:) NOW HE HAD SENT JUDAH AHEAD OF HIM UNTO JOSEPH. This text is related (to Is. 65:25): THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL FEED TOGETHER…. (Tanh., Gen. 11:8; Gen. R. 95:1.)  Come and see how whatever the Holy One has smitten in this world is healed in the world to come. The blind are healed, as stated (in Is. 35:5): THEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND SHALL BE OPENED. The lame also are healed, as stated (in vs. 6): THEN THE LAME SHALL LEAP LIKE A HART. And the dumb shall be healed, as stated (ibid., cont.): AND THE TONGUE OF THE DUMB SHALL SHOUT FOR JOY. Everyone shall be healed, but just as one goes (to the grave), so he comes &lt; back &gt;. (Sanh. 91b; Eccl. R. 1:4:2; see yKil. 9:4 (32b).)  If he goes blind, he comes &lt; back &gt; blind. If he goes deaf, he comes deaf. If he goes lame, he comes lame. If he goes dumb, he comes dumb. Just as one goes clothed, so one comes clothed. Thus it is written (in Job 38:14): IT IS CHANGED LIKE CLAY UNDER A SEAL; THEY STAND FORTH AS &lt; IN &gt; A GARMENT. From whom do you learn this? From Samuel. When Saul raised him, what did he say to the woman (of Endor)? He said to her: What do you see, AND (according to I Sam. 28:14) SHE SAID: IT IS AN OLD MAN RISING, AND HE IS WRAPPED IN A ROBE; for he had been so clothed, as stated (in I Sam. 2:19): HIS MOTHER WOULD MAKE A LITTLE ROBE FOR HIM. So why is it that, just as one goes (to the grave), so one comes &lt; back &gt; ? So that the wicked of the world will not say: After they died, would the Holy One have healed them and later brought them &lt; back &gt;? It would seem that these are not the same ones (who died), but others. The Holy One said: If so, let them rise just as they went (to the grave), and afterwards I will heal them. Thus it is stated (in Is. 43:10): &lt; SO THAT YOU MAY KNOW THAT &gt; … BEFORE ME NO GOD WAS FORMED. Then later the beasts are healed, as stated (in Is. 65:25): THE WOLF AND THE LAMB SHALL FEED TOGETHER…. And why? Because it (the serpent) (For this interpretation, see Gen. R. 95:1 and also 20:5.)  has brought everything to dust.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>And he sent Judah before him (Gen. 46:28). Jacob sent Judah before him to establish an academy wherein he might teach the Torah as he had previously done for the tribes. You know that he taught his sons earlier from the fact that Jacob remembered the chapter of the Torah that Joseph was studying with him at the time of his disappearance. When Joseph’s brothers returned and told him: “Joseph is yet alive” … his heart fainted, for he believed them not (Gen. 45:26). Jacob recalled the chapter of the Torah that Joseph was studying at the time of his departure, and he said to himself: “I know that he was studying the portion devoted to the beheaded heifer.” (See Deut. 21:1–9.)  Whereupon he turned to them and said: “If he gave you something to indicate the chapter he was studying when he departed from here, I will believe you.” Joseph had also remembered the chapter he was studying when he was separated from his father. What did Joseph do? He gave them wagons (ibid., v. 21). When Jacob saw the wagons (‘agalot), the spirit of their father revived forthwith. (Word-play relating ‘agalot (“wagons”) to kelayot (“kidneys”), stated in the next paragraph to be the organ through which Abraham learned and retained the law.)  This teaches us that wherever Joseph went, he devoted himself to the law, as his ancestors had done before him, even though the Torah itself had not yet been given. And thus it is written: Because that Abraham hearkened to My voice and kept My laws (Gen. 26:5).</p>

              <p>Regarding that which the verse states: “Shaḥarayim begot children in the field of Moav [after he had sent them away, Ḥushim and Baara his wives]” (I Chronicles 8:8), Elijah, of blessed memory, asked Rabbi Nehorai, he said to him: ‘What is this that is written: “Shaḥarayim begot in the field of Moav”?’ [Rabbi Nehorai] said to him: ‘A great man begot in the field of Moav.’ “After he had sent them away” (I Chronicles 8:8) – as they were from the tribe of Benjamin, as it is written: “The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying” (Judges 20:12). (Just as the term “sent” appears in Judges regarding the tribe of Benjamin, the verse in Chronicles is hinting to the fact that the man’s wives were from the tribe of Benjamin. )  Another interpretation, “Shaḥarayim,” this is Boaz. Why was his name called Shaḥarayim? It is because he was free [meshuḥrar] of iniquities. “Begot in the field of Moav,” as he begot from Ruth the Moavite. “After he had sent them away,” as he was from the tribe of Judah, as it is stated: “And he sent Judah before him to Joseph” (Genesis 46:28). “Ḥushim and Baara his wives,” does a man beget his wives? Rather, he was swift like a leopard and articulated the halakha: (He expounded the verse: “An Amonite and a Moavite shall not enter the congregation of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4).)  An Amonite but not an Amonite woman, a Moavite but not a Moavite woman. “He begot from Ḥodesh his wife” (I Chronicles 8:9) – it should have stated only, “from Baara his wife.” Rather, in his days, the halakha of an Amonite but not an Amonite woman, a Moavite and not a Moavite woman, was introduced [nitḥadsha]. One verse says: “Yitra the Ishmaelite” (see I Chronicles 2:17), and one verse says: “Yitra the Israelite” (II Samuel 17:25). Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: He is Yitra the Ishmaelite, he is Yitra the Israelite. (Both verses refer to the same person.)  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman and the Rabbis: Rabbi Shmuel said: He was an Ishmaelite, and you say Israelite? Rather, he was an Ishmaelite. He entered the study hall and found Yishai sitting and expounding thus: “Look to Me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth…” (Isaiah 45:22). (Anyone from all the ends of the earth can look to God and be saved.)  He converted, and [Yishai] gave him his daughter. The Rabbis say: He was an Israelite, and you say Ishmaelite? Rather, he was an Israelite and he girded his sword like an Ishmaelite. He stuck his sword in the middle of the study hall and said: I will either kill or be killed until I establish the halakha for the multitudes, so that anyone who abrogates this halakha, I will behead him with this sword: An Amonite but not an Amonite woman, a Moavite and not a Moavite woman.</p>

            <summary>Yehudah emerges as a leader among his brothers in Egypt, replacing Reuven, and is later sent ahead by Jacob to prepare the land for Israel's resettlement. This pattern of leadership following previous achievements is seen throughout Jewish history, such as David succeeding Saul and the Messiah of the House of David following the Messiah of Joseph. The Egyptians' harsh treatment of the Israelites was not physical, but rather aimed at preventing them from studying Torah and performing commandments, in an attempt to distance them from God's holiness. This is exemplified by the prohibition of Torah study and attempts to disrupt daily prayers, leading to punishments such as the plague of frogs.</summary>

                <h4>Midrash BeChiddush on Pesach Haggadah, Magid, First Fruits Declaration 7:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>וַיָּרֵ֧עוּ אֹתָ֛נוּ הַמִּצְרִ֖ים וַיְעַנּ֑וּנוּ וַיִּתְּנ֥וּ עָלֵ֖ינוּ עֲבֹדָ֥ה קָשָֽׁה׃ The Egyptians dealt harshly with us and oppressed us; they imposed heavy labor upon us. (Deuteronomy 26:6) וַיָּרֵ֧עוּ אֹתָ֛נוּ הַמִּצְרִ֖ים Vayarei’u otanu: “The Egyptians dealt harshly with us…” (Deut 26:6)  One might ask, after stating, “The Egyptians dealt harshly with us,” along with all the other verses describing (Israel’s oppression), why was it necessary to bring a verse from the Torah (to explain Deut. 26) that does not seem to offer any additional information? What do we learn from one verse about the other?  However, one might say that since the verses (Deuteronomy 26:5-8)  (in the Haggadah) are from Deuteronomy, one might claim that Moses said this of his own volition. Because he was grateful for all the kindness that God did for him, he exaggerated. Therefore, we bring a proof for each and every detail (in Deuteronomy 26) to show that it is exactly as it happened. Everything in Deuteronomy only adds to what is not stated in the other books of the Torah, as has been said regarding the commandments. All of the commandments taught in Deuteronomy are meant to add something (that has already been taught in the other books of the Torah). We will explain this later.  (Atta) Now, Maggid informs us of the bodily and physical injuries the Egyptians inflicted on us. It does this so that no one should ask why God smote the Egyptians with all of the plagues that have been mentioned. That is why Scripture states וַיָּרֵעוּ אֹתָנוּ &quot;And the Egyptians dealt harshly with to us&quot; (Deut. 26:6) and not וַיָּרֵ֥עוּ לָ֛נוּ “The Egyptians ill-treated us,” as is written elsewhere, וַיָּרֵ֥עוּ לָ֛נוּ מִצְרַ֖יִם וְלַאֲבֹתֵֽינוּ “Egypt ill-treated us and our fathers” (Num. 20:15) (There isn’t a good way to translate these two expressions so they are different from one another. Both include the word vayarei’u, one includes lanu and the other otanu. Vayerei’u otanu might be translated as, they made us evil, while vayerei’u lanu would be they dealt harshly or harmed us.)    It intends to tell us that the Egyptians made the Israelites look guilty before Heaven. They did this by keeping them from studying Torah and performing commandments, as the Midrash states when it gives the reason for each plague. The sages said that the Egyptians did not deal harshly with the Israelites in order to injure their bodies or possessions. Rather they did so because God is holy and those who serve God are holy. However when one sanctifies oneself the divine presence rests within them, while one who makes oneself impure one is distanced from God.  Therefore, the heavenly prince who was appointed over Egypt put the idea in the minds of the Egyptians to make Israel perform acts that would make the Israelites impure. It was as if he said to them, if Israel is not holy, God will reject them. He tried to remove from them the things that sanctified them so that they would be removed from their domain (of holiness). The first effort was to prohibit them from studying Torah. Jacob had established a house of study in Goshen, as the sages said regarding the verse, “He had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to point the way (lihorot) before him to Goshen.” (See Rashi on the verse: BEFORE HIM — means before he should arrive there. A Midrashic comment is: להורת לפניו (in the sense of, “that there might be teaching before him”) — to establish for him a House of Study from which Teaching (הוראה or תורה) might go forth (GR 95:3).)  (Gen. 46:28) And so the Egyptians decreed against the study of Torah. This is what the sages said, for their stratagems, they decided to punish them with water. Water is none other than Torah - that is why they were judged with water (at the Reed Sea). The Egyptians also tried to abrogate their daily recitation of the Sh’ma and the Amida; and so they smote them with the plague of frogs, as is stated in the Zohar. Va’era page 30a: This is the way of Israel: “At midnight, those who desire to remember the Holy One of blessing, do not allow their hearts to be restful. They rise up from bed to make mention of the Holy One. When the sun rises they go early to the synagogue and praise the Holy One. Similarly after noon, the time of Minchah. And when it becomes dark and the darkness clings to the night, when the sun has set. Regarding them, it is written, “By day or by night, O you, Adonai’s remembrancers, take no rest. This is the way of the people of Israel. Therefore, the Holy One remembered them in Egypt and sent those who did not subside neither day nor night against Pharaoh. Who are they? The frogs whose voices never subside! For Pharaoh seized hold of the Holy people who never stopped praising the Holy One…” Because he kept them from reciting the Shema evening and morning, and similarly kept them from the other commandments, therefore, “He treated them harshly/ he made them bad.” (See full translation of this passage with variations in Daniel Matt’s translation of the Zohar, Volume 4, Pages 121-122, Volume 2, 30a)  </p>

              <p>One difference between the first two and the third encounters with Yosef in Egypt is the leadership dynamic of the brothers. In the first meeting (Bereshit 42:10–22), the brothers are always speaking as a group, with the one exception of Reuven’s brief interjection of “I told you so” (verse 22) when they recognize their guilt in their earlier treatment of Yosef. In the second encounter, before Binyamin is framed, the brothers are still speaking as a group. Afterwards, when the brothers are arrested and there is a need for leadership, it is no longer Reuven who steps up but Yehudah. Now that Yehudah’s leadership has come to the fore, the text (Bereshit 44:14) describes the group as “Yehudah, and his brothers.” Yehudah now becomes the undisputed leader, to be confirmed by Yaakov later on (Bereshit 46:28, 49:8–12).</p>

              <p>Judah and Joseph In the crucible of the fight for Benjamin, Judah proved himself capable of being the champion even of those he once wished to destroy: the children of Rachel. It was therefore Judah that Jacob sent before him to Goshen, so that he might prepare the land for Israel’s resettlement. The verse was very particular as to Jacob’s instruction to Judah: that he go “ahead of him, to Joseph, to prepare Goshen before his arrival.” (Genesis 46:28.)  Joseph was already in Egypt. His tasks – to unite the Children of Israel, to act as liaison to the nations of the world, to build a “foundation for nationhood and malkhut,” (Weinberg, Patterns in Time: Chanukah, 196–97.)  were fulfilled. (See “Manasseh: The Diaspora Jew” in chapter 13.)  Judah followed Joseph, building on what Joseph had already achieved. This pattern repeated itself throughout Jewish history: David followed Saul (of benei Rachel), and the Messiah of the House of David will ultimately follow the Messiah of Joseph. (Sukkah 52a.) </p>

              <p>Genesis 46,29. (normal translation) “Joseph harnessed his ‎chariot and ascended towards Israel his father;” ‎ ‎[The reason why the author presents an allegorical ‎commentary first, as if it were the obvious meaning, is ‎presumably, that if the Torah had merely wanted to tell us that ‎Joseph traveled in the direction of his father to welcome him, ‎these details would have been irrelevant. The same reason applies ‎elsewhere where he chooses the allegorical or mystical approach ‎as his first choice. Ed.]‎ The word ‎ויאסור‎, refers to Joseph “harnessing” his body in ‎anticipation of meeting his saintly father; the word ‎מרכבתו‎ is an ‎allusion to the four basic components (raw materials in terms of ‎the creation) of which the physical universe is composed. Joseph ‎considers the forthcoming encounter with his father as almost ‎like making a pilgrimage to the Holy Temple. This is reflected in ‎the Torah’s choice of his name Yisrael at this point, although his ‎father is entering “exile.” His father had the name Yisrael added ‎to his name as recognition that he had elevated his body through ‎service of the Lord to come closer to his Creator. The first three ‎letters in that name, i.e. ‎ישר‎, “upright,” straightforward, are also ‎reflected in the location where Israel would reside from now on, ‎in ‎גשנה‎, a word reflecting ‎הגשה‎, bringing something close, in order ‎to unite it with something or somebody else. In this case it ‎reflects rapprochement to G’d in heaven. The letter ‎ה‎ at the end ‎of the word ‎גשן‎, meaning five, alludes to the One and only G’d ‎Who holds the other 4 parts of the universe together, without ‎Whom it would implode. Here on earth this world is held together ‎by the tzaddik, in our case by the righteous Joseph.‎</p>

              <p>“And Yosef harnessed his chariot” (Bereishit 46:29). Whatever is under a person's control is called ‘his chariot’. Thus, the entire world is a ‘chariot’ for Hashem, the King of the world. Each individual must draw everything under their control towards the service of Hashem. This is how one humbles oneself to Hashem, by subjecting everything they have to Him. Yosef's rulership in Mitzrayim, where the Egyptians were subjugated to him, was a preparation for the exile in Mitzrayim. The Egyptians became a ‘chariot’ for Yosef. When Yosef went to greet Yaakov, he needed to first harness his chariot, meaning he had to properly control all that was under him, which was far removed from Yaakov's truth, to prevent it from falling apart upon meeting Yaakov. Similarly, when Yaakov left Eretz Yisrael, he connected himself deeply to withstand negative forces. Yosef, in contrast, attached all of this world under his control to not lose it when encountering Yaakov's holiness. Thus, when Yosef ascended, he harnessed his entire chariot to draw everything towards Hashem, embodying the trait of Yosef the tzadik to draw everything to Hashem.</p>

              <p>On the pasuk “And Yosef harnessed his chariot” (Bereishit 46:29), it signifies that man was created to rule over nature, as stated in &quot;he shall rule over the fish of the sea&quot; (Bereishit 1:26) and &quot;laying the world at his feet&quot; (Tehillim 8:7). Man controls nature, making it his chariot. When a person accepts the yoke of heaven and humbles himself before Hashem, all of creation is nullified to Hashem through this person. This can only occur when one overcomes negative inclinations, thus gaining control over creation. Yosef's reward for overcoming his trials was his rulership in Mitzrayim, which prepared Bnei Yisrael for the upcoming exile. Without Yosef preceding them as a ruler, Bnei Yisrael could not have withstood the impurity of Mitzrayim. Yaakov's level was above nature, and he needed Yosef to harness everything under his control, making it subjugated to the general force of Bnei Yisrael. The Medrash (Bereishit Rabba 94:4) explains that Yaakov exclaimed Yosef's greatness for withstanding the tests of Mitzrayim and fulfilling the verse, “How abundant is the good that You have in store for those who fear You, that You do in the full view of men for those who take refuge in You” (Tehillim 31:20). This &quot;good in store&quot; is earned through efforts and trials in this world. The reward of the world to come is dependent on one's actions in this world. There is a correlation between great good and great bad, as overcoming great bad leads to meriting great good. Yosef's steadfastness in Mitzrayim allowed him to remain a tzadik and achieve this level of greatness.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויעל לקראת ישראל, “he (Joseph) went up to meet Israel.” The reason that the expression עלה is used here is to tell the reader that for Joseph it was tantamount to a spiritual ascent to go and greet his father and to pay him this honour. Alternately, the reason why he is described as ascending, is that the province of Goshen is situated on a higher plateau than the Nile delta in which most of the Egyptians dwelt. Goshen borders on the land of Israel which is a land of many hills and mountains. This is also clear from Joshua 15,49-51. Seeing that Yehudah had been sent ahead by his father to prepare his residence in Goshen, that region became part of the ancestral heritage of the tribe of Yehudah in due course. The Egyptians never challenged the Israelites having annexed that province.

              <p>ויאסר יוסף מרכבתו, “Joseph harnessed his chariot.” Tanchuma Vayigash 7 states that there were two people who were honoured in a manner unparalleled. One was Yitro, the other was Yaakov. When Yitro visited Moses in the desert, the Torah writes: (‎Exodus 18,7) “Moses went forth to greet his father-in-law.” As soon as someone saw Moses leave his customary place in order to welcome Yitro, all the princes, Aaron the High Priest, as well as the entire nation went out also to welcome Yitro. Yaakov experienced something similar. As soon as people saw that heir ruler harnessed his chariot in order to welcome his father, the entire nation did the same. This was an example of what Isaiah 24,23 had in mind when he said: “and the Presence will be revealed to His elders.”</p>

Good taste would have dictated for Joseph to kiss the hand of his father or to prostrate himself in front of him. The verbs in this verse all apply to Yaakov. It was Yaakov who fell around the neck of Joseph and broke out crying for quite some time. Just as he had still been crying over him while they had not been reunited, the reunion also evoked a crying spell. He cried over the reunion, and he cried additionally when he considered the position of power and eminence Joseph had attained.</p>

              <p>עוד, is that this went on for a time. We find the word used in this sense in Exodus 4,6 where G’d is persisting in His efforts to convince Moses to accept the position of Israel’s leader by showing him miracles he could perform to legitimise himself before his people. The word describes something that happened repeatedly, at intervals. Yaakov wept only once, whereas Joseph wept repeatedly. Some commentators claim that Yaakov did not weep at all but was preoccupied with reciting the שמע ישראל, an affirmation of G’d and His uniqueness which he formulated on that occasion for the first time.

              </summary>
              <p>AND HE APPEARED BEFORE HIM. Joseph appeared before his father. And he wept on his neck a good while. The phrase vayeivk od signifies “weeping copiously.” Jacob, however, did not fall upon the neck of his son Joseph, nor did he kiss him. Our Rabbis said that this was because he was reciting the Shema, (the affirmation of G-d’s Unity). This is the language of Rashi. But [according to this interpretation, which says that it was Joseph who fell on his father’s neck and wept], I know of no reason for the statement, And he appeared before him, since it is understood that Joseph appeared before Jacob since he fell upon his neck. Moreover, it is not respectful for Joseph to fall upon his father’s neck. He should rather bow before him or kiss his hands, as it is written, And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he fell down on his face. (Further, 48:12.)  And at the present moment, it was more fitting that he bow to him [than at the time referred to in the aforementioned verse]. (Further, 48:12.)  So also, every term ‘od’ in Scripture indicates an addition to the original but does not imply copiousness. Thus: He doth not set a stated time ‘od’ for a man, (Job 34:23.)  which means, “He sets a stated time for a man in accordance with his transgression, and nothing is added.” (We thus see that od can refer to a slight increase.)  The correct interpretation appears to me to be that Israel’s eyes were already slightly dim from age, (See further, 48:10.)  and when Joseph arrived in the carriage of the second in rank, (Above, 42, 43.)  with a mitre on his head as was the custom of the Egyptian kings, his father did not recognize him. His brothers also had not recognized him. (Ibid., 42:8.)  Therefore Scripture mentioned that when he appeared before his father, who stared at him and finally recognized him, his father fell on his neck and cried again over him, even as he had continually cried over him to this day when he had not seen him after his disappearance, and then Jacob said, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face. (Verse 31 here.)  It is a known matter as to whose tears are more constant: that of an old father who finds his son alive after having despaired of him and having mourned for him, or that of a grown-up son who reigns. Do not be concerned [lest this interpretation be open to question] because Scripture immediately says, And Israel said, (Verse 30 here.)  [thus implying that the previous subject is not Israel but Joseph], whereas according to our interpretation Scripture is speaking of Jacob and then mentions his name once again in the following verse. A similar case is found in these verses: And he gathered up all the foods of the seven years, etc., (Above, 41:48.)  [where Joseph is the subject of the verse, and yet Scripture mentions his name in the succeeding verse], And unto Joseph were born two sons. (Ibid., Verse 50.)  There are constantly many similar places in the Torah and in the other books of Scripture.</p>

              <p>Our Sages explained that this was because he was reading the “Shema.” Some ask: Perhaps he was standing in prayer? It seems [the answer is:] Our Rabbis of blessed memory said in Berachos 27a that we may not pass in front of someone standing in prayer, so as not to interfere with his concentration. Surely, Yoseif would not fall on Yaakov’s neck lest he disturb his concentration. But with the Shema, we need to concentrate mainly in the first verse, which where we accept upon ourselves the Kingship of Heaven. And Yoseif fell on Yaakov’s neck after Yaakov had read the first verse. You might ask: Why was Yoseif, too, not reading the Shema? The answer is: Yoseif was involved with the mitzvah of honoring his father. Someone involved in the performance of a mitzvah is exempt from performing another mitzvah. Another answer: Yoseif exempted himself by reading the first verse [alone], since he was busy and occupied, as it says in the Gemara in Berachos 13b that [the single verse of] Shema Yisrael was the Shema of R. Yehudah Hanasi, because he was busy with teaching the disciples. </p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויעל לקראת אביו גושנה, he went up to meet his father, to the province of Goshen. Some commentators say that the Goshen mentioned here is the same as that mentioned in the Book of Joshua 10,41, [that Goshen is described as near Givon], and that seeing that the land of Israel is located at higher altitudes than all other countries according to our sages, the Torah describes Joseph as traveling “up,” i.e. uphill. [why would Yaakov’s journey then have been described as a descent, seeing that one look at the map would convince us that as his last stop was Beer Sheva, he too would have had to continue from there uphill. Ed.]
    We do not consider this explanation of the word ויעל as appropriate at all. The province of Goshen was situated within Egypt proper, though at a higher level than the Nile delta which was practically at sea level for many kilometers starting with the capital. As to the apparently contradictory line in 46,31 where Joseph, leaving his father, speaks about “going up to Pharaoh etc,” has to be understood in terms of his stepping into his chariot, just as getting out of a chariot is described as “descending” from it, so entering it again as described as “ascending” into it.
    It is also possible that the correct interpretation of these terms עליה and ירידה respectively, is that Joseph said: “I will go to Egypt, (capital) and ascend to the palace of Pharaoh, which was built on a hill, overlooking the surrounding area, and inform him, etc.” It is even possible, though unlikely, that the land of Egypt proper was on a higher plateau than the province of Goshen, which was closest to the Mediterranean sea, in which case the word ויעל in our verse would refer to Joseph ascending his chariot before beginning his journey.

              <p>וירא אליו, “he appeared to him;” according to Rashi, Joseph appeared to his father and fell around his neck and wept still, are to be contrasted with Yaakov’s reaction; he did not fall around Joseph’s neck and did not kiss his son until he had finished reciting the prayer קריאת שמע. 
    Nachmanides writes that he does not know why the expression וירא “he appeared,” has been chosen by the Torah to describe this meeting, seeing that it is quite obvious that when two people meet so closely that they embrace each other, as here, that they appear to one another. Furthermore, Joseph’s whole behaviour does not seem appropriate. He should have first prostrated himself and have kissed his father’s hands. Furthermore, the word עוד does not mean a surfeit of something, but something in addition to what had already been there before. Seeing that Joseph had not fallen around Yaakov’s neck before, the word עוד in this connection is hard to understand.
    The correct meaning of the phrase is that Yaakov’s eyes were heavy from old age, which made it difficult for him to recognize Joseph, or that seeing that Joseph had been in a rush to welcome his father he had been wearing royal attire and some sort of headgear totally unfamiliar to Yaakov, so that even if he would have recognized him in ordinary garments, he did not associate the figure approaching him in Royal Splendour as being his son. Therefore, when upon Joseph approaching real close and Yaakov finally recognizing him, i.e. “he appeared to him,” he fell around his neck and, in addition to this, wept while doing so. He had been weeping over the loss of Joseph for many years, only this time he wept from joy. Joseph, on the other hand, although he had been told that his father was well, when he saw him, he received a shock so that he began to weep in spite of the reunion. It is a moot point who of the two wept more and longer.

              <p>“He embraced him around the neck” [46:29]. Joseph fell on Jacob’s neck and cried, but Jacob did not fall on Joseph’s neck. Jacob was reciting the Shema at that time. (Rashi, Genesis, 46:29.)  Here one asks a question. Why did Joseph also not recite the Shema? The explanation is that Joseph was absolved from the obligation to read the Shema because he was engaged in fulfilling a commandment. He was honoring his father and was going to greet him. Thus, he did not need to read the Shema. (Devek Tov, Genesis, 46:29, n. 10.)  Ramban writes. How is it that Joseph fell on his father’s neck? This was not culturally appropriate. He should have prostrated himself before his father with fear. Therefore, the explanation must be that Jacob fell on his son’s neck and embraced him. “He wept on his neck, etc.” [46:29]. That is to say, Jacob was still crying, as he had cried previously when he was lost, so Jacob was still crying. Particularly now, when a son that he had lost hope for, had become a king. How could he not cry for joy? The old people can do no more than cry in their troubles and their joy. (Ramban, Genesis, 46:29.) </p>

              <p>While reciting the Shema, one should not gesture with his eyes or lips, or point with his fingers, (Yoma 19b distinguishes between the first section of Kri'at Shema and the second in this regard, forbidding these activities only during the recitation of the first section. Indeed, in Halachah 4 which also deals with a &quot;haphazard&quot; recitation of the Shema, the Rambam, himself makes such a distinction. Indeed, the Lechem Mishneh explains that the Rambam relies on his statements in Halachah 4. Rabbenu Manoach explains that the Rambam did not clarify the matter explicitly lest he cheapen the value of the second section in the eyes of his reader. The Kessef Mishneh adds that although making such gestures in the second section is not as &quot;improper&quot; as during the first, doing so is, nevertheless, prohibited.)  in order that his reading not be haphazard. (Rabbi Acha notes ודברת בם (&quot;and you shall speak of them&quot;) implies making these words a matter of primary importance, and not regarding them as haphazard (Yoma, op. cit.).)  If one were to do this, although he does fulfill his obligation, he has acted improperly. (Yoma ( op. cit.) refers to Isaiah 43:22: &quot;And you have not called upon Me, Jacob,&quot; implying that such a casual reading of the Shema is not considered as calling to God. The Maharsha explains an added implication of the above verse. Rashi, in his commentary to Genesis 46:29, relates that when Jacob was first reunited with Joseph he made no response because he was reciting the Shema at that time. Surely, one who gestures while reading the Shema has certainly not achieved the level of devotion.)  One should recite the Shema so that his words are audible to himself. (This is derived from the word Shema - literally &quot;hear&quot; - in the first verse. It implies that one should make audible to himself that which he says (Berachot 15a).)  [However, even] if he does not do this, he fulfills his obligation. (The entire latter portion of this halachah is based on Berachot 15a: One who recites the Shema so that the words are not audible to himself has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yosse says that he has not fulfilled his obligation. If he reads, but does not enunciate clearly: Rabbi Yosse says that he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yehudah says that he has not. The Talmud concludes (ibid. 15b) that the halachah is in accordance with the lenient position in both cases - i.e., the anonymous opinion in the first case and Rabbi Yosse in the second. Rav Yitzchak Alfasi adds that this is only after the fact. A priori (לכתחילה), one must read in such a way as to be audible to himself and enunciate the letters clearly. The Rambam follows this view. Nevertheless, one must at least mouth the words of Kri'at Shema, even if he does not pronounce them loudly enough that they are audible to himself. Thought is not regarded like speech. (See the commentary on Halachah 3.) Therefore, one who does not even move his lips, but just thinks about the words as he &quot;reads&quot; them, does not fulfill his obligation (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 62:3).)  One must enunciate the letters clearly. (Berachot 15b derives this from the word ולמדתם- &quot;And you shall teach them.&quot; It can be divided into two words ולמד תם, implying that your teaching (ולמד) must be תם - perfect.)  [However, even] if he does not do this, he fulfills his obligation. (Berachot ibid. notes that if a person reads the Shema with proper enunciation, &quot;Gehinom will be cooled off for him.&quot;) </p>

            <summary>The term &quot;riding upon the heavens&quot; is a figurative expression used to compare God to a rider and the uppermost sphere to an animal being ridden, emphasizing God's control and separation from the sphere. In Hebrew, the collective noun for animals used for riding is &quot;mercabah,&quot; as seen in various biblical examples, indicating a collection of animals, such as the four horses carrying the Throne of Glory being referred to as a &quot;mercabah&quot; by the Sages due to its similarity to a chariot pulled by four single animals.</summary>

              <p>Know also that the term “riding upon the heavens,” has figuratively been applied to God in order to show the following excellent comparison. The rider is better than the animal upon which he rides—the comparative is only used for the sake of convenience, for the rider is not of the same class as the animal upon which he rides—furthermore, the rider moves the animal and leads it as he likes; it is as it were his instrument, which he uses according to his will; he is separate from it, apart from it, not connected with it. In like manner the uppermost sphere, by the rotation of which everything moveable is set in motion, is moved by God, who is separate from the sphere, and is not a power in it.</p>

              <p>You must know that in Hebrew the collective noun denoting animals used for riding is “mercabah.” Instances of this noun are not rare. “And Joseph made ready his chariot” (merkabto) (Gen. 46:29); “in the second chariot” (be-mirkebet) (ib. 41:43); “Pharaoh’s chariots” (markebot) (Exod. 15:4). The following passage especially proves that the Hebrew merkabah denotes a collection of animals: “And a merkabah came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for an hundred and fifty” (1 Kings 10:21). Hence we may learn that mercabah denotes here four horses. Therefore I think that when it was stated, according to the literal sense of the words, that four Ḥayyot (beasts) carry the Throne of Glory, our Sages called this “mercabah” on account of its similarity with the mercabah consisting of four single animals.</p>

Abraham's actions counteract Bilam's curses, Joseph's actions counter Pharaoh's pursuit of Israel, and Abraham's chopping wood parallels the splitting of the sea.

Love upsets one’s usual practice, as it is written: “Abraham awoke early in the morning [and saddled his donkey]…” Did he not have several slaves [who could do this for him]? The explanation is that love upsets one’s usual practice. (Since Abraham was so enthused to fulfill God’s wishes, he did everything himself, including saddling the donkeys, though this was not ordinarily his practice.)  Hatred upsets the natural order, as it is written: “Bilam arose in the morning, and saddled his donkey” (Numbers 22:21). Did he not have several slaves? The explanation is that hatred upsets one’s usual practice. Love upsets the natural order, as it is written: “Joseph harnessed his chariot, and went up toward Israel his father” (Genesis 46:29). Did Joseph not have several slaves? The explanation is that love upsets one’s usual practice. Hatred upsets the natural order, as it is written: “He [Pharaoh] harnessed his chariot” (Exodus 14:6). Did he not have several slaves? The explanation is that hatred upsets one’s usual practice.  Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said: [God said:] ‘Let one saddling come and counteract the other saddling.’ Let the saddling that Abraham our patriarch saddled in order to go and perform the will of the Omnipresent, of Him who spoke and brought the world into being, as it is stated: “Abraham extended his hand [and took the knife to slaughter his son]” (Genesis 22:10), counteract the saddling that Bilam saddled in order to go and curse Israel. (It was in the merit of Abraham’s actions that Bilam’s curses were negated.)  Let the harnessing that Joseph harnessed to greet his father come and counteract the harnessing of Pharaoh to go and pursue Israel. (It was in the merit of Joseph’s actions that Pharaoh’s attack on the Israelites ended in failure.)   Rabbi Yishmael taught: Let the drawn sword that Abraham our patriarch wielded, as it is stated: “Abraham extended his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son” (Genesis 22:10), counteract the drawn sword regarding which Pharaoh said: “I will draw my sword [and my hand will destroy them]” (Exodus 15:9).  “He took his two young men with him” – Rabbi Abahu said: Two people acted with propriety, (It is proper for a man of stature to take two attendants along on a journey. )  Abraham and Saul. Abraham, as it is stated: “He took his two young men with him”; Saul, “he went, and two men with him” (I Samuel 28:8).   “He chopped wood (The Hebrew atzei is in plural, indicating that two logs of wood were split.)  for the burnt offering” – Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosei in the name of Rabbi Meyasha, and some teach it in the name of Rabbi Benaya: In reward for the two choppings [beki’ot] with which Abraham chopped the wood for the burnt offering, he was privileged to have the sea split before the children of Israel, as it is stated: “He chopped [vayvaka] wood for the burnt offering” and it is stated elsewhere: “The water was split [vayibaku]” (Exodus 14:21). Rabbi Levi said [to him]: Enough. Until here. (The derivations regarding saddling and harnessing are valid, but your comparison of chopping wood to the splitting of the sea goes too far.)  Rather, Abraham [acted] according to his ability, and the Holy One blessed be He [acted] according to his ability. (It is improper to draw a comparison between man’s actions and God’s actions.)   “[He] arose, and went to the place” – he was given reward for rising up, and [further] reward for walking.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>There is an additional important allusion in this verse which is seized upon by the Zohar in a different context. Accordingly, the performance of a מצוה enhances the &quot;image&quot; of G–d, whereas when one sins one damages G–d's &quot;image&quot; both in the Celestial Regions and on earth. Man's sins leave noticeable imprints on his face; this is the reason that Isaiah 3,9 speaks of: הכרת פנים ענתה בם, &quot;Their faces reflect their sins. Rabbi Moshe Alshich, commenting on Genesis 45,28: אלכה ואראנו בטרם אמות, &quot;I will go and see him (Joseph) before I die,&quot; writes that Jacob wanted to determine if Joseph had remained loyal to the Abrahamitic tradition by looking at his face. As soon as Jacob looked at Joseph's face (Genesis 46,29) he expressed willingness to die. The Torah phrases this peculiarly when it writes: &quot;After I have seen that you are alive.&quot; At first glance the words &quot;that you are alive&quot; seem superfluous. Jacob indicated by his words that being &quot;alive&quot; in itself was quite meaningless unless Joseph had remained loyal to his father's teachings. Joseph's face reflected G–d's approval, i.e. G–d made Joseph's face light up. One of the ways which result in man's face being illuminated is by means of repentance. When the Jewish people are reminded (Deut. 5,4) that G–d spoke to them פנים אל פנים, &quot;face to face,&quot; this is a compliment telling us that their facial features had undergone a change for the better, and that the ugly lines on their faces reflecting their sinful behavior had been erased. Psalms 42,12 speaks of the hope of the sons of Korach. There is no point in being downcast when repentance can cause us to reflect G–d's salvation on our own face; not only this, but we will simultaneously remove the tarnish caused to G–d's &quot;image&quot; by our own sins. The commandment to appear in the Temple three times a year (16,16), caused our sages in Chagigah 2a to say that the word יראה can be read both passively or actively, i.e. &quot;to be seen&quot; or &quot;to see.&quot; Their message is that if one comes to the Temple with a positive attitude, i.e. in order to &quot;see&quot; G–d, then one will also be positively &quot;seen&quot; by G–d. This also enables us to understand another verse which is generally held to be almost beyond comprehension.</p>

            <summary>The lack of pathos in the reunion of Moshe and Aharon suggests a calm and unambiguous relationship, contrasting with emotional reunions in Genesis that are marked by crying and carrying on due to missed opportunities and mistakes. This emotionally uncomplicated reunion may be attributed to their lack of previous exposure to each other, reflecting a lack of earlier conflict compared to other stories. The wise understand that verbs in the Torah can refer to both distant and proximate agents, with God as the ultimate mover and Moses as the most proximate external cause in certain actions.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>The wise know that a term when used as a verb can refer equally to a distant and a proximate agent, and that these adjectives (distant, proximate) can be understood in varying degrees, both more and less. (1. This refers to Gen. 15:7, “I am the Lord that brought thee out from Ur Kasdim …” which is here interpreted as referring to God acting through intermediate causes. This is similar to Maimonides’ statement in the Guide II:48 affirming that actions are attributed directly to God, even when His will is realized through a natural framework of causes.)  Therefore in saying “act, do, make, create, move, bring forth, write, speak, say, build, destroy, forbid, permit, give, leave, eat, see, hear, remember,” as well as every verb used in any expression, it is correct, necessary, and proper to affirm, absolutely and without qualification, that (such verbs) can refer equally to the nearest agent and the furthest. In the Torah this (affirmation) has reference to the Lord, for He is above all the Separate Intelligences, the Heavenly Spheres, and so much more above earthly matter. (2. On these worlds, and the divine role, see above chap. I.)  (This is the meaning of the verse) “And He made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years,” (3. Num. 32:13.)  meaning that the Lord on high caused the Israelites to move, but (in such a way that) He was necessarily only the distant, prime mover, while Moses was the most proximate external (cause). To this one can add “writes,” “says,” and “speaks” (when attributed to God in the Torah) as well as the other verbs that I may or may not have mentioned. (4. In Ṭirat Kesef (MK I 65) Kaspi writes, “the agent and the one acted on join together, so in several ways the agent is considered as acted upon.” He quotes, “and Joseph made ready his chariot” (Gen. 46:29), where Joseph only issued the command that this be done. So too is “So Solomon built the house” (I Kings 6:14).) </p>

              <p>Similarly, the comparative lack of pathos when Moshe and Aharon reunite after many years of separation (Shemot 4:27) (Shemot 4:27.)  reveals a calm and unambivalent relationship. Absent is the falling on the neck and crying that marks the reunion of brothers and of fathers and sons in the book of Bereshit.Bereshit 33:4; Bereshit 45:14 and Bereshit 46:29 (Bereshit 33:4, 45:14 and 46:29.)  The crying and the carrying on that appear in the other stories are a response to feelings of loss and regret at what could have been. In all of those cases, mistakes had been made and opportunities had been missed. And, as is the way of such situations, the feelings of loss could be fully recognized only after the changes that had taken place in the other person had been observed. This, of course, could occur only at the point of reunion. Unlike the stories in Bereshit, the separation of Moshe and Aharon appears to have been preceded by harmony and a lack of complexity. Thus, whatever missed opportunities elapsed on account of their separation resulted from events outside their control. The outcome of all this was Moshe and Aharon’s emotionally uncomplicated reunion. (The lack of complexity revealed in Moshe and Aharon’s reunion could also be due to the lack of previous exposure to each other, Moshe having grown up largely out of his home. At the same time, that doesn’t negate the fact that their reunion also reflects a lack of earlier conflict in comparison to the other stories.) </p>

              <p>The truth is that most of the time, &quot;falling one another's neck&quot; only is mentioned when there is a kiss, and therefore the text could have mentioned this, along with the weeping, without explicitly mentioning that they kissed; the kiss would have been understood implicitly like Ya'akov and Yosef in Gen. 46:29 (&quot;And Yosef...went up to meet his father...and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while&quot;). In the latter case, Yosef clearly kissed him without it having to be mentioned in the text. It's also possible that in a state of great emotional excitement one would be too wonderstruck and stunned to kiss the other person; perhaps this was the case with Yosef and Ya'akov. However, regarding Ya'akov and Esav there's no doubt that there was no great affection between them, certainly not the type of excitement that would lead to being wonderstruck and stunned.</p>

              <p>BARAITHA. Subordinate your will to the will of Heaven; for so we find that Jacob did not kiss Joseph. GEMARA. Why did he not kiss him? He thought that, since he was away from home, women may have led him astray because of his beauty; as it is written, And he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck. (Gen. 46, 29, which does not mention Jacob kissing his son.)  [Joseph] wanted to kiss him but he would not let him do so, as it is written, And he wept on his neck a good while. (ibid., a good while is explained that Joseph kept on weeping but Jacob still did not kiss him.)  That is to say, he [only] kissed him when he died, as it is written, And wept upon him, and kissed him. (ibid. L, 1.)  Joseph said, ‘Thirty-nine years have [passed] before him (i.e. it was thirty-nine years since Joseph left home. As Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years (ibid. XLVII, 28), Joseph must have been separated from his father twenty-two years.)  and I have not kissed my father’s mouth, and now shall I bury him without kissing him?’ That is the meaning of what is written, And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons and said: Who are these? (ibid. XLVIII, 8.)  Did he not know until then who they were? But [Jacob] inquired of him whether they had been born in wedlock, (lit. ‘with a kethubah’, i.e. according to the Hebrew marriage law.)  and when he showed him the kethubah his mind became at rest and he kissed them for the sake of Joseph. Raba said: Infer from this that [Joseph] was aroused sexually by her; (viz. Potiphar’s wife (ibid. XXXIX, 7ff), otherwise Jacob would not have doubted Joseph’s moral purity.)  for should you say that he was not aroused by her, it has been taught: (B.M. 83b (Sonc. ed., pp. 478f.). The reference is to the story of R. Eleazar b. Simeon, who had a man arrested because of his insolence towards him and subsequently hanged. R. Eleazar regretted his action, but was assured by his disciples that the man must have been guilty of a capital crime. On hearing this, he felt relieved and reassured that his own body would not decompose after his death.)  He laid his hand upon his heart (lit. ‘his inwards’, and similarly in the continuation.)  and exclaimed, ‘Rejoice my heart, rejoice my heart! If matters about which you are doubtful are so, (i.e. seem to be just. He was doubtful whether the man deserved hanging.)  how much more those about which you are certain! I am confident that neither worms nor decay will have power over you’. He applied to himself the verse, My flesh also dwelleth in safety. (Ps. 16, 9.)  Now he (viz. R. Eleazar; and yet he felt assured that the worms would have no power over his body.)  is not mentioned among those [over whom the worms have no dominion], (Cf. B.B. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 86): ‘There are seven over whom the worms had no dominion, viz. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Miriam, and Benjamin, son of Jacob’.)  how much more so Jacob who is mentioned! (How could Jacob then doubt the innocence of Joseph, seeing that the sin of suspecting the innocent would have lost him that privilege?)  Therefore [we must say] that Jacob held back from kissing Joseph because of what he saw by means of the Holy Spirit. (He was inspired by God to do so in order that Joseph should not communicate her moral impurity to him.)  And where is this (Joseph’s moral impurity.)  alluded to? As it is written, But his (i.e. Joseph’s.)  bow abode firm; (Gen. 49, 24. The word bow is found in both the passages cited. On the exegetical rule of Gezerah Shawah, inference from analogous phraseology, what applies to one applies also to the other. In Hab. the bow is described as being bare, ‘eryah, which is equated with ‘erwah, ‘forbidden intercourse’. Consequently the use of bow in connection with Joseph indicates that there was an occasion when he was aroused sinfully.)  and it is written there, Thy bow is made quite bare. (Hab. 3, 9. The Heb. maṭṭeh can mean ‘rod’ or ‘tribe’. The Rabbinic interpretation is that God swore to Jacob that the tribes descended from him would be pure.)  What caused him to be saved? Sworn are the rods of the word. Selah. What is the meaning of Selah? (The word. Selah is by a process of analogy equated with the words the God of Jacob … Selah; that is to say, the word sworn by the God of Jacob to him.)  It is to be taken in the sense of The God of Jacob … Selah. (Ps. 46, 12.)  It was quoted in refutation, And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him (Gen. 29, 13.) —is not this a case where an inference from minor to major is to be drawn? If of Laban who kissed idols and harlots it is so written, (That he kissed Jacob.)  Joseph who did not kiss these [yet did not kiss Jacob]! Perhaps the verse should not have written this, but it points to Jacob’s merit. [It indicates,] And he [Laban] ran to meet him, i.e. he wanted to kiss him but [Jacob] would not permit him; he then embraced him again to kiss him, whereupon he struck [Laban] on his cheek. This may be proved from the fact that it is written wayyenashsheḳ (There are two Heb. roots with the same letters, one meaning ‘to kiss’ and the other ‘to be equipped with weapons’, and the verb in the verse is given the second sense, i.e. he attacked him.)  and not wayyishshaḳ. Hence it is proved; here it is written, And he kissed them (Gen. 48, 10, where the verb is wayyishshaḳ and denotes an expression of love.)  and [continues], And embraced them. What is the difference between wayyishshaḳ and wayyenashsheḳ? The latter (Which is an intensive form of the verb.)  indicates [kissing] with the whole body, the former [only] with the mouth. Whence do we know that this is so? For it is written, He kisses [yishshaḳ] the lips that giveth a right answer. (Prov. 24, 26.)  Wherever wayyishshaḳ occurs it denotes a [light] impress to be added to the count. (A single gesture which may form part of a further display of affection subsequently.)  Come and hear: [It is stated,] And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him. (Gen. 33, 4, the verb being wayyishshaḳ.)  Is not this [act of kissing] similar to what Laban did? The reply is: Go and see how many teeth were dug into him. (In the Heb. text the word has dots over the letters, which are taken by the Midrash to indicate that Esau’s real intention was to bite Jacob. [Cf. ARN, p. 165.])  And why? Because he [really] wanted to bite him, but at the time his teeth became as [soft as] wax and he knocked his jaws against Jacob’s neck and became weak. To that episode David alluded when he said, Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God; for Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek, Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. (Ps. 3, 8.) </p>

        <summary>Jacob was relieved to see Joseph alive, allowing him to die in peace without facing two deaths as he previously feared. The reunion brought Jacob a sense of fulfillment, highlighting Joseph's importance in the family. The Torah emphasizes Joseph's righteousness and spiritual unity with his brothers, despite his mistreatment and different life experiences. Jacob's words to Joseph are seen as a message against succumbing to the temptations of prosperity in the Second Temple commentary. Israel finds comfort in knowing he can die as the righteous do after reuniting with Joseph in the Targum.</summary>

              <p>Another part of this verse which needs analysis is why Jacob added the words כי עודך חי, &quot;that you are still alive.&quot; If Joseph had not been alive how could Jacob have expressed his joy at seeing him? Besides, why did Jacob not make this statement when the brothers had told him that Joseph was still alive in 45,26?</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Actually Jacob had now reassured himself about something that the brothers could not have told him at the time. He had been satisfied that Joseph was alive, well and powerful; he had not yet been certain that in view of all the experiences Joseph had undergone both as a slave and subsequently as a powerful ruler, that he had been able to preserve his righteousness. Jacob himself had experienced a loss of the presence of Holy Spirit at the time he had mistakenly exclaimed that Joseph had been devoured by a wild beast. He naturally was afraid that Joseph too had been cut off from such Holy Spirit seeing he had lived in close contact with people who represented the קליפה, the personification of impurity. It is a well known fact that the righteous prefer the disappearance of a son to such a son embarassing them by abandoning his spiritual heritage. It was only when he set eyes on Joseph that he realised that Joseph had not changed. We have numerous examples in the Bible of righteous people being able to tell by merely looking at the faces of people that such people were upright and righteous. This is why Jacob was able to say אחרי ראותי את פניך, &quot;after having seen your face.&quot; Jacob was now able to accept death without regret whenever it would occur. Berachot 18 mentions that the righteous are called חיים, alive, during their lifetime. Jacob expressed this thought when he called Joseph as &quot;still alive&quot; after having set eyes on him.</p>

Now, since you are alive I will die only once, in this world (Midrash Tanchuma, Vayigash 9).</p>

I died long ago, when they brought me your shirt, my soul left me. I was as if dead, but now since I have seen you alive, I am alive again. Therefore, I can die when my time will come (Toldot Yizhak, Genesis, 46:30.) </p>

            <summary>Jacob feared he would die a wicked man in both worlds when he thought Joseph was dead, but was relieved when he saw him alive. The patriarchs all requested not to be buried in Egypt to avoid idolatry and to ensure redemption for the Egyptians. The Land of Israel is seen as the land of the living, where the dead will come to life first in the messianic era. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yoshiya had specific requests for their burials to avoid embarrassment or to show their readiness to meet their Creator. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi's pain in his teeth coincided with a lack of childbirth or miscarriages in the Land of Israel, and he was healed by Elijah in disguise.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>“He called his son, Joseph” – why did he not call Reuben or Judah? Reuben was the firstborn and Judah was the king, but he disregarded them and called Joseph. Why did he do so? Because [Joseph] had the capability to carry out [his request]. That is why “he called his son, Joseph” – because the hour was given to him. (He was in power at the time. )  “Please do not bury me in Egypt” – it is for your sake I descended to Egypt; it is for your sake that I said: “Now I can die” (Genesis 46:30).   “Perform kindness and truth with me” – is there kindness of falsehood, that he says “kindness and truth”? Why [did he say] so? The folk saying says: If the son of your friend dies, bear with him. (This is because he can repay the kindness.)  If your friend dies, cast off. (Cast off sorrow, because he cannot repay the kindness.)  He said to him: ‘If you perform kindness for me after my death, it is a true kindness.’   “Please do not bury me in Egypt” – why? Because the ultimate fate of the land of Egypt is to be stricken with lice, and they will swarm in my body. That is why “please do not bury me in Egypt.”  Another matter, for what reason did Jacob request not to be buried in Egypt? It was so they would not make him the subject of idolatrous worship, for just as punishment is exacted from one who worships, so is punishment exacted from the one who is worshipped, as it is written: “Against all the gods of Egypt I will administer punishments: I am the Lord” (Exodus 12:12). Likewise you find regarding Daniel, once he interpreted Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, what is written? “Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and he prostrated himself to Daniel, and said to pour out to him a meal offering and fragrances” (Daniel 2:46). But Daniel did not accept it. Why? Because just as punishment is exacted from those who worship idols, so is punishment exacted from it. (From the subject of such worship. )  Likewise you find regarding Ḥiram. Once he made himself into a god, what was his ultimate fate? It is written in his regard: “Because your heart became haughty, and you said: I am a god” (Ezekiel 28:2) – the Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Behold, you are wiser than Daniel” (Ezekiel 28:3). Nebuchadnezzar sought to sacrifice to him, but he did not want it, and you make yourself a god? What was his ultimate fate? “I cast you upon the ground, I placed you before kings that they may gaze upon you” (Ezekiel 28:17).  Another matter, Jacob said: ‘So that the Egyptians will not merit redemption because of me. They prostrate themselves to a lamb, and I was likened to a lamb, as it is stated: “Israel is a scattered lamb” (Jeremiah 50:17), and regarding Egypt it is written: “Whose flesh is the flesh of donkeys” (Ezekiel 23:20), and it is written: “The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb”’ (Exodus 34:20). That is, “please do not bury me in Egypt.”  Why did all the patriarchs demand and have fondness for burial in the Land of Israel? Rabbi Elazar said: These are cryptic matters. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What are these “cryptic matters”? “I walk before the Lord in the land of the living” (Psalms 116:9). (The Land of Israel is the “land of the living.”)  Our Rabbis said two matters in the name of Rabbi Ḥelbo: Why did the patriarchs have fondness for burial in the Land of Israel? Because the dead of the Land of Israel come to life first in the messianic era, and enjoy the messianic years.  Rabbi Ḥanina said: One who dies outside of the Land of Israel and is buried there, has undergone two deaths, (Death and burial.)  as so it is written: “And you, Pashḥur, and all the dwellers in your house, will go into captivity, and to Babylon you will come, and there you will die, and there you will be buried” (Jeremiah 20:6). That is, he has undergone two deaths. That is why Jacob says to Joseph: “Please do not bury me in Egypt.”  Rabbi Simon said: If so, the righteous who are buried outside of the Land of Israel suffer a loss. What, then, does the Holy One blessed be He do? He makes tunnels in the ground for them and makes them like channels, and they roll along until they reach the Land of Israel. The Holy One blessed be He then places in them a spirit of life and they arise. From where is this derived? It is written: “Behold, I am opening your graves, and I will take you up from your graves, My people, and I will bring you to the soil of Israel” (Ezekiel 37:12), and then: “I will place My spirit into you and you will live” (Ezekiel 37:14). Reish Lakish said: It is an explicit verse, that once they reach the Land of Israel, the Holy One blessed be He will place a soul in them, as it is stated: “Who places a soul in the people upon it” (Isaiah 42:5).  There was an incident involving Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] and Rabbi Eliezer, who were walking near the gates outside Tiberias. They saw the coffin of a dead person who came from outside of the Land of Israel to be buried in the Land of Israel. Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] said to Rabbi Eliezer: ‘What has this one, whose soul departed outside of the Land of Israel and came to be buried in the Land of Israel, accomplished? I read in his regard: “My inheritance you rendered an abomination” (Jeremiah 2:7) during your lifetime, “and you came, and you defiled My land” (Jeremiah 2:7) after your death.’ [Rabbi Eliezer] said to him: ‘Once he is buried in the Land of Israel, the Holy One blessed be He grants him atonement, as it is written: “His earth will atone for his people”’ (Deuteronomy 32:43).  Rabbi Yoḥanan, when he was departing from the world, said to those who needed to tend to him: ‘Bury me in garments dyed green, not white and not black, so if I stand among the righteous we will not be shamed, and if I stand among the wicked we will not be disgraced.’ (Rabbi Yoḥanan was not sure if he would be summoned with the righteous, who appear in white, or the wicked, who appear in black. He therefore asked to be buried in a different color so as to avoid a situation in which he was dressed in white but summoned with the wicked, which would be embarrassing, or a situation in which he was dressed in black but summoned with the righteous, which might appear as a distortion of Divine justice.)   Rabbi Yoshiya, when he was departing from the world, said to those who were standing over him: ‘Summon my disciples.’ He said to them: ‘Bury me in white garments. Why? Because I am not ashamed to greet my Creator because of my actions.’   Rabbenu, (Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.)  when he was departing from the world, commanded three matters: ‘Do not move my widow from my house. Do not eulogize me in the towns in the Land of Israel. And do not allow a gentile to touch my bier; rather, let he who tended to me during my lifetime tend to me after my death.’   During his lifetime, he resided in Tzippori seventeen years, and he would read in his regard: “Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years,” and Yehuda lived in Tzippori seventeen years. Rabbenu suffered from pain in his teeth for thirteen years, and all those thirteen years, no woman died in childbirth in the Land of Israel and no woman miscarried in the Land of Israel. After thirteen years, Rabbenu became angry at Rabbi Ḥiyya HaGadol. Elijah, of blessed memory, came to Rabbenu in the guise of Rabbi Ḥiyya, placed his hand on his tooth, and he was immediately healed. On the next day, Rabbi Ḥiyya came to him. He said to him: ‘Rabbi, that tooth of yours, what is its condition?’ He said: ‘From the moment you came to me yesterday, it was healed.’ At that moment, Rabbi Ḥiyya said: ‘Woe unto you, birthing mothers in the Land of Israel. Woe unto you, pregnant women in the Land of Israel.’ Nevertheless, he said to him: ‘It was not I who placed a hand on your tooth.’ Rabbenu knew that it had been Elijah of blessed memory. From that moment, Rabbi began treating Rabbi Ḥiyya with honor.</p>

              <p>(Gen. 37:35:) NO, I WILL GO DOWN MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL. What is the meaning of MOURNING TO … SHEOL? Perhaps I shall die the death of the wicked in this world and in the world to come. Why? Because the Holy One had promised to give me twelve tribes, and here one of them is dead. Perhaps I was not worthy of them, and I am to die in both worlds. (The midrash regards Jacob’s mourning as the equivalent of dying in the present world and his descent to Sheol as a second death.)  For this reason he said (in vs. 35): NO, I WILL GO DOWN MOURNING TO MY SON IN SHEOL. Do you want to know what he said when he saw that he was alive? (Gen. 46:30:) THEN ISRAEL SAID UNTO JOSEPH: NOW LET ME DIE. What was the reason for him to say: NOW LET ME DIE? He simply said: When they came and told me Joseph was dead, I said: I was to die in both worlds. Now that I have seen that you are alive, I am receiving the good news that I am only dying one time.

Isaac likewise sought death, as is said: That I may eat, and bless thee before the Lord before my death (ibid. 35:29). Similarly, Jacob asked for death, as is said: Now let me die (ibid. 46:30). The Holy One, blessed be He, told him: You have said: Now let me die, but you will live seventeen additional years. After that time had passed he became ill and died.</p>

The Holy One, blessed be He, promised me twelve tribes, and now one of them has been torn asunder. Perhaps I was not worthy of them, and I shall perish in both worlds.” That is why he said: I will go down to the grave to my son mourning. You know this to be so from the fact that when he saw that Joseph was alive, he exclaimed: Now let me die (Gen. 46:30). When did he say Now let me die? He said to himself: “When my sons came to me, and told me that Joseph was dead, I cried out: ‘I am destined to die twice,’ but now that I see that you are alive, I am assured that I did not die, but only now will I die.” Hence he said: Now let me die.</p>

                <h4>Or HaChaim on Exodus 1:5:3</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Perhaps the Torah wants to put Joseph and family on a par with the other members of Jacob's family who descended to Egypt at the invitation of Pharaoh and Joseph by phrasing it thus: כל נפש…ויוסף היה במצרים, &quot;all the persons …including Joseph who happened to be in Egypt already at that time.&quot; They were all righteous though some had been born in Egypt, etc. The Torah uses the word נפש for persons in the singular to show that they all formed a single spiritual unit. This is a tremendous compliment for Joseph whose life-experience was so totally different from that of his brothers and who had been mistreated by them. The Torah testified that Joseph was in no way less of an Israelite or part of the common heritage than his brothers who had remained in the land of Canaan all these years. If anything, Joseph was the prime example that given the proper strength of character, one could maintain one's spiritual integrity even after having lived in Egypt for many years and having occupied a position of power and prominence in that society. I have already mentioned this aspect of Joseph when I explained why Jacob was willing to die happy the moment he had made visual contact with Joseph in Genesis 46,30.</p>

A marvellous utterance, which has travelled beyond the range of the common life which we lead, we who if we but catch a puff of the air of prosperity loosen every reef and let the breeze blow fresh and clear, and then with our strong steady wind to swell our canvas speed on to the enjoyments of the passions, and never do we draw in the loose and slack licence of our lusts until we strike the rocks and wreck the whole bark of the soul.</p>

Unsere Väter sollten sich in Goschen ansiedeln, weil diese Provinz dem ganzen Zentralleben Ägyptens entlegen war. &quot;Wenn das so weiter geht&quot;; spricht der spätere Pharao, &quot;und sie sich so vermehren, so werden sie bei erster Gelegenheit aus ihrer Provinz, in die sie jetzt eingepfercht sind, heraufkommen und wir werden uns vor Juden nicht retten können&quot;.

              <p>“I will go up and tell the news to Pharaoh” [46:31]. Joseph said to his brothers. I will go to Pharaoh and will tell him that my brothers and father have come. When Pharaoh will ask you, what kind of artisans are you, you should say that you have flocks in the field and your parents were also shepherds. Tell him also that you have many flocks and therefore have no other work. Hizkuni writes here. Joseph told them to say that they were shepherds, expecting that Pharaoh should denigrate them. They caused Joseph to be mute before Pharaoh, that Joseph became insignificant before Pharaoh. Therefore Joseph told the brothers to say that they are shepherds, that is, insignificant. Rashi writes that Joseph told them that they should say that they were shepherds because the Egyptians worship the sheep and consider it an idol. Therefore, the Egyptians hate shepherds. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 46:34.)  Here one asks a question. Why do they hate the shepherds? On the contrary, they should love those who watch over the sheep because they do good things for the sheep and watch over them that they should have food and water. The explanation is that sometimes they sheep go astray and the shepherd must hit them. That is why they hate those who hit their idols. Another explanation is that they therefore hate shepherds because the one who watches over them knows what the sheep are and does not worship them. (Imre Noam, Genesis, 46:34.) </p>

              <p>והאנשים רועי צאן, “and the men are shepherds of flocks.” Joseph meant that they were self-employed and had minded their own flocks. In order to make doubly sure that Pharaoh should not misunderstand and think that his brothers worked as employees for others, he added: “for they have been cattlemen.” They were very wealthy. If they had chosen this vocation of their fathers before them, they were motivated by two considerations. 1) It was a very profitable vocation. They reaped the wool of the sheep, the milk, the young animals, etc. It is a vocation which does not require a great deal of physical labor and does not tempt those who pursue it to commit sins, dishonest business practices, etc.. Solomon already said in Proverbs 27,23: “make sure that you know the looks of your flock; pay attention to the herds.” 2) Seeing the brothers were aware of the prophecy that when the time came they would be exiled in Egypt and they were aware that the Egyptians worshipped the ram in the zodiac, they chose this vocation in order that their descendants would be familiar with sheep and the limitations of such animals. This would be an antidote to the temptation to deify sheep. When you examine Scriptures you will find that a majority of the righteous people of whom the Torah tells us were shepherds. Hevel, Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, Moses, the prophet Samuel, King Saul prior to his election as king, as well as David, all practiced this vocation. They used this as an excuse to separate themselves from urban centers as they realized that most sins are the direct result of people living together in urban centers. A rural life, relatively lonely, keeps one from most of the temptations offered in the city. It reduces one’s opportunity to engage in slander, libel, petty thievery, violence, etc.. Compare what happened to Lot after he began to associate with the city dwellers of Sodom. He was forced to flee Sodom, leaving all his wealth behind in order not to become killed by association with the sinners of that city. He absorbed his lesson and henceforth resided on a mountain, far from an urban society. He had taken temporary refuge in Tzoar, citing the fact that that town was of recent origin as proof that they could not yet have become too guilty in the eyes of the Lord (Genesis 19,20). Even this fact did not persuade him to settle there but he moved to a mountain preferring the isolation of the mountain to associating with sinners.  Another advantage to living in isolation on a mountain is that such isolation enables one to better concentrate on one’s Creator and, if one has attained the proper degree of spiritual preparation, to qualify for prophecy, for a communication from G’d. Most major prophets practiced living in isolation for long periods of time, not even engaging in tending sheep. Examples are Elijah and Elisha. Of Elisha we read in Kings I 19,19 that “12 yokes of oxen were ahead of him.” This means that he had already given up his vocation of tending the oxen and had withdrawn from them. This is what Jeremiah meant when he wrote there in verse 20 that Elisha asked permission from Elijah “to let me kiss my father and mother good-by, and I will follow you.” At the end of verse 21 we are told: “Then he arose and followed Elijah and became his attendant.”</p>

It is only that their wealth consists of cattle. This is the sense of the expression, they have been keepers of cattle, and had wealth, and a very great household (Job 1:3.)  by virtue of the great multitude of cattle which they possessed.

The aversion of the Egyptians towards the Jews' professions helped protect the Jewish people from assimilation and moral decline. Joseph highlighted this uncomfortable truth to ensure that the Jews were given a separate province to live in. When Pharaoh asked about their occupation, it was a way to ensure their distinctiveness and preservation as a people.</summary>

Auch sie sollten auf Pharaos Frage ungescheut diese unangenehme Wahrheit hervorkehren; denn der nicht zu umgehende Abscheu der Ägypter vor ihrem Berufe war, wie überhaupt die Abneigung der Völker gegen die Juden, das erste Erhaltungsmittel dieses zum isolierten Gange durch die Zeiten bestimmten Menschenstammes. Bis zum geistig sittlichen Morgen der Völker schützten die Pallisaden, die der Wahn der Völker gegen die Juden errichtete, diese vor jeder Ansteckung durch die Barbarei und Entsittlichung der Menschen, in deren Mitte sie Jahrhunderte hinab zu wandeln haben sollten. Deshalb kehrte auch hier Josef sofort die den Ägyptern unangenehme Seite hervor, in der ausgesprochenen Absicht, damit sie dadurch eine gesonderte Provinz zum Wohnplatz eingeräumt erhielten.</p>

The Torah's command to sacrifice animals was meant to counter false principles and demonstrate God's superiority over Egyptian deities. The division between Israelite and Egyptian cattle during the plague in Egypt prevented the spread of pestilence. The rejection of shepherds by the Egyptians and the sacrifice of virtues as offerings are symbolic of the conflict between virtue and passion.

The reason they did so was because they hated sheep meat, i.e. mutton, just as they hated goats’ meat. This was something not unique to the Egyptians. This is also why they could not sit at the same table as the Hebrews when the latter were being served lamb. They harboured a deep aversion for anyone stemming from the Euphrates-Tigris region. They considered the Sumerians as a lower class of human beings. (Exodus 8,9) The Hebrews claimed that they would insult the Egyptians if they slaughtered their animals as service to their G–d inside the boundaries of the land of Egypt. They would risk being stoned by them. It is interesting that they did not refer to being just killed, but they spelled out by which method they would be killed, a method which in Jewish law is the most severe kind of death penalty. Our author states that he has also heard a different interpretation of our verse. The Egyptians considered anyone slaughtering sheep or goats and eating their meat as guilty of the kind of perversion that would stamp such a person as a subhuman species. We find the word רועה, which we normally translate as “tending,” i.e. shepherding, also used by the Targum for “providing food” (transitive) on Genesis 48,15 by Yaakov in his blessings for his children when on his deathbed.</p>

    Some commentators, on the contrary, consider that the Egyptians especially esteemed cattle men and men raising sheep as it would not make sense that Joseph should present his brothers before Pharaoh in a manner which would make him despise them. The reason that Pharaoh assigned the province of Goshen for them to dwell in was precisely because he considered them a very valuable asset to the Egyptian economy so that they deserved to live in the economically most prosperous part of the country. The word תועבה, abomination, does not refer to the brothers’ vocation, but to the deities whom the Egyptians worshipped.

              <p>Scripture tells us, according to the Version of Onkelos, that the Egyptians worshipped Aries, and therefore abstained from killing sheep, and held shepherds in contempt. Comp. “Behold we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians,” etc. (Exod. 8:26); “For every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians” (Gen. 46:34). Some sects among the Sabeans worshipped demons, and imagined that these assumed the form of goats, and called them therefore “goats” [se‘irim]. This worship was widespread. Comp. “And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto demons, after whom they have gone a whoring” (Lev. 17:7). For this reason those sects abstained from eating goats’ flesh. Most idolaters objected to killing cattle, holding this species of animals in great estimation. Therefore the people of Hodu [Indians] up to this day do not slaughter cattle even in those countries where other animals are slaughtered. In order to eradicate these false principles, the Law commands us to offer sacrifices only of these three kinds: “Ye shall bring your offering of the cattle [viz.], of the herd and of the flock” (Lev. 1:2). Thus the very act which is considered by the heathen as the greatest crime, is the means of approaching God, and obtaining His pardon for our sins. In this manner, evil principles, the diseases of the human soul, are cured by other principles which are diametrically opposite.</p>

              <p>The zodiac sign of the lamb is the first of the twelve zodiac signs and represents the senior power to which G–d delegated a variety of such functions. It was this symbol which had to be slaughtered to drive home the point that without the consent of G–d it represented impotence instead of power. Since the Egyptians had made it a symbol of their שר, counterpart in the Celestial Regions, it had to be slaughtered by the Jews. For the same reason it was important that the redemption take place in the month of the ascendancy of that sign, and on the day that symbolised the zenith of its orbit, i.e. its power at its supposedly strongest. The Torah's explanation in Genesis 46,34, that any shepherd was an abomination to the Egyptians is logical. The mere suggestion that sheep needed human guardians -when they were viewed as a supreme deity- is an insult to their religion. When G–d said: החודש הזה לכם, &quot;This month is for you,&quot; it is an announcement that Israel would be redeemed during the month of Nissan. G–d commanded that the lamb be taken in order to slaughter it and to humiliate by this single act the entire system upon which the Egyptians had built their position in this world. G–d performed judgments on the sheep, on the Egyptian deities, to demonstrate that He is not only a deity (like others, i.e. אלוקים) but that He is י-ה-ו-ה.</p>

              <p>Nachmanides writes that the reason the Torah mentions the word בשדה in connection with the cattle is that the Egyptians kept their cattle outdoors on a permanent basis. The reason was that shepherds of cattle were considered an abomination in Egypt (compare Genesis 46,34). These cattle were grazing far from Egypt proper, on the border of the province of Goshen, so that the cattle of the Israelites and that of the Egyptians intermingled. The fact that none of the Israelites’ cattle were affected by the plague was therefore all the more remarkable. Another reason why this was remarkable could have been that the bacteria causing the plague came from the same airspace so that it could have been expected to affect all the animals in equal measure</p>

              </summary>
              <p>In the third section of Moreh Nevuchim chapter 32, item 47 Maimonides writes concerning the reason behind the animal sacrifice legislation that the Torah wanted to uproot pagan practices amongst the Jewish people and that by sublimating the animal sacrifice ritual this could be achieved. The most important part of the legislation was that instead of sacrifices of living creatures being offered to idolatrous forces in temples dedicated to forces of nature, the Jew would learn to dedicate all he had to dedicate to the one and only G’d. The idolaters had imagined that by what they were doing they could reinforce the power of their respective horoscopes by offering their sacrifices to them and that in turn their horoscopes would bestow their largess upon them or at least protect them against harmful influences.  When the Egyptians worshipped the image of a sheep they did so in the knowledge that the horoscope of the sheep was of great influence in the celestial regions. They felt that the blessings bestowed on earth by means of flocks originated with that zodiac sign. It was generally perceived that essential food products such as milk, butter, etc., were all the “gift” of zodiac signs in the celestial regions. If the Egyptians did not want to be shepherds (compare Genesis 46,34), this was because they felt that acting as if they owned their “gods” was an insult to these gods who they perceived of as being the providers of their essential foodstuffs.  What applied to the Egyptians and their sheep applied to the Chaldaens and their attitude to cattle. They perceived the zodiac sign of the ox to be the source responsible for their food-supply. As a result they forbade that cattle be slaughtered, and abstained from eating beef. Indians still cling to such beliefs today and do not slaughter cows, (hence the expression “holy cow.”) This is why G’d commanded that just these species be sacrificed to G’d. This is why the Torah commenced the section dealing with animal sacrifice by referring to a person’s desire to offer מן הבקר ומן הצאן, “from the cattle or the flock” (1,2). The Torah wanted to let us know that these species were considered as so important in determining the fates of the heathens of those days. Henceforth, these very species would be featured in obtaining forgiveness for the trespasses committed by the Jewish people unintentionally. Faulty philosophies, i.e. religious beliefs, can be forgiven only when one reverses course. By dedicating the very thing one used to dedicate to idolatrous causes to a sacred cause approved by G’d, or better still, commanded by G’d, atonement for one’s former errors becomes possible. Diseases of the body are healed, i.e. reversed, when the balance of the body is restored by the person suffering from the disease reversing course, i.e. negating intake of what brought on the disease, etc. The same is true for spiritual imbalances which resulted in idolatrous philosophies. The Torah’s principal concern is the combating of false philosophies, false perceptions of who rules the universe and who has created it. This is why such sacrifices became “a fire-offering of pleasant odour to the Lord.” When the people unite in order to serve the Lord instead of idols, they thereby strengthen the unity of G’d. Idolatry, by definition, is the opposite of unity, in particular of the concept of the unity of G’d. This is the approach of Maimonides and his followers to the subject of animal sacrifice.  However much one might be tempted to accept Maimonides’ theory, the fact remains that righteous people long before the Torah had been given were in the habit of offering animal sacrifices not to idols- but to the one and only G’d. All of this preceded the times when idolatrous practices were introduced. Adam offered animal sacrifices (Chulin 60); Hevel, his son, also offered sheep, i.e. animal sacrifices (Genesis 4,4). Noach and his sons offered numerous animal sacrifices as thanksgiving after the deluge from which they had been saved (Genesis 8,21). G’d is on record as responding to these sacrifices by describing them as ריח ניחוח, “pleasant smelling odour.” All this occurred long before there were any Egyptians or Chaldaens.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>THEN MOSES CALLED FOR ALL THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL, AND SAID UNTO THEM: DRAW OUT, AND TAKE YOU LAMBS ACCORDING TO YOUR FAMILIES AND SLAUGHTER THE PASSOVER. This chapter shortens the account of how the laws which G-d had commanded Moses, as stated in the section above, [were communicated by him to Israel], as it is self-understood that Moses related all the laws to Israel in detail and taught them the matter involved, it being included in the verse, As the Eternal hath commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. (Verse 28.)  Instead, Scripture mentioned this section in a general way, saying that Moses called for all the elders of Israel and they gathered together to him all the people. Then they [the elders] (So explained later on in the text, and so clearly rendered in the Tur: “Moses called for all the elders of Israel and they gathered together to him all the people, and then they themselves said to the whole congregation of Israel, Draw out, and take you lambs, etc.”)  said to the whole congregation of Israel, “Draw out the sheep from the flock to your homes, and keep it there from the tenth day of the month [till the fourteenth, when it is to be slaughtered as the Passover-offering].” It is possible that Scripture used the word, mishchu (draw out), because their sheep were very far from them in the land of Goshen, for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians. (Genesis 46:34.)  It said, and take you, meaning “take the lambs according to your families,” every man a lamb, according to their fathers’ houses, (Above, Verse 3.)  and slaughter the Passover lamb (Verse 21 before us.)  at eventide, (Above, Verse 6.)  all in accordance with what has been explained above concerning this commandment. Now we read in the Mechilta: (Mechilta on the verse before us. See above, Note 205.)  “Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel. This teaches us that he constituted them a court. (The teaching is derived from the word z’keinim (the elders), “and zakein denotes only one who has acquired wisdom” (Kiddushin 32 b). See Ramban above, Verse 2, that “elders” are needed for the Sanctification of the New Moon, as mentioned in the section above, and hence Moses constituted them a court.)  And he said unto them. The word came from the mouth of Moses, saying it to all Israel. (According to this opinion of Rabbi Yashiya, the court of the elders was constituted only for the Sanctification of the New Moon, and then after the elders gathered the people by command of Moses, he himself said to the people, Draw out, etc.)  These are the words of Rabbi Yashiya. Rabbi Yonathan says that the word came out from the mouth of Moses saying it to the elders, and the elders saying it to all Israel.” Thus according to Rabbi Yashiya, the expression, Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, means that he told them to gather together to him all the people, [and he himself told the people all the laws of the Passover mentioned above], as I have explained. But according to the opinion of Rabbi Yonathan, the elders related it to the assembly. Accordingly, the verse stating, Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, (Above, Verse 3.)  refers [not to Moses and Aaron mentioned in the two verses there above, but] to the elders that were assembled before [Moses and Aaron, and they — the elders — spoke to the congregation], as is also the purport of the verse, Then it shall be, if it be done in error by ‘the eyes of the congregation,’ (Numbers 15:24.)  [which is a reference to the elders of the congregation, members of the Court].</p>

              <p>BEHOLD, THE HAND OF THE ETERNAL IS UPON THY CATTLE WHICH ARE IN THE FIELD. Scripture speaks of the ordinary custom that most cattle are in the field, but the plague was also upon the cattle in the houses, just as it is said, And all the cattle of Egypt died. (Verse 6.)  It is possible that because every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians, (Genesis 46:34.)  the Egyptians removed the cattle from the cities except for the use of horses for riding and asses for loading. Thus the cattle were located far from Egypt, grazing in the fields bordering upon Goshen, and in those pastures the cattle of the Egyptians and of the Israelites would intermingle. Therefore it was necessary that it be said, And the Eternal shall make a division between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt. (Verse 4.)  It may be that the division was necessary because since the pestilence was caused by the change of air, it should naturally spread over the whole district, [affecting the cattle of the Israelites as well], but G-d dealt wondrously with them. (See Joel 2:26.) </p>

              <p>The Hebrew midwives - the understanding of our sages, o blessed memory, and Onkelos, and Rashbam, and Ramban and Ra&quot;z is that those midwives were from the seed of Israel, and the understanding of the Alexandrian translator, and[Eusebius Sophronius] Hieronymos, and Yoseohus Flavius, and Don Itzchak [Abrabanel] is that they were Egyptian, these midvives of the Hebrews. And this is right, since how does it make any sense that [Pharaoh] would order Jewish women to destroy all the children of their own people and believe that they won't reveal such a thing? And [Philiphus] Klericus affirms that if they were not Jewish the text should have read &quot;midwives to the Hebrews&quot;. And the Ra&quot;z comes and says that it should read &quot;the midwives that served the Hebrews&quot; - and this has no standing, since the text could have said &quot;the midwives that served the Hebrews&quot; by omitting the word 'et' as it does in (Jer. 31:29) &quot;every man that eats  sour grapes&quot;. And what is proved by the phrase 'the midwives feared God' is no proof at all, since it is not written here Hashem, rather, E-lohim, and everyone who has a god (a God of truth or a god of falsehood) would fear killing babies that did not sin at all, whatever people they are from. And an example of this is what is said regarding Amalek 'and he attacked you in the rear, and you were tired and exhausted, and he did not fear E-lohim' (Deu. 25:18) and my dear student, R. Yaakov Chay Pardo, may the tzadik's memory bring blessings to us, adds that if they were from another people it made more sense to say they did this out of fear and not of love, since if they were Jewish what need would there be to remind us that they feared God, since all humans love the children of their own people. Also, what they point out that the names Shifra and Puah are not Egyptian, but come from Hebrew roots, this is not relevant, since they would come from the Land of Goshen, that is closer to the land of Israel (see Gen. 46:34), and it is possible that they just spoke a language closer to Hebrew like Cannanite, and so their names would be closer to Hebrew and Cannanite. And another thing that is clear is that for a people that is &quot;many and strong&quot;  makes no sense to have only those two midwives, and so Rabbi Ibn Ezra and (and after him the Ra'z) says that those two were the supervisors of the all the midwives; and Rabbi Ovadia Sforno says that Pharaoh talked first to the midwives of his city, and after them not doing his bidding,  he did not trust others from other places; and more, this is happening far away from his eyes, since Israel is living in the Land of Goshen and not in Egypt. How else could we explain that the land is full of them, but that &quot;in the land of Goshen, where Israel lived, there was no hail&quot;? And I say that Pharaoh did not want to talk to all the midwives at once, since if all of them would kill all the Israelite babies at one moment, the thing would be known and publicized.And if just two of them were going around killing them - and not all the other midwives, others could say it  was an accident, and he thought to order all the midwives in small groups, so that the matter would not be known [if it had worked with those first two].</p>

              </summary>
              <p>&quot;And he resided there&quot; – this teaches that he didn't go down to settle there, but rather to reside there, as it is stated, &quot;And they said to Pharaoh, to reside in the land have we come, since there is not enough pasture for your servant's flocks, since the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan, and now please grant that your servants should dwell in the land of Goshen.&quot; (Gen. 47:4) The Maggid did not interpret, “And he resided there” as a reference to settling permanently in Egypt as we see elsewhere, “And Jacob resided in the land of Ham,” (Ps. 105:23) for two reasons. First, because if this is what the text meant, it would have been more fitting for it to say, “And he dwelled there.” (Vayeshev sham) (Vayeshev means to settle permanently while vayagar is to reside for a limited amount of time.)  The descendants of Jacob actually dwelled there a long time and were already residents of the land. So why does Scripture use “residing” (geirut) if it doesn’t reflect their intention when they came there… The second reason is that Scripture states, “They resided there few in number.” This implies that the residing must have taken place at the beginning of their stay in Egypt when they were still few in number, only seventy. The verse is referring to the time soon after they arrived in Egypt. The most direct explanation of the verse, ‘They resided there few in number” reflects their thinking when they first arrived and not when they had been dwelling for a while in Egypt. About this (later period of their residence in Egypt) it states, “and there they became a great and mighty nation.” (As happened during many periods of Israel exile, what began as residence quickly turned into settlement. Jacob and his family came planning to reside for a short time in Egypt but they became as great nation when they remained there permanently.)  A proof is brought for this from the verse, “to reside in the land have we come.” (Gen. 47:7) The Maggid understood from the true meaning of the story of Joseph; Joseph only told the brothers to bring their father to Egypt to live there during the years of the famine, as he said, “And here I will nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine, lest you, and your household and all you have come to poverty.” (Gen. 45:11) He thought that after the famine ended, they would return to Canaan. When they arrived in Egypt Joseph planned to dupe Pharaoh into allowing them to settle the land of Goshen. He ordered his brothers, when he presented them to Pharaoh and he asked them what type of work they did, to say, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34) He then told them the reason why they should say this, “That you may live in the land of Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.” (Gen. 46:34) Because of this the Egyptians would not want them to dwell in Egypt. Even though this advice was for their benefit and there can be no doubt that it was true that both they and their ancestors were shepherds, still Joseph had them say this so Pharaoh would not suspect that they came to Egypt to eat his food, and that Joseph was going to give it to them from the king’s treasury. The brothers came before Pharaoh and when he asked them, “What is your trade,” they answered as Joseph instructed them, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our ancestors;” this would have been enough for them to say. So why did they add, “And they said, ‘Moreover, we have come to reside in the land.’” (Gen. 47:4) Also why did they explicitly ask Pharaoh, “Let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” (Gen. 47:4) It was not Joseph’s intention that they should ask for the land of Goshen but rather they should answer him in this way so that Pharaoh himself would offer it to them. Yet the truth of the matter became apparent when they said, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34). They became silent thinking that Pharaoh would answer, “Then go dwell in the land of Goshen…” But upon hearing this Pharaoh didn’t say anything so the brothers felt it was necessary to add the second part of the statement, “They said, to reside in the land we have come.” This was an unexpected statement and it made known the truth of their intentions, that it was not their plan to continue to dwell in the land but to reside there temporarily because of the pressing needs of their herds and because the famine was severe in Canaan. Then they asked him clearly to give them permission to dwell in Goshen for the sake of their herds for a limited time. To this second request Pharaoh did not answer directly; rather he turned to Joseph and said, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.” (Gen. 47:5) He said to Joseph, ‘’All of this was to fool me, for your father and brothers came because of their herds and you can see that other shepherds have not come from Canaan. The truth is they came “To you” – because you are a leader in my land and so you can support them. They want to dwell in the land of Goshen and I want things to go well for them. Since that is the case, “Behold the land is before you; let your father and your brothers live in the best of the land.” (Gen. 47:6) From this it has been explained that when the brothers said, “We have come to reside in the land,” they were not being duplicitous. They were being completely honest – this is what they meant. It is why the Maggid explains, “and he resided there” to mean, they did not come to Egypt to settle there. (While Joseph tried to trick Pharaoh into letting his family settle in Goshen, the brothers’ honest explanation was more affective in convincing Pharaoh to allow them to settle in Goshen. Pharaoh is cleverer than Joseph and he turns on him and makes it clear that he knows Joseph’s true intentions. Thus when the Haggadah says, that they did not come to settle but to reside in Egypt it is clear that the brothers had no intention of staying on but remaining until the end of the famine.)  We have now answered the questions in the forty-ninth and the fiftieth gates.</p>

              <p>IN THE LAND OF GOSHEN. The land of Goshen refers to the entire land, the land of Rameses (v. 11) to an area within it. (In our verse we are told that the Israelites lived in the land of Goshen. However, verse 11 tells us that they lived in the land of Rameses. I.E. solves this discrepancy by explaining that the land of Goshen was divided into a number of subdivisions one of which was called Rameses (Weiser). Thus the Israelites dwelt both in the land of Rameses and in the land of Goshen.)  The ayin in Rameses is vocalized with a quiescent sheva. I believe that the city Raamses (Ex. 1:11) which is vocalized with a pattach beneath the ayin (Rameses and Raamses have identical consonants. They differ only with regard to the vocalization of the ayin.)  is not to be identified with the Rameses in which the Israelites dwelt, for Raamses was one of the store cities that the Israelites built for Pharaoh. (It was not even in existence when the Israelites came to Egypt.) </p>

Ramban clarifies the term &quot;mikeitz&quot; in Deuteronomy 15:1, while Rashi and Chizkuni discuss the strength of the tribes Zebulun, Gad, Dan, Naphtali, and Asher. In the Talmud, Rava questions Rabba bar Mari about the weak brothers presented to Pharaoh, identified as Dan, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, and Naftali. Moses blesses Zebulun and Issachar in the Tanakh, encouraging them to find joy in their travels and contentment in their homes. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that Joseph presented five brothers to Pharaoh, specifically Zebulon, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</summary>

              <p>ומקצה אחיו SOME OF HIS BRETHREN — Some of the inferior ones amongst them as to strength — of those who did not look robust. For should Pharaoh find them to be robust men he might press them for military service. The weaker brethren were as follows: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Issachar and Benjamin, and it was they whose names Moses did not repeat when he blessed them. But the names of the strong ones he mentioned twice: (Deuteronomy 33:7) “And this is for Judah ... hear, Eternal, the voice of Judah”; (Deuteronomy 33:20) “And of Gad he said, Blessed he lie that extendeth Gad”; (Deuteronomy 33:25) “And of Naphtali he said, Naphtali ...” (Deuteronomy 33:22). “And of Dan he said Dan . . .”, and in like manner he repeated the names of Zebulun (Deuteronomy 33:18) and of Asher (Deuteronomy 33:24). This is the version of Genesis Rabbah 95:4 which is a Palestinian Agada. But in our Babylonian Talmud we find that those whose names Moses mentioned twice were the weaker of the brethren and it was these whom he (Joseph) brought before Pharaoh. But six are enumerated above as having their names mentioned twice and he brought only five before Pharaoh. The explanation is that it is true that Judah’s name is mentioned twice, but it is mentioned twice not because he was one of the weaker brethren, but there is another reason for this, as is stated in Bava Kamma 92a. In the Baraitha of Siphre on וזאת הברכה we have the same version as in our Babylonian Talmud. </p>

              <p>“From among his brothers he took five men, and he presented them before Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:2).  “From among [miktze] his brothers he took five men” – why did the verse state “from among [miktze] his brothers”? It is to teach you that they were not mighty. (The term katze indicates those on the periphery; those who are relatively weak.)  Who were these five men? They were Reuben, Levi, Benjamin, Simeon, and Issachar. Why did Joseph the righteous select these five men from his brothers? It is because he knew each and every mighty one among his brothers, and he acted wisely. He said: ‘If I present the mighty ones before pharaoh, he will see them and make them his warriors.’ Anyone whose name was repeated in Moses’s blessing was mighty, and anyone whose name was not repeated, was not mighty. Judah, who was mighty, his name was repeated, as it is stated: “This is for Judah, and he said: Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah” (Deuteronomy 33:7). Therefore, he did not present him before Pharaoh. Likewise Naphtali, as it is stated: “Of Naphtali he said: Naphtali” (Deuteronomy 33:23). Likewise Asher, as it is stated: “Of Asher he said: Blessed of sons is Asher” (Deuteronomy 33:24). Likewise Dan, as it is stated: “Of Dan he said: Dan” (Deuteronomy 33:22). Likewise Zebulun, as it is stated: “Of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun” (Deuteronomy 33:18). And likewise Gad – “Of Gad he said: Blessed is He who expands Gad” (Deuteronomy 33:20). That is why he did not present these before Pharaoh. The rest, whose names were not repeated, were not mighty. Therefore, he presented them before Pharaoh. That is why it is written: “From among his brothers he took.” It does not mention their names here because they were not mighty.  “Joseph said: Give your livestock, and I will give you for your livestock, if silver has run out” (Genesis 47:16).  “Joseph said: Give your livestock…” – your horse is before me. You are exposed as a peeled onion. (You can claim that you have no money, but not that you have nothing. I see your horses.)   (This is not part of the midrash but a later addition that suggests an explanation of the preceding sentence, on the basis of Genesis 47:18. ) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>MIKEITZ’ OF SEVEN YEARS THOU SHALT MAKE ‘SH’MITAH.’ The correct interpretation appears to me that he is warning about the seventh year itself, that we make it a Sabbatical [refraining] from plowing, [sowing] and reaping, just as He said, But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow, (Exodus 23:11.)  this being the meaning of thou shalt make ‘sh’mitah,’ that “you should rest,” similar to the expression, to keep the Sabbath-day. (Above, 5:15.)  He abridged the prohibitions of sowing and pruning because He expressly mentioned them already, (See Leviticus 25:4.)  but he supplemented [what was previously said] to explain that it is a ‘sh’mitah’ of the Eternal (Verse 2.)  also in regards to the release of moneys. This is the sense of the expression, because it is proclaimed ‘the remission’ of the Eternal, (Verse 2.)  which is similar to a Sabbath unto the Eternal, (Leviticus 25:2.)  and all works are to cease. I have already alluded to its secret. (Leviticus 25:2.)  Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented [that the meaning of the word mikeitz is] “at the beginning of the year.” And so say all grammarians (Including R’dak in his Sefer Hasharashim, under the root katzeh.)  that the beginning and end of something are each called katzeh, since there are two extremities to each thing, similar to what is written, from ‘hakatzeh’ (end) to ‘hakatzeh’ (end); (Exodus 26:28.)  of the two ends thereof; (Ibid., 25:19.)  in the four ends thereof. (Ibid., 27:4.)  But the words [of the grammarians and Ibn Ezra] do not seem correct to me. For “the beginning of seven years” denotes the first year [of the Sabbatical cycle], this being the katzeh which is called rosh (the beginning)! Now had Scripture said, “mikeitz of the seventh year” their interpretation would have been correct [for then the verse would mean “at the beginning of the seventh year you shall make sh’mitah.” Instead, however, Scripture says, “‘Mikeitz’ of seven years thou shalt make ‘sh’mitah’ which according to them means “at the beginning of seven years,” i.e., in the first year you shall make the sh’mitah, which cannot be correct]! And in the opinion of our Rabbis (Sifre, R’eih 111.)  mikeitz means “at the end of the seven years,” and Scripture speaks only of the release of money [i.e., the remission of debts], stating “at the end of all seven years counted by you [as a Sabbatical cycle] you shall make a release, that every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor, ” (Verse 2.)  and it is therefore that the Rabbis have said (Arakhin 28b.)  that the Seventh year cancels a loan only at the end. Similarly in their opinion (Sifre, R’eih 111.)  the verse ‘mikeitz’ seven years, at the appointed season of the year of remission, in the Festival of Tabernacles (Further, 31:10.)  means “at the end of the seventh year,” except that “the end” mentioned here [with reference to the release of debts] means immediately [i.e., in the last moment of the seventh year] and “the end” mentioned there [with reference to the Assembly at which the king was to read the Book of Deuteronomy] is “distant,” [during Tabernacles, somewhat “distant” from the end of the year], since he explained at the appointed season of the year of remission, in the Festival of Tabernacles. (Further, 31:10.)  Thus the sense [of mikeitz] in both cases is “the end,” stating here “at the end of seven years you shall make a release,” and there likewise it states “when the seven years end at the appointed season of the year of remission in the Festival of Tabernacles you shall make an Assembly.” By way of the simple meaning of Scripture it appears to me that the language of Scripture in its plain sense is clear and correct. Keitz means “end,” and so is its translation [as rendered by Onkelos and Yonathan: “at the end”]. Numbers and every [other] thing have a beginning and an end, and their beginning and end are part of them. Thus when you speak of tens, “one” is the beginning of the number and “ten” its end. If so, “the end of seven years” is “the seventh year” which is the end of that number, and Scripture refers to the Sabbatical of the Land, as I have explained above. The meaning of the word mikeitz is then like one cherub (‘mikatzeh’) at the one ‘end’ and one cherub (‘mikatzeh’) at the other ‘end’. (Exodus 25:19.)  The purport of the verse here is thus as follows: “at the end of seven years [i.e., in the seventh year which is ‘the end’ of that period] you shall make a cessation of work on the Land.” Similarly, ‘Mikeitz’ of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee and hath served thee six years (Jeremiah 34:13.)  means “in the seventh year” which is the end of that number, this being similar to the verse written in the Torah, and in the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing. (Exodus 21:2. Thus the point is clear: In the seventh year — i.e., from its very beginning — we are to observe an entire year’s rest for the Land. Similarly, at the beginning of the seventh year of his service, the Hebrew servant is to go free, for, as Scripture stated, he shall serve thee six years, and at [the beginning of] the seventh year he goes free for nothing.)  So also, and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free; (Further, Verse 12.)  for having said, he shall serve thee six years, (Further, Verse 12.)  it was not necessary to explain [“mikeitz seven years you shall let him go”] but only to state that in the seventh year he goes free. In the same way it would appear that the meaning of the other verse — ‘mikeitz’ seven years, at the appointed season in the year of remission, in the Festival of Tabernacles (Further, 31:10.)  — would be in a similar way: “in ‘the end’ year, in the Festival of Tabernacles, in the beginning of that year in which plowing and sowing have been forbidden, this being the Sabbatical year.” But we could not say so, since our Rabbis have received by tradition (Sotah 41a.)  and they provided that the Assembly [in which the king read the Book of Deuteronomy] should be held in the Festival of Tabernacles of the eighth year, this being the year after the Sabbatical year. Therefore, the commentators (Rashi (further, 31:10).)  said that at the appointed season in the year of remission (Further, 31:10.)  means “in the appointed season of the first year in the Sabbatical cycle.” This is not correct for the year of remission in Scripture refers only to the year of rest, to that year which is the remission of the Eternal (Verse 2.)  [and not as Rashi explained, “the first year of the Sabbatical cycle”], and so also, the year of the Jubilee (Leviticus 25:13.)  [means, “the year which is itself the Jubilee”]. Our Rabbis themselves made this point, for they said: (Arakhin 24b.)  “Is it written ‘in the year of the Jubilee?’ It states from the year of the Jubilee (Leviticus 27:17.)  which means ‘the year after the Jubilee.’” (This proves that only where Scripture uses the term “from” — “from the Jubilee” or “from the remission” — it means “the year after the Jubilee” or “after the remission,” but “the year of remission” means the year in which the rest of the Land takes place.)  But I say thus: keitz and soph are used in Scripture to denote “the end” of any matter, but sometimes they are within that extremity and sometimes after it, outside of it. Thus: ‘umiktzei’ (and from among) his brethren; (Genesis 47:2.)  ‘mikatzeh’ (that is outmost) in the set; (Exodus 26:4.)  ‘umiktzatham’ (that at the end) they might stand before the king; (Daniel 1:5.)  ‘miktzoth’ (from the uttermost part) of the one wing unto ‘k’tzoth’ (the uttermost part) of the other (I Kings 6:24.)  — all these are expressions of an extremity which is attached to the thing itself and is contained within it. [But the following expressions:] ‘keitz’ (the end of) all flesh is come before Me; (Genesis 6:13.)  and he shall come to ‘kitzo’ (his end), and none shall help him; (Daniel 11:45.)  ‘hakeitz’ (the end) is come; (Ezekiel 7:2.)  ‘keitz’ (an end) is come (Ibid., Verse 6.)  — all signify “the end” of the matter mentioned but it signifies a later period, for it has been severed and separated. So it is regarding the term soph (end): It is better to go to the house of mourning etc. for that is ‘soph’ (the end of) all men, (Ecclesiastes 7:2.)  which means “after him,” for he has died; they are wholly ‘sophu’ (consumed) by terrors. (Psalms 73:19.)  The work that G-d hath done from the beginning even to ‘soph’ (the end) (Ecclesiastes 3:11.)  — here the term end is within the work itself. And in the language of the Rabbis we find [with reference to the writing of a Scroll of the Law: (Baba Bathra 13b.)  “The scribe is to leave blank] about a column at the beginning [of the Torah] and about [the width of] the circumference ‘b’sopho’ (at its end).” The meaning of the verse [regarding the Assembly] will then be as follows: “From the end of the seven years in the account of the year of release, in the Festival of Tabernacles which follows after the seven years, you shall make the Assembly.” And in order it should not appear to them that “the seven years” refer to some other counting, he mentioned that the seven years be [bizman ha’sh’mitah], at “the time of” the release. Similarly, when I take ‘mo’eid’ (Psalms 75:3.)  means “the [appointed] time.” So do all mo’adim (festivals) signify “the [appointed] times.” Thus this term mikeitz [stated in connection with the Assembly] means “after the period [of seven years] is finished,” as he explained, in the Festival of Tabernacles. (Further, 31:10.)  But [in the verse stated here before us] ‘mikeitz’ seven years thou shalt make a release [the seventh year is] within that number. He did not need to dwell upon and explain this since He already explained that the seventh year is the year of the release. (Exodus 23:11; Leviticus 25:4.)  And the word keitz (end) here is then extensive, applying [to the release during] the whole [seventh] year as I have explained by way of the simple meaning of Scripture. It is possible to say that Scripture counts the beginning of the year from the Festival of Tabernacles, as He said, and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year, (Exodus 34:22.)  and He further said, and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year. (Ibid., 23:16.)  And if so, ‘mikeitz’ seven years [stated further on in connection with the Assembly] (Further, 31:10.)  means “at the end [of the seven years] and just beyond it.” And he states, at the appointed season of the year of remission (Further, 31:10.)  to indicate that the reckoning of seven years be according to the Sabbatical cycles, as I have explained, but not that the [legal obligations of] release extend up to this Festival [of Tabernacles]. Now, I have seen of one author (I have not identified this author.)  who wrote [with respect to the verse on the Assembly]: “This teaches that we are to add from the secular to the sacred, and the law of release [although officially ending at the New Year of the eighth year] still applied until the Festival of Tabernacles of the eighth year. But it is irrefutably shown in the Talmud (Rosh Hashanah 13a. See my Hebrew commentary p. 413.)  with clear proofs that it [the above interpretation] is untrue. Now it is possible to say that what our Rabbis have said (Sifre, R’eih 111.)  with respect to ‘mikeitz’ seven years thou shalt make a release that the release of money [i.e., the remission of debts] takes effect only at the end of the year — that it is an interpretation [deduced from the text]. Because Scripture did not say “the seventh year you shall make a release” [but instead said ‘mikeitz’ seven years …], it is more suggestive that you effect the remission at the end of the seven [years] than at the beginning. And the intent of [the Rabbis in using here] this term “end” is “beyond it.” Thus a creditor can demand his debt on the last day of the year of the release, and it is not remitted until the night, for thus we find in the Tosephta (Tosephta Shevi’ith 8:10. On “Tosephta” see Vol. III, p. 179, Note 124.)  that they may write a prozbul (A declaration made before a court by a creditor and signed by witnesses to the effect that the loan in question would not be cancelled by the law of release of the Sabbatical year. The prozbul’s legal basis is the Torah’s prohibition that the creditor shall not exact the debt; by turning over his claims to the court, it is they, the officers of the court, who collect it and not the creditor (Rashi, Gittin 36a). It was Hillel who established this ordinance because people refused to lend money to the poor on the seventh year for fear that the debts would be remitted, thus transgressing the law of the Torah against being callous to the condition of the poor (ibid., 36a). See “The Commandments,” Vol. I, pp. 149-150.)  on the day before the New Year of the outgoing seventh year.</p>

        <summary>Chasidut explains the concept of &quot;ELDaD and MeIDaD&quot; as a source of bounty, completing the Name Elohim with the letter heh (Likutei Moharan 97:1:2). The Torah demonstrates interchangeability of letters with the use of ה instead of י in רעה (Rabbeinu Bahya), and Joseph's brothers distinguish themselves as shepherds, not cattle breeders, as advised by Joseph (Rav Hirsch, Steinsaltz). The second tithe in Jerusalem promotes charity to strengthen love and brotherhood, while the law concerning first-born animals includes only domestic animals for practicality (Jewish Thought). Radak interprets רובה in Genesis 21:20:4 as lad or shooter, Rabbeinu Bahya clarifies Yaakov's instructions to gather stones in Genesis 31:46:1, and Ramban explains Yaakov's respectful address to Laban's brothers (Quoting Commentary). In the Second Temple period, Jacob's sons resist the temptations of Pharaoh in Egypt and proudly declare their identity as shepherds when questioned (Second Temple). Pharaoh inquires about Joseph's brothers' occupation, to which they respond that they are shepherds like their fathers (Targum Onkelos Genesis 47:3).</summary>

              <p>In reference to the law concerning the first-born of man and cattle it is distinctly said, “And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the Lord slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, etc., therefore I sacrifice to the Lord,” etc. (Exod. 13:15). But it can easily be explained why only cattle, sheep, and asses are mentioned in this law; these are kept as domestic animals, and are found in most places, especially in Palestine, where the Israelites were shepherds, they, their fathers, and forefathers; comp. “Thy servants are shepherds, both we and also our fathers” (Gen. 47:3). Horses and camels, however, are not wanted by shepherds, and are not found in all places; thus in the booty of Midian (Num. xxxi.) no other animals are mentioned but oxen, sheep, and asses. But asses alone are indispensable to all people, especially to those who are engaged in the field or in the forest. Thus Jacob says, “I have oxen and asses” (Gen. 32:5). Camels and horses are not possessed by many people, but only by a few, and are only found in a few places. The law that the first-born of an ass was to have its neck broken [in case it is not redeemed], will only ensure the redemption of the ass. It has, therefore, been said that the act of redeeming the ass is to be preferred to that of breaking its neck.</p>

              <p>ויהי רובה קשת, the word רבה may be understood as נער, lad. Onkelos translates it as רביא. The word קשת is an adjective mode of the word keshet, bow. The mode is similar to that of ganav, someone practicing thievery, or salach, someone apt to forgive. An alternative way of understanding the word רובה is that it means the same as יורה, someone shooting. He developed the technique of shooting arrows by means of a bow. [a far less dangerous mode of hunting than bodily facing the adversary. At this point Kimchi draws on the points made already by Rash’bam on our verse. Ed.] He adds that the ability to hit distant targets enables archers to practice what the Torah called ידו בכל, attacking all and sundry, even distant targets. He quotes examples of ancient peoples who became known for this skill, apparently distant descendants of Ishmael, especially the בני קדר.  Reference is made to these people, (in that capacity?) in Isaiah 21,17  Our sages suggest that it is appropriate for the sons to perfect themselves in the trade, vocation or skills in which their father excels. (Erchin 16) They also base this on Kings I 7,14 where Chirom is described as having mastered the art of being a coppersmith just like his father. Yaakov’s sons, when presented to Pharaoh in Genesis 47,3, also were described as continuing the tradition of their father as shepherds.

              <p>AND JACOB SAID UNTO HIS BRETHREN. I.e., to Laban’s brothers mentioned above, (Verse 23 here.)  who had accompanied him, as Jacob did not want to say it to his father-in-law whom he treated with respect. Likewise, the verse, And he [Jacob] called his brethren to eat bread, (Verse 54 here.)  also refers to Laban’s brothers, and he did not invite Laban to eat bread as an act of respect, as if everything is under his authority and is all his. A similar case is the verse, And Pharaoh said unto his brethren: What is your occupation? (Further, 47:3.)  [which means he said it to Joseph’s brethren]. But Rashi explained: “And Jacob said unto his brethren — to Jacob’s brothers, [meaning, his sons, who were like brothers to him since they stood by him in trouble and in battle].” However, those that came with Laban, whom Scripture calls “his brethren”, were really his friends and companions. It is possible that that which is said concerning Laban, And he took his brethren with him, (Verse 23 here.)  refers to his kinsmen, members of his family from the seed of Nahor the brother of Abraham. He did this because he did not want to bring against Jacob strangers lest they fight with him intensely, or covet, rob and steal his belongings. Thus these men were kinsmen to Jacob just as to Laban, and therefore they are called “brethren” of both. And some say (P’sikta Zutrata above on Chapter 29, Verse 4.)  that Jacob ethically referred to them as “my brothers,” just as he said to the shepherds, My brethren, whence are ye? (Above, 29:4.)  And in Bereshith Rabbah, the Sages have said: (74:11.)  “And Jacob said unto his brethren — these are his sons, whom, in a respectful manner, he called his brothers.” However, with respect to the verse, And he called his brethren to eat bread, (Verse 54 here.)  the Midrash did not explain [that “his brethren” refers to his sons]! The correct interpretation is the one I wrote at the outset.</p>

            <summary>The brothers told Pharaoh they came to Egypt because there was no pasture left in Canaan due to severe famine, even though Egypt also lacked pasture; the famine was more intense in Canaan, leading people to eat grass, leaving nothing for the animals. They requested to stay temporarily in Goshen, where some pasture remained near ponds and rivers, as they were shepherds and needed grazing land for their flocks. Pharaoh allowed them to stay in Goshen and even offered to have strong men watch over his flocks there.

I wonder about this reason which they told to Pharaoh, for there was also no pasture in Egypt; the famine was as severe in the land of Egypt as it was in the land of Canaan, or even more so, for it was against Egypt that the main decree was directed. Perhaps they said that in the land of Canaan, due to the severity of the famine, people were eating the grass of the field and were not leaving any sustenance for the cattle. However, in the land of Egypt where there is corn, people subsist on that, and thus in Egypt there is a little pasture left. It is possible that in the land of Egypt there was a little pasture in the reedgrass on account of the rivers and the ponds.</p>

After all, there was no grazing land in Egypt either during the famine, and both man and beast survived only from stored surplus of prior years. Possibly, the most intense famine raged in the land of Canaan, and the people there were reduced to eating grass, so that there was really nothing left for the beasts to feed on. Seeing that people received regular food rations in Egypt they had not needed to deny their beasts the grass in the fields. Alternately, there would be some grass around the many ponds in Egypt and in the Nile delta near the banks of the tributaries of the Nile river.</p>

You find that everything that is written in Abraham’s regard is written regarding his descendants. In Abraham’s regard it is written: “There was famine in the land” (Genesis 12:10); in Israel’s regard it is written: “For these two years the famine is in the midst of the land” (Genesis 45:6). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there” (Genesis 12:10); in Israel’s regard it is written: “Our ancestors descended to Egypt” (Numbers 20:15). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “To sojourn there”; in Israel’s regard it is written: “We have come to sojourn in the land” (Genesis 47:4). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “As the famine was severe in the land” (Genesis 12:10); in Israel’s regard it is written: “The famine was severe in the land” (Genesis 43:1). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “It was when he drew near” (Genesis 12:11); in Israel’s regard it is written: “Pharaoh drew near” (Exodus 14:10). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “They will kill me, and keep you alive” (Genesis 12:12); in Israel’s regard it is written: “Every son who is born, you shall cast him into the Nile [and every girl you shall keep alive]” (Exodus 1:22). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “Please, say you are my sister; so that it may be well with me [yitav li] because of you…” (Genesis 12:13); in Israel’s regard it is written: “God favored [vayeitev] the midwives” (Exodus 1:20). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “It was upon Abram’s arrival in Egypt” (Genesis 12:14); in Israel’s regard it is written: “These are the names of the children of Israel who arrived in Egypt” (Exodus 1:1). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “And Abram was very wealthy in livestock, [in silver, and in gold]” (Genesis 13:2); in Israel’s regard it is written: “He took them out with silver and with gold” (Psalms 105:37). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “Pharaoh commanded [men] in his regard, [and they sent away him and his wife]” (Genesis 12:20); in Israel’s regard it is written: “The Egyptians urged the people, [to send them away in haste]” (Exodus 12:33). In Abraham’s regard it is written: “He went on his journeys” (Genesis 13:3); in Israel’s regard it is written: “These are the journeys of the children of Israel” (Numbers 33:1).</p>

              <p>“He dwelled (vayagar) there, teaching us that he did not go down to settle there.” If Jacob had gone down to Egypt to settle there permanently, this would have negated God’s promise of redemption. As long as they saw themselves as temporary residents, it was known that they would not remain in the land. A ger is someone who is only temporarily settled in a place and will be gone tomorrow. This was how the Israelites saw themselves in Egypt when Jacob went down to Egypt and because of this they were worthy of redemption. The word vayagar was chosen here to show that they did not go down to settle permanently. Doesn’t the verse already imply that they settled there temporarily?  (The word vayagar already implies temporary residence so why do we need another proof text here to prove this? The Maharal suggests that while the original settlers saw themselves as temporary residents, by the time of Moses the people saw themselves as permanent residents. The Egyptians, however, saw the Israelites as gerim and not as citizens. Despite their attitudes, the Israelites merited redemption because of their ancestors and because from the standpoint of the Egyptians they were still outsiders.)  The Egyptians saw Israel as gerim, as temporary residents, while the Israelites thought of the land as their permanent residence. That is why the Haggadah brings this proof text, “They said to Pharaoh, to dwell in Egypt temporarily we have come for there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants…” (Gen. 47:4) This verse shows that their original intention was not to stay permanently in the land but to dwell temporarily.</p>

              <p>And he sojourned there. Jacob did not go down to settle in Egypt but merely to sojourn there... There are two proofs for this explanation of the verse in Deuteronomy. First, the word Vayar comes from the root word Gur, which means to sojourn rather than to permanently settle. The Haggadah also brings an additional verse from Genesis 47:4 to prove this. Shortly after arriving in Egypt, Joseph brings his brothers to Pharaoh. They clearly say that their intention is not to remain in Egypt but to sojourn there until the end of the famine: “And they said to Pharaoh, ‘We have come to sojourn (Lagur) in this land for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks, the famine being severe in the land of Canaan.’”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>They went down to Egypt: Not to settle there but to sojourn there: This teaches how shrewd Jacob was. When children of Jacob went down to Egypt they (and their father) were fearful that their descendents would intermix with the Egyptians and become entrenched there. Jacob chose a set place for his family to live so that if one of them chose to leave the community, they could no longer return even to work. (In other words, Jacob created the first Ghetto; this way of life was not imposed upon the children of Israel but was adopted by them in order to assure their continued unique identity.)  This is what the Torah means when it tells us Vayagar Sham, “they sojourned there,” that is, they chose to sojourn there and not dwell permanently among their neighbors. The land that he chose was Goshen: “Now, let your servant dwell in the land of Goshen…” (Genesis 47:4; However, this verse is a statement by the brothers to Pharaoh and not by Jacob. Maybe the author implies that while they were speaking, Jacob was orchestrating this plan to isolate the family so they would not become assimilated into the general population.)  Despite this plan, it does not appear that Jacob succeeded. When the children of Israel arrived in Egypt they were a quantifiable number of which they could easily keep track – there were only seventy people. But as the generations passed the people multiplied in a unnatural fashion (the Midrash says that every woman gave birth to sextuplets) so that within a short period of time there were so many Israelites that they were too numerous to keep count of. In such a case it would have been hard to keep track of the people and hard to keep them from assimilating into their environment. It would have been hard to keep everyone living in one confined area. Thus the Torah says, “With seventy souls your ancestors went down to Egypt but now I have made you more numerous than the stars in the heavens.” (Deuteronomy 10:22)  As a result the people would no longer have been in the category of a quantifiable number, and not capable of being tracked or counted. In the Talmud Sanhedrin, we find a story in which the emperor who asked Rabban Gamliel what was so impressive about the fact that God could count the stars; even he can do this. Rabban Gamliel made the emperor aware that this is no easy matter since the stars and the heavens are constantly revolving. (Sanhedrin 39a - Again the Emperor said to Rabban Gamliel: It is written, “He counts the number of the stars etc.” (Psalm 147:4) In what way is that remarkable; I too can count them!' Rabban Gamliel brought some quinces, put them into a sieve, whirled them around, and said: 'Count them.' 'Keep them still,' he requested. Thereupon Rabban Gamliel observed, 'But the Heavens revolve so.' Some say that the Emperor spoke thus to him: 'The number of the stars is known to me.' Thereupon Rabban Gamliel asked him, 'How many molars and [other] teeth have you' Putting his hand to his mouth, he began to count them. Said he to him, 'You know not what is in your mouth and yet wouldst know what is in Heaven!')  The insight of this story applies here as well: God compared Israel to the stars because while human beings cannot count the stars, God can; therefore when the Israelites were as numerous as the stars, they were still quantifiable! Jacob, then, did succeed since God could keep track of the people of Israel even as they multiplied in Egypt. Rashi also points out that since Israel was compared to the stars in the heavens, each and every Israelite remained important and significant in the eyes of God. As long as each Jew is counted none will be lost!</p>

                <h4>Rabbeinu Bahya, Bereshit 37:1:2</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>In the two verses quoted above Solomon informed us of the penalty for stealing from the poor. It is well known that there are four categories of people concerning whom the Torah has expressed especial concern, asking people to be merciful towards them and not to inflict any harm upon them. They are: the poor, the orphans, the widows and the proselytes. Indeed we find that the Torah expresses a warning against discrimination against the aforesaid in one and the same verse in Deuteronomy 16,14 where we read: ושמחת בחגיך, אתה ובנך ובתך ועבדך ואמתך והלוי והגר והיתום והאלמנה אשר בשעריך. “You are to rejoice on your festival, you, your son, your daughter, your male servant and your maid servant, the proselyte, the orphan and the widow in your cities.”   Our sages as quoted by Rashi comment: “these four are Mine (G’d speaking). If you will give joy to those who are Mine, I will provide joy for those that are yours.” Mention of the Levites is equivalent to mentioning the poor as the Levites have no source of income other than the generosity of the Jewish farmer. G’d Himself is their portion as we read in Numbers 18,20 אני חלקך ונחלתך, “I am your share and your inheritance.” When the Torah legislated the treatment of the poor it did so both as a positive as well as a negative commandment. It is written (Deut. 15,10) נתון תתן, “you shall surely give (repeatedly),” (15,8) “and you shall repeatedly open your hand for him (the poor).” The negative counterpart of this commandment is found side by side (15,10), לא ירע לבבך בתתך לו, “your heart must not feel bad when you give him.” We also find another basic aspect of this commandment in Deut. 15,7 לא תאמץ את לבבך ולא תקפוץ את ידך מאחיך האביון, “do not harden your heart or close your hand against your destitute brother.”  Seeing that the Torah legislated against stealing altogether already in the Ten Commandments as well as in Leviticus 19, 19,13, there was no need to stress a prohibition against stealing from the poor. The instruction to give to the poor would have been sufficient to make it plain that it is forbidden to steal from the poor instead of giving to the poor. The fact that the Torah nonetheless writes words prohibiting this prompted Solomon to tell us that the penalty for stealing from the poor is far harsher than that for stealing from ordinary people. It was not Solomon’s habit to repeat commandments which have been spelled out in the Torah already and to simply repeat them in his volume משלי, Proverbs. Whenever he does so, he does so only in order to reveal an additional dimension to such a commandment. After all, who is so great that he could arrogate to himself to add to the Torah something Moses had not already thought of or been told by G’d to write down? Solomon, in common with later sages, only added “fences” to the Torah, i.e. warned against conduct which might lead to infringing Biblical commandments. This is why he said: “do not steal from the poor because he is poor,” i.e. stealing from him is so commonplace seeing that the poor is defenseless, that we must be warned not to exploit his weakness. The poor does not have protagonists such as the rich have. Everybody hates the poor and keeps his distance from him, even his relatives. This is why Solomon emphasises that the temptation to steal from the poor is great precisely “because he is poor.” Solomon therefore warns us not to think that because the poor do not have defenders of flesh and blood that they are without recourse. On the contrary, G’d Himself is their advocate and will see to it that they do not suffer because they are being exploited due to their poverty. He will go out of His way to administer punishment to anyone who steals from the poor. Contrary to the penalty for thieves who do not steal from the poor specifically, whose penalty the Torah expressed in terms of financial restitution and penal charges, someone who steals from the poor will endure chastisement of body and soul. This is the meaning of the words וקבע את קובעיהם נפש, “he will put in their places those who have tried to put the poor in their place.”  The Torah warns us in many places not to disadvantage orphans and widows, i.e. כל אלמנה ויתום לא תענון, ”do not oppress any orphan or widow” (Exodus 22,21). Our sages in the Mechilta comment on this verse: “even the widow of a king (presumably wealthy and influential) is included in this commandment.” The same applies to children of a king left orphaned. The reason is that in spite of their financial resources, the state of mind of such widows and orphans is one of melancholy and they are apt to cry at the slightest provocation. It is unfortunately a fact of life that people do take advantage of orphans and widows. The Torah goes on to say: אם ענה תענה אותם.....והרגתי אתכם בחרב והיו נשיכם אלמנות ובניכם יתומים, “if indeed you will persecute them..then I will kill you and your wives will become widows and your children orphans.” The Torah conditions this harsh punishment on the assumption that the victim cried out to G’d for vengeance. Generally speaking, people faced with unfair treatment put their faith in seeking recourse from a human tribunal. The orphan and widow have no other recourse than G’d Himself. This is why G’d listens specifically to their outcries and fights their battles for them.  Solomon also addresses the plight of orphans and widows in this chapter, and this is why he said (Proverbs 23,10-11) אל תסג גבול עולם, ובשדי יתומים אל תבא. כי גואלם חזק. הוא יריב את ריבם אתך. “Do not remove ancient boundary marks; do not encroach upon the field of orphans. For they have a powerful redeemer; he will fight their battles against you.”  The Torah also takes up the plight of the proselytes (strangers, immigrants to the land of Israel) on many occasions For instance, we find in Exodus 22,20 וגר לא תונה ולא תלחצנו כי גרים הייתם בארץ מצרים. “And do not taunt or oppress a stranger (convert) for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.” The Torah cites an additional reason for treating the proselyte fairly when it writes (Exodus 23,9) כי אתם ידעתם את נפש הגר, “for you are familiar with the mentality of the stranger.” Significantly, the Torah did not speak of your “knowing the stranger,” but of your being familiar with נפש הגר, the soul, the mentality of the stranger. You know that the mentality of strangers is one of feeling subdued, humbled, etc., so that his eyes are constantly turned towards G’d seeing he lacks in self-confidence.  The Talmud (Baba Metzia 58) speaks of the prohibition of reminding a proselyte or even his son of his former deeds or the deeds of his father. When such a proselyte comes to study Torah one is not to say to him: “ how can the mouth which used to enjoy all manner of forbidden foods presume to qualify to study the holy Torah.” The reminder of the Torah that when the Jewish people were still enslaved in Egypt their status was not superior to the recent proselyte is an example of the Rabbinic dictum מום שבך אל תאמר לחברך, “do not speak to your fellow man about a blemish as long as you yourself are afflicted with a similar blemish.” (Baba Metzia 59). In fact we find that the righteous themselves are referred to as גרים, strangers, the expression גר being derived from גרגיר, something that has been separated from its origin. The righteous is in the habit of viewing himself as distinctive, a loner, in the sense that he is different from the majority. For instance, he does not view his residence on this earth as something other than temporary. This is what King David had in mind when he said (Psalms 119,19) “I am only a stranger on earth, do not hide Your commandments from me.” He viewed himself as a tourist who has already been invited to commence a journey though he does not know the time of departure. Seeing that he does not know when he will depart, he must accumulate provisions for his journey to guard against a sudden and unprepared departure. What do these “provisions” consist of? The observance of G’d’s commandments. This is what David meant when he asked G’d not to hide His commandments from him. We also note that all of the patriarchs have been referred to as גרים on different occasions. Avraham said of himself (Genesis 23,4) “I am a stranger or a resident stranger amongst you” when he prepared to buy a burial ground for Sarah. Yitzchak was commanded by G’d to remain in the land of Canaan during the famine, albeit as a stranger. The wording is גור בארץ הזאת, “sojourn in this land on a temporary basis” (Genesis 26,3). Yaakov is referred to as a stranger in our verse (first verse of our portion וישב) as well as in Genesis 47,4 and when he described his long stay at Lavan’s as that of a stranger in Genesis 32,5.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND JACOB LIVED IN THE LAND OF EGYPT SEVENTEEN YEARS. I have already mentioned (Above, 43:14.)  that Jacob’s descent into Egypt alludes to our present exile at the hand of the “fourth beast,” (In Daniel’s vision concerning the Four Kingdoms, the fourth beast symbolizes Rome. See Daniel 7:7, also Note 8 in Seder Vayeitzei.)  which represents Rome. [There are many parallels,] for it was Jacob’s sons themselves who, by the sale of their brother Joseph, caused their going down there. Jacob, moreover, went there on account of the famine, thinking to find relief with his son in the house of his son’s friend, for Pharaoh loved Joseph and considered him as a son. It was their hope to ascend from there as soon as the famine would cease in the land of Canaan, just as they said, To sojourn in the land we have come, for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks, for the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan. (Above, 47:4.)  But then they did not come up, but instead the exile prolonged itself upon Jacob and he died there, and his bones ascended from there accompanied by all the elders and courtiers of Pharaoh, who instituted severe lamentation for him. Our relationship with our brothers Rome and Edom is similar. We ourselves have caused our falling into their clutches, as they (The Hasmonean rulers during the Second Temple era. See Abodah Zarah 8b.)  made a covenant with the Romans, and Agrippa, the last king during the Second Temple, fled to them for help. It was due to famine that Jerusalem was captured by the Romans, and the exile has exceedingly prolonged itself over us, with its end, unlike the other exiles, (It was known that the Babylonian Exile would last for a period of seventy years, (Jeremiah 25:12; II Chronicles 36:21). There was also a terminus known for the Egyptian Exile, (above 16:13).)  being unknown. We are in it as the dead, who say, “Our bones are dried up, we are completely cut off.” (See Ezekiel 37:11.)  But in the end they will bring us from all the nations as an offering to the Eternal, (Isaiah 66:20.)  and they will be in deep sorrow as they will behold our glory, and we will see the vengeance of the Eternal. May He raise us, that we may live in His presence. (Hosea 6:2.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>&quot;And he resided there&quot; – this teaches that he didn't go down to settle there, but rather to reside there, as it is stated, &quot;And they said to Pharaoh, to reside in the land have we come, since there is not enough pasture for your servant's flocks, since the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan, and now please grant that your servants should dwell in the land of Goshen.&quot; (Gen. 47:4) The Maggid did not interpret, “And he resided there” as a reference to settling permanently in Egypt as we see elsewhere, “And Jacob resided in the land of Ham,” (Ps. 105:23) for two reasons. First, because if this is what the text meant, it would have been more fitting for it to say, “And he dwelled there.” (Vayeshev sham) (Vayeshev means to settle permanently while vayagar is to reside for a limited amount of time.)  The descendants of Jacob actually dwelled there a long time and were already residents of the land. So why does Scripture use “residing” (geirut) if it doesn’t reflect their intention when they came there… The second reason is that Scripture states, “They resided there few in number.” This implies that the residing must have taken place at the beginning of their stay in Egypt when they were still few in number, only seventy. The verse is referring to the time soon after they arrived in Egypt. The most direct explanation of the verse, ‘They resided there few in number” reflects their thinking when they first arrived and not when they had been dwelling for a while in Egypt. About this (later period of their residence in Egypt) it states, “and there they became a great and mighty nation.” (As happened during many periods of Israel exile, what began as residence quickly turned into settlement. Jacob and his family came planning to reside for a short time in Egypt but they became as great nation when they remained there permanently.)  A proof is brought for this from the verse, “to reside in the land have we come.” (Gen. 47:7) The Maggid understood from the true meaning of the story of Joseph; Joseph only told the brothers to bring their father to Egypt to live there during the years of the famine, as he said, “And here I will nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine, lest you, and your household and all you have come to poverty.” (Gen. 45:11) He thought that after the famine ended, they would return to Canaan. When they arrived in Egypt Joseph planned to dupe Pharaoh into allowing them to settle the land of Goshen. He ordered his brothers, when he presented them to Pharaoh and he asked them what type of work they did, to say, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34) He then told them the reason why they should say this, “That you may live in the land of Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.” (Gen. 46:34) Because of this the Egyptians would not want them to dwell in Egypt. Even though this advice was for their benefit and there can be no doubt that it was true that both they and their ancestors were shepherds, still Joseph had them say this so Pharaoh would not suspect that they came to Egypt to eat his food, and that Joseph was going to give it to them from the king’s treasury. The brothers came before Pharaoh and when he asked them, “What is your trade,” they answered as Joseph instructed them, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our ancestors;” this would have been enough for them to say. So why did they add, “And they said, ‘Moreover, we have come to reside in the land.’” (Gen. 47:4) Also why did they explicitly ask Pharaoh, “Let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” (Gen. 47:4) It was not Joseph’s intention that they should ask for the land of Goshen but rather they should answer him in this way so that Pharaoh himself would offer it to them. Yet the truth of the matter became apparent when they said, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34). They became silent thinking that Pharaoh would answer, “Then go dwell in the land of Goshen…” But upon hearing this Pharaoh didn’t say anything so the brothers felt it was necessary to add the second part of the statement, “They said, to reside in the land we have come.” This was an unexpected statement and it made known the truth of their intentions, that it was not their plan to continue to dwell in the land but to reside there temporarily because of the pressing needs of their herds and because the famine was severe in Canaan. Then they asked him clearly to give them permission to dwell in Goshen for the sake of their herds for a limited time. To this second request Pharaoh did not answer directly; rather he turned to Joseph and said, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.” (Gen. 47:5) He said to Joseph, ‘’All of this was to fool me, for your father and brothers came because of their herds and you can see that other shepherds have not come from Canaan. The truth is they came “To you” – because you are a leader in my land and so you can support them. They want to dwell in the land of Goshen and I want things to go well for them. Since that is the case, “Behold the land is before you; let your father and your brothers live in the best of the land.” (Gen. 47:6) From this it has been explained that when the brothers said, “We have come to reside in the land,” they were not being duplicitous. They were being completely honest – this is what they meant. It is why the Maggid explains, “and he resided there” to mean, they did not come to Egypt to settle there. (While Joseph tried to trick Pharaoh into letting his family settle in Goshen, the brothers’ honest explanation was more affective in convincing Pharaoh to allow them to settle in Goshen. Pharaoh is cleverer than Joseph and he turns on him and makes it clear that he knows Joseph’s true intentions. Thus when the Haggadah says, that they did not come to settle but to reside in Egypt it is clear that the brothers had no intention of staying on but remaining until the end of the famine.)  We have now answered the questions in the forty-ninth and the fiftieth gates.</p>

              <p>We must refer back to where Pharaoh had instructed Joseph in 45,17 - 18 to command his brothers to take their father and &quot;come to me.&quot; These instructions could have either one of two meanings. 1) Joseph should speak to the brothers conveying instructions from Pharaoh. 2) Joseph should speak to them as if he were acting on his own authority. This latter interpretation is more likely to be the correct one. We base this on 45,19 where Joseph is told &quot;you have been commanded, etc.&quot; If the instructions for the migration of Joseph's family had all originated with Pharaoh why would Joseph have to refer to permission he obtained from Pharaoh? One obtains permission after making a request for it. You will note that Joseph had spoken to the brothers about their migration in 46,31 when he was about to speak to Pharaoh about their arrival. The fact that he described the brothers as having &quot;come to me&quot; as opposed to having come to Pharaoh, seems evidence that they did not come in response to Pharaoh's invitation. In our verse, however, he did not describe the brothers as having &quot;come to me,&quot; but simply as &quot;having arrived.&quot; This implied that their arrival was at the behest of Pharaoh. He now wanted Pharaoh to make good on his promise. In response Pharaoh said in verse 6: &quot;your father and your brothers have come to you.&quot; Pharaoh meant to correct any impression Joseph might have had that what he had said in 45,17 -18 should have been construed as an invitation from himself for the brothers to settle there. All Pharaoh had meant was that Joseph had his permission to extend an invitaion to them in Pharaoh's name to settle in the best part of Egypt.</p>

              <p>There are subtle differences between a migration as the result of Pharaoh's direct invitation and one which resulted from an invitation by Joseph which had Pharaoh's approval. On the one hand, it appears that Pharaoh was now anxious to relieve himself of any responsibility towards Joseph's brothers and clan. When a king grants a certain person an elevated status, this is normally considered a permanent gift. Had the brothers' migration been at the direct invitation of Pharaoh their status in the land of Goshen would have been permanent and irrevocable. Pharaoh was concerned lest his invitation would be perceived as that kind of gift. He preferred to have the brothers believe that the land of Goshen was allocated to them by the authority of Joseph. It was valid as long as Joseph was ruler in the land. Just as Joseph's position was not a hereditary one, so the brothers' tenure in Goshen would not be a hereditary one. Both Joseph's position and the brothers' stay in Goshen continued to depend on Pharaoh's pleasure. Pharaoh wanted to make sure that Joseph or the brothers should not think that he, Pharaoh, needed them in order to strengthen his hold on the throne of Egypt.</p>

              <p>There is, however, also a positive aspect of what Pharaoh had said now. Why would Joseph have to appeal to Pharaoh now as if he himself did not wield any authority in the country? Had not Pharaoh given Joseph blanket authority at the time he had appointed him as the absolute ruler over his kingdom? When Pharaoh now said to Joseph that his brothers had come to him, he merely reiterated that Joseph did not need to ask any kind of permission. Joseph's authority included the area concerning which he had now asked Pharaoh's permission. We find something analogous in Yuma 4 where Rabbi Mussiah son of Rabbi Menassiah teaches that there is scriptural proof for the assumption that when one reveals information received by a second person even when one had not been sworn to secrecy, this is forbidden unless specific permission has been granted. When G'd spoke to Moses in Leviticus 1,1, He added that Moses should communicate His words by adding the word לאמור. Accordingly, Pharaoh had to tell Joseph to extend the invitation in his name. Although this diminishes the value of Pharaoh's invitation slightly, it is not materially different from what Pharaoh had said in chapter 45.</p>

              <p>We may also see some additional significance in the word אליך in verse five. The reason Pharaoh did command the brothers to migrate to Egypt was only in order to demonstrate that Joseph had never been a slave and had been born into a very respectable family. While it was true that on the face of it this had been demonstrated at the time when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, he had not yet freed himself completely from the suspicion that the &quot;brothers&quot; were a group of bachelors with whom Joseph had made a deal that they should claim to be his family. We find that Bereshit Rabbah 100,9 refers to such a possibility in connection with Genesis 50,21 where Joseph is described as: &quot;he consoled them and put their minds at ease.&quot; The Midrash describes that Joseph put his brothers' minds at ease by telling them that if he were to take any punitive action against them now the Egyptians would question his claim that they were his family and would argue that at the time that he, Joseph, identified them as his brothers this had been a charade, and that they had only been a group of young men whom he had paid to misrepresent themselves. When Pharaoh said to Joseph &quot;your brothers have come to you,&quot; he meant that the brothers' presence in Egypt would buttress Joseph's claim concerning his ancestry.</p>

              <p>And He sojourned there: Jacob hoped that his family would not suffer from subjugation and oppression but that they would simply be sojourners in a foreign land. He also didn’t want his family to become too settled in an impure land. That is why he said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land because there is no pasturage in Canaan, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan.” This is what Nachmanides writes. If it had been their intention to remain in Egypt a long time, they would have spread throughout the land and become more assimilated in the country. They remained within a small prescribed area so that when the time came to return to Canaan it would be easy to organize the return trip. That is why all the people lived in the land of Goshen. Now let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen: Jacob wanted his family to dwell together in Goshen so that they wouldn’t intermingle with the rest of Egypt. Also, the land of Goshen technically belonged to his family because it was given to Sarah by Pharaoh during Abraham’s brief sojourn in the land of Egypt many years before.  (Pirkei D’Rebbe Eliezer 26)  So Jacob made two requests of Pharaoh; the first, to remain in Egypt and second, to dwell in the land of Goshen. Pharaoh had already given Joseph permission to allow his family to remain in Egypt. Jacob now asked to dwell in Goshen.  “Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “As regards your father and brothers…settle…in the best part of the land…put them in charge of my live stock.” (Genesis 47:5)  We see here that the Israelites went down to Goshen so that they could care for Pharaoh’s flocks. Since they were charged with caring for his flocks, they ruled over the lamb, which was considered one of the gods of Egypt. We learn that the Israelites went down to Goshen because of the flock and they left Egypt because of the flock, as it is written, “Go, pick out lambs for your family and slaughter the Passover offering.” (Exodus 12:21 See Yalkut Reuveni Parshat Vayigash and Kanfei Yona (Rabbi Menachem Azarya of Fano)) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>&quot;And he resided there&quot; – this teaches that he didn't go down to settle there, but rather to reside there, as it is stated, &quot;And they said to Pharaoh, to reside in the land have we come, since there is not enough pasture for your servant's flocks, since the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan, and now please grant that your servants should dwell in the land of Goshen.&quot; (Gen. 47:4) The Maggid did not interpret, “And he resided there” as a reference to settling permanently in Egypt as we see elsewhere, “And Jacob resided in the land of Ham,” (Ps. 105:23) for two reasons. First, because if this is what the text meant, it would have been more fitting for it to say, “And he dwelled there.” (Vayeshev sham) (Vayeshev means to settle permanently while vayagar is to reside for a limited amount of time.)  The descendants of Jacob actually dwelled there a long time and were already residents of the land. So why does Scripture use “residing” (geirut) if it doesn’t reflect their intention when they came there… The second reason is that Scripture states, “They resided there few in number.” This implies that the residing must have taken place at the beginning of their stay in Egypt when they were still few in number, only seventy. The verse is referring to the time soon after they arrived in Egypt. The most direct explanation of the verse, ‘They resided there few in number” reflects their thinking when they first arrived and not when they had been dwelling for a while in Egypt. About this (later period of their residence in Egypt) it states, “and there they became a great and mighty nation.” (As happened during many periods of Israel exile, what began as residence quickly turned into settlement. Jacob and his family came planning to reside for a short time in Egypt but they became as great nation when they remained there permanently.)  A proof is brought for this from the verse, “to reside in the land have we come.” (Gen. 47:7) The Maggid understood from the true meaning of the story of Joseph; Joseph only told the brothers to bring their father to Egypt to live there during the years of the famine, as he said, “And here I will nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine, lest you, and your household and all you have come to poverty.” (Gen. 45:11) He thought that after the famine ended, they would return to Canaan. When they arrived in Egypt Joseph planned to dupe Pharaoh into allowing them to settle the land of Goshen. He ordered his brothers, when he presented them to Pharaoh and he asked them what type of work they did, to say, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34) He then told them the reason why they should say this, “That you may live in the land of Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.” (Gen. 46:34) Because of this the Egyptians would not want them to dwell in Egypt. Even though this advice was for their benefit and there can be no doubt that it was true that both they and their ancestors were shepherds, still Joseph had them say this so Pharaoh would not suspect that they came to Egypt to eat his food, and that Joseph was going to give it to them from the king’s treasury. The brothers came before Pharaoh and when he asked them, “What is your trade,” they answered as Joseph instructed them, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our ancestors;” this would have been enough for them to say. So why did they add, “And they said, ‘Moreover, we have come to reside in the land.’” (Gen. 47:4) Also why did they explicitly ask Pharaoh, “Let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” (Gen. 47:4) It was not Joseph’s intention that they should ask for the land of Goshen but rather they should answer him in this way so that Pharaoh himself would offer it to them. Yet the truth of the matter became apparent when they said, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34). They became silent thinking that Pharaoh would answer, “Then go dwell in the land of Goshen…” But upon hearing this Pharaoh didn’t say anything so the brothers felt it was necessary to add the second part of the statement, “They said, to reside in the land we have come.” This was an unexpected statement and it made known the truth of their intentions, that it was not their plan to continue to dwell in the land but to reside there temporarily because of the pressing needs of their herds and because the famine was severe in Canaan. Then they asked him clearly to give them permission to dwell in Goshen for the sake of their herds for a limited time. To this second request Pharaoh did not answer directly; rather he turned to Joseph and said, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.” (Gen. 47:5) He said to Joseph, ‘’All of this was to fool me, for your father and brothers came because of their herds and you can see that other shepherds have not come from Canaan. The truth is they came “To you” – because you are a leader in my land and so you can support them. They want to dwell in the land of Goshen and I want things to go well for them. Since that is the case, “Behold the land is before you; let your father and your brothers live in the best of the land.” (Gen. 47:6) From this it has been explained that when the brothers said, “We have come to reside in the land,” they were not being duplicitous. They were being completely honest – this is what they meant. It is why the Maggid explains, “and he resided there” to mean, they did not come to Egypt to settle there. (While Joseph tried to trick Pharaoh into letting his family settle in Goshen, the brothers’ honest explanation was more affective in convincing Pharaoh to allow them to settle in Goshen. Pharaoh is cleverer than Joseph and he turns on him and makes it clear that he knows Joseph’s true intentions. Thus when the Haggadah says, that they did not come to settle but to reside in Egypt it is clear that the brothers had no intention of staying on but remaining until the end of the famine.)  We have now answered the questions in the forty-ninth and the fiftieth gates.</p>

          </summary>
          <details>
            <summary>In Genesis 47:6:1, Ibn Ezra explains that the rulers over cattle were likely in charge of horses and mules, as the Egyptians did not keep sheep. Rashbam interprets &quot;men of valor&quot; as capable commandants or ministers, with the ability to tend to livestock. Or HaChaim clarifies that Pharaoh specified that the brothers should dwell in the best part of Goshen to avoid misunderstandings, while Radak and Tur HaArokh suggest that the rulers were capable livestock breeders. Rashi and Siftei Chakhamim emphasize that the term &quot;men of valor&quot; refers to those skilled in tending sheep. Steinsaltz notes that although Egyptians did not shepherd, they owned livestock for other purposes. Chizkuni also explains that the rulers were appointed over livestock, specifically camels, mules, and horses.</summary>

              <p>במיטב הארץ הושב את אביך, “in the most fertile part of the land settle your father!;” seeing that he is aged and is only looking for peace and quiet and clean air, let him dwell in that part of the land; as far as your brothers are concerned, let them settle in the region of Goshen which has excellent grazing land. Our author continues with: “Do not tell me that the cantillation mark etnachta under the words: ואת אחיך clearly contradicts this interpretation.” This is not the only time that an etnachta, divisive cantillation mark, does not override the plain meaning of the verse. To mention just one:Judges 5,18 זבולון עם חרף נפשו למות ונפתל על מרומי שדה; “Zevulun is a people that mocketh at death; Naftaly on the open heights.” The etnachta under the word Naftaly in that verse is not meant to be divisive. Devorah surely lauded both those tribes as partners.</p>

An alternate exegesis: Seeing that the areas in which defenseless sheep, goats and cows graze in the desert, an area where there are wild animals and robbers, the shepherds looking after them must be strong, able and capable of defending them.</p>

If Pharaoh were not to confirm this specifically, Joseph might think that he did not want them to reside in Goshen. If, on the other hand, he were to say only that the brothers should reside in Goshen without adding the words &quot;in the best part of the land,&quot; Joseph might feel that Pharaoh only assigned the inferior part of the province of Goshen to them. To avoid any misunderstanding, Pharaoh spelled out that the brothers should reside in the best part of the land of Goshen. Verse eleven then confirms that this is indeed what happened, that the land around Ramses was considered the best part of Goshen.</p>

If Jethro who did not come near Moses for anything else but his own honor was so rewarded, how much more then should a man he rewarded, who takes learned men in his house, feeds them, gives them drink and lets them enjoy of his wealth?' R. Jose opened in honor of the one who is hospitable and preached: Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wert a stranger in his land (Deu. 23, 8). &quot;Can this not be concluded through the rule of a fortiori? If the Egyptians who came nigh unto Israel for their own benefit only, as is said (Gen. 47, 6.) And if thou knowest that there are among them men of activity, then appoint them rulers over my cattle, were so protected; how much more then, should he be protected who takes in a learned man and gives him food and drink and lets him enjoy of their wealth?&quot; R.

              <p>And Moses was tending... in the midst of a flame of fire from within the thorn bush. Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai asks: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself from the heavens and speak to Moses from within the thorn bush? What is so special about this thorn bush, which is more formidable than all the trees in the world, such that any bird that enters it does not emerge from it in peace, but rather is cut to pieces? Similarly, the servitude in Egypt was harsher before God than any other servitude in the world. No slave or maidservant ever went free from Egypt, except for Hagar, as it is said (Genesis 12:20): &quot;And Pharaoh commanded men concerning him, and they sent him away, him and his wife and all that he had.&quot;  Another interpretation of &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: Rabbi Joshua says: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself from the heavens and speak to Moses from within the thorn bush? Whenever Israel is in distress, it is as if He Himself is in distress, as it is said (Isaiah 63:9): &quot;In all their affliction, He was afflicted.&quot; And it says (Psalms 91:15): &quot;I am with him in distress.&quot; And it says (Zechariah 2:12): &quot;For whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye.&quot; The scripture likens this to anyone who harms Israel is, so to speak, harming the One who spoke and brought the world into being. Thus, Rabbi Joshua says: Come and see the extent of God's compassion and merits for Israel. When they descended to Egypt, the Divine Presence went with them, as it is said (Genesis 46:4): &quot;I will go down with you to Egypt.&quot; When they ascended, the Divine Presence ascended with them, as it is said (ibid): &quot;And I will also surely bring you up again.&quot; When they went down to the sea, the Divine Presence was with them, as it is said (Exodus 14:19): &quot;And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved.&quot; When they came to the desert, the Divine Presence was with them, as it is said (Deuteronomy 1:31): &quot;In the wilderness, where you saw how the Lord your God carried you.&quot; When they were in distress, as it were, He was with them in distress, as it is said &quot;from within the thorn bush.&quot; When they were at ease, He was with them in comfort, as it is said (Psalms 106:5): &quot;That I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation, that I may glory with Your inheritance.&quot;  Another interpretation of &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: Rabbi Yosi says: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself from the heavens and speak to Moses from within the thorn bush? Because it is pure, and the nations of the world do not make it into an idol.  Another interpretation of &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: A certain non-Jew asked Rabban Gamaliel: &quot;Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself to Moses from within the thorn bush?&quot; He replied: &quot;Had He revealed Himself upon a single carob or fig tree, you would have said that there is a place on earth devoid of the Divine Presence. Now that He revealed Himself upon a thorn bush, it teaches you that there is no place on earth devoid of the Divine Presence.&quot;  Another interpretation of &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: Rabbi Yosi says: Why &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;? Just as with a thorn bush, if a person inserts his hand into it, he is not harmed because its thorns point downward. But if he wishes to withdraw his hand, the thorns grasp it. Similarly, when the Israelites descended to Egypt, the Egyptians welcomed them, as it is said (Genesis 47:6): &quot;The land of Egypt is before you; in the best of the land make your father and brothers to dwell.&quot; But when they wished to leave, the Egyptians held them back, as it is said (Exodus 5:2): &quot;I will not let Israel go.&quot;  Rabbi Eliezer says: Moses saw a great miracle from within the thorn bush: he saw the bush burning yet not consumed by the fire. If you are astonished by this, consider Aaron's staff, which was dry wood, yet it produced almonds and blossoms.  Another interpretation of why &quot;from within the thorn bush&quot;: Rabbi Elazar ben Arach says: Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, reveal Himself from the heavens and speak to Moses from within the thorn bush? Although God could have spoken from the tops of mountains or the heights of the world or the cedars of Lebanon, He humbled Himself and spoke from a lowly thorn bush. Regarding this, Solomon said (Proverbs 29:23): &quot;A man's pride shall bring him low, but he who is of a humble spirit shall obtain honor.&quot; You will not find any tree more humble than the thorn bush. And it also says (Psalms 138:6): &quot;For though the Lord is high, He regards the lowly.&quot;</p>

              <p>זאב יטרף, “a wolf that will attack and kill most domesticated animals.” The wolf consumes in the morning sufficient parts of his prey to last him until evening, after which he distributes the remains to its young. The blessing has been worded as a parable. The letter ו at the beginning of the word: ולערב, is unnecessary; there are many such unnecessary letters in the Torah, and especially when the text is not prose but poetry. There is no point in arguing that from the cantillation mark etnachta under the word עד that it is divisive; I have already explained this in Genesis 47,6 in connection with the words: במיטב הארץ, under the word אחיך where I listed a number of examples that the etnachta is not always a divisive cantillation mark, or rather, that it does not always override the plain meaning of the verse.</p>

              <p>Bereishit 47:1-6, with Rashi to Pasuk 2, teaches that Yosef does not want his brothers to serve in Paroh’s administration. What accounts for the difference? Several TABC Talmidim suggest that Yosef feared his overloading Paroh’s administration with Jews. Too many Jews in Paroh’s government, he feared, would trigger mass hatred for the Jews (TABC Talmid Avi Tepler argues that only after Hashem performed the extraordinary Nissim recorded in Daniel Perek 2 was Daniel comfortable with advocating higher positions for Chananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.) . TABC Talmidim Shimshy Gordon, Elisha Markovitz, Akiva Prager and Yitzi Weis note that Yosef wanted them to avoid service in the Egyptian military. The Talmidim explain: “When you join the military, they can be negatively influenced. They also do not have a real position of power where they can help Am Yisrael in Egypt (It is important to note that after Yosef died, none of Bnei Yisrael made an effort to serve as a successor to Yosef and advise Paroh. This left us in the dangerous position where no one advocated for us when Paroh began to conspire to eliminate our nation. The Gemara (Sotah 11a) describes Paroh’s conference with Bilaam, Yitro, and Iyov when Paroh introduces his “final solution” for the Jews. Conspicuously, no one at the meeting advocated on behalf of the Jews. We paid a steep price for our lack of political involvement. This underlines the critical importance of AIPAC and NORPAC advocacy for the strengthening of the American-Israeli alliance.) . Soldiers are expected to follow orders (TABC Talmid Eli Rubin reminds us of the Mishna’s teaching (Avot 1:10) to distance oneself from the government. However, Rav Ovadia Bartenura’s first explanation of this phrase is that one should not assume such a position with the opportunity to wield power and authority. The explanation fits with the context of this Mishna as well as Daniel 2:49. This implies that one may seek such office if his intention is thereby to serve Am Yisrael. ) ”.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>&quot;And he resided there&quot; – this teaches that he didn't go down to settle there, but rather to reside there, as it is stated, &quot;And they said to Pharaoh, to reside in the land have we come, since there is not enough pasture for your servant's flocks, since the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan, and now please grant that your servants should dwell in the land of Goshen.&quot; (Gen. 47:4) The Maggid did not interpret, “And he resided there” as a reference to settling permanently in Egypt as we see elsewhere, “And Jacob resided in the land of Ham,” (Ps. 105:23) for two reasons. First, because if this is what the text meant, it would have been more fitting for it to say, “And he dwelled there.” (Vayeshev sham) (Vayeshev means to settle permanently while vayagar is to reside for a limited amount of time.)  The descendants of Jacob actually dwelled there a long time and were already residents of the land. So why does Scripture use “residing” (geirut) if it doesn’t reflect their intention when they came there… The second reason is that Scripture states, “They resided there few in number.” This implies that the residing must have taken place at the beginning of their stay in Egypt when they were still few in number, only seventy. The verse is referring to the time soon after they arrived in Egypt. The most direct explanation of the verse, ‘They resided there few in number” reflects their thinking when they first arrived and not when they had been dwelling for a while in Egypt. About this (later period of their residence in Egypt) it states, “and there they became a great and mighty nation.” (As happened during many periods of Israel exile, what began as residence quickly turned into settlement. Jacob and his family came planning to reside for a short time in Egypt but they became as great nation when they remained there permanently.)  A proof is brought for this from the verse, “to reside in the land have we come.” (Gen. 47:7) The Maggid understood from the true meaning of the story of Joseph; Joseph only told the brothers to bring their father to Egypt to live there during the years of the famine, as he said, “And here I will nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine, lest you, and your household and all you have come to poverty.” (Gen. 45:11) He thought that after the famine ended, they would return to Canaan. When they arrived in Egypt Joseph planned to dupe Pharaoh into allowing them to settle the land of Goshen. He ordered his brothers, when he presented them to Pharaoh and he asked them what type of work they did, to say, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34) He then told them the reason why they should say this, “That you may live in the land of Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.” (Gen. 46:34) Because of this the Egyptians would not want them to dwell in Egypt. Even though this advice was for their benefit and there can be no doubt that it was true that both they and their ancestors were shepherds, still Joseph had them say this so Pharaoh would not suspect that they came to Egypt to eat his food, and that Joseph was going to give it to them from the king’s treasury. The brothers came before Pharaoh and when he asked them, “What is your trade,” they answered as Joseph instructed them, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our ancestors;” this would have been enough for them to say. So why did they add, “And they said, ‘Moreover, we have come to reside in the land.’” (Gen. 47:4) Also why did they explicitly ask Pharaoh, “Let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” (Gen. 47:4) It was not Joseph’s intention that they should ask for the land of Goshen but rather they should answer him in this way so that Pharaoh himself would offer it to them. Yet the truth of the matter became apparent when they said, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34). They became silent thinking that Pharaoh would answer, “Then go dwell in the land of Goshen…” But upon hearing this Pharaoh didn’t say anything so the brothers felt it was necessary to add the second part of the statement, “They said, to reside in the land we have come.” This was an unexpected statement and it made known the truth of their intentions, that it was not their plan to continue to dwell in the land but to reside there temporarily because of the pressing needs of their herds and because the famine was severe in Canaan. Then they asked him clearly to give them permission to dwell in Goshen for the sake of their herds for a limited time. To this second request Pharaoh did not answer directly; rather he turned to Joseph and said, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.” (Gen. 47:5) He said to Joseph, ‘’All of this was to fool me, for your father and brothers came because of their herds and you can see that other shepherds have not come from Canaan. The truth is they came “To you” – because you are a leader in my land and so you can support them. They want to dwell in the land of Goshen and I want things to go well for them. Since that is the case, “Behold the land is before you; let your father and your brothers live in the best of the land.” (Gen. 47:6) From this it has been explained that when the brothers said, “We have come to reside in the land,” they were not being duplicitous. They were being completely honest – this is what they meant. It is why the Maggid explains, “and he resided there” to mean, they did not come to Egypt to settle there. (While Joseph tried to trick Pharaoh into letting his family settle in Goshen, the brothers’ honest explanation was more affective in convincing Pharaoh to allow them to settle in Goshen. Pharaoh is cleverer than Joseph and he turns on him and makes it clear that he knows Joseph’s true intentions. Thus when the Haggadah says, that they did not come to settle but to reside in Egypt it is clear that the brothers had no intention of staying on but remaining until the end of the famine.)  We have now answered the questions in the forty-ninth and the fiftieth gates.</p>

G’d’s decrees, (negative ones) are definitive unless a ‎‎tzaddik intervenes and asks Him to cancel or to “soften” ‎them. On the other hand, the tzaddik has no power to ‎cancel or “soften” a decree by G’d which is manifestly beneficial ‎for the people concerned. When we read in 47,7 that Joseph ‎introduced his aged father Yaakov to Pharaoh, the Torah ‎describes this with the words: ‎ויעמידהו לפני פרעה‎, “he made him ‎stand (not bow) before Pharaoh.” This was a hint that his father ‎had the power to affect G’d’s negative decrees which his son had ‎predicted. In other words, although G’d had taken him, and ‎through him, Pharaoh, into His confidence, Yaakov, Joseph’s ‎father took precedence over both Joseph and Pharaoh in his ‎intimacy which G’d.‎</p>

              <p>ויברך יעקב את פרעה. He greeted him (bestowed a blessing) as is customary when one is introduced to the king. The custom is highlighted in Kings II 4,29 where Elisha told Gechazi not to respond to anyone’s greeting. Yaakov blessed Pharaoh again upon leaving after the audience. I have not found a satisfactory explanation why the Torah had to report something so ordinary.</p>

              <p>AND JACOB BLESSED PHARAOH. This refers to a salutation, as is customary for all who are granted an occasional interview with kings. Thus the language of Rashi. But this does not appear to be so, for it is not royal protocol for a person to greet the king, and the Rabbis have similarly said: (Shabbath 89a.)  “May a servant greet the king?” Instead, it refers to a real blessing which Jacob bestowed upon Pharaoh, for it is customary for aged and pious people who come before kings to bless them with wealth, possessions, honor, and the advancement of their kingdom, even as Scripture says, Let my lord king David live forever. (I Kings 1:31.)  Upon his taking leave of Pharaoh, Jacob again blessed him (Verse 10 here.)  in order to take permission to leave. Our Rabbis have said (Tanchuma Naso 26, and mentioned here by Rashi.)  that he blessed him that the Nile might rise at his approach.</p>

              <p>“Jacob greeted Pharaoh” [47:7]. Joseph brought his father before Pharaoh, and Jacob greeted Pharaoh. Pharaoh asked Jacob: how old are you? Jacob responded: all my days I have been a stranger and wandered from one city to the other city and had no good in my days. Therefore, do not think that I am old, but my face is looks old from troubles and worries. My parents were all older than me. Hizkuni writes. The Holy One said to Jacob: I protected you from Esau, from Laban, and from Shechem and returned Dinah and Joseph to you. You said that you had evil, bad and few years. For this reason, I will diminish thirty-three years less than your parents from you, as many extra words that you spoke. For each word you must live one year less. From here we learn that a person should always praise God, even when not everything goes well and one should not talk against God who does everything for good. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 47:8.)  Imre Noam writes. Pharaoh asked Jacob: how old are you, because Jacob had said that he would remain in Egypt until the end of the famine. Afterwards, he would return to the land of Canaan. Therefore, Pharaoh asked, how old are you. That is, you think you will live long enough that you want to return to the land of Canaan after the famine. The Midrash (Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, V: 360, cites the Imre Noam as the source of this story, and does not cite a midrashic source.)  writes that Pharaoh was with Abimelech when Abraham came before Abimelech. This Abimelech had a very low gate and an image of the idol was over the gate. Each person who wanted to visit Abimelech through that gate, had to bow down. When Abraham came to that gate, the gate rose, so that Abraham should not have to bow down to the image. Pharaoh in Egypt also had a gate with this image. When Jacob came, the gate went up. Pharaoh asked Jacob: how old are you? Pharaoh had thought that this was Abraham because the gate went up. (Imre Noam, Genesis, 47:8.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>Chapter 42: Writings [1] &quot;The earth is filled with the abundance of God's waters&quot; (Psalms 65:10). &quot;With the abundance of the good things that they have, they will enjoy them&quot; (Ecclesiastes 5:18). &quot;When the righteous are numerous in the world, good things come to the world, as it is said, 'When the righteous are many, the people rejoice'&quot; (Proverbs 29:2). Similarly, Moses said, &quot;So that it may go well with you and your children after you forever&quot; (Deuteronomy 12:28), &quot;When you do what is good and right in the sight of the Lord your God&quot; (Deuteronomy 12:28). And you find in every place that the righteous went, they brought good things with them. Jacob went to Laban's house, and good things went with him, as it is said, &quot;And God blessed me on account of you&quot; (Genesis 30:27), and it is said, &quot;May the Lord bless you as you go&quot; (Genesis 28:15). You find that Laban did not have sons until Jacob came, as it is said, &quot;And he heard the words of Laban's sons&quot; (Genesis 31:1). It is not written here, &quot;Laban's daughters,&quot; but &quot;Laban's sons.&quot; Therefore, &quot;May the Lord bless you as you go&quot; (Genesis 33:30). When Joseph went to Potiphar's house, good things went with him, as it is said, &quot;And the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house because of Joseph&quot; (Genesis 39:5). And when Jacob went to Egypt, he blessed Pharaoh, as it is said, &quot;And Jacob blessed Pharaoh&quot; (Genesis 47:7), so that the Nile rose to meet him. When his granaries were filled, a messenger came to Pharaoh and said to him, &quot;The Nile has risen today to such and such a level,&quot; and immediately the famine ended. This is what is meant by &quot;The earth is filled with the abundance of God's waters.&quot; (Psalms 65:10)</p>

              </summary>
              <p>“A man or woman...” – this is what is written: “All the kings of the earth will praise You [yodukha], Lord, as they heard the words of Your mouth” (Psalms 138:4). Rabbi Pinḥas said: The kings of the nations of the world heard three matters from the Holy One blessed be He, and they stood from their thrones and praised [vehodu]. When the Holy One blessed be He gave the Torah to Israel and said: “I am the Lord your God” (Exodus 20:2), the kings of the nations of the world said: He is saying as we would. What king would want another to reject him? Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He, when He said: “You shall have no [other gods]” (Exodus 20:3), they said: What king would want to have a partner? Likewise, when He said: “You shall not take [the name of the Lord your God in vain]” (Exodus 20:7), they said: What king would want people taking oaths in his name and lying? Likewise, the Holy One blessed be He, when He said: “Remember the Shabbat day” (Exodus 20:8), they said: What king would want people not to honor the day that he rested? But when He said: “Honor [your father and your mother]” (Exodus 20:12), they said: According to our protocols, anyone who registers himself to be subservient to the king, he renounces his parents; but this One declares and says: “Honor your father and your mother”? They arose from their thrones and praised him. (All the more so they praised him regarding the prohibitions against murder, adultery, stealing, bearing false testimony, and coveting.)   When the Holy One blessed be He said: “For what he misappropriated from the sacred he shall pay” (Leviticus 5:16), they said: According to our protocols, anyone who misappropriates a spinning hook from the emperor must give him the blade of a plow, (He is punished much more severely than a person who stole from a commoner, whereas the punishment for one who steals from the sacred (Leviticus 5:16) and one who steals from a commoner (Leviticus 5:24) is the same.)  but this One declares and says: “For what he misappropriated from the sacred he shall pay”? Moreover, He was more stringent regarding [sins against] with the commoner than He was regarding [sins against] the Most High, as regarding the Most High it is written: “A person who will commit a trespass, [and sins unwittingly]…” (Leviticus 5:15), and regarding a commoner it is written: “A person who shall sin, [and commit a trespass against the Lord]” (Leviticus 5:21); the Torah renders it as though it were intentional. (Although in both cases, one incurs liability to bring an offering only if the act was unwitting, regarding the trespass against the commoner, the word unwitting is not mentioned.)  Moreover, regarding this one, it precedes trespass to sin, while regarding that one, it precedes sin to trespass. This is true not only regarding an Israelite, but it is so even regarding one who robs a proselyte. Who is a God like this who loves those who love Him, and draws near the distant like those who come near in His name? They stood from their thrones and praised him.  Do not say it is only righteous proselytes who converted for the sake of Heaven that the Holy One blessed be He draws near; but even those who converted not for the sake of Heaven, the Holy One blessed be He demands an accounting for the affront to them. That is what is written: “There was a famine in the days of David [for three years, year after year, and David entreated of the Lord. The Lord said: For Saul, and for the bloody house, in that he put the Givonites to death]” (II Samuel 21:1). What is “year after year”? It teaches that they were three consecutive years. When David saw that the famine began to come in his days, he said: Due to the iniquity of five matters rain does not fall: It is due to the iniquity of idolaters, of engagers in illicit relations, of shedders of blood, of pledgers of charity in public who do not give, and due to the iniquity of those who do not distribute their tithes properly.   Due to the iniquity of idolaters, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Beware, lest your heart be seduced [and you stray and serve other gods]” (Deuteronomy 11:16), and it says: “The wrath of the Lord will be enflamed against you, [and He will restrain the heavens and there will be no rain]” (Deuteronomy 11:17).  Due to the iniquity of engagers in illicit relations, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “You defiled the land with your licentiousness…” (Jeremiah 3:2), and it says: “Raindrops were withheld and [there was no] late rain” (Jeremiah 3:3).  Due to the iniquity of shedders of blood, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “For blood defiles [yaḥanif] the land” (Numbers 35:33); blood will cause wrath to settle [yiḥan af] upon the land. (From the previous derivation, the result of wrath is: ”And He will restrain the heavens and there will be no rain.”)   Due to the iniquity of pledgers of charity in public who do not give, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Clouds and wind but no rain” (Proverbs 25:14). Why? [Because of] “a man who glories in a false gift” (Proverbs 25:14).  Due to the iniquity of those who do not distribute their tithes properly, from where is it derived? It is as it is stated: “Bring all the tithe to the storehouse…[test Me now with this…if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out an endless blessing for you]” (Malachi 3:10).  During the first year, David began admonishing his generation during the pilgrimage festival, and he said to them: Are there, perhaps, people among you who are idolaters, as the heavens are restrained from having rain fall only due to that iniquity? They went out and sought, but did not find. The second year, he said to them: Are there, perhaps, illicit sexual relations among you, as the heavens are restrained only due to that? They went out and sought, but did not find. The third year, he said to them: Are there, perhaps, shedders of blood, pledgers of charity in public who do not give, or withholders of tithes among you, as the heavens are restrained only due to them? They went out and sought, but did not find.  From then on, David said: The matter is dependent solely upon me. He began consulting the Urim and the Tumim. That is what is written: “David entreated of the Lord” (II Samuel 21:1). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: That [indicates] he consulted the Urim and the Tumim. Rabbi Elazar said that the source of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish is that he derives a verbal analogy: penei, penei. Here it is written: “David entreated of the Lord [penei Hashem],” and there it is written: “Before [velifnei] Elazar the priest he shall stand, and he will inquire for him [regarding the judgment of the Urim before the Lord]” (Numbers 27:21).   The Holy One blessed be He said to him: David, you are protected from sin; rather, it is due to Saul and the bloody house. That is what is written: “The Lord said: For Saul, and for the bloody house, [in that he put the Givonites to death]” (II Samuel 21:1). “For Saul” – because you did not perform kindness with him and he was not eulogized properly. The Holy One blessed be He said to him: David, is he not Saul who was anointed with the anointing oil? Is he not Saul, who, during his reign, no idol worship was performed in Israel? Is he not Saul, whose portion is with Samuel the prophet, and you are in the land [of Israel] and he is outside the land? (He is buried in Yavesh Gilad, which is located east of the Jordan River.)   “And for the bloody house in that he put the Givonites to death” (II Samuel 21:1) – Where do we find that he put the Givonites to death? Rather, due to the fact that he killed [the residents] of Nov, the city of priests, to whom they would supply water and food, the verse ascribes to him as though he put them to death. (The Givonites would earn their livelihood by supplying food and water to Nov.)  Rabbi Elazar said: It is written: “Seek the Lord, all you humble of the earth, who have performed his judgment” (Zephaniah 2:3). What is “who performed his judgment”? It is that he implements His judgment and His reward for performance simultaneously. You find the Holy One blessed be He demanding justice for the Givonites from Saul, and remembering Saul’s deeds in order to pay him a good reward.  At that moment, David said: Is it on behalf of these proselytes that the Holy One blessed be He did so to His people? The Holy One blessed be He said to him: If you distance the distant, ultimately, you will distance those who are near. Come and learn from your master Joshua, who, when the Givonites said: “Come up to us quickly, and save us and help us” (Joshua 10:6), Joshua said: Will we burden the community on behalf of these proselytes? The Holy One blessed be He said to Joshua: If you distance the distant, ultimately, you will distance those who are near. Go out and learn from where are your origins? Are they not from strangers, as it is stated: “To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born…[Manasseh and Ephraim]” (Genesis 46:20), and it is written: “For the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea (Hoshea is Joshua (Numbers 13:16).)  son of Nun (Numbers 13:8)?  Immediately, “the king summoned the Givonites and spoke with them. The Givonites [were not of the children of Israel…and the children of Israel had taken an oath to them]” (II Samuel 21:2). “The Givonites were not of the children of Israel” – how is this matter relevant here? Rather, this is what the verse is saying: Because David summoned the Givonites and spoke with them, but they did not accept it (His offer of compensation.)  from him, that is why “the Givonites were not of the children of Israel,” as David arose and distanced them that they may not marry with the congregation [of Israel]. That is what we learned: The netinim (This is a reference to the Givonites, based on the verse: “Joshua rendered them [vayitnem] that day hewers of wood and drawers of water” (Joshua 9:27).)  may not enter the congregation. (See Mishna Yevamot (78:2).)  At that moment, David said: The Holy One blessed be He gave three gifts to Israel: Being merciful, self-effacing, and performers of acts of kindness. Merciful, as it is stated: “He will give you mercy, and He will be merciful to you, and He will increase you” (Deuteronomy 13:18). Self-effacing, as it is written: “So that His fear will be on your faces, so that you will not sin” (Exodus 20:17) – this is a sign for the self-effacing that they do not sin. Anyone who does not have the quality of self-effacement, it is a certainty that his ancestors did not stand at Mount Sinai. Performers of acts of kindness, as it is stated: “So that he shall command his children and his household [after him…to perform righteousness and justice]” (Genesis 18:19), and it is written: “The Lord your God will maintain for you the covenant and the kindness” (Deuteronomy 7:12). And these have none of these qualities in them. Immediately, he arose and distanced them. That is what is written: “The Givonites were not of the children of Israel” – they are not worthy to become intermingled with them. Even though they are proselytes, their ancestors did not stand at Mount Sinai, because they are considered to be of the Canaanites. That is what is written: “But rather from the remnant of the Emorites” (II Samuel 21:2). What is written in their regard? “You shall not marry them” (Deuteronomy 7:3). These too, like them, are not worthy to cleave to Israel.  One verse says: “The men of Israel said to the Hivites…” (Joshua 9:7), but here, it calls them Emorites. Rather, they were from the Emorites. Why, then, does it call them Hivite? It is because they performed the act of the serpent. (Serpent is ḥivya in Aramaic.)  The serpent said: I know that the Holy One blessed be He said to you: “As on the day that you eat of it you will die” (Genesis 2:17). Rather, I will go and deceive them. They will eat and be punished, and I will inherit the earth for myself. The Givonites did the same. They said: We know that the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: “Rather, you shall destroy them, the Hittites, the Emorites…” (Deuteronomy 20:17), “You shall not make a covenant with them…” (Deuteronomy 7:2). Rather, we will go and deceive them, and they will make a covenant with us. Perforce, either they will put us to death and will violate the oath or they will sustain us and will violate the decree. In any case they will be punished, and we will inherit the land for ourselves. Therefore, when Joshua saw that this was so, he said to them: “Why did you deceive us…?” (Joshua 9:23). Joshua said to them: You performed the act of the serpent; therefore, you will receive the retribution of the serpent. Rabbi Elazar said: He cursed them like the serpent, as it is written: “Now, you are accursed” (Joshua 9:23), just as it is written regarding the serpent: “You are more accursed than all the animals” (Genesis 3:14).  What is, “the children of Israel took an oath to them” (II Samuel 21:2)? David said: When the children of Israel took an oath to them, they left the matter dependent upon me, so that if I wish to distance them or to draw them near, I have license to do so. I am distancing them. From where is it derived that they left the matter dependent upon David? It is written: “Joshua rendered them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water [for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord to this day, in the place that He would choose]” (Joshua 9:27). Rabbi Ami said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: After it said: “For the congregation and for the altar of the Lord,” what need was there to say: “In the place that He would choose [yivḥar]”? Rather, Joshua left it dependent upon David. He said: I will neither draw them near nor distance them. Rather, the one who is destined to build the Temple [beit habeḥira], if he arrives at the decision to draw them near, he will draw them near; to distance them, he will distance them. When David came and saw that they were cruel, he distanced them. Ezra, too, distanced them, as it is written: “The netinim lived in the Ofel…” (Nehemiah 11:21). (They were distinct from the rest of Israel.)  In the future, too, the Holy One blessed be He will distance them, as it is stated: “Those who labor in the city, (The midrash is explaining that “those who labor in the city” refers to the Givonites, who were drawers of water and hewers of wood for the altar in Jerusalem.)  will till it [yaavduhu], from all the tribes of Israel.” (Ezekiel 48:19) – they will be eradicated [ye’abeduhu] from all the tribes of Israel.   “Saul sought to smite them” (II Samuel 21:2) – even though he did not smite them, they acted cruelly toward him. This is to teach you that David did not distance them for naught. “In his zeal on behalf of the children of Israel and Judah” (II Samuel 21:2) – even though Saul became angry at them only due to the zeal that he had on behalf of Israel and Judah, and he did so not due to hatred that he hated them. Nevertheless, they did not have mercy on his offspring. What is that zeal? It is due to the fact that they did not reveal to him where David was hiding.  Immediately, David sent and summoned them: What is with you and the house of Saul? They said to him: It is because he put an end to our livelihood, and he put seven of our people to death; two hewers of wood, two drawers of water, an official, a scribe, and an attendant. He said to them: What do you seek now? That is what is written: “David said to the Givonites: “What shall I do for you? With what shall I atone, so that you will bless the inheritance of the Lord” (II Samuel 21:3)? He said to them: What benefit will there be for you if you kill a person from the house of Saul? Rather, tell me with what remedy shall I provide you so you will be placated? How much silver and gold shall I give you as ransom for your lives? “With what shall I atone [akhaper],” just as it says: “When ransom [kofer] is imposed upon him, he shall give redemption of his life” (Exodus 21:30), so that the famine will cease? That is what is written: “So that you will bless the inheritance of the Lord”; just as it says: “Jacob blessed Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:7), he blessed him that the famine would cease.   “The Givonites said to him: We have [lanu] no silver or gold with Saul or with his house” (II Samuel 21:4) – li is written, but it is read lanu. (Li means “I have,” whereas lanu means “we have.”)  Why is it so? David said to them: ‘What benefit would there be for you in their being killed? Take silver and gold for yourselves.’ They said to him: ‘We do not seek silver and gold from Saul and from his house. He did not owe us any money so that we should take money from him, but rather, he owes us lives and we seek lives.’ David said: Perhaps this half of them is intimidated by the other half. He took each one separately and sought to placate him by himself. He said to him: ‘What benefit would there be for you in their being killed? Take money.’ He said to him: ‘I have no silver or gold with Saul or with his house. We have no interest in seeking any others, but only him, as his servants did not wish to extend their hand against the priests, nor against us,’ as it is stated: “But the king's servants were unwilling to extend their hand to harm the priests of the Lord” (I Samuel 22:17). That is, “We would not have any man in Israel put to death” (II Samuel 21:4).  When David saw that they did not accept it from him, he said to them: ‘What do you say that I should do for you? If it is lives that you seek, I will do it.’ That is what is written: “What do you say that I shall do for you?” (II Samuel 21:4). When David said that to them, they said to him: ‘We do not seek to exact retribution against him for his full measure. He sought to destroy us all, so we would have no standing within the entire boundary of Israel; we are not demanding all his offspring, but only seven, corresponding to the seven that he killed from us.’ That is what is written: “They said to the king: The man who eradicated us [asher kilanu], and who devised against us, [so that we would be destroyed from standing within the entire border of Israel]” (II Samuel 21:5). Asher kilanu contains seven letters, corresponding to the seven people among them whom he put to death. “Let seven men of his offspring be given to us, and we will impale them before the Lord in Giva of Saul, chosen of the Lord” (II Samuel 21:6) – so that the entire world will see, will be afraid, and will no longer continue to mistreat proselytes. That is why it is written: “Before the Lord,” as He commanded to treat proselytes well, but he mistreated them. Why in Giva of Saul? So that they will know that if the Holy One blessed be He did not show favor to the king, all the more so to commoners.  “Chosen of the Lord” (II Samuel 21:6)? They are denouncing him and calling him “chosen of the Lord”? Rather, they said: “In Giva of Saul,” and a Divine Voice emerged and said: “Chosen of the Lord.”  When David saw that his problem was a problem, he told them: ‘I will give.’ That is what is written: “The king said: I will give” (II Samuel 21:6). “The king had compassion for Mefivoshet son of Yonatan [son of Saul]” (II Samuel 21:7) – because he was a great Torah personality, David set his sights on rescuing him from their hand. David said: I will pass them before the altar. Anyone whom the altar accepts will be under its auspices. He passed them before the altar and prayed on his behalf, and the altar went and accepted him. That is what is written: “I cry out to God Most High, to the Almighty who accomplishes for me” (Psalms 57:3); the Holy One blessed be He agreed with David. “The king took the two sons of Ritzpa daughter of Aya, whom she bore to Saul…[and the five sons of Mikhal daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel son of Barzilai the Meḥolatite]” (II Samuel 21:8). But is it not written: “Mikhal daughter of Saul did not have a child until the day of her death” (II Samuel 6:23)? And where is Merav? (Merav was married to Adriel (I Samuel 18:19).)  Say now that they were the sons of Merav, but Mikhal raised them and they are attributed to her name. “He gave them into the hand of the Givonites, and they impaled them on the mountain before the Lord. The seven of them [shevatam] fell together” (II Samuel 21:9). Shevatam is written without a yod; (As opposed to shivatayim.)  this is Mefivoshet, who was spared, who was lacking from the seven.  “And they were put to death during the first days of harvest, at the beginning of barley harvest” (II Samuel 21:9) – it teaches that they were killed on the sixteenth of Nisan, the day on which the omer is sacrificed.  “Ritzpa daughter of Aya took sackcloth, and spread it for herself over the rock [hatzur]” (II Samuel 21:10) – what is “over the rock”? Rabbi Hoshaya said: “As she would say: “The Rock, His deeds are perfect” (Deuteronomy 32:4).  “From the beginning of harvest until water dripped upon them from the heavens” (II Samuel 21:10) – Rabbi Aḥa bar Zevina said in the name of Rabbi Hoshaya the Great: Sanctifying the Name is greater than profaning the Name. Regarding profaning the Name, it is written: “His corpse shall not remain overnight upon the tree” (Deuteronomy 21:23). (Leaving a corpse hanging on the tree for an extended time is considered to be profaning the Name. See Rashi on Deuteronomy 21:23.)  Regarding sanctifying the Name, it is written: “From the beginning of harvest until water dripped upon them from the heavens.” (The sanctification of the Name caused by leaving them on the tree for an extended period outweighs the profanation of the Name caused by leaving them.)  It teaches that they remained hanging from the sixteenth of Nisan until the seventeenth of Marḥeshvan.  But is it not written: “Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, [and sons shall not be put to death for the fathers]” (Deuteronomy 24:16)? But sons died for the sin of their father. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is preferable for one letter to be uprooted from the Torah than to have the name of Heaven profaned in public. The nations of the world were saying: The Torah of these is fraudulent; it is written in their Torah: “His corpse shall not remain overnight” (Deuteronomy 21:23), and these are hanging for seven months. It is written in their Torah: Two are not sentenced on one day, (Mishna Sanhedrin 45b.)  and these seven were [sentenced] together. It is written in the Torah: “Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, [and sons shall not be put to death for the fathers],” but these were killed for the sin of their fathers. They were asking: What did these do that the attribute of justice was altered in their regard? Israel would say to them: ‘It is because their ancestors extended their hand to mistreat unsought proselytes.’ They said to them: ‘What is their nature?’ They [Israel] said to them: ‘These are the proselytes who converted in the days of Joshua.’ They said to them: ‘It is on behalf of these accursed unsought proselytes that the Holy One blessed be He did so to His people? If this is so for the sons of kings, all the more so for commoners. If for these who did not convert for the sake of Heaven, see how the Holy One blessed be He exacted punishment for their blood, one who converts for the sake of Heaven, all the more so. Certainly, there is no god like their God, and there is no nation like their nation, and we should cleave only to this nation, whose God is greater than any god.’ Immediately, many proselytes converted from the nations of the world, at that moment, one hundred fifty thousand, as it is stated: “Solomon counted all the proselytes who were in the Land of Israel, after the count that David his father counted them; and they were found to be one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred” (II Chronicles 2:16). Solomon rendered from among them seventy thousand porters and eighty thousand quarriers in the mountains, as it is stated: “Solomon counted seventy thousand porters [and eighty thousand quarriers in the mountains.]” (II Chronicles 2:1).  Why to that extent? It is to inform that the Holy One blessed be He draws the distant near and supports the distant like the near. Moreover, he gives precedence to the distant over the near, as it is stated: “Peace, peace, for the distant and the near” (Isaiah 57:19). That is, “until water dripped upon them from the heavens” (II Samuel 21:10).   What is “she did not allow the birds of the heavens to rest upon them” (II Samuel 21:10)? Come and see the kindness that Ritzpa daughter of Aya performed on their behalf, as she protected them during the day from the birds of the heavens and at night from the beasts of the field, for seven months. Although the Holy One blessed be He had said to David that it was for Saul, because he was not eulogized properly and he is buried outside the land, David was dilatory regarding the eulogy, as he said: Twelve months of the year have passed already, and it is not customary to mourn for him. When they told him of the actions of Ritzpa daughter of Aya, he reasoned an a fortiori inference himself: If she, who is a woman, acted so in performance of kindness, I, who am king, all the more so. Immediately, he went to perform kindness for them. That is what is written: “It was reported to David what [Ritzpa daughter of Aya] had done.… David went and took the bones of Saul [and the bones of Yonatan his son].… He took up from there the bones of Saul [and the bones of Yonatan his son, and they collected the bones of the impaled]’ (II Samuel 21:11–13). What did David do? He stood and assembled all the elders of Israel and the eminent among them, and they crossed the Jordan and came to Yavesh Gilad. They located the bones of Saul and Yonatan, placed them in a coffin, and crossed the Jordan, as it is stated: “They buried the bones of Saul and Yehonatan his son [in the land of Benjamin in Tzela, in the grave of Kish his father. They did everything that the king commanded]” (II Samuel 21:14). What is “in Tzela, in the grave of Kish his father”? It teaches that they brought him to the border of Jerusalem and buried him there, as Tzela is alongside Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And Tzela, HaElef, and the Yevusite, which is Jerusalem…” (Joshua 18:28).  “They did everything that the king commanded” (II Samuel 21:14) – what did the king command? He commanded that they should circulate Saul’s coffin to each and every tribe. The tribe into which Saul’s coffin entered would emerge, they, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, and they performed kindness for Saul and his sons, so that all of Israel would fulfill their obligation with the performance of acts of kindness. They did so until they reached his ancestral land, to the border of Jerusalem.   When the Holy One blessed be He saw that all of Israel had performed acts of kindness for him and had executed justice for the Givonites, He immediately became filled with mercy and provided rain on the land, as it is stated: “God acceded to the entreaty of the land thereafter” (II Samuel 21:14). We learned the extent to which the Holy One blessed be He draws the distant near, even though they converted not for the sake of Heaven, and it goes without saying regarding righteous proselytes. That is, “all kings of the earth will praise You, Lord…” (Psalms 138:4).</p>

              <p>I will bless those who bless you, and one who curses you, I will curse, and all the families of the earth shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3).  “I will bless those who bless you” – Rabbi Yirmeya said: The Holy One blessed be He was more exacting regarding the honor of the righteous man than regarding His own honor. Regarding His own honor it is written: “For those who honor Me, I will honor, but those who scorn Me will be dishonored” (I Samuel 2:30) – by others. Regarding the honor of the righteous it is written: “I will bless those who bless you, and one who curses you, I will curse” – I, Myself.  It is taught: (This is based on the interpretation of the term venivrekhu (literally translated as “shall be blessed”) as deriving from the word berekh, knee, and meaning to bend the knee.)  These are the blessings (Of the eighteen blessings in the Amida prayer.)  during which a person bows: The blessing of the Patriarchs, at the beginning and the end; the blessing of thanksgiving, at the beginning and the end. One who bows during each blessing, he should be taught not to bow. Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥman said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: A High Priest bows at the beginning of each blessing, and a king bows at the beginning of each blessing and at the end of each blessing. Rabbi Simon said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The king, once he bowed [at the beginning], he would not stand upright until he would complete his entire prayer. That is what is written: “It was when Solomon had concluded praying this entire prayer and entreaty to the Lord that he rose from before the altar of the Lord, from kneeling [mikero’a] on his knees, and his hands were spread heavenward” (I Kings 8:54).  What is keria and what is berikha? (These are two terms for bowing or prostration.)  Rabbi Ḥiyya the Great demonstrated keria before Rabbi, (Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.)  and he became lame [as a result], but he was healed. Bar Sisi demonstrated berikha before Rabbi, and he became lame [as a result], and was not healed. (Standing up from berikha is much more difficult.)   “Shall be blessed in you” – the rains are due to your merit, the dews are due to your merit.   That is what is written: “The matter became known to Mordekhai, and he told Queen Esther…” (Esther 2:22). (Mordekhai found out about an assassination attempt against Aḥashverosh, and he warned him about it.)  This one [Mordekhai] is circumcised and that one [Aḥashverosh] is uncircumcised, and he took pity on him? That is astonishing. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya, Rabbi Yehuda says: [Mordekhai said:] ‘“I gain insight from the elders, for I uphold Your edicts” (Psalms 119:100) – Jacob blessed Pharaoh, as it is stated: “Jacob blessed Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:7). Joseph revealed [the dream] to him [Pharaoh]. (He interpreted his dreams and revealed to Pharaoh how to conduct himself during the years of famine.)  Daniel revealed [the dream] to Nebuchadnezzar. (He interpreted his dreams and revealed to him how to avoid divine punishment.)  I, too, will do so: “And he told Queen Esther.”’ Rabbi Neḥemya said: The Holy One blessed be He said to Abraham our forefather: “All the families of the earth shall be blessed in you” (Genesis 12:3).. If you say that it means that they will be wealthy, they [the gentiles] are more wealthy than they [the Jews]. But rather, it is for consultation. When they encounter trouble, they consult with us and we reveal to them [what to do].</p>

              <p>“The Lord said to me: Do not fear him, as I have delivered him and his entire people and his land into your hand; you shall do to him as you did to Siḥon, king of the Emorites, who lives in Ḥeshbon” (Deuteronomy 3:2).  Another matter, “the Lord said to me: Do not fear him” – “because I will deliver him into your hand” is not written here, but, “as I have delivered him…into your hand.” The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘I have already issued his sentence, from the days of Abraham.’ How so? When Lot, his son’s brother, was taken captive, Og came and informed Abraham, as it is stated: “The fugitive [hapalit] came [and told Abram the Hebrew]” (Genesis 14:13). Reish Lakish said in the name of bar Kappara:  Palit was his name. Why was he called by the name Og? It is because he came and found Abraham engaged in the mitzvot of cakes [ugot] (Matza (see, e.g., Exodus 12:39). )  on Passover. But he did not come for the sake of Heaven, but because of Sarah’s beauty. He said in his heart: ‘I will bring him the news, the regiment will kill him, and I will take his wife Sarah.’ The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Oh wicked one, is that what you say? As you live, I will give you the reward for your legs, and extend your years. (Og lived an exceptionally long life as reward for having gone with his legs to inform Abraham. )  But for what you thought in your heart: I will have Abraham killed, and I will take Sarah; in the hand of her descendants, this man (A reference to Og himself.)  is destined to fall.  Another matter, “as I have delivered him…into your hand” – “because I will deliver him into your hand” is not written here, but, “as I have delivered him…into your hand.” I have already issued his sentence, from the days of Isaac. How so? When Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, he made a feast and invited all the kings of Canaan, as it is stated: “Abraham made a great feast…” (Genesis 21:8). What is “great”? It is that all the prominent men were there. Og, too, was there. At that time they said to Og: ‘Did you not used to say: Abraham is a barren mule and cannot beget children?’ When he saw Isaac, he said: ‘This is nothing, I can kill him with my finger.’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘Is this what you say? [I will extend your years] so that you will see thousands and myriads emerging from him, and in their hand, this man is destined to fall.’  Another matter, “because I will deliver him into your hand” is not written here, but, “I have delivered.” I already issued his sentence from the days of Jacob. How so? When Jacob came in to Pharaoh to bless him, as it is stated: “Jacob blessed Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:7), Og was sitting there. At that moment, Pharaoh said to Og: ‘Did you not used to say: Abraham is a barren mule and cannot beget children? Here is his grandson and seventy of his offspring.’ At that moment, Og began introducing the evil eye upon them. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Oh, wicked one, why are you introducing the evil eye upon my children? May the eye of this man dissolve. This man is destined to fall into their hand.’ That is, “as I have delivered him…into your hand.” The Holy One blessed be He said to Israel: ‘Just as, in this world, the nations of the world would hear your renown and were afraid and terrified of you, so it will be in the future, as it is stated: “All the peoples of the earth will see that the name of the Lord is invoked upon you and they will fear you” (Deuteronomy 28:10).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>&quot;And he resided there&quot; – this teaches that he didn't go down to settle there, but rather to reside there, as it is stated, &quot;And they said to Pharaoh, to reside in the land have we come, since there is not enough pasture for your servant's flocks, since the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan, and now please grant that your servants should dwell in the land of Goshen.&quot; (Gen. 47:4) The Maggid did not interpret, “And he resided there” as a reference to settling permanently in Egypt as we see elsewhere, “And Jacob resided in the land of Ham,” (Ps. 105:23) for two reasons. First, because if this is what the text meant, it would have been more fitting for it to say, “And he dwelled there.” (Vayeshev sham) (Vayeshev means to settle permanently while vayagar is to reside for a limited amount of time.)  The descendants of Jacob actually dwelled there a long time and were already residents of the land. So why does Scripture use “residing” (geirut) if it doesn’t reflect their intention when they came there… The second reason is that Scripture states, “They resided there few in number.” This implies that the residing must have taken place at the beginning of their stay in Egypt when they were still few in number, only seventy. The verse is referring to the time soon after they arrived in Egypt. The most direct explanation of the verse, ‘They resided there few in number” reflects their thinking when they first arrived and not when they had been dwelling for a while in Egypt. About this (later period of their residence in Egypt) it states, “and there they became a great and mighty nation.” (As happened during many periods of Israel exile, what began as residence quickly turned into settlement. Jacob and his family came planning to reside for a short time in Egypt but they became as great nation when they remained there permanently.)  A proof is brought for this from the verse, “to reside in the land have we come.” (Gen. 47:7) The Maggid understood from the true meaning of the story of Joseph; Joseph only told the brothers to bring their father to Egypt to live there during the years of the famine, as he said, “And here I will nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine, lest you, and your household and all you have come to poverty.” (Gen. 45:11) He thought that after the famine ended, they would return to Canaan. When they arrived in Egypt Joseph planned to dupe Pharaoh into allowing them to settle the land of Goshen. He ordered his brothers, when he presented them to Pharaoh and he asked them what type of work they did, to say, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34) He then told them the reason why they should say this, “That you may live in the land of Goshen for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.” (Gen. 46:34) Because of this the Egyptians would not want them to dwell in Egypt. Even though this advice was for their benefit and there can be no doubt that it was true that both they and their ancestors were shepherds, still Joseph had them say this so Pharaoh would not suspect that they came to Egypt to eat his food, and that Joseph was going to give it to them from the king’s treasury. The brothers came before Pharaoh and when he asked them, “What is your trade,” they answered as Joseph instructed them, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our ancestors;” this would have been enough for them to say. So why did they add, “And they said, ‘Moreover, we have come to reside in the land.’” (Gen. 47:4) Also why did they explicitly ask Pharaoh, “Let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” (Gen. 47:4) It was not Joseph’s intention that they should ask for the land of Goshen but rather they should answer him in this way so that Pharaoh himself would offer it to them. Yet the truth of the matter became apparent when they said, “Your servants trade has been keeping cattle from our youth until now, and also our ancestors,” (Gen 46:34). They became silent thinking that Pharaoh would answer, “Then go dwell in the land of Goshen…” But upon hearing this Pharaoh didn’t say anything so the brothers felt it was necessary to add the second part of the statement, “They said, to reside in the land we have come.” This was an unexpected statement and it made known the truth of their intentions, that it was not their plan to continue to dwell in the land but to reside there temporarily because of the pressing needs of their herds and because the famine was severe in Canaan. Then they asked him clearly to give them permission to dwell in Goshen for the sake of their herds for a limited time. To this second request Pharaoh did not answer directly; rather he turned to Joseph and said, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.” (Gen. 47:5) He said to Joseph, ‘’All of this was to fool me, for your father and brothers came because of their herds and you can see that other shepherds have not come from Canaan. The truth is they came “To you” – because you are a leader in my land and so you can support them. They want to dwell in the land of Goshen and I want things to go well for them. Since that is the case, “Behold the land is before you; let your father and your brothers live in the best of the land.” (Gen. 47:6) From this it has been explained that when the brothers said, “We have come to reside in the land,” they were not being duplicitous. They were being completely honest – this is what they meant. It is why the Maggid explains, “and he resided there” to mean, they did not come to Egypt to settle there. (While Joseph tried to trick Pharaoh into letting his family settle in Goshen, the brothers’ honest explanation was more affective in convincing Pharaoh to allow them to settle in Goshen. Pharaoh is cleverer than Joseph and he turns on him and makes it clear that he knows Joseph’s true intentions. Thus when the Haggadah says, that they did not come to settle but to reside in Egypt it is clear that the brothers had no intention of staying on but remaining until the end of the famine.)  We have now answered the questions in the forty-ninth and the fiftieth gates.</p>

Yaakov explained that his troubled life had aged him, contrasting his own experiences with those of his forefathers. G-d shortened Yaakov's lifespan by 33 years for complaining about his life to Pharaoh. Yaakov emphasized that his time on earth was temporary, marked by sorrow, and that he lived each day meaningfully.

              </summary>
              <p>?כמה ימי שני חייך, “how old are you?” Pharaoh was under the impression that Yaakov was extremely old, as he bore the marks of his sorrow filled life marked on his facial features. Yaakov replied: “do not be surprised that I look so old, the experiences that I have undergone during my life thus far have left their mark on me.” A Midrash quote G-d as responding to Yaakov describing his life as a series of harsh experiences by pointing out that no one before had been protected from as many dangers facing him as had Yaakov. According to these Midrash, the reason why Yaakov lived 33 years less than his father and 28 years less than his grandfather was onaccount of his not having appreciated all that G-d had done for him. The number 33 is arrived at by counting the number of words in verse 8 of our chapter commencing from the word: ויאמר up to and including the word: מגוריהם in verse 9.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>כמה ימי שני חייך, “for how many years have you lived thus far?” Pharaoh was probably prompted to ask this unusual question of his guest as he looked as if he was exceedingly old. Yaakov, when replying, did not refer to his having “lived” at all, but described his sojourn on earth as something of a very temporary nature, ימי מגורי, “the days of my being a stranger,” as opposed to ימי שני חיי, “the days of the years the life,” the way the Torah had described the life of his grandmother Sarah at her death, reported in Genesis 23,1. He indicated that as opposed to his forefathers, he had had a very troubled life thus far. This resulted in his features reflecting this. An explanation by the Midrash of this strange sounding conversation between the ruler of the civilised world at the time and Joseph’s father: As soon as Yaakov had uttered the words that his life compared unfavourably with that of his father and grandfather, G–d told him “I have saved you from Esau and Lavan, I restored your daughter Dinah to you, as well as your son Joseph, and you have the nerve to describe your life on earth in negative terms when speaking to Pharaoh? I am now forced to make sure that you did not tell a lie, by shortening your lifespan when compared to that of your father and grandfather. He therefore deducted a year for each of the words in this reply by Yaakov, i.e. 33 words, so that he died at 147 years, 33 years younger than the lifespan of his father who had lived for 180 years. [This includes the opening blessing and the concluding blessing Yaakov gave to Pharaoh. Ed.]

              <p>כמה ימי שני חייך, “how old are you?” Yaakov appeared to Pharaoh as considerably older than anyone he had seen in Egypt. When Yaakov replied he was careful not to equate the years he had been on earth as “life.” He said: “the days of my sojourn on earth, etc.” This is typical of the righteous. They consider themselves as merely transients in this world. Having established how he related to the experience of living within a body here on earth, he did say: “the days of my life are fewer and have been marked by sorrow.” He used the word “life” in contrast to his fathers who had not experienced such sorrows and who could therefore describe their days of life on earth as “life.” In order for Pharaoh to understand that the term “life” applied to his fathers was merely relative, Yaakov reverted again to describing even the lives of his fathers as “the days of their sojourn.”</p>

              <p>Auch heute sprechen Fürsten, deren Zeit natürlich höchst kostbar ist, bei einer Audienz in der Regel nur ein paar kurze hingeworfene Fragesätze, die aus gleichgültigen Verhältnissen des Anzuredenden herausgegriffen sind. Selten hat aber wohl ein Fürst mehr Feinheit in ein paar Frageworte zu bergen verstanden, als hier Pharao, und noch seltener ein Angeredeter in einem kurzen Antwortsatz mehr Weisheit ausgesprochen, als hier Jakob. Wenn man nach Jahren zählt, rechnet man nicht mehr nach Tagen. Nur bei wenigen auserlesenen Menschen geschiehts, bei denen jeder Tag bedeutungsvoll und von ihnen als besondere Aufgabe betrachtet wird. Der wahre Mensch lebt nicht Jahre, sondern Tage. So in dem großen Psalm Mosches, wo die ganze Weltgeschichte wie ein Traum vorüberzieht, heißt es zuletzt: wenn selbst tausend Jahre Weltgeschichte nichts mehr als eine Minute bedeuten, dann bedeuten die Tage gar nichts. Nur wo die תורה eingezogen und die Tätigkeit des Menschen im Dienste Gottes bestimmt und weiht, da lebt der Mensch Tage, heute hat er Kraft, heute wirkt er, um den Zusammenhang und die Folge völlig unbekümmert, der Tag ist Gott zugezählt und unverloren. &quot;למנות ימינו כן הודע!&quot; &quot;Lehre uns so unsere Tage zählen!&quot; — So spricht auch Pharao hier: Wie viel Tage hast du in den Jahren deines Lebens gelebt? und gibt in dieser Fragestellung den tiefen Eindruck kund, den die ganze Erscheinung Jakobs auf ihn gemacht.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויאמר פרעה כמה ימי שני חייך?, “Pharaoh said to Yaakov: ‘how old are you?’” It is puzzling why Pharaoh suddenly displays such interest in Yaakov’s age. At the same time, it is puzzling why Yaakov, instead of simply telling Pharaoh his age, prefaces his answer with a description of the quality of his life before revealing the quantitative aspect of it. Yaakov meant to explain to Pharaoh that if, contrary to norm, he appeared far older than his actual years this was due to the many trials and tribulations he had experienced in his years on earth. When Yaakov had arrived in Egypt and his sons had described themselves as coming לגור בארץ, to sojourn for a while, this created the impression that Yaakov expected to be around on this planet for quite some time yet. Pharaoh was therefore almost bound to ask him how old he was already, seeing that he had such plans for the future. Yaakov reassured him, that as of this day he was far younger in terms of years, than had been either his father or his grandfather at the time of their respective deaths. The fact that Yaakov really intended to return to Canaan after the famine would have passed had really thrown Pharaoh for a loop.
    According to the Midrash, G’d reacted angrily when He heard that after having been saved by Him miraculously a number of times during his life, Yaakov had the nerve to complain about the quality of his life on earth up until then in the presence of Pharaoh. As a result, Yaakov’s lifespan was reduced by 33 years when compared to the 180 years his father Yitzchok had lived. The number 33 corresponds to the number of words in our verse.

It appears to me that our father Jacob had turned gray, and he appeared very old. Pharaoh wondered about his age, for most people of his time did not live very long as the lifespan of mankind had already been shortened. (See Ramban, above, 5:4.)  He therefore asked him, “How many are the days of the years of thy life, (Verse 8 here.)  as I have not seen a man as aged as you in my entire kingdom?” Then Jacob answered that he was one hundred and thirty years of age, and that he should not wonder at the years he had lived for they are few when compared with the lifespans of his fathers who had lived longer. However, on account of their having been hard years of toil and groaning, he had turned gray and he appeared extremely old.</p>

Both experienced continuous ascents and descents, reflecting the moon's pattern.

              <p>Similarly, Ramban in his commentary on the passage under discussion, comments on the verse mentioning the sovereignty of the sun and the moon, (See Ramban’s commentary to Bereishis 1:18.)  and explains that naming the celestial beings distinguishes and defines the nature of their power. Thus, it is written: (Tehillim 147:4.)  “He counts the sum of the stars, naming them all,” and “He calls them all by name.” (Yeshayahu 40:26.)  Similarly, in the present context, calling the righteous by the moon’s name reflects their nature. In particular, these two – Yaakov and David – are described as small because of their humility and the difficulties that they underwent. Thus, Yaakov declared, (Bereishis 47:9.)  “The days of the years of my sojourning… were few and aggravating.” Indeed, the narratives concerning Yaakov related in the Torah confirm this statement. In the same vein, David was continually beset by many wearisome troubles, as reflected in the stories concerning him. This theme is also expressed in his psalms. Similarly, both Yaakov and David experienced continuous ascents and descents, and were beset by hardships. This reflects the pattern of the moon, which sometimes shines and sometimes is hidden. By identifying the moon with the righteous, God granted it a significant honor, for according to the tradition we have received, the level of the righteous exceeds that of the angels, (See Sanhedrin 93a.)  and certainly that of the celestial beings and their hosts. (For the level of the celestial beings is lower than that of the angels. See Rambam, Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 3:9.)  Therefore, by identifying the righteous with the moon – causing them to share the moon’s nature, with the moon resembling them and them it – God granted the moon a significant honor, praiseworthy quality, and exaltation.</p>

In another interpretation, Rabbi Shmuel and Rabbi Shimon discuss mourning over sins and the foolishness of man, while Rabbi comments on the fragrant plants in the Garden of Eden and the ingratitude of Abraham, Jacob, and the generation of the wilderness towards God.</summary>

              <p>[2] Another interpretation: &quot;Why do you say, O Jacob?&quot; (Isaiah 40:27). Rabbi Shmuel says, &quot;How can a person mourn over sins of the world? Let him examine his own sins that he has overcome.&quot; And Rabbi Shimon says, &quot;How can a person mourn when he is alive and sees this sun? And similarly, Solomon says, 'What advantage does a man have in all his labor under the sun?' (Ecclesiastes 1:3). If it were not enough that he sees the sun, therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Jacob, 'Why do you call out, O Jacob? Why do you say, O Israel?'&quot; As for Rabbi's comment, &quot;The foolishness of man perverts his way&quot; (Proverbs 19:3). Rabbi says there were thirteen types of fragrant plants in the Garden of Eden and ten chambers, as it is said, &quot;In Eden, the garden of God&quot; (Ezekiel 28:13). And God said, &quot;It is not good for man&quot; (Genesis 2:18), he did not need to praise me, but rather he began to complain and say, &quot;The woman You gave me&quot; (Genesis 3:12). And so Abraham went to war and made him king over sixteen kings and I returned their captivity, and he thought it was his reward, so I said to him, &quot;Your reward is very great&quot; (Genesis 15:1). He did not need to thank me, but rather say, &quot;The Lord God, what will You give me?&quot; (Genesis 15:2). And so Jacob said, &quot;With my staff I crossed this Jordan&quot; (Genesis 32:11) and I did all that good for him, and he said to Pharaoh, &quot;Few and evil have been the days of my life&quot; (Genesis 47:9), &quot;I have caused you evil, Jacob, that you speak so.&quot; And similarly, the generation of the wilderness, how many good things I did for them, as it is said, &quot;In the wilderness, where you saw&quot; (Deuteronomy 1:31), and they said, &quot;Our souls loathe this light bread&quot; (Numbers 21:5). Thus it is your blasphemy and your complaint. So why do you say, O Jacob?</p>

              <p>“His offering was one silver dish, its weight one hundred and thirty; one silver basin of seventy shekels, in the sacred shekel; both of them full of high-quality flour mixed with oil as a meal offering” (Numbers 7:55).  “His offering was one silver dish [kaarat]…” – do not read it as kaarat, but rather as akart, corresponding to Jacob, who extracted [akar] the birthright (The birthright refers to the extra portion of the inheritance that the eldest son received.)  from Reuben and gave it to Joseph: “I have given you one portion more than your brothers…” (Genesis 48:22). “Silver” – just as it says: “The tongue of the righteous is choice silver” (Proverbs 10:20), just as he (Silver alludes to the statement made by Jacob, who was righteous.)  said: “Ephraim and Manasseh will be for me like Reuben and Simeon” (Genesis 48:5).  “Its weight one hundred and thirty” – when Jacob descended to Egypt on account of Joseph, he was one hundred and thirty years old, as it is stated: “Jacob said to Pharaoh: The days of the years of my residence are one hundred and thirty years” (Genesis 47:9).  “One silver basin [mizrak]” – corresponding to Joseph, who was cast [shenizrak] from his father and sold to Egypt. “Silver” – after: “The tongue of the righteous is choice silver” (Proverbs 10:20) – what he said to his father (Silver alludes to the statement made by Joseph, who was righteous.) : “Joseph said to his father: Not so, my father, as this is the firstborn; place your right hand upon his head” (Genesis 48:18). “Seventy shekels, in the sacred shekel” – as it was through him that seventy people descended to Egypt. “Both of them full…” – Jacob and Joseph, both of them were full-fledged righteous men and both produced tribes.  “One gold ladle of ten shekels, filled with incense” (Numbers 7:56).  “One gold ladle of ten shekels…” – corresponding to the ten districts of Manasseh, as it is stated: “Ten districts fell to Manasseh” (Joshua 17:5).  “One young bull, one ram, one lamb in its first year, as a burnt offering” (Numbers 7:57).  “One goat as a sin offering” (Numbers 7:58).  “One young bull, one ram [one lamb in its first year, as a burnt offering]; one goat…” – these (This is a reference to the three burnt offerings.)  are three corresponding to the three generations that Joseph saw from Manasseh that received a portion in the land, (This is a reference to the fact that there were three major families named after the three generations following Manasseh, in addition to the family which was named after Manasseh himself. Therefore, the phrase “the sons of Makhir” refers to Makhir himself, Gilad, and Iezer.)  as it is stated: “The children of Makhir son of Manasseh, too, were born at Joseph’s knees” (Genesis 50:23). Likewise, it says: “The sons of Manasseh: For Makhir, the family of the Makhirites, and Makhir begot Gilad.… These are the sons of Gilad: Of Iezer…” (Numbers 26:29–30). Makhir, Gilad, and Iezer – these are three generations that were patrilineal houses that were attributed to Joseph, as Manasseh is attributed to Jacob, just as it says: “And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before my coming to you to Egypt, they are mine” (Genesis 48:5). The fourth, this was Ya’ir son of Manasseh, who received a portion in the land, just as it says: “Ya’ir son of Manasseh went and captured their villages [ḥavot], and he called them Ḥavot Ya’ir” (Numbers 32:41). The three species of burnt offerings corresponded to the sons of Makhir son of Manasseh. (This is referring to what was mentioned above, and is mentioned again since the midrash now also explains what the sin offering signifies.)  The goat sin offering corresponded to Ya’ir, who did not bequeath his portion to his sons, because he did not have sons. That is why he called them (The villages.)  by his name, because he did not have any remnant, and the sons of his brother Makhir inherited his portion.  “And for the peace offering, two bulls, five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year. This was the offering of Gamliel son of Pedatzur” (Numbers 7:59).  “And for the peace offering, two bulls” – corresponding to the tribe of Manasseh, which split into two and received two portions in the land, half of it on the east bank of the Jordan and half in the land of Canaan. “Five rams, five goats, five lambs in their first year” – these are three species, corresponding to three things that Joseph did on behalf of Manasseh, whom he sought to elevate over his brother Ephraim. The first: “Joseph took the two of them, Ephraim in his right hand to the left of Israel, and Manasseh in his left hand to the right of Israel” (Genesis 48:13). The second: “He supported his father’s hand, to remove it from the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh” (Genesis 48:17). The third: “Joseph said to his father: Not so, my father, as this is the firstborn…” (Genesis 48:18).  Why were they five each? It corresponds to the five women from the tribe of Manasseh who took a portion in the land. These were Tzelofḥad’s five daughters, just as it says: “Tzelofḥad’s daughters speak justly; give them a holding for inheritance…” (Numbers 27:7). They were five, as it is stated: “These are the names of his daughters: Maḥla, Noa, Ḥogla, Milka, and Tirtza” (Numbers 27:1). Likewise, Jacob mentioned them in the blessing of Joseph, as it is stated: “Branches [banot] ran atop the wall [alei shur]” (Genesis 49:22); these are Tzelofḥad’s daughters [banot], who received a portion in the land. Alternatively, why were they five each? It corresponds to the blessing that Jacob blessed them: “May they proliferate like fish in the midst of the earth” (Genesis 48:16), and fish were created on the fifth day.  “This was the offering of Gamliel…” – since the Holy One blessed be He saw that he presented the offering in this order, He began lauding his offering: “This was the offering of Gamliel…”</p>

After twelve months the souls of the sinners of Israel who transgressed the Torah and the commandments are consumed and their bodies are consumed and they are turned to dust. Gehinnom spits them out and the wind scatters them underneath the feet of the righteous, as it says “And you shall crush the wicked, for they will be as ash under the soles of your feet…” (Malachi 3:21) But those who separated from the ways of the community, like the Sadducees, and the betrayers and the hypocrites and the heretics, and those who ‘spread their terror in the land of the living,’ and those who denied the resurrection, and those who say Torah is not from heaven, and those who scoff at the words of the Sages – Gehinnom is locked before them and they are judged there forever, as it says “And they shall go out and see the corpses of the people who rebelled against Me…” (Yeshayahu 66:24) Not only this, but the netherworld will cease to be but they will not cease to be, as it says “…and their form will outlast the grave as his dwelling place (zevul).” (Tehillim 49:15) From His dwelling place He will wear out their form, and their form will wear out the netherworld.

              </summary>
              <p>And know about these forefathers: Avraham's beginning was with pain, as he was pursued by Nimrod. But afterwards all of his days were with goodness and blessing. It was only in the days of his youth that he was in pain - before God, may He be blessed, acquired Avraham. But from the time that God, may He be blessed, acquired Avraham, he had goodness all of his days. And that is why at the beginning - before God, may He be blessed, acquired them as a people, when they were in Egypt - Israel was in pain; but when God, may He be blessed, acquired them as a people, Israel had blessing all the time of their beginning. And Yitzchak's beginning was with goodness and blessing; but at the end, his eyes dimmed from seeing. And in the Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 65:9): &quot;Yitzchak originated afflictions, as it is stated (Genesis 27:1), 'And when Yitzchak grew old, and his eyes were dimmed, etc.'&quot; And this shows about Israel that at first they would be with goodliness; but at the end, their eyes would dim as a result of the exile and the subjugation under the nations. And Yaakov also had a unique trait, as most of his days were with pain. And that is that which it states (Genesis 43:14), &quot;And God, the Omnipotent (Sha-ddai)&quot; - the One who said, &quot;Enough&quot; (sheamar, dai) to His world - should say, &quot;Enough,&quot; to my distress (Rashi on Genesis 43:14); and as he said to Pharaoh, &quot;the days of my years have been few and bad&quot; (Genesis 47:9). However at the end of his days, when he came to Yosef, he was already restored from all of his distress. And this too is the reality of the end of Israel. For the exile will be very long; but at the end of days, the exile will recede and they will have goodness.</p>

              <p>I believe that this is also what Onkelos alluded to when he translated סגי לי חדוא , “great joy for me.” This kind of joy is of a type reserved for the hereafter. Joy in this life is something finite and only in the hereafter do we encounter something enduring. This in spite of the fact that Yaakov had experienced more than his fair share of disappointments during his life on earth [ — Compare his own words in Genesis 47,9. Ed.] Our sages in Bereshit Rabbah 76,2 state that “promises made to the righteous by G’d are not ironclad as to their validity during the terrestrial life of the recipient (my translation).” When Yaakov had thought that he had lost Joseph and had said (37,35) “for I will go down to my grave mourning for my son,” this expressed his fear that he had forfeited eternal life. He had come to believe that both Joseph and he himself were slated for purgatory due to sins they had committed. Now that he heard that Joseph was alive he was certain that both he and his son would merit life in the hereafter.</p>

              <p>SIMEON AND LEVI ARE BRETHREN. Jacob is saying that they possess the attribute of kinship for their hearts were inflamed concerning their sister. (Ibid., 34:25-26.)  He is thus stating in their defense that they acted as they did out of their brotherly zeal, thus suggesting [that were it not for this extenuating circumstance], they would have been deserving of great punishment and their sin would have been unforgivable since what they did to the people of Shechem was an act of violence. The correct interpretation appears to me to be that he is saying that Simeon and Levi are real brothers, uniting in fraternity and brotherhood in counsel and deed. Now I have already explained (Ibid., 34:13.)  that Jacob was angry with Simeon and Levi for having committed violence when they killed the people of the city of Shechem, for they (The people of the city committed no wrong. It was Shechem who violated Dinah, and the people were not in a position to protest his action.)  had not sinned against them at all. They even made a covenant with them and they were circumcised, thus being enabled to return to G-d and become included within the people of the household of Abraham, part of the souls that they had gotten in Haran. (Above, 12:5. A reference to the proselytes whom Abraham and Sarah had brought “beneath the sheltering wings of the Shechina” (Rashi, ibid.))  Jacob was additionally angry with them lest people say that the matter was done at his suggestion, thus creating a profaning of G-d’s Name, as people will say that the prophet has committed violence and plunder. This is the intent of the verse, Let my soul not come into their council— (Verse 6 here.)  this is an excuse for he was not in their council when they answered the people of Shechem with subtlety, (Above, 34:13.)  and he was not united in their assembly when they came upon the people of the city and killed them. It was for this reason that he cursed their anger and wrath. (Verse 7 here.)  And so did Onkelos translate: “My soul was not in their council when they assembled to strike, etc.”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>INSTRUMENTS OF VIOLENCE ‘M’CHEIROTHEIHEM.’ According to Onkelos and all commentators, (Rashi and R’dak.)  the meaning of the verse is as if it were written: instruments of violence ‘m’garotheihem’ (in their sojournings). This is similar to the verses: Thy sojourning (‘m’chorothayich’) and thy nativity, (Ezekiel 16:3. There too m’chorothayich is as if it were written m’gorothayich.)  into the land of their sojourn (‘m’churatham’). (Ibid., 29:14.)  Thus the commentators said that the meaning of the verse is that they did violence in the land of their sojourn. (That is, the people lived with them in peace, and they did not act accordingly.)  Now if so, the approximate sense of the verse is as follows: “They had instruments of violence in the land of their sojournings,” it being referred to as “the land of their sojournings” since they lived there afterwards. (At the time when Simeon and Levi wrought punishment upon the city of Shechem, they had just entered the land. How then could Jacob refer to the event as having taken place in the land of their sojourning? Ramban answers that this is a reference to the future.)  But in my opinion Jacob is saying that “the instruments of violence are their dwelling places,” i.e., the essence of their lives, even as the expression, the days of my pilgrimage (‘m’gurai’). (See above, 47:9.)  He is thus saying that the very instruments of violence are their dwelling places for they live and sustain themselves by them. A similar expression is found in the verse: The desert yieldeth them bread for their children. (Job 24:5. The word “yieldeth” is not in the Hebrew text. Ramban interprets the meaning of the verse as follows: “The desert is to him bread for his children,” for there he has the opportunity to rob and plunder. Similarly, the verse here says that the sword is their livelihood. Ramban’s interpretation of the above verse in the book of Job is also found in his commentary to that book. See Kitvei Haramban, I, p. 80.)  And it is on account of this that their father divided them in Jacob (Verse 7 here.)  so that they should not unite and scattered them in Israel so that they should not assemble. This was indeed so, for Simeon’s inheritance in the Land was contained in the inheritance of the children of Judah, as it is written, And their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah, (Joshua 19:1.)  with the cities of Simeon set apart from one another throughout the entire tribe of Judah. And Levi’s inheritance consisted of the Cities of Refuge, (See Numbers 35:1-8.)  which were scattered through all Israel. (See Joshua, Chapter 21.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND THE DAYS OF ADAM AFTER HE BEGOT SETH WERE EIGHT HUNDRED YEARS. Because of the long lives of these first men, Scripture states their ages before they begot children and also afterwards, and then sums them all up in the end until the generations which followed the flood. The reason for their longevity is that the first man, the handiwork of the Holy One, blessed be He, was made in absolute perfection as regards beauty, strength, and height. Even after it was decreed upon him that he be mortal, it was in his nature to live a long time. But when the flood came upon the earth, the atmosphere became tainted, and as a result their days kept on decreasing. Until the flood, their days were about the length of Adam’s; some even lived longer than Adam. (Jered lived 962 years (Verse 20), and Methuselah lived 969 (Verse 27) while Adam lived 930 years (Verse 5).)  And Shem [Noah’s son], who was born before the flood, lived six hundred years; (Genesis, 11:10-11.)  he benefitted from his innate strength, but the tainted air after the flood caused him harm, [hence he died at a younger age than that attained by the preceding generations]. The days of his sons who were born after the flood were still more shortened until they came down to four hundred years. (Ibid., Verses 10-17.)  You can see that this degree of longevity remained with them until the generation of the Dispersion, when the change of climates caused by the Dispersion affected them, and their days were again shortened. Thus you find that the life of Peleg, in whose days the earth was divided, (Ibid., 10:25.)  came down to half their days, i.e., two hundred years. (Ibid., 11:19.)  It would appear that in the generations of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, people lived seventy and eighty years, just as Moses, our teacher, mentioned in his prayer. (Psalms 90:10. The days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years.)  But as for the righteous ones in their generations, The fear of the Eternal prolongeth days (Proverbs 10:27.)  for them. For Pharaoh wondered about Jacob’s old age, and Jacob in turn spoke to him about the long days of his fathers, even as he said, And they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojournings. (Genesis 47:9.)  Now what the Rabbi (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Rambam). See above, Note 139.)  has written in the Moreh Nebuchim (II, 47.)  does not seem right to me, namely, that the longevity was only in those individuals mentioned, while the rest of the people in those generations lived lives of ordinary natural length. He further said that this exception was due to the mode of living and food of such people or by way of a miracle. But these are words without substance. Why should this miracle have happened to them since they were neither prophets nor righteous, nor worthy that a miracle be done for them, especially for generation after generation. And how could a proper mode of living and proper food prolong their years to the extent that they are so many times greater than that of the entire generation? It is possible that there were also others who observed such a mode of living, in which case all or most of them should have attained similar longevity. And how did it happen that enough of the wisdom concerning this good mode of living did not come down to just one of all the sons of Noah after the flood [to enable him to match the longevity of his ancestors], for there was among them a little wisdom of their ancestors even though it steadily decreased from generation to generation?</p>

In Egypt they were 210 years — corresponding to the numerical value of the word רדו (see Rashi in Genesis 42:2) — making altogether 400 years. If, however, you say that they were in Egypt 400 years — well, Kohath was one of those who went down to Egypt with Jacob; go and add up the years of Kohath (130), those of Amram (137), and the 80 years that Moses was old when Israel left Egypt, and you only have about 350, and you really have to deduct all the years that Kohath lived after Amram was born, and those that Amram lived after the birth of Moses (Megillah 9a).</p>

              <p>ויהיו ימי אדם, “Adam’s lifespan amounted to, etc.” Seeing these early generations lived for so many years when compared to the lifespan of man in times after the deluge, the Torah adopted a method of telling us about their inordinately longs life spans immediately after reporting that these people fathered their first children at an age when most of us nowadays have long been buried already. By choosing the method adopted here, the Torah explains why these people married (relatively speaking) so late and did not start a family sooner. Seeing that original man had been fashioned by the Creator Himself, he had been endowed with a more perfect body, enabling him and the first few generations after him, to live longer than usual lives in spite of death having been decreed for the species as a whole. Due to the gradual spiritual corruption of mankind, their bodies were affected negatively also, so that immediately after the deluge the average life span had already shrunk to less that half of what it had been prior to the deluge. After the dispersal as a result of the building of the Tower, the life expectancy shrank further, not least because suddenly man had to adjust to climactic changes during the year in the locations to which they had been dispersed.
    It would seem that the lifetime of people other than the patriarchs had already shrunk to an average of seventy years, (the immediate offspring of Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov excepted) We know this from Moses’ prayer recorded in the Book of Psalms, 90,10, where he describes this number as a “normal.” lifespan. The fact that Pharaoh was dumbfounded when Yaakov told him that he was already 130 years old, seems to support this theory. (Genesis 47,9)
    Maimonides writes that all the people mentioned in the Torah as having attained such longevity were exceptions and that is why their individual life spans have been mentioned. He credits their exceptional longevity to their having been very careful with their diets, foregoing foods which are basically life-shortening. Anyone not mentioned specifically lived a normal lifespan. Nachmanides already questions Maimonides’ opinion, citing the fact that the people mentioned as having lived for so long were not prophets so that G’d should have performed a miracle [I might add that Chanoch, (5,23) whom the Torah described as loyal to G’d, ”walking with Him,” (5,24) lived far fewer years than his not so righteous contemporaries Ed.] Also, why, according to Maimonides, would the נפילים, corrupt individuals, be granted such long lives as the Torah testified that the spies in Moses’ time had encountered?

              <p>ויברך יעקב AND JACOB BLESSED [PHARAOH] — i.e. he gave him the salutation of peace as is usual for all who take their leave of princes — they salute them and depart. A Midrash however understands this more literally and asks, “What was the blessing with which he blessed him? That the waters of the Nile might rise at his approach Because Egypt does not drink (is not irrigated by) rain-water, but the waters of the Nile rise and irrigate it. And from the time when Jacob blessed him and henceforth, whenever Pharaoh came to the Nile it rose at his coming, overflowed its banks and watered the land. Thus it is stated in Tanchuma Yashan 4:2:26 to נשא.</p>

              <p>What blessing did he give him? That the Nile rise as he approached it... This explanation is from Midrash Tanchuma, as Rashi mentions at the end [i.e., older versions of Rashi mentioned Tanchuma as the source]. Accordingly, “Yaakov blessed” means he gave him an actual blessing. But according to the first explanation, it was not an actual blessing. It rather meant: “Those who take leave of royalty, bless them [as a matter of formality]and take their leave.” Therefore, Rashi is asking [according to the Midrash: “What blessing did he give him?” Alternatively, even according to the first explanation that maintains that those who take leave of royalty offer a blessing, but that too is an actual blessing, regarding this [Rashi asks:] “What blessing did he give him?”</p>

              <p>ויברך יעקב את פרעה, ”Yaakov blessed Pharaoh.” Rashi understands this “blessing” as extending greetings. 
    Nachmanides writes that it does not appear reasonable to him that a commoner is in the habit of enquiring after the good health, etc., of a reigning monarch. It is assumed that a king enjoys such, as a matter of course. We are told in Shabbat 89 there are no servants who offer this type of greeting to their masters, their masters being presumed to enjoy amenities denied to people of a lower social stratum. [when Moses arrived at the seat of G’d’s throne, he supposedly found G’d preoccupied with decorating the letters of the Torah with crowns. When he remained silent, dumbfounded, G’d asked him whether in his part of the universe it was not customary to extend greetings? Moses replied with the above quotation. Ed.] Nachmanides therefore concludes that Yaakov extended a real (literal) blessing to Pharaoh. It was customary for aged people to do so, as the very fact that they attained old age was perceived as proof that they themselves were blessed, and that therefore a blessing by them was of special value. Yaakov’s first blessing was in respect of earthly possessions, including good health, whereas his blessing before leaving the presence of Pharaoh was the promise that the waters of the Nile would once again overflow their banks and irrigate the farmland of Egypt.

Rabbi Berekhya HaKohen said: When Jacob went to Pharaoh, he did not leave his presence until he blessed him, as it is stated: “Jacob blessed Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:10). What did he bless him? He said to him: May the Nile rise to your feet. (It signified the end of the famine.)  I, too, when I come to you, I come laden with blessings. Where did He allude to it to them? It was at Sinai. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: By means of an allusion, the Holy One blessed be He said to Israel that they should craft the Tabernacle and He would give them blessings when He came, as it is stated: “You shall craft for Me an altar of earth…in every place that I mention my name, I will come to you and I will bless you” (Exodus 20:21). So, He did; when He came to the Tabernacle, He blessed them, as it is stated: “May the Lord bless you and protect you” (Numbers 6:24). When? It was “on the day that [Moses] concluded [erecting the Tabernacle].” We learned that man is not more just than God. That is, “will a man be more just than God…?” No. It is, rather, that the Holy One blessed be He, too, blessed Israel when He came to them. That is why it is written: “May the Lord bless you and protect you,” and it juxtaposed to it: &quot;It was on the day that [Moses] concluded…”</p>

              <p>(Numb. 7:1:) “So it came to pass on the day that Moses had finished.” R. Berekhyah the Priest Berabbi said, (Similarly Numb. R. 12:2.)  “Before the Tabernacle was erected, when Israel stood before Mount Sinai, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them an intimation that when His Divine Presence would dwell among them, He would then bless them. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, ‘When I come unto you, I will come loaded with blessings.’” R. Berekhyah Berabbi [also] said (citing Job 4:17), “’Shall a human be more righteous than God […]?’ When Jacob went to Pharaoh, he did not depart from him until he had blessed him. And how did he bless him? He said to him [that] the Nile (Gk.: Neilos; Lat.: Nilus.)  would rise to his foot. Where is it shown? Where it is stated (in Gen. 47:7), ‘and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.’ The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘Also when I come unto you, I shall come loaded with blessings.’” And where did they have an intimation of [such blessings]? At Sinai, since it is stated (in Exod. 20:21), “An altar (Of course, such an altar would naturally stand in the Tabernacle.)  of earth you shall make for Me… I will come unto you and bless you.” Then when He came unto them He blessed them, as stated (in Numb. 6:24), “The Lord bless you […].” When? On the day that the Tabernacle was erected. (Numb. 7:1:) “So it came to pass on the day that Moses had finished (kallot).” Kallat (which means &quot;bride of&quot;) is [what is really] written. (PRK 5:1; see especially Numb. R. 12:8, end, which greatly expands this interpretation.)  [Thus the passage would allude] to the day that [the] bride (kallah) entered the wedding canopy. (In other words, Israel is the bride of the Holy One, and the Tabernacle, her wedding canopy.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>(1) When calling in his sons concerning the events in the distant future, Jacob had in mind what happens to the souls after death. The second call concerned happenings during Messianic times, on this earth. Concerning Reuben, the statement yeter se-eyt refers to additional responsibilities which Reuben should have shouldered being a firstborn, instead of assuming an additional portion of negative virtues. Since the nature of his error was such that it could not be undone, like water which, if it has once hit the ground, cannot be retrieved, Reuben's sin of entering his father's bedroom constituted an irreversible desecration. This deprived him of the birthright, which was transferred to Joseph. Possibly, the hastiness and lack of mature judgment criticized here in Reuben's character may account for the equally hasty decision of the tribe of Reuben later in claiming their part of the ancestral inheritance in the territory formerly belonging to Sichon. It was the tribe of Reuben who was the first to experience exile and dispersion in later years. (2) Shimon and Levi are bracketed together because of the similarity of their actions. Their error was the opposite of that of Reuben. Reuben had acted hastily, without mature judgment. Shimon and Levi's action against Shechem was reprehensible precisely because it was preceded by careful planning. Aristo in Ethics 7, Section 9, already discusses the relative merit of impetuosity versus the person who is in perfect control of his actions who, though carrying out carefully planned deeds, has given no thought to the possibility that he may be wrong. At Shechem, Shimon and Levi sinned because they had planned. When it came to the violence done to Joseph, they could not even claim that their action had been thoroughly thought out. Concerning the first action, Jacob condemns an anger of the aph variety, something that would not evaporate until they had taken collective revenge. In the case of their treatment of Joseph, their action was the result of ratzon, free will, impetuous behavior. When both of these characteristics are found side by side, they spell too much danger for society. Jacob did not want to be associated with this. Therefore, the two have to be separated to reduce their potential for causing harm. Although anger is a negative virtue, it can on occasion be most helpful, since it awakens people to their duty who would otherwise have remained inactive, on the sidelines. Having Levi scattered throughout Israel would ensure that when the occasion would demand it, there would be people that would galvanize the rest of the population into taking action. When Isaiah (63,5) says, &quot;My arm brought me salvation, and my fury upheld me,&quot; he refers to exactly such instances of the usefulness of fury. Similarly, the Talmud in Ketuvot 103 reports how Rabbi Yehudah taught his son Rabbi Gamliel how to conduct himself in the office of the President. He told him, &quot;Conduct your office among the exalted and strike fear into the students.&quot; (3) Yehudah is the first of the sons whose heroic deeds did not manifest themselves in turning against his own flesh and blood when angered; rather, &quot;Your hand was against the neck of your enemy.&quot; Therefore, it is fitting that his brothers pay homage to him. &quot;A young lion;&quot; subsequently he is described as a fully grown lion (both in verse 9). This suggests that Yehudah's personality development proceeded according to accepted norms. He develops from strength to strength, unlike other crowned heads, many of whom experience their greatest moment of glory at the moment they are crowned and ascend the throne. Miteref beni aleeta, you overcame, surmounted the confused thinking of my other sons. Even though you were young in years, you showed mature judgment at the moment it was called for (&quot;What profit is there in killing our brother&quot; 37,26). Jacob proceeds to assure Yehudah that royalty will be hereditary in his descendants throughout the ages. However, just as the lion may crouch ready to pounce, but lacks the power, so the royal descendants of Yehudah will similarly be found lacking in strength on occasion. Such weakness will reflect Yehudah's lack of religious observance during such periods. The Talmud (in Sanhedrin 5) tells us that the term &quot;king&quot; is not used here for Yehudah to convey the idea that in the long years of exile when there will be no Jewish king, leadership functions will still devolve upon the descendants of Yehudah; &quot;The sceptre will not depart,&quot; &quot;the lawgiver,&quot; refer to such men as the Exilarch, i.e. the leader of the Jews in the Babylonian exile who were members of the tribe of Yehudah, often in a direct line from David. Once the era of Shilo commences, the condition of Yehudah being merely kore-a, crouching, will be over, and the whole world will pay homage to him. The reference then is to Yehudah's restricted leadership role in the interval, not the cessation of such status. The reason that Zevulun in this blessing is mentioned ahead of Issachar is that since the former provides the funding for the latter's sacred vocation, that of devoting himself to Torah, the former is the prime mover, and deserves to be recognized first. Issachar who is like a beast of burden weighed down under its load, represents the qualities without which Torah study devoid of ulterior motives cannot be undertaken successfully. A donkey accepts ever greater burdens without protest, is undemanding in manner, and modest in upkeep. (4) The reason that both sons of Zilpah are mentioned in between the sons of Bilhah, is to prove that Zilpah really was supposed to have become pregnant before Bilhah. Only Laban's trickery had prevented this at the time he tricked Jacob into marrying the wrong girl. (5) Issachar realized the kind of menuchah, rest, that is &quot;good.&quot; The reference is to the serenity attainable only through the diligent study of Torah, which ensures that one will reap the ultimate &quot;good&quot; at the end of one's endeavours. (6) After having mentioned the sons of Leah in the order of their birth, Jacob addresses himself to the oldest son of the maids. Samson, descendant of Dan would achieve the position of leader amongst his people, and become the first one to begin and shake off the yoke of the Philistines. Samson's activities were not accompanied by the glory and pomp of a royal Court, but like a snake, a loner, were simply acts of revenge perpetrated as acts of terror from ambush. This is just like the action of a snake which always seems unconcerned about its own fate. Samson died at the site of his greatest triumph, just as a snake presumably gets killed when the horse and rider it has bitten fatally kills the snake near the site of their own death. Since a victory in which the pursuer dies himself is hardly a true victory, the victor not surviving to enjoy the fruits of his deed, Jacob adds the words, &quot;In Your help I trust,&quot; expressing the hope that the defender of his people will be spared by Divine intervention. &quot;Gad will form units of troops,&quot; even though Gad will be the first of the tribes to be led into captivity (Kings II 10,33), he will eventually re-emerge at the time of redemption. Asher is blessed by being promised material blessings that are rarely found side by side, namely both grain and fruit. Perhaps during the reign of Solomon, he was called upon to supply the royal palace. &quot;He will supply the delicacies for the king.&quot; The comparison of Naftali to &quot;a hind let loose,&quot; i.e. fleet-footedness, may hint at the climatic conditions in his territory giving rise to earlier harvests than elsewhere in Israel. Possibly, Naftali had silver-tongued men, bearers of good tidings who would lead Israel in thanksgiving to the Lord. (7) Because Joseph was like a beautiful fruit, flourishing by a fountain, attracting admiration from all sides, he also attracted jealousy and envy. As a result, he was quarrelled with and persecuted. He himself, however, kept his ammunition in check instead of fighting back. Thus, he proved himself stronger than his adversaries. His hands were strengthened by the same G-d who had proven His might when aiding Jacob. Therefore, he possessed the merit to become the provider (ro-eh) for his family, his clan. &quot;May you receive your reward from the G-d of your father, may it be stored with the G-d Shadday, and may you receive the bountiful blessings from the heavens above and the depths that lie below, which are typified by the blessings of the breasts and the womb. The blessings of your father (Jacob) are greater than those of my parents (Isaac) in that I may select one of my sons for a special blessing, though all of them deserve blessings.” Each one of the sons of Jacob had a morally justifiable claim to givaut olam, high positions in the world; Joseph, however, had proven outstanding. Therefore, &quot;on his skull more than on that of his brothers,&quot; the special blessing. Since the tribe of Levi had not yet been given its special designation replacing the firstborn, and the number of tribes was not to exceed twelve, the blessings for Menashe and Ephrayim are here incorporated in the blessings pronounced on their father Joseph. At the time when Moses blessed the nation, singling out Levi for its share of recognition, Ephrayim and Menashe are once again not mentioned separately, to avoid exceeding the number twelve. Moses therefore only alludes to them by stating that bechor shoro, the firstborn, his ox, are the tens of thousands of Ephrayim and the thousands of Menashe. The importance of Benjamin is alluded to by the fact that he rates the opening of a new paragraph (the paragraph could easily have ended at verse twenty-nine). Just as the word &quot;Yehudah&quot; is usually found at the beginning of a &quot;page,&quot; so both of the brothers in whose territory the holy temple was to stand later, share the distinctive treatment in the manner in which their blessings are recorded in the Torah. Since the Priests and Levites will constantly be found in Jerusalem, it is reasonable to expect the members of those tribes to pursue the wisdom obtainable by keeping company with the priests, like wolves that rob in the morning and share the booty at night. Benjaminites will share in the knowledge obtained through close association with the tribe of Levi, and will teach others. Since in this manner they will both learn and teach, they are privy to the essence of all blessings. After all, success in any endeavor is based on study and dissemination of knowledge. The verse &quot;the tribes of Israel are twelve,&quot; means that &quot;although Joseph was divided into two tribes, the total still does not exceed twelve tribes, rather Levi is to be regarded as in a class by himself.&quot; This is what is meant by the words (verse 28), &quot;Which their father said to them&quot; (perhaps for this reason the scattering of Levi's cities was of quite a different nature than the dispersal of Shimon who had contiguous tribal territory, though it was an enclave within Yehudah). Since seventeen years had elapsed since Jacob and his family had left Canaan, Jacob was concerned lest any claim against the burial place of Abraham should have been registered during the family's absence from the country. Therefore, Jacob repeated all the details of his justified claim to the lands in question. Should any claim originate with the Canaanites, the fact that Ephron had sold to Abraham was essential; should the descendants of Ishmael claim the cave as theirs, the fact that Isaac had been buried there would prove that they had no valid claim thereto. To forestall any claim of Esau to be buried there, the fact that Leah had already been buried there, would attest to its ownership by the family of Jacob. Should the argument be used that the sale by an individual such as Ephron was invalid, since he was merely an individual and it was not in the national interest to sell off land to outsiders, the fact that the beney chet, a national group had approved the sale to Abraham, would invalidate any such claim in the future. (4) We have explained when Abraham died, that geviyah is the failure of one's faculties to function (clinical death), whereas meetah is the destruction and decay of the body's whole structure. Assiphah refers to the return of the soul to its hidden origin. Meetah is not mentioned in connection with Jacob. The reason our Rabbis may not have quoted this passage when they made the statement that &quot;Jacob did not die,&quot; is so as not to allow the misconception that the elaborate measures taken to embalm Jacob's body were what is meant by the absence of the term meetah. The impression could easily have been formed that preventing decay of the body is equivalent to preventing meetah, i.e. death. Joseph appears to have had his own royal embalmers, and instead of the standard thirty-day procedure, Jacob was given the royal treatment, i.e. seventy days. This made the removal of the intestines and brain unnecessary (possibly). It appears that during the mourning Joseph observed for his father for seventy days, he did not permit himself to communicate with anyone at the royal court, and spoke to Pharaoh only through intermediaries (50,4). (5) It seems that as soon as Jacob had passed on, his sons were ready to return to the land of Canaan with their families and livestock, but were prevented by the Egyptians who were already planning to eventually enslave Jacob's entire offspring (Midrash Rabbah Tzav). We are told therefore, that the reason the Parshah dealing with Jacob's &quot;death&quot; is closed, i.e. is not separated from the preceding Parshah by a paragraph or line, is to indicate that true independence was lost as soon as Jacob closed his eyes for the last time. The Jews already felt that their freedom of movement had become subject to restrictions, and that is why even a Joseph on his deathbed had to invoke the time when G-d would lead the Jews out of Egypt as the time when his own remains should be transferred to the holy land (50,24). (6) The words va-ya-al immo in 50,9 may refer to the Shechinah leaving Egypt, having accompanied Jacob on his journey to Egypt seventeen years earlier (compare &quot;I will go up with you,&quot; 46,4). The Canaanites saw a bad omen in all of this; they emphasized to their deities that this was an Egyptian affair, no business of theirs, and that any harmful fallout should befall Egypt. From then on, the brothers carried Jacob on their shoulders, just as their father had instructed. (7) The brothers had convinced themselves by and by that Joseph's rise to greatness was due entirely to their own action against him, and that because of that he owed them good treatment (as compensation). Their reasoning ran thus: &quot;If only Joseph would hate us and pay us back for the kind of harm (may it happen so to all Jewish children) we have done him.&quot; They hoped to receive good in return for evil as a matter of right, not as a gesture of generosity. (8) When speaking in the name of Jacob then, they referred to their treatment of Joseph as evil (50,17), but they referred to themselves as &quot;servants of the G-d of your father,&quot; who had acted presumably in consonance with G-d’s will, hence such eminently successful outcome of their actions. (9) Joseph realized that all this convoluted reasoning was the result of his brothers' fear, and he wept at their fear and discomfort. However, Joseph, answering his brothers along the line of their own argument, said, &quot;I am not in place of G-d, so you need no forgiveness from me since your intention was indeed wicked. However, it was G-d who arranged for the outcome to be good not just for me alone but for everyone concerned. Despite your moral guilt however, do not worry, I will look after your needs.” (10) Joseph's raising Ephrayim's grandchildren on his knees is reported to show that Jacob's blessing concerning such grandchildren had been fulfilled. Since Joseph died at a younger age than his brothers, his reassuring remarks on his deathbed concerning the Providence of the Lord are of prime importance. Since his embalming was different from the method employed for his father, his physical death is mentioned. Since his remains were going to be interred in Egypt immediately, the treatment described would be quite adequate. </p>

            <summary>Joseph fasted for forty days to seek wisdom from God, who granted him wisdom and knowledge as a gift. Solomon's wisdom surpassed all men, including Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Joseph. The Queen of Sheba tested Solomon's wisdom with riddles, which he answered successfully. Solomon composed three thousand proverbs and a thousand and five interpretations for each. He spoke with trees, animals, and creeping things to understand their significance. Solomon's wisdom was a gift from God, and he was wiser than all men, including those from the East and Egypt. The Midrash also discusses the righteousness of Noah, the challenges faced by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the troubles and rest experienced by the patriarchs.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>“This is the statute of the Torah…” – Rabbi Yitzḥak began: “All this I attempted with wisdom; I said: I will become wise, but it is distant from me” (Ecclesiastes 7:23). It is written: “God granted wisdom to Solomon…[like the sand that is on the seashore]” (I Kings 5:9). What is “like the sand”? The Rabbis say: He granted him wisdom corresponding to that of all of Israel, as it is stated: “The number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea…” (Hosea 2:1). Rabbi Levi said: Just as the sand is a barrier for the sea, (Thus, the sea is &quot;contained&quot; by the sand barrier.)  so too, wisdom was contained within Solomon. The parable they say: You lack knowledge, what have you acquired; you acquired knowledge, what are you lacking? “A man with no constraint to his spirit is a breached city without a wall” (Proverbs 25:28).  “Solomon’s wisdom exceeded the wisdom of all the people of the east” (I Kings 5:10) – what was the wisdom of the “people of the east”? They were knowledgeable and clever in divination by bird calls. Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel said: Regarding three matters I praise the people of the east: They do not kiss on the mouth, but rather on the hand; they do not bite with their mouth, but they cut with a knife; and they seek counsel only in a spacious area, as one consults only in the field.  “And all the wisdom of Egypt” (I Kings 5:10) – what was the “wisdom of Egypt”? You find that when Solomon sought to build the Temple, he sent to Pharaoh Nekho. He said to him: Send me craftsmen, at their standard wages, as I seek to build the Temple. What did he do? He assembled all his astrologers. They looked and saw people who were destined to die that year, and sent them to him. When they came to Solomon, he saw by means of the Divine Spirit that they would die in that year. He gave them their shrouds and sent them to him. He sent to him: Did you not have shrouds with which to bury your dead? Here they are for you, they and their shrouds.   “He became the wisest of all people [haadam]” (I Kings 5:11) – Adam the first man, what was his wisdom? You find that when the Holy One blessed be He sought to create Man, He consulted with the ministering angels. He said to them: “Let us make man in our image” (Genesis 1:26). They said before Him: “What is man that You remember him” (Psalms 8:5)? He said to them: ‘Man, whom I seek to create, his wisdom is greater than yours.’ What did He do? He assembled all the animals, beasts, and birds and passed them before them. He said to them: (To the angels.) ‘What are the names of these?’ They did not know. When He created Adam, he passed them before him. He said to him: ‘What are the names of these?’ He said: ‘This one it is fitting to call bull, this one lion, this one horse, this one donkey, this one camel, and this one eagle,’ as it is stated: “Adam called names” (Genesis 2:20). He said to him: ‘And you, what is your name?’ He said to him: ‘Adam.’ ‘Why?’ ‘It is because I was created from the earth [adama].’ The Holy One blessed be He said to him: ‘I, what is My name?’ He said to Him: ‘Lord.’ ‘Why?’ ‘It is because You are Lord over all the creations.’ That is what is written: “I am the Lord, it is My name” (Isaiah 42:8) – it is My name that Adam the first man called Me. It is My name that I stipulated between Me and Myself; it is My name that I stipulated between Me and My creations.  “More than Eitan the Ezraḥite” (I Kings 5:11) – this is Abraham, as it is stated: “A contemplation by Eitan the Ezraḥite” (Psalms 89:1). (See Bava Batra 15a.)  “Heiman” (I Kings 5:11) – this is Moses, as it is stated: “Not so My servant Moses; [in all My house he is faithful [ne’eman]]” (Numbers 12:7). “And Kalkol” (I Kings 5:11) – this is Joseph, as it is stated: “Joseph sustained [vaykhalkel]…” (Genesis 47:12). The Egyptians said: Did not this slave reign over us only due to his wisdom? What did they do? They brought seventy tablets and wrote on them seventy languages. They would cast them before him, and he would read each and every one in its language. Moreover, he could speak in the sacred tongue, which they did not have the ability to understand, as it is stated: “He established it as a precept for Joseph [bihosef] [when he went out over Egypt]; I learned a language I had not known” (Psalms 81:6). (The Holy One blessed be He added a heh to Joseph’s name, granting him the ability to understand languages that he had previously been unable to understand.)  “Darda” (I Kings 5:11) – this is the generation [dor] of the wilderness, which had knowledge [de’a]. “Sons of Maḥol” (I Kings 5:11) – as the Holy One blessed be He pardoned [maḥal] them for the act of the calf.  “He spoke three thousand parables; [and his songs [shiro] were one thousand and five]” (I Kings 5:12) – Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: We reviewed all of the verses and found that Solomon prophesied only close to eight hundred verses. Rather, it teaches that in each and every verse that he said there were two or three interpretations, just as it says: “[A wise admonisher in a heedful ear is] a nose ring of gold and an adornment of fine gold” (Proverbs 25:12). (These are two parables for one scenario.)  The Rabbis say: Three thousand parables for each and every verse, and one thousand and five songs for each parable. It is not written here, “his songs [shirav],” but rather, “its song [shiro]” – the song of the parable.  “He spoke to the trees” (I Kings 5:13) – is it possible for a person to speak to trees? Rather, Solomon said: Why is a leper purified with the highest of the high and the lowest of the low, the cedar and the hyssop? (Leviticus 14:1–7.)  It is because he exalted himself like the cedar that he was afflicted with leprosy. Once he humbled himself like the hyssop, he was healed by the hyssop.  “He spoke to the animals and to the birds” (I Kings 5:13) – is it possible for a person to speak to animals and birds? Rather, he said: Why is an animal permitted with two signs and the bird with one sign? (When an animal is slaughtered both the trachea and esophagus must be cut, but when a bird is slaughtered it is sufficient to cut one of them.)  It is because the animal was created from dry land. But the bird, one verse says from the earth, as it is written: “The Lord God formed from the ground every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens” (Genesis 2:19). And one verse says: “Let the water swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly [above the earth]” (Genesis 1:20). Bar Kappara says: They were created from the mud in the sea. Rabbi Avin said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel: Nevertheless, the legs of the rooster are like the scales of the fish.  “And to crawling creatures” (I Kings 5:13) – is it possible for a person to speak to crawling creatures? Rather, Solomon said: Why is it that the eight creeping animals that are written in the Torah, one who traps them or wounds them incurs liability, (On Shabbat.)  but the other creeping animals, he is exempt? It is because they have hides.  “And to the fish” (I Kings 5:13) – is it possible to say this? Rather, why do animals, beasts, and birds require ritual slaughter, but fish do not require ritual slaughter? It is, rather, from this verse: “Will flocks and cattle be slaughtered for them…[if all the fish of the sea will be gathered for them]” (Numbers 11:22).  Yaakov of Kefar Niboraya issued a ruling in Tyre regarding fish, that they require ritual slaughter. Rabbi Ḥagai heard, and sent and summoned him. He said to him: ‘From where did you issue this ruling?’ He said to him ‘from here: “Let the water swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly [above the earth]” (Genesis 1:20) – just as the bird requires ritual slaughter, so too, fish require ritual slaughter.’ He said to them: ‘Recline him and flog him.’ He said to him: ‘Is a person who speaks matters of Torah flogged?’ He said to him: ‘You did not issue a proper ruling.’ He said to him: ‘From where?’ He said to him: ‘From here: “Will flocks and cattle be slaughtered for them…if all the fish of the sea will be gathered for them” (Numbers 11:22) – these require ritual slaughter and these require gathering.’ He [Yaakov of Kefar Niboraya] said: ‘Strike your striking, as it is favorable for absorbing.’ (Absorbing lessons for the future.)   Yaakov of Kefar Niboraya issued a ruling in Tyre regarding an Israelite man who consorted with a gentile woman and begot a son, that the son is circumcised on Shabbat. Rabbi Ḥagai heard, and sent and summoned him. He said to him: ‘From where did you arrive at this?’ He said to him: ‘As it is written: “They verified their lineages by their families, by their patrilineal houses” (Numbers 1:18).’ (Since lineage is determined by the father, he claimed that if the father is Jewish, the son is Jewish.)  He said to them: ‘Bend him over and flog him.’ He said to him: ‘Is a person who speaks matters of Torah flogged?’ He said to him: ‘You did not issue a proper ruling.’ He said to him: ‘From where do you prove it to me?’ He said to him; ‘If a member of the nations were to come to you and say: I wish to become a Jew provided that I can be circumcised on Shabbat day or on Yom Kippur, does one desecrate the Shabbat for him or not? Is it not so, that one desecrates the Shabbat only for the son of the daughter of an Israelite alone?’ He said to him: ‘From where do you derive this?’ He said to him: ‘It is written: “Now, let us establish a covenant with our God to send away all the wives, and those born from them, according to the counsel of the Lord” (Ezra 10:3).’ He said to him: ‘Are you flogging me on the basis of Tradition?’ (The Prophets and the Writings. )  He said to him: ‘It is written: “Let it be done in accordance with the Torah”’ (Ezra 10:3). He said to him: ‘From what Torah?’ He said to him: ‘From what Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: It is written: “You shall not marry them” (Deuteronomy 7:3). Why? “Because he will divert your son from following Me” (Deuteronomy 7:4). Your son who comes from an Israelite woman is called your son, but your son who comes from a Kushite woman is not called your son, but rather, her son.’ (See Yevamot 17a.)  He said: ‘Strike your striking, as it is favorable for absorbing.’  Solomon said: Regarding all these I was able to comprehend, but the portion of the red heifer I investigated, I asked, and I searched; “I said: I will become wise, but it is distant from me” (Ecclesiastes 7:23).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>“Faultless [tamim] in his generations” – bar Ḥatya said: Everyone in whose regard tamim is stated, he completed his years to a multiple of seven. (Tamim also means “complete,” and numbers that are multiples of seven are considered “complete.” Noah lived for three hundred and fifty years after the Flood. Abraham (also called tamim, in Genesis 17:1) lived for seventy-seven years after that reference.)    “Was [haya]” – Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Anyone in whose regard haya is stated, he was righteous from beginning to end. They raised an objection against him: But is it not written: “Abraham was (haya) one, and he inherited the land” (Ezekiel 33:24); was he the same from beginning to end? (Was he not an idolater in his youth?)  He said to them: This, too, is not a contradiction, as Rabbi Levi said in the name of Reish Lakish: At the age of three years, Abraham recognized his Creator. (So he was indeed righteous from beginning (early childhood) to end.)    Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yoḥanan, both of them say: At the age of forty-eight years, Abraham recognized his Creator. How, then, do I explain “haya”? It means that he was destined to guide the entire world to repent. (Rabbi Yoḥanan disagrees with the interpretation of haya given above, and explains that it indicates that a person had a particular destiny from birth.)  [Similarly,] “Behold, man [Adam] has become [haya]” (Genesis 3:22) – he was destined for death. “The serpent was [haya]” (Genesis 3:1) – he was destined for calamity. “Cain was [haya]” (Genesis 4:2) – he was destined for exile. “Job was [haya]” (Job 1:1) – he was destined for suffering. “Noah was [haya]” – he was destined for a miracle. “Moses was [haya]” (Exodus 3:1) – he was destined to be a redeemer. “Mordekhai was [haya]” (Esther 2:5) – he was destined for redemption.   Rabbi Levi and the other Rabbis [discussed this]. Rabbi Levi said: Everyone in whose regard haya is stated saw [the emergence of] a new world. Rabbi Shmuel said: They are five: Noah – yesterday [during the Flood], “stones were worn away by water” (Job 14:19), as Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even the lower millstone was obliterated in the water. Then you read: “The sons of Noah who emerged from the ark”? (Genesis 9:18). This [change] is bewildering! However, it indicates that he saw [the emergence of] a new world. Joseph – “they tortured his legs with chains” (Psalms 105:18), but now, “Joseph was the ruler”! (Genesis 42:6). However, it indicates that he saw a new world. Moses – yesterday, he was fleeing from Pharaoh, and now he was drowning him in the sea! However, it indicates that he saw a new world. Job – yesterday, “He spills my bile onto the ground” (Job 16:13), and now, “the Lord added to Job double of all that he had before”! (Job 42:10). However, it indicates that he saw a new world. Mordekhai – yesterday he was destined for hanging, and now he is hanging his hangers! However, it indicates that he saw a new world.  The other Rabbis say: Everyone in whose regard haya is stated, he fed others and sustained them. Noah fed and sustained [the animals] all twelve months, as it is stated: “And you, take for you [from all food that is eaten…and it shall be for you and for them for food]” (Genesis 6:21). Joseph – “Joseph provided for his father and his brothers” (Genesis 47:12). Moses fed and sustained Israel for forty years in the wilderness. Job – “I ate my bread alone, and an orphan did not partake of it?” (Job 31:17). This was meant as a rhetorical question. Mordekhai fed and sustained others. Rabbi Yudan said: One time he went around to all the wet nurses, but did not immediately find a wet nurse for Esther, and he nursed her himself. Rabbi Berekhya and Rabbi Abahu said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: Milk came into him [his breasts] and he nursed her. When Rabbi Abahu expounded this in public, the audience laughed as he spoke [of a man producing milk]. He said to them: But is it not [stated in] a mishna: Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: The milk of a male is not subject to ritual impurity. (Mishna Makhshirin 6:7.) </p>

              <p>“All this I attempted with wisdom; I said: I will become wise, but it is far from me” (Ecclesiastes 7:23). “All this I attempted with wisdom.” It is written: “God granted wisdom to Solomon, [great discernment, and breadth of understanding like the sand on the seashore]” (I Kings 5:9). The Rabbis and Rabbi Levi, the Rabbis say: “Like the sand” – what is “like the sand”? He was granted wisdom corresponding to all of Israel. (Israel is compared to the sand on the seashore; see Genesis 22:17.)  Rabbi Levi said: Just as this sand is a boundary for the sea, so, too, wisdom was a boundary for Solomon. (It prevented him from sinning.)  The parable says: If you lack knowledge, what have you acquired? If you have acquired wisdom, what are you lacking? It is written: “Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East and all the wisdom of Egypt” (I Kings 5:10). What was the wisdom of the people of the East? They were well-versed in astronomy, performed sorcery with birds, and were expert in augury. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: Regarding three matters I praise the people of the East: They do not kiss on the mouth, but rather on the hand; they do not bite [pieces of food from a larger piece] with their mouth but cut with a knife; and they seek counsel only in a spacious area, as they consult only in the field. (This is to ensure that there are no eavesdroppers.)  What was the wisdom of the Egyptians? You find that when Solomon sought to build the Temple, he sent to Pharaoh Nekho and said: ‘Send me craftsmen [and I will pay] their wage, as I seek to build the Temple.’ What did he [Pharaoh] do? He assembled all his astrologers, and they envisioned people who were destined to die during that year and he sent them to him. When they came to Solomon, he envisioned with the divine spirit that they were destined to die during that year. He gave them shrouds and sent them [back] to [Pharaoh Nekho], and said to him: ‘If you did not have shrouds for the needs of your dead, here they are with their shrouds; arise and bury them.’  “He was wiser than any man [ha’adam]” (I Kings 5:11) – than Adam the first man. What was the wisdom of Adam the first man? You find that when the Holy One blessed be He sought to create Adam the first man, He consulted with the ministering angels, and He said to them: “Let us make man” (Genesis 1:26). They said to him: ‘Master of the universe, “what is man that You remember him?”’ (Psalms 8:5). He said to them: ‘The man I seek to create, his wisdom is greater than yours.’ What did He do? He gathered all the animals, beasts, and birds, and stood them before them [the angels], and said to them: ‘Give them names.’ They remained [silent] and did not know [what to say]. He went to Adam and said to him: ‘What [should] the names of these [creatures be]?’ [Adam] said: ‘Master of the universe, it is fitting to call this one ox, this one lion, this one horse, this one camel, this one eagle,’ and so forth for all of them. [God] said to him: ‘What is your name?’ He said before Him: ‘Adam, because I was created from the ground [adama].’ [God said:] ‘And I, what is My name?’ He said before Him: ‘You are my Lord [adonai], because You are the Lord [adon] over all Your creations’ – that is what is written: “I am the Lord, it is My name” (Isaiah 42:8), it is My name that I was called by Adam the first man. It is My name that I stipulated between Me and Myself. It is My name that I stipulated between Myself and My creations and My ministering angels. “[For he was wiser than all men: than Eitan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Kalkol, and Darda, the sons of Maḥol]” (I Kings 5:11). “Than Eitan the Ezrahite,” this is Abraham, as it is written: “A contemplation of Eitan the Ezrahite” (Psalms 89:1). (Rabbinic tradition identifies Eitan the Ezrahite of Psalms as Abraham; see Bava Batra 15a.)  “And Heman,” this is Moses, as it is stated: “In all My house he is trusted [ne’eman]” (Numbers 12:7). “And Kalkol,” this is Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph provided [vaykhalkel]” (Genesis 47:12). The Egyptians said: ‘Is this slave not king over us due only to his wisdom?’ They took seventy notes (Each note was written in a different language.)  and cast them before him and he would read each of them in its language. Moreover, he would speak in the sacred tongue, which they did not know, with which they were not familiar, and which they could not understand. So, it says: “He established it as a precept for Joseph [when he went out over Egypt; I learned a language I had not known]” (Psalms 81:6). “And Darda,” (I Kings 5:11), this is the generation [dor] of the wilderness, which was entirely knowledge [de’a]. “Sons of Maḥol,” (I Kings 5:11), these are the Israelites, whom the Holy One blessed be He forgave [maḥal] for the sin of the [Golden] Calf.</p>

              <p>“I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, and the war is not to the valiant; also bread is not to the wise, and also wealth is not to the clever, and also favor is not to the knowledgeable, but rather, time and chance befalls them all” (Ecclesiastes 9:11). “That the race is not to the swift” – this is Jacob our patriarch; yesterday: “Jacob lifted his feet [and went to the land of the children of the east]” (Genesis 29:1), and today it is written: “He gathered his feet onto the bed [and expired]” (Genesis 49:33). “And the war is not to the valiant” – this is Jacob; yesterday, “he rolled the stone off the mouth of the well” (Genesis 29:10), and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Like a person removing the stopper from the mouth of a flask, (This demonstrates Jacob’s great strength, as the stone was heavy enough that generally multiple people had to lift it together (see Genesis 29:8).)  and today, “the sons of Israel transported Jacob their father” (Genesis 46:5), his body, and he could not be carried even [sitting] in a litter. (Jacob was so weak that his sons had to carry him themselves as they traveled.)  “Also bread is not to the wise” – this is Jacob; yesterday, “Jacob sacrificed an offering on the mountain…[and called his brethren to eat bread] and they ate bread” (Genesis 31:54). Were they his brethren? He had one brother, and if only he had buried him. (His only brother, Esau, wanted to kill him; it would have been better for Jacob had Esau died.)  Were they not his sons? Rather, once they reached his shoulders he likened them to himself and called them brethren. Today, “Return and purchase a little food for us…” (Genesis 43:2). (Jacob asked his sons to return to Egypt to purchase food. Instead of him providing for them, he asked them to provide food for him.)  “And also wealth is not to the clever” – this is Jacob; “the man became exceedingly prosperous [vayifrotz]” (Genesis 30:43). Rabbi Simon teaches in the name of Rabbi Shimon that he had a microcosm of the World to Come, as it is stated: “The one who breaks through [haporetz] will have ascended before them” (Micah 2:13). (Just as the Messiah, the subject of that verse, will break the laws of nature, God broke the laws of nature in causing Jacob’s flocks to multiply in order to grant him wealth.)  But today, “Joseph sustained his father and his brothers…” (Genesis 47:12). “And also favor is not to the knowledgeable” – this is Jacob. Yesterday, “I know my son, I know” (Genesis 48:19). I know about the incident of Judah and Tamar, the incident of Reuben and Bilha. If the matters that were not revealed to you, were revealed to me, the matters that were revealed to you, all the more so. But today, he said to him: “If I have found favor in your eyes…do not bury me in Egypt (Genesis 47:29). (Jacob was more knowledgeable than Joseph, as indicated in Genesis 48:19, yet he had to ask for Joseph’s favor so that he could be buried in the land of Israel.)  Another matter, “the race is not to the swift” – this is Asael, as it is stated: “Asael was light on his feet, like one of the antelopes…” (II Samuel 2:18). How was his lightness manifest? He would run over the awns of the stalks and they would not break. Yesterday, “Asael was light on his feet,” and today, “Avner struck him with the back of the spear” (II Samuel 2:23). “And the war is not to the valiant” – this is Avner, as it is written: “Are you not a man? Who is your equal in Israel…” (I Samuel 26:15). As Rabbi Asi said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is easier for a person to move a six-cubit-wide wall than one of Avner’s legs; but today, “shall Avner die the death of a scoundrel?” (II Samuel 3:33). (David said this after Yoav tricked Avner and killed him.)  “Also bread is not to the wise” – this is Solomon. Yesterday, “Solomon’s daily provision was thirty kor of fine flour and sixty kor of flour” (I Kings 5:2), and it is written: “Ten fattened bulls…” (I Kings 5:3). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Likewise, each and every day, and likewise each and every one of his wives would prepare a meal for him, under the impression that he would dine with her. But today, “this was my portion from all my toil” (Ecclesiastes 2:10). There is one who says: [All he had was] his bowl, there is one who says: [All he had was] his walking stick, and there is one who says: [All he had was] his belt. (This is an allusion to the midrash (Kohelet Rabba 2:10) that Solomon was displaced from his throne and made to wander as a commoner with almost nothing.)  “And also wealth is not to the clever” – this is Job. Yesterday, “his livestock was seven thousand sheep…” (Job 1:3), “and his livestock spread [paratz] in the land” (Job 1:10). Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: He breached [paratz] the boundaries of the world. Everywhere, the way of the world is that wolves kill the goats; however, with Job, the goats would kill the wolves. But today, “pity me, pity me, you are my friends…” (Job 19:21). “And also favor is not to the knowledgeable” – this is Joshua. Rabbi Aḥva son of Rabbi Zeira said: There are two matters that Joshua spoke before Moses, but they did not find favor in his eyes, and these are: One regarding the appointment of the elders, and one in the incident of the [Golden] Calf. In the appointment of the elders, as it is written: “My lord Moses, incarcerate them [kela’em]” (Numbers 11:28); he said to him: Put an end to them [kalem] and remove them from the world. “Moses said to him: Are you zealous on my behalf?” (Numbers 11:29). [Moses] said to him: ‘Joshua, am I jealous of you? (According to rabbinic tradition, Joshua’s statement to Moses about two elders, Eldad and Medad, was made after the latter prophesied that Moses would die and Joshua would lead the nation in the land of Israel (Sanhedrin 17a). That is the backdrop of this midrash, in which Joshua demanded that these elders be punished for their lack of respect toward Moses, and Moses responded that he was not insulted by their prophecy (Rabbi David Luria).)  If only my son could be like you, if only all Israel could be like you, “would that all the people of the Lord would be prophets” (Numbers 11:29).’ And one regarding the [Golden] Calf, as it is stated: “Joshua heard the sound of the people in their uproar [and he said to Moses: There is a sound of war in the camp]” (Exodus 32:17). Moses said to him: ‘A person who is destined to assert authority over six hundred thousand [men] does not know to distinguish between one sound and another sound? “It is not the sound of a cry of strength [gevura]” (Exodus 32:18),’ as it is stated: “Israel prevailed [vegavar]” (Exodus 17:11); ‘“and it is not the sound of a cry of weakness” (Exodus 32:18),’ as it is stated: “Joshua weakened [Amalek]” (Exodus 17:13); ‘“the sound of a cry, I hear” (Exodus 32:18).’ Rabbi Asi said: It is the sound of praise of idol worship, I hear. Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Asi: You do not have any generation that did not take one ounce of the calf. (The punishment for this sin is distributed over all the generations.) </p>

                <h4>Midrash Mishlei 1:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>[1] (Proverbs 1:1): &quot;The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel&quot; - Rabbi Tanhum ben Hanilai began and said: (Job 28:12): &quot;But wisdom - where can it be found? And where is the place of understanding?&quot; - This refers to Solomon, who fasted for forty days, so that God would grant him a spirit of wisdom and understanding, and he wandered around and sought after it. God said to him (1 Kings 3:5): &quot;Ask, what shall I give you?&quot; He replied, 'Master of the Universe, I ask of You neither silver nor gold, but wisdom alone,' as it is written (1 Kings 3:9): &quot;Give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people.&quot; God answered him and said, 'Since you asked for neither silver nor gold, wisdom and knowledge are given to you as a gift.' Moreover, wisdom preceded the Torah, as it is written (Psalms 111:10): &quot;The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.&quot; There we learned (Mishnah Avot 3:17): &quot;Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah says: If there is no Torah, there is no proper conduct.&quot; And since his wisdom preceded, the scripture said about him (1 Kings 3:3): &quot;And Solomon loved the Lord&quot;; it teaches that Solomon's wisdom was a gift. &quot;And where is the place of understanding?&quot; - Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said: Wisdom and understanding are one, where there is wisdom there is understanding, and where there is understanding there is wisdom. And since he fasted for forty days and sought wisdom, God did not withhold his reward, as it is written (1 Kings 5:26): &quot;And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon,&quot; and it is written: (1 Kings 5:11): &quot;And he was wiser than all men&quot; - this refers to Adam the first, as it is written about Solomon (Proverbs 30:2): &quot;For I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man&quot;; &quot;than Ethan from the East&quot; - this is Abraham, as it is written (Isaiah 41:2): &quot;Who raised up one from the east, He calls him to His foot&quot;; &quot;Heman&quot; - this is Moses, as it is said (Numbers 12:7): &quot;Not so, My servant Moses, in all My house he is faithful&quot;; &quot;Calcol&quot; - this is Joseph, as it is written (Genesis 47:12): &quot;And Joseph sustained his father, and his brothers&quot;; &quot;Darda&quot; - this refers to the generation of the desert, who were of exceptional knowledge; &quot;the sons of Mahol&quot; - this is David, whom God forgave for that sin. &quot;And his name was among all the nations around&quot; - this refers to Solomon, whose name went from one end of the world to the other. ANOTHER interpretation: &quot;And wisdom, from where can it be found?&quot; - this refers to the Queen of Sheba, who heard of his wisdom, said 'I will go and see if he is wise or not', and from where do we know that she heard his wisdom? It is written (1 Kings 10:1): &quot;And the Queen of Sheba heard the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, and she came to prove him with hard questions.&quot; What are &quot;hard questions&quot;? Rabbi Jeremiah Bar Shalom said: she asked him 'Are you Solomon, about whom I heard, and about your kingdom, and about your wisdom?' He replied 'Yes.' She said to him 'You are a great sage, but if I ask you one thing, will you answer me?' He replied (Proverbs 2:6): &quot;For the LORD giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.&quot; She asked him a riddle 'What are the seven that go out, the nine that enter, the two that pour, and the one who drinks?' He answered her 'Certainly, the seven days of menstruation go out, the nine months of pregnancy enter, two breasts pour, and the baby drinks.' She said to him 'You are a great sage, but if I ask you another thing will you answer me?' He replied 'For the LORD giveth wisdom', She asked him 'What is it, a woman said to her son: your father - my father, your elder - my husband, you - my son, and I - your sister?' He answered her 'Certainly, these are Lot's two daughters.' And another example she did: she brought before him children of one height and one garment, and said to him 'Distinguish for me from these males and females.' He hinted to his eunuch, and brought him nuts and shells, and began to scatter them before them; males, who were not ashamed, took them in their garments, and females, who were ashamed, took them in their handkerchiefs. He said to her 'These are males and these are females.' She said to him 'Son, you are a great sage!'. And another example she did: she brought circumcised and uncircumcised, said to him 'Distinguish for me the circumcised from the uncircumcised'; he immediately hinted to the high priest and opened the Ark of the Covenant, the circumcised among them bowed down to half their height, and not only that but their faces were filled with the radiance of the Divine Presence, and the uncircumcised among them fell on their faces, he immediately said to her 'These are uncircumcised and these are circumcised.' She said to him 'Where did you get that from?' He said to her 'From Balaam, for it is written (Numbers 24:4): &quot;He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling but with opened eyes&quot;, if he had not fallen - he would not have seen anything.' And if you don't want to learn from Balaam, come and learn from Job: at the hour when the three friends of Job came to comfort him, he said to them (Job 12:3): 'I have a heart like you; I am not inferior to you,' 'I am not inferior to you.' At that hour it was said to him (1 Kings 10:7): 'I did not believe the words until I came and my eyes saw, and behold, the half was not told to me; you have added wisdom and goodness to the hearing that I have heard; happy are your men, happy are these your servants who stand before you always and hear your wisdom; may the Lord your God be blessed who desired you, to place you on the throne of Israel and so on, and he made you king to do justice and righteousness.' It was said about Solomon 'justice and righteousness,' and it was said about David 'justice and righteousness,' from where? Because it is written (2 Samuel 8:15): 'David administered justice and righteousness to all his people,' and it is said about Solomon 'justice and righteousness,' the Scripture tells us that the wisdom of Solomon is equal to the wisdom of David, and the wisdom of David is equal to the wisdom of Solomon. Alternatively, 'Where can wisdom be found?' - this teaches that Solomon was searching for where wisdom is found. Rabbi Eliezer says: in the head, Rabbi Joshua says: in the heart. As it is said (Psalms 4:1): 'You have given joy in my heart,' and it is written (Proverbs 27:11): 'Be wise, my son, and gladden my heart.' And why was wisdom given in the heart - because all the organs depend on the heart. Solomon said: I am doing as my father opened, who opened with his wisdom with the first letters and ended with the middle letters: [opened] with the head - because it is written (Psalms 1:1): 'Happy is the man who does not walk,' and he ended in the middle - as it is said (Psalms 150:6): 'Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.' In the beginning, I open in the middle, and I end at the end: I open from the place where wisdom is given, where is it - in the heart, and where is the heart given - in the middle. It turns out you are saying that David caught on to Rabbi Eliezer's words, and Solomon to Rabbi Joshua's words. And not only that, but the heart is in God's hands, as it is written (Proverbs 21:1): 'The king's heart is like streams of water in the hand of the Lord; he turns it wherever he wills.' And since Solomon saw that wisdom is given in the heart, he said: I am beginning from the place where wisdom was given, for he says 'The proverbs of Solomon.' 'The son of David' - what son of David, and don't all know that he is the son of David?! Rather, everything he did, he did in honor of David. 'King of Israel' - and don't all know that he is the King of Israel?! Rather, what he did, he did for the honor of Israel.&quot; </p>

This text is related (to Job 8:7): THOUGH YOUR BEGINNING WAS TRIFLING (rt.: Ts'R), .  to teach you that everyone who is troubled (rt.: Ts'R) from his beginning has rest at his end. You have no one who was more troubled (rt.: Ts'R) than Abraham, who was cast into a fiery furnace and went into exile from his ancestral home. Moreover, sixteen kings oppressed him. He also stood the test of ten trials and buried Sarah. Yet in the end he had rest. (Gen. 24:1) NOW ABRAHAM WAS OLD, ADVANCED IN YEARS, AND THE LORD BLESSED ABRAHAM . Isaac was troubled (rt.: Ts'R) in his youth, for the Philistines were jealous of him, [as stated] (in Gen. 26:16): AND ABIMELECH SAID UNTO ISAAC: GO AWAY FROM US, FOR YOU HAVE BECOME HAVE BECOME TOO POWERFUL FOR US. In the end they begged him for mercy, [as stated] (in vs. 27): AND ISAAC SAID UNTO THEM: WHY HAVE YOU COME UNTO ME…. Jacob also was troubled (rt.: Ts'R) in his youth, as stated (in Ps. 129:1): THEY HAVE HARASSED ME GREATLY FROM MY YOUTH, LET ISRAEL NOW SAY.

              <p>Another interpretation (of Gen. 44:18): THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM. This text is related (to Job 41:8 [16]): ONE IS SO NEAR TO THE OTHER THAT NO AIR CAN COME BETWEEN THEM. This refers to Judah and Joseph, for in whatever Joseph prided himself, Judah came and vanquished, as stated (in Gen. 45:1): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF. To what were they comparable? (Tanh., Gen. 11:3.)  To a bull that went out; and, when all the beasts fled from him, he kicked (rt.: B'T) at one and gored at another. Then came the lion, but he did not stand up to him. Rather, when the lion appeared and sought out the bull, he was not to be found. So Joseph is likened to the bull, as stated (in Deut. 33:17): LIKE A FIRSTLING BULL HE HAS MAJESTY. The tribes also have been likened to beasts, and Joseph was priding himself as being over them and despising (rt.: B'T) them. (According to Gen. 42:7) HE BECAME A STRANGER TO THEM. Then goring at a particular one, (according to Gen. 42:24) HE TOOK SIMON FROM THEM. He acted so only until the lion came, &lt; for &gt; (according to Gen. 49:24) JUDAH IS A LION'S WHELP. He sought him out as the bull, but he was not to be found. Rather (according to Gen. 45:1): JOSEPH COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIMSELF. Why? (Prov. 30:30:) THE LION IS THE MIGHTIEST AMONG THE BEASTS, AND RETREATS BEFORE NONE, even because it is written of him (in Gen. 47:12): AND &lt; JOSEPH &gt; SUSTAINED &lt; HIS FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS &gt;. (One would expect some saying about Judah. Buber’s note here suggests that SUSTAINED be read as two words, apart from the biblical context, and interpreted as “All in all,” i.e., the lion is “all in all” in the world of beasts. Cf. Tanh., Gen. 11:3: “Who has stood facing a bull? The lion, as stated (Gen. 44:18): THEN JUDAH DREW NEAR UNTO HIM.”)  Also in the world to come a fighting Messiah is going to arise from Joseph, but a Messiah who is to arise from Judah will be stronger than he, as stated (in Zech. 10:6): I WILL STRENGTHEN THE HOUSE OF JUDAH, &lt; BUT THE HOUSE OF JOSEPH I WILL SAVE &gt;.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>R. Isaac began [his discourse] (with Eccl. 7:23), “All this I tested with wisdom; I thought I could fathom it, but it eludes me.” It is written (in I Kings 5:9), “So God gave Solomon wisdom and discernment in great measure, with understanding....” R. Johanan said a parable in the name of R. Simeon ben Yehozedek, “This is comparable to a king who had a friend, and the king loved him exceedingly. The king said to him, ‘Ask me anything you want and I will give it to you.’ And that friend was very wise. He said [to himself], ‘If I ask him to make me a duke, it [alone] will come to me.” Rather I will ask him for something that is attached to all the advantages.’ Immediately he answered and said to the king, ‘Since you asked that I should ask for something in front of you, I am asking from you that you marry off your daughter to me.’ The king said, ‘By your life, I want this. Behold my daughter is [given] into your house.’ So [too] at the time that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Solomon (in I Kings 3:5), ‘Ask what I should give to you,’ Solomon said [to himself], ‘What shall I ask; If I ask for silver and gold, it [alone] will come to me. If I ask for the monarchy, it [alone] will come to me. Rather I will ask for something that is attached to all the things.’ Immediately he said in front of the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Master of the World, I only request from you wisdom.’ [Then] the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘You have asked well in asking for wisdom, as all the things are attached to it. Silver and gold are attached to it, as stated (in Prov. 8:19), “My fruit is better than gold, fine gold, and my produce than choice silver.” Monarchy is attached to it, as stated (in Prov. 8:15), “Through me kings reign.” Behold everything is given to you.’” Hence it is written (in I Kings 5:9), “So God gave Solomon wisdom,” as He gave him wisdom as a gift. (I Kings 5:9, cont.:) “As vast as the sand of the sea.” The rabbis say, “[This] teaches that He gave him as much wisdom as all Israel, who are compared to the sand, as stated (in Hos. 2:1), ‘The number of the Children of Israel shall be like that of the sands of the sea.’ How is this? The sages have knowledge, the elders of knowledge and the children have knowledge, but they are different, one from the other. And [so] if all of Israel would be on one side and Solomon on the other side, his wisdom would be greater than theirs.” (Numb. R. 19:3; Eccl. R. 7:23:1; PRK 4:3; PR 14:8.)  R. Levi said, “Just as sand is a wall and a fence for [the sea], that it not go out and flood the world; so that his wisdom stand in front of his [evil] impulse, that he not sin.” The proverb says, “If you lack knowledge, what have you gained? If you have gained knowledge, what do you lack?” Like (in Prov. 25:28) “A city broken into with no walls,” so “is a person who does not restrain his spirit.” (I Kings 5:10:) “Now Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the East.” And what was the wisdom of the peoples of the East? (Above, Gen. 7:24; PR 14:9.)  [In that] they knew about astrology and were astute at divination (from birds). Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel said, “I like three things about the people of the East: They do not kiss on the mouth, but only on the hand; When they cut meat, they cut only with a knife and not on the back of the hand; And when they take counsel, they take it only in the field. It is therefore stated (in Gen. 31:4), ‘So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flock was.’” (I Kings 5:10, cont.:) “From all the wisdom of Egypt.” What was the wisdom of Egypt? You find that when Solomon wanted to build the Temple, he sent to Pharaoh Necho and said to him, “Send me craftsmen [to work] for a wage, for I want to build the Temple.” What did Pharaoh do? He gathered all his astrologers (Gk.: astrologoi.)  and said to them, “Foresee which people are going to die this year and send them to him. So that I can come to him with a grievance and say to him, ‘Give me the value of the craftsmen that you killed.’” When they came to Solomon, he foresaw through the holy spirit that they would die during that year. He [therefore] gave them shrouds and sent them [back] to [Pharaoh]. He sent to him, saying, “Do you not have shrouds to bury your dead? Here they are for you with their shrouds. Go and bury your dead.” Hence it is stated, (I Kings 5:10, cont.) “from all the wisdom of Egypt.” (I Kings 5:11:) “And he was wiser than any man, than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalkol, and Darda the sons of Mahol.” “Wiser than any man (literally, than all of Adam),” than the first Adam. And what was his wisdom? You find that, when the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to create the first Adam, he consulted with the ministering angels. He said to them (in Gen. 1:26), “Let us make humankind (Adam) in Our image.” They said to him (in Ps. 8:5), “What is a human that You are mindful of him?” He said to them, “This Adam that I want to create Adam shall have wisdom greater than yours.” What did He do? He gathered all cattle, wild beasts, and fowl pass before them. He said to them, “What are the names of these [beings]?” They, however, did not know. When He had created Adam, He made them pass before him. He said to him, “What are the names of these [beings]?” He said, “It is fitting to call this one an ox, this one a lion, this one a horse, [...]” and so on for all of them. It is so stated (in Gen. 2:20), “So Adam recited names for all the cattle.” (The understanding of the midrash is that the creatures implicitly already possessed names.)  He said to him, “And you, what is your name?” Adam said to him, “Adam, because I was created out of the ground (adamah).” The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, “I, what is My name?” He said to him, “The Lord, because you are Lord over all creatures,” namely as written (in Is. 42:8), “I am the Lord, that is My name,” which the first Adam gave me. (Above, Lev. 3:11.)  “That is my name,” the one which I have agreed to [for use] between Me and My creatures. (I Kings 5:11, cont.:) “[Wiser] than Ethan the Ezrahite.” This is Abraham, of whom it is stated (in Ps. 89:1), “A maskil (a psalm of erudition) of Ethan the Ezrahite.” (It is assumed, of course that Abraham wrote the Psalm, an assumption based on a comparison of Ps. 89:1 and Is. 41:2: WHO HAS RAISED UP RIGHTEOUSNESS FROM THE EAST?. See BB 15a. The Ezrahite (‘ezrahi) of Ps. 89:1 is understood in the sense of “Easterner,” and Ethan (which means “steadfast”) is regarded as equivalent to “righteous.” For another argument identifying Ethan and Abraham, see PR 6:5.)  (I Kings 5:11, cont.:) “And Heman (rt.: 'mn).” This is Moses, of whom it is stated (in Numb. 12:7 with reference to Moses), “he is trusted (rt.: 'mn) in all My house.” (I Kings 5:11, cont.:) “Calcol (klkl).” This is Joseph, of whom it is stated (in Gen. 47:12), “And joseph sustained (rt.: klkl) [his father and his brothers].” The Egyptians said, “Has this slave come to rule over us for any reason but because of his wisdom?” What did they do to him? They brought seventy tablets (Gk.: piyyakia; Lat.: pittacia.)  and wrote on them in seventy tongues. Then when they cast them before him. He read each and every one in its own tongue. And not only that, but he spoke in the holy tongue, which they did not have the ability to understand, as stated (in Ps. 81:6), “He made it a statute upon Joseph, when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a language I had not known.” (I Kings 5:11, cont.:) “Darda (drd')].” This is the generation (dor) of the desert, which had knowledge (de'ah). (I Kings 5:11, cont.:) “The children of Mahol,” i.e., the Children of Israel whom the Divine Presence forgave (rt.: mhl) for the deed of the calf. (I Kings 5:12:) “Moreover he composed three thousand proverbs.” R. Samuel bar Nahman said, “We have gone over all of the scriptures and have found that Solomon only uttered prophetically close to eight hundred verses. (See Cant. R. 1:1:11.)  Then what is meant by three thousand? [This number] teaches that each and every verse that he spoke contains two [or] three interpretations, just as it says (in Prov. 25:12), ‘Like an earring of gold, a necklace of fine gold, [so is a wise reprover to a listening ear].’” (The midrash understands the WISE REPROVER TO BE Solomon himself, who is likened to both a golden earring and a golden necklace.)  But the rabbis say, “Every verse has three thousand proverbs, while each and every proverb has a thousand and five interpretations.” [(I Kings 5:12, cont.:) “And his song numbered a thousand and five.”] “Songs” is not written here, but “song,” the song of the proverb. (I Kings 5:13:) “And he spoke with/concerning ('al) (The point of the midrash in this and in the following chapter concerns whether to understand ‘al as “with” or “concerning.”)  the trees.” Is it possible that a person would speak with the trees? Solomon merely said, “For what reason is a leper cleansed through the tallest among the trees (the cedar) and through the lowest of the low (the hyssop); through (according to Lev. 14:4) cedar wood, [crimson stuff,] and hyssop?’ It is simply because he had exalted himself like the cedar, that he was stricken with leprosy. As soon as he humbled himself like the hyssop, he was therefore cured through hyssop”. (I Kings 5:13, cont.:) “He also spoke with/concerning ('al) the cattle and the fowl.” Is it possible that [a person] would speak with cattle and with fowl? Rather [the passage is concerned with] why the cattle are permitted [as food] with [the cutting of] two organs (Gk.: semeia (“signs,” “omens”).)  (the gullet and the windpipe); but the fowl, with [the cutting of] one organ (i.e., the gullet or the windpipe). (See Hul. 2:1; Hul. 27b.)  Because cattle were created from the dry land, as stated (in Gen. 1:14), “Let the earth bring forth the living creatures after its kind, cattle, creeping things,” they are permitted with two organs. But in regard to fowl, because they were created from the mud, they were permitted with one organ. As one text says [they came] from the dry land, while another text says [they came] from the sea. [The text stating fowls came] from the dry land is what is written (in Gen. 2:19), “So from the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the heavens.” The other text says (in Gen. 1:20), “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures and the fowl fly above the earth.” (This unusual translation of Gen. 1:20 is required by the midrash.)  Bar Qappara said, “They were created from the mud which is in the sea.” R. Abbin said the name of R. Jose the Galilean said, “Nevertheless, the feet of the cock resemble the scaly skin (Reading HSPNYT’ with the parallel in Yalqut Shim‘oni, Kings, 178, for Buber’s HRTsPYTYH.)  of the fish.” (A fish of the genus anthias.)  (I Kings 5:13, cont.:) “And with/concerning ('al) the creeping things.” Is it possible that one would speak with a creeping thing? Solomon simply said, “What is the reason that in the case of the eight swarming creatures which are in the Torah, one is culpable for hunting or injuring them (on the Sabbath) (Shab. 14:1.) ; but in the case of the rest of the swarming creatures, one is exempt? (Shab. 14:1.)  For the reason that they (i.e. the former) have skins.” (Shab. 107ab, explains that in the case of skin, as distinct from the flesh, a wound does not completely heal but leaves a scar. Thus part of the animal’s life is lost. See yShab. 14:1 (14b); also Hul. 9:2. Cf. Rashi on Shab. 14:1, according to whom cutting the skin causes blood to color it in a form of dying, an act forbidden on the Sabbath.)  (I Kings 5:13 cont.:) “And with/concerning ('al) the fish.” Is it possible that one would so speak? Solomon merely said, “For what reason do cattle, beasts, and birds require ritual slaughtering, while fish do not require ritual slaughtering?” Jacob the man of Kefar Gibburayya taught in Tyre with respect to fish, that they do require ritual slaughtering. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him, “On what basis did you decide this?” He said to him, “From here (in Gen. 1:20), ‘Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let the fowl fly.’ Just as fowl require ritual slaughtering, so do the fish require ritual slaughtering.” He said to them (i.e., those standing by), “Lay him down to receive lashes.” He said to him, “Shall a person who speaks words of Torah be lashed?” He said to him, “You did not decide [the law] well.” He said to him, “On what basis?” He said to him, “From here (in Numb. 11:22), ‘Are there enough flocks and herds to slaughter for them; are there enough fish in the sea to gather for them?’ The former require ritual slaughtering, while the latter [is taken] through gathering.” He said to him, “Give [me] your beating, as it is good for retention.” And again did Jacob the man of Kefar Gibburayya teach in Tyre, [this time] with respect to an Israelite man, who came upon a foreign woman and had her bear him a son, that he should be circumcised on the Sabbath. When R. Haggai heard, he sent for him to come. He said to him, “On what basis do you hold this?” He said to him, “[From this which is written] (in Numb. 1:18) ‘then they registered their lineages according to their families according to the house of their fathers.’” He said to them (i.e., those standing by), “Lay him down to receive lashes.” He said to him, “Shall a person who speaks words of Torah be lashed?” He said to him, “You did not decide [the law] well.” He said to him, “Where is it shown?” He said to him, “Lie down and listen.” He said to him, “If one of the gentiles came to you in order to become a proselyte on condition that you circumcise him on the Sabbath day or on the Day of Atonement, would you profane the Sabbath on account of him or not?” He said to him, “One does not profane the Sabbath or the Day of Atonement for him but only for the son of an Israelite woman.” He said to him, “On what basis do you hold this?” He said to him (in Ezra 10:3), “So now let us make a covenant with our God to put away all (foreign) wives and (anyone] born of them […].” He said to him, “Would you lash me on the basis of [a non-Mosaic text]?” He said to him, “It is written (ibid.), ‘let it be done [according to] the Torah.’” He said to him, “From which [piece of] Torah?” He said to him, “From that of R. Johanan, when he said in the name of R. Simeon ben Johay, ‘It is written (in Deut. 7:3), “You shall not intermarry with them; do not give your daughters to their sons.” Why? (Deut. 7:4:) “Because they will turn your children away from following me.” Your child that comes from an Israelite woman is called &quot;your child&quot;; but that which comes from a foreign woman is called, not &quot;your child,&quot; but &quot;her child,” as stated (in Gen. 21:13), “And I will also make the son of the maidservant into a nation.”’&quot; He said to him, “Give [me] your beating, as it is good for retention.” Solomon said, “About all these things I have knowledge; but in the case of the parashah on the red heifer, I have investigated it, inquired into it, and examined it. Still (at the end of the verse in Eccl. 7:23), ‘I thought I could fathom it, but it eludes me.’” (Eccl. 8:1:) “Who is like the wise person, and who knows the explanation of a saying?” (Eccl. 8:1:) Who is like the wise person? This is the Holy One, blessed be He, since it is stated about Him (in Prov. 3:19), “Through wisdom the Lord founded the earth.” (Numb. R. 19:4; Eccl. R. 8:1:1; PRK 4:4; PR 14:10.)  (Eccl. 8:1, cont.:) “And who knows the explanation of a saying?” This [also] is the Holy One, blessed be He, who explained the Torah for Moses. (Eccl. 8:1, cont.:) “A person's wisdom lights up his face.” R. Judan said, “Great is the power of the prophets, as they [are able to] compare the Almighty above to the form of a man, as stated (Daniel 8:16), ‘And I heard the voice of a man.’” And R. Judah bar Simon says [the proof] is from here (in Ezekiel 1:26), “and on the image of a chair was an image of a man.” (Eccl. 8:1, cont.:) “And the radiance ('oz) of his face is changed (for the better),” in that he changes the principle of judgment into a principle of mercy with respect to Israel. R. Joshua of Sikhnin said in the name of R. Levi, “Over each and every word that the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke to Moses, He spoke to him of its [related] uncleanness and of its purification. (See Numb. R. 19:4.)  When he made known the Parashah (starting with Lev. 21:1), ‘Speak (Emor) unto the priests,’ [Moses] said to him, ‘Master of the world, if a priest becomes unclean (through touching a human corpse), what means is there for his purification?’ When [the Holy One, blessed be He,] did not answer, at that time the face of Moses turned yellow (with shame). Then when the Holy One, blessed be He, reached the parashah on the [red] heifer, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘Moses, [when I gave you] that saying which I spoke to you (in Lev. 21:1), “Go, speak unto the priests,” then you said to me, “If one becomes unclean, what means will there be for his purification,” I did not answer [you at that time. Now] this is his purification (in Numb. 19:17), “They shall take some ashes from the burning of the sin offering (i.e., the red heifer).”‘”</p>

              </summary>
              <p>(Deut. 7:12:) “And it shall come to pass if you heed [these statutes].” What is written above the matter (in Deut. 7:7)? “It is not because you are the most numerous of all the peoples [that the Lord desired you and chose you. Rather you are the least of all the peoples].” It is not because you are the most numerous of all the nations,” and it was not because you fulfilled more commandments than they; for the nations do more commandments that they were not commanded than you, and they magnify My name more than you. Thus it is stated (in Mal. 1:11-12), “For from the rising of the sun until its setting My name is great among the nations, [and in every place incense is offered to My name, even a pure oblation; for My name is great among the nations]…. But you desecrate it when you say the table of the Lord is defiled, and its special food is treated with scorn [like ordinary] food.” (Deut. 7:7:) “Rather you were the least of all the peoples.” Rather, because you diminish yourselves for Me, therefore I love you.’ And so it says (in Mal. 1:2-3), “’I have loved you,’ says the Lord …. ‘But I have hated Esau….’” It also says (in Hos. 14:5), “I will heal their veering and love them voluntarily….” My soul has volunteered to love them, even though they were not worthy; and so it says (in Deut. 7:8), “Because the Lord loves you […].” It is written (in Is. 2:2), “And it shall come to pass that in the latter days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains….” This text is related (to Job 8:7), “Though your beginning was trifling (rt.: ts'r), [your end shall greatly flourish].” [This verse is here] to teach you that everyone who is troubled (rt.: ts'r) from his beginning will have it well at his end. You have no one who was more troubled (rt.: ts'r) than Abraham, who was cast into a fiery furnace and went into exile from his ancestral home. Moreover, sixteen kings pursued him. He also stood the test of ten trials and buried Sarah. Yet in the end he had rest, as stated (Gen. 24:1), “Now Abraham was old, advanced in years, and the Lord blessed [Abraham in all things].” So too was Isaac troubled (rt.: ts'r) in his youth, for the Philistines were jealous of him, [as stated] (in Gen. 26:16), “And Abimelech said unto Isaac, ‘Go away from us, [for you have become have become too powerful for us].’” But in the end they begged him [for mercy], as stated (in vs. 27-28), “And Isaac said unto them, ‘Why have you come unto me…?’ And they said, ‘We have clearly seen….’” Jacob also was troubled (rt.: ts'r) in his youth, as stated (in Ps. 129:1), “’They have harassed me greatly from my youth,’ let Israel now say.” While he was in his mother’s belly, Esau sought to kill him, as stated (in Gen. 25:22), “But the children struggled [within her].” [Moreover,] when he received the blessings (according to Gen. 27:41), “Then Esau hated Jacob …, and Esau said in his heart, ‘Let the days of mourning for my father come, [and I will kill my brother Jacob]’.” So he fled to Laban and was troubled (rt.: ts'r) over his daughters, and after that Laban sought to kill him, as stated (in Deut. 26:5), “An Aramean would have destroyed my ancestor.” (This is required sense by the midrash. A more usual translation would read: A WANDERING ARAMEAN WAS MY ANCESTOR.)  He went away from him and encountered Esau, as stated (in Gen. 33:1), “Now Jacob raised his eyes and saw Esau coming….” There came upon him the trouble over Dinah, the trouble over Rachel and the trouble over Joseph. But in the end he had rest, [as stated] (in Gen. 47:12), “And Joseph sustained his father [and his brothers]….” Ergo (in Job 8:7), “Though your beginning was trifling (rt.: ts'r), your end shall greatly flourish.” Another interpretation (of Is. 2:2), “the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established as the highest of the mountains… and Mount Tabor shall become very tall.” A parable: To what is the matter comparable? To the palace (Palterin. Gk.: praitorion; Lat. praetorium.)  children of a king. They went down from the city and killed lions, tigers, and bears in the forest. Then they brought them and hung them opposite the city gate, so that all the people in the city were amazed from those lions. The Holy One, blessed be he, did so with Sisera. [When] Sisera came against Israel on Mount Tabor; (according to Jud. 5:20), “The stars fought from the heavens; from their courses they fought with Sisera.” (Cf. Pes. 118b, according to which the stars descended and heated the iron implements in Sisera’s army.)  All began to be amazed, for there had never been an event like this, when the stars came down from the heavens to make war with flesh and blood. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, “In this world the stars have fought on your behalf, but in the world to come (according to Zech. 14:3-4), ‘Then the Lord will come forth and fight with those nations [as when He fights in the day of battle]. And His feet shall stand in that day [upon the Mount of Olives]….’ And [so on through] all that section (of Zechariah).” Then everyone will see and point Him out with the finger, as stated (in Is. 25:9), “In that day they shall say, ‘See, this is our God; [we waited for Him, and He delivered us. This is the Lord; we waited for Him. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation].’”</p>

              <p>Another comment on I have been young, and now am old. This verse suggests that the Holy One, blessed be He, will never abandon the righteous during a time of famine, neither they nor their descendants. In fact, when a disaster envelops the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, decrees how they will survive. You find this to be so in the case of Elijah, whom He told how to survive, as it is said: Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there; behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee (I Kings 17:9). Similarly you find: Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there (ibid., vv. 3–4). And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine (Gen. 26:1); and there was a famine in the land; and Abraham descended (ibid. 12:10). Similarly, when the famine came upon Jacob, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed to him that Joseph would feed him in Egypt, as it is said: And Joseph fed his father and his brothers (Gen. 47:12). Hence, Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt.</p>

Noah saw the world inhabited, he witnessed its destruction, and finally he beheld it reinhabited. Daniel saw the first Temple intact, he beheld its destruction, and then he witnessed the erection of the second Temple. Job saw his household established, he beheld its destruction, and he finally witnessed its reestablishment. Noah was a righteous man. Noah was called righteous because he fed the creatures of the Holy One, blessed be He. Two men were called righteous because they fed the creatures of the Holy One, blessed be He. They were Noah and Joseph. It is written concerning Joseph: Because they sell the righteous for silver (Amos 2:6), and of Joseph it is also said: And Joseph fed (Gen. 47:12).</p>

Rabbi Samuel bar Nachmani said, 'Sustenance is even greater than redemption, for redemption comes through an angel, as it says, &quot;The angel who redeemed me from all harm&quot; [Genesis 48:16], while sustenance comes directly from God, as it says, &quot;God who shepherds me&quot; [Psalms 23:1].&quot; Therefore, Shepherd of Israel, listen and conduct [yourself] like Joseph's flock. Just as Joseph gathered [grain] from the years of plenty for the years of famine, so too gather us from the life of this world to the life of the next. Just as Joseph provided for his brothers according to their deeds, as it says, &quot;Bread according to their children's needs&quot; [Genesis 47:12], so too provide for us according to our deeds.

              <p>“This is the law of the peace offering that one sacrifices to the Lord” (Leviticus 7:11).  “If he sacrifices it as a thanks offering, he shall sacrifice with the thanks offering unleavened loaves mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers smeared with oil, and loaves of boiled fine flour, mixed with oil” (Leviticus 7:12).  “This is the law of the peace offering that one sacrifices to the Lord.” That is what the verse says: “One who slaughters a thanks offering honors Me” (Psalms 50:23). It is not written here “One who slaughters a sin offering,” or “one who slaughters a guilt offering,”  but rather, “one who slaughters a thanks offering.” Why? A sin offering comes due to a sin and a guilt offering comes due to a sin. A thanks offering does not come due to a sin, “if he sacrifices it as a thanks offering.”  Another matter, “one who slaughters a thanks offering honors Me,” this is Akhan, who slaughtered his evil inclination in confession. “Joshua said to Akhan: My son, please give glory [to the Lord, God of Israel, and confess to Him]… Akhan answered Joshua [and he said: Indeed, I have sinned against the Lord, God of Israel; such and such I have done]” (Joshua 7:19–20). “And for one who sets his path” (Psalms 50:23); he showed the penitents the path [of repentance].   That is what is written: “The sons of Zeraḥ: Zimri, Eitan, Heiman, Kalkol, and Darda; all of them were five” (I Chronicles 2:6). Zimri – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: This is Akhan, as he performed the act of Zimri. (In addition to the sin of taking from the prohibited spoils of Jericho (see Joshua 7:1), Akhan sinned in the realm of forbidden sexual relations (see Sanhedrin 44a), as did Zimri (see Numbers 25:14). )  The Rabbis say: It is because Israel was pruned [nizmeru] on his account. (Thirty-six soldiers were killed in the first war with Ai due to Akhan’s sin.)  Eitan – this is Abraham our patriarch, based on: “A contemplation by Eitan the Ezrahite” (Psalms 89:1). (The Sages identify Eitan the Ezrahite with Abraham. See Bava Batra 15a. )  Heiman – this is Moses, as it is stated: “In all My household he is trusted [ne’eman]” (Numbers 12:7). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: This is Akhan, based on: “Indeed [omna], I have sinned” (Joshua 7:20). Kalkol – this is Joseph, based on: “Joseph sustained [vaykhalkel]” (Genesis 47:12). Darda – this is the generation [dor] of the wilderness, which was full of knowledge [de’a]. “All of them were five” – do we not know that all of them were five? Rather, it teaches that even Akhan was with them in the World to Come. Likewise, Joshua said: “May the Lord sully you on this day” (Joshua 7:25); this day you are sullied, but you are not sullied in the future.</p>

Tanchuma explains this on Genesis 37,17 נסעו מזה. In spite of the brothers having severed their connection with Joseph at that time, he provided for them as we know from Genesis 47,12.</p>

              <p>Tanchuma on Chukat 8 comments as follows on the words: “they shall take a red cow to you.” The words “a cow to you,” mean that I, G’d, will reveal the meaning of this legislation to you, but for everyone else it will remain in the realm of a חוקה, a statute, beyond their understanding. This interpretation is based on an illuminating comment by Rav Huna on two verses (Psalms 75,3 and Zecharyah 14,6). In the former verse the psalmist writes: At the time I choose I will give judgment equitably.” [At that time the justice of My ways will become revealed to everyone, seeing G’d did not mean to imply that up until that time His justice had been inequitable. Ed.]. In the other verse the prophet quotes G’d as saying: “in that day there shall be neither sunlight nor cold moonlight, but there shall be a continuous day -only the Lord knows when- of neither day or night, and there shall be light at eventide.” The meaning of the verse is that there will remain matters which while they are not revealed to you in this world will be revealed to you in that future, such as the blind man who gains his sight, of whom Isaiah 42,16 writes: “I will guide the blind by a road they did not know, and I will make them walk by paths they never knew I will turn darkness before them to light.....these are the things which I have done and I will not abandon them.” The crucial word in that verse is the word עשיתים, instead of אעשה אותם, i.e. “I have done them,” instead of “I am going to do them” (as we would have expected). This means (according to Tanchuma) that what is described here as a view of the future G’d has already shown to Rabbi Akiva and his companions (who descended into the Pardess).  A different approach to the same verse: Even matters which have not been revealed to Moses will be revealed to Rabbi Akiva. This is based on Job 28,10: “his eyes behold every precious thing.” These words which describe someone as seeing “every precious thing” refer to Rabbi Akiva. Solomon said in Kohelet 7,23: “All this I tested with wisdom; I thought to myself that I would become wise, but it is beyond me.” The words: “I would become wise,” are a reference to the testimony in Kings I 5,9: “the Lord had given wisdom to Solomon and discernment in great measure....and his wisdom was greater than that of all the Kedemites and all the wisdom of Egypt.” What precisely did the wisdom of the Kedemites consist of? They knew how to interpret zodiac signs, were experts in astrology; they were also familiar with the tiar, a bird (raven?) based on Kohelet 10,20: “for a bird of the sky may carry the sound, and some winged creature may betray the matter.”  Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel used to say that he liked three customs of the Orientals. They do not kiss on the mouth but on the hand; when they cut meat they always employ a knife; when they ask someone’s advice on a matter they invariably do this in the field (where they cannot be overheard). This latter practice is based on Yaakov consulting with his wives in the field on his decision to leave Lavan (compare Genesis 31,4). What did the wisdom of the Egyptians which Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel praised consist of? You will find that when Solomon was about to build the Temple he sent word to Pharaoh Necho asking him to supply him with artisans on loan to help him in the construction. How did Pharaoh answer this request? He consulted his astrologers to determine which of his artisans would not live out the year and he then dispatched these artisans to Solomon. When Solomon saw these people he realized with the aid of Holy Spirit that they were all going to die during that year. He provided each one with a shroud and sent them back to Pharaoh with a note reading: “were you short of shrouds in Egypt? Here I send you your artisans back with a gift of shrouds.” When the Book of Kings wrote that Solomon was wiser than “כל האדם, “any man” (or “Adam,”) what precisely did the unique wisdom of Adam consist of? You will find a discussion in the Midrash that when G’d was about to create Adam He consulted with the ministering angels about His plan saying: “let us make Adam in our image and in our likeness.” The angels countered: “what is so special about Adam that You want to bother with him?” G’d responded that the Adam He intended to create would be wiser than they. How did G’d proceed to prove His point? He assembled all the beasts, the birds, etc., and asked the angels to name them. The angels were unable to do this. After G’d had created Adam, He paraded all the animals in front of him and asked him: “what is the name of this animal, etc.?” Adam replied: “this one is called “lion,” this one is called “giraffe,” this one is called “sheep,“ etc.; etc. This is the meaning of Genesis 2,20: “Adam called the names of all the beasts.”‘ All these names Adam gave the beasts were not merely arbitrary names he chose to call them by, but they reflected the essence of each animal respectively. I have already discussed this in greater detail in my commentary on Genesis 2,19. When G’d asked Adam what his own name was, he answered: “Adam.” He explained that he said this seeing he had been created out of אדמה, raw material taken from the soil. Thereupon G’d asked Adam what His name was. Adam answered that G’d’s name was the tetragram. When G’d wanted to know what had given him this idea, (seeing he had not been told) he answered: for You are the Master of all creatures. We know that Adam was correct from Isaiah 42,8 אני י-ה-ו-ה הוא שמי, “I am the Lord, this is My name.” G’d meant that He adopted (or retained this name) seeing the first human being Adam had bestowed it upon Him. This was a pact between Adam and G’d that G’d would henceforth be known by the name bestowed upon him by His first intelligent creature.  When we read in Kings I 5,11 that Solomon was wiser than Eytan the Ezrachi, whom did Jeremiah (author of that Book) have in mind when he wrote these words? It was a reference to Avraham. Psalm 89 is attributed to Avraham as the word האזרחי, at the beginning of that psalm is a reference to the “East” according to our sages in Baba Batra 15. Heyman is understood to be Moses (ibid). The philological connection is established by the word נאמן in Numbers 12,7 that G’d said of Moses בכל ביתי נאמן הוא, “he is trusted in My entire House.” כלכל, another of the wise men mentioned in the chapter of the Book of Kings extolling Solomon’s wisdom is a reference to Joseph (who “provided” for all of Egypt economically with his wisdom). The Egyptians recognized that the only reason a man whom they considered a slave was able to rule over them was the extreme wisdom of Joseph which enabled him to maintain himself in that position. The Egyptians who had been suspicious of Joseph and his ability brought him seventy different pieces of paper, each in a different language, asking him to explain what was written thereon. Joseph was able to read each in its respective language. Not only that; Joseph also knew Hebrew, a tongue which the Egyptians did not understand. We base this on Psalms 81,6: עדות ביהוסף שמו, i.e. an allusion that Joseph knew something in addition to what anyone else knew. The word דרדע, another person named as very wise in Kings 5,11 is a reference to the generation of Israelites who had experienced the revelation at Mount Sinai in the desert and who had been granted insights exceeding that of any other generation. They were known as the דור דעה, “the generation imbued with knowledge.” The בני מחול who are also listed in the Book of Kings as possessing outstanding wisdom are an allusion to the people of the period of the golden calf whom G’d had forgiven their participation in that sin, hence they were called בני מחול, “people who had been pardoned.”   The Book of Kings there continues in quantifying Solomon’s wisdom by attributing to him no fewer than three thousand parables (proverbs) and over one thousand poems. Concerning this enigmatic statement Rabbi Shmuel bar Nachmeni opines that he made a search of the entire Bible and could not come up with more than approximately 800 verses in which Solomon is mentioned as saying anything of significance. We are therefore forced to interpret these numbers mentioned in the Book of Kings not as original sayings recorded in the Bible but as the number of interpretations offered by Solomon on a far smaller number of texts. When Kings I 5,13 speaks about Solomon “speaking about trees,” one such example may be that Solomon examined the phenomenon of a person afflicted with the skin disease tzoraat requiring some of the wood from the tallest tree (cedar) and some of the wood from the most lowly tree (hyssop) to effect his purification. Solomon suggested that the cause of the affliction was that the person so stricken was guilty of arrogance, considering himself superior to his contemporaries. In order to be cured of this psychological defect he had to “lower” himself (even in his own eyes) to the level of the hyssop, the lowest of the trees in order to be fit to rejoin society. The Book of Kings goes on to describe part of Solomon’s wisdom as his ability to speak על הבהמה ועל העוף ועל הרמש ועל הדגים, “on the mammals, the birds, the creeping creatures and the fish.” He defined the reason why mammals, if fit to eat, require the severing of both the gullet and the windpipe, whereas birds require the severing of only one of these organs. He explained that this was related to the raw material these creatures were made of, i.e. the mammals were created from the soil (Genesis 1,24), whereas the birds were created from a mixture of water and soil, i.e. from mud (Genesis 1,20).   When Solomon is reported as speaking about the creeping things, the meaning is that he explained why eight of these species confer ritual impurity on contact with their carcass, etc. He also explained why people who hunt or injure these species on the Sabbath are guilty of a major infraction of the Sabbath legislation, whereas other related creeping creatures are not treated in that way by halachah, i.e. because these eight species are covered by skin (Shabbat 107). Concerning the statement in Kings that Solomon spoke about the fish, he explained why they do not require ritual slaughter in order to make them fit to eat for Israelites, as we know from Numbers 11,22 where Moses speaks of slaughter for mammals and fowl, but implies that the mere gathering in of fish make them fit to be eaten. In short, Solomon declares that whereas he was able to figure out satisfactory reasons for all the legislations of the Torah concerning these creatures, the reason for the red cow legislation had escaped him. It is interesting that the numerical value of the words והיא רחוקה, which Solomon uses to describe his inability to fathom the meaning of something, is the same as that of פרה אדומה, “red cow” (341).</p>

                <h4>Ramban on Exodus 25:29:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>AND THOU SHALT MAKE ‘KE’AROTHAV VEKAPOTHAV UKSOTHAV UMENAKIYOTHAV.’ Rashi explained: “Ke’arothav are the forms [the moulds that were made to fit the shape of the bread]; vekapothav are spoons in which the incense was put; (See Leviticus 24:7.)  uksothav are rods in the shape of halves of hollow canes [which were put between one loaf and another so that they would not become mouldy]; umenakiyothav are the trestles which were notched in [five places] to support the canes.” These vessels [that Rashi referred to] are indeed mentioned in the Gemara. (Menachoth 97a.)  And the Rabbi further said: “The word mechilathei [which Onkelos used for the Hebrew menakiyothav] means ‘bearers,’ similar to the expressions: and I weary myself ‘kalkeil’ (to bear it); (Jeremiah 20:9.)  I am weary ‘hachil’ (bearing it). (Ibid., 6:11. The beginning of the verse reads: Therefore I am full of the fury of the Eternal.)  Now the Sages of Israel have differed on this. For some say that ksothav are the trestles, and menakiyothav are the hollow canes. But Onkelos who translated menakiyothav by [the Aramaic] mechilathei was of the same opinion as he who says that menakiyoth are the trestles [supporting pillars attached to the table].” These are Rashi’s words. But I do not find them to be correct, for the word mechilathei [of Onkelos] in the Aramaic language is but a term meaning measures, such as ephahs and the like. Thus Onkelos rendered, eiphath tzedek (Leviticus 19:36.)  — mechilon dikshot (a true measure); Thou shalt not have in thy house ‘eiphah v’eiphah’ (Deuteronomy 25:14.)  — thou shalt not have mechilta umechilta (diverse measures). In a similar sense it is found whenever mentioned in the Talmud and in the Sages’ words: kayal meikal (he was measuring); (Menachoth 53 b: ka kayol.)  bimchilta d’kayil inish ba mitkil (with the measure that one measures others, with that he is measured). (Targum Yerushalmi Genesis 38:26.)  Similarly, I am weary ‘hachil’ (Ibid., 6:11. The beginning of the verse reads: Therefore I am full of the fury of the Eternal.)  means “I am weary of being a holding measure” [of G-d’s fury], and it is associated with these expressions: alpayim bath yachil (it held two thousand baths); (I Kings 7:26.)  v’chol bashalish aphar ha’aretz (and He comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure); (Isaiah 40:12.)  too little ‘meihachil’ (to receive) the burnt offering. (I Kings 8:64.)  Similarly, I am weary ‘hachil’ (Ibid., 6:11. The beginning of the verse reads: Therefore I am full of the fury of the Eternal.)  is in my opinion not an expression of “bearing” but is instead a form of that very same meaning of “holding,” thus saying, “I am weary of holding” [G-d’s fury], similar in usage to these expressions: the land is not able ‘l’hachil’ (to hold) all his words; (Amos 7:10.)  the spirit of a man ‘y’chalkeil’ his infirmity, (Proverbs 18:14.)  meaning that he will be able to hold the pain within himself and not become weary [and broken in spirit] because of it. Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot ‘y’chalkelucha’ (I Kings 8:27.)  — they cannot hold and contain the greatness of Your exaltedness, for there is no limit and measure to You — how much less this house that I have built! (I Kings 8:27.)  'Y’chalkeil' his words rightfully (Psalms 112:5.)  means that he is not a fool who spendeth all his spirit, (Proverbs 29:11.)  but holds his words within himself when necessary, and uses them as necessary. 'Vay’chalkeil Yoseiph' (Genesis 47:12.)  means that Joseph gave them as much food as they could hold; he gave neither too much nor too little, but bread according to the want of their little ones. (See Ramban on Genesis 41:48 (Vol. I, p. 507) that Joseph had gathered all food essential to life “even figs, fresh and dried, etc.” Now of this kind of food he gave his family abundantly, but bread he gave them according to the want of their little ones (Genesis 47:12).)  And such is the explanation of all [other similar expressions]. But Onkelos’ opinion [who translated umenakiyothav — umechilathei] is not clear. Perhaps menakiyothav is in the opinion of Onkelos a term for measures, since they had [in the Tabernacle and later in the Sanctuary] a measure holding two tenth parts [of an ephah] flour, with which to measure one cake, (Leviticus 24:5.)  and they did not measure it twice with the one tenth measure of the meal-offering. We must then say that Onkelos differs from the Mishnah which teaches: (Menachoth 87a.)  “There were two dry-measures in the Sanctuary: the tenth, and the half-tenth” [of an ephah], and in his opinion there were three dry-measures: the tenth, the half-tenth, and the two tenths. The correct interpretation of Onkelos’ opinion appears to me to be that mechila is the form (mould) made for the dough, just as the Rabbis have said: (Ibid., 94a.)  “There were in the Tabernacle three moulds [for the showbread]: he placed it in a mould whilst it was still dough; when baked in the oven it was put in another mould, and when he took it out he placed it in a [third] frame so that it should not spoil.” (The first and third moulds were made of gold; the one for the oven was an iron mould.)  This [third] frame which was used so that it should not spoil did not have to be shaped to the form of the bread and its size; instead, it was made like a sort of dish to support the sides of the bread, this being the ke’arothav mentioned in the verse. But the first mould for the dough was shaped to the form of the bread and its size, namely, ten [handbreadths] long and five wide, and its horns (Small pieces of dough were put on the four corners of each of the breads (Menachoth 96 a).)  seven fingerbreadths [high]. Into this mould the dough was put, measured and shaped to fit its form, and for this reason it was called mechila because it was made to “the measure.” The term menakiyoth then [according to Onkelos] is a name just like ephah and s’ah [a third of the ephah measure is a s’ah], similar, to ke’arothav and ksothav and other nouns which are not descriptive. Perhaps those just measures which are called a just ephah, and a just hin, (Leviticus 19:36.)  and termed menakiyoth [of the root naki — clean] because they are clean of any falsehood, and thus they clear their owners of any cheating and sin. And ksavoth is a general term covering the canes [which were put between one loaf and another] and the trestles [notched in five places upon which the canes separating the loaves rested]. Perhaps because of their notches they were so called [ksavoth], with the letter tzade [ktzavoth — sides, corners] being used instead of the letter sin [ksavoth], this word [ksavoth] being similar to [the word ktzavoth found in the following verse]: so that they that dwell in ‘ktzavoth’ (the uttermost parts) stand in awe of Thy signs, (Psalms 65:9.)  by interchanging the letter tzade with the sin, just like in the word s’chok [“laughter,” which is the word tzchok]. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: “There is an error in Chronicles, (I Chronicles 28:17. The verse there reads: ‘v’hamizlagoth’ (and the forks), ‘v’hamizrakoth’ (and the basins), ‘v’haksavoth’ (and the jars), of pure gold; ‘v’lichphorei’ (and the bowls of) gold by weight ‘lichphor uchphor’ (for every bowl); ‘v’lichphorei’ (and for the bowls of) silver by weight ‘lichphor uchphor’ (for every bowl). — Ibn Ezra’s comment is to the effect that there are new vessels here mentioned for the table in the Sanctuary that are not found here in the Torah in connection with the table in the Tabernacle. — Ramban will point out mat Ibn Ezra erred in thinking that this Verse 17 refers back to the tables of showbread mentioned above in Verse 16, since it really refers back to Verse 13, as explained in the text.)  for in speaking of the vessels of the table in place of ke’aroth [mentioned here] it writes mizrakoth (basins); in place of kapoth [mentioned here] it writes kiporim (bowls); ksavoth is mentioned there as here; and in the place of menakiyoth it speaks of mizlagoth (forks). And all these were made of gold for the purpose of the table [and yet we do not find the mizrakoth, kiporim, and mizlagoth mentioned here in connection with the table in the Tabernacle]! Perhaps these were other vessels which David commanded to be placed on the tables (II Chronicles 4:8.)  which his son Solomon would make, but the table in the Tent of Meeting did not have these vessels.” The error, however, is in Rabbi Abraham’s words, [not in the Book of Chronicles], for that which Scripture states, and the forks, and the basins, and the jars of pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl, (I Chronicles 28:17. The verse there reads: ‘v’hamizlagoth’ (and the forks), ‘v’hamizrakoth’ (and the basins), ‘v’haksavoth’ (and the jars), of pure gold; ‘v’lichphorei’ (and the bowls of) gold by weight ‘lichphor uchphor’ (for every bowl); ‘v’lichphorei’ (and for the bowls of) silver by weight ‘lichphor uchphor’ (for every bowl). — Ibn Ezra’s comment is to the effect that there are new vessels here mentioned for the table in the Sanctuary that are not found here in the Torah in connection with the table in the Tabernacle. — Ramban will point out mat Ibn Ezra erred in thinking that this Verse 17 refers back to the tables of showbread mentioned above in Verse 16, since it really refers back to Verse 13, as explained in the text.)  is not connected only with the tables of showbread (I Chronicles 28:16.)  [mentioned in the preceding verse], but it reverts back to that which Scripture stated [several verses above], and for all the work of the service of the house of the Eternal, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the Eternal. (Ibid., Verse 13.)  And then it continues, of gold, for all vessels of every kind of service, (Ibid., Verse 14.)  and then it mentioned, and the forks, and the basins (I Chronicles 28:17. The verse there reads: ‘v’hamizlagoth’ (and the forks), ‘v’hamizrakoth’ (and the basins), ‘v’haksavoth’ (and the jars), of pure gold; ‘v’lichphorei’ (and the bowls of) gold by weight ‘lichphor uchphor’ (for every bowl); ‘v’lichphorei’ (and for the bowls of) silver by weight ‘lichphor uchphor’ (for every bowl). — Ibn Ezra’s comment is to the effect that there are new vessels here mentioned for the table in the Sanctuary that are not found here in the Torah in connection with the table in the Tabernacle. — Ramban will point out mat Ibn Ezra erred in thinking that this Verse 17 refers back to the tables of showbread mentioned above in Verse 16, since it really refers back to Verse 13, as explained in the text.)  which are vessels of the altar, and the jars for the table, and the bowls for the altar. And finally it stated, and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight, (Ibid., Verse 18.)  concluding: All this [do I give thee] in writing, as the Eternal hath made me wise by His hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern. (Ibid., Verse 19.)  Thus David [in speaking to his son Solomon] included all needs of the Sanctuary.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Yaakov’s descent to Egypt involves three meetings: with God, with Yosef, and with Pharaoh. The first is God’s final revelation to Yaakov. God had previously forbidden Yitzhak to go to Egypt during a famine (26:1–2), but his son may now go as part of the divine plan, his people’s destiny. The blessing given to Avraham’s children (particularly to Yishmael) is repeated in 46:3, and God will be “with” Yaakov (46:4) on this journey as he has been on others. The meeting between father and long-lost son is brief but powerful, returning as it does to the “face” motif (46:30). Immediately afterward Yosef gives the family advice on how to demonstrate their usefulness to the Egyptians, and one is struck by the precariousness of their situation in even this best of circumstances. Yaakov’s brief audience with Pharaoh is both moving and pathetic. The Patriarch sums up his life in depressing terms, and it becomes clear that long life (he believes his own to be short), in addition to wealth and fertility, is considered a sign of divine favor. The actual migration is sketched in a few brief strokes. The list of names in 46:8–27 has been constructed on patterned numbers, with a total of seventy.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>LANGUISHED. Va-telah (languished) follows the paradigm of va-teta (and strayed) (Gen. 21:14). (The root of va-tela is lamed, heh, heh. The root of va-teta is tav, ayin, heh. Both words drop the final root letter and are similarly vocalized.)  Similarly ke-mitlahle’ah (as a madman) (Prov. 26:18) is like ki-metate’ah (as a mocker) (Gen. 27:12). (Both of these words also follow similar patterns in their quadriliteral form. In Prov. 26:18 and in Gen. 27:12 these words appear as quadriliteral; i.e., their first root letters are similarly doubled forming the stems lamed, heh, lamed, heh and tav ayin, tav ayin.)  Its meaning is, the land was like a person who has lost his wits. (Its inhabitants couldn’t think clearly because of exhaustion (Krinsky). Thus according to I.E. va-telah means crazed. Cf. I.E. on Prov. 26:18 and Kimchi on our verse.) </p>

              <p>ולחם אין…כי כבד הרעב מאד, there was no bread…because the famine was very severe, etc. The Torah informs us of the psychology of hunger. During a famine people have a tendency to eat inordinate amounts of food thus causing their reserves of food to be depleted prematurely. The author describes a personal experience of famine in the country he lived in where a person ate ten times the amount of food he would eat normally and still felt hungry.</p>

              <p>וילקט יוסף את כל הכסף, Joseph collected all the silver (money), etc. The reason the Torah uses the expression לקט, gleaned, for the manner in which Joseph collected the money, is to tell us that after Joseph had collected there was absolutely no money left anywhere.</p>

              <p>וילקט יוסף את כל הכסף הנמצא, “Joseph collected all the money which could be found, etc.” When the verse continues with: “Joseph brought the money he had collected to the palace of Pharaoh,” the letter ה is to tell us that he brought all of it to Pharaoh’s palace. All the acquisitions Joseph made from the people he channeled to Pharaoh. He did not pocket any of it for himself. Although he took from the people their most precious possessions he remained popular with them. This was clearly something that G’d had arranged. The plain meaning of all these verses is that the money mentioned (verse 18) is money which Joseph collected over a period of five years and brought it to Pharaoh’s palace. It is not reasonable to suppose that the population of Egypt ran out of money and cattle within a single year or two. The Egyptians had hoarded their money and it had lasted them for five years although under non-famine conditions they would have been less frugal and would have used it up much sooner. The Torah records only that after five years when their money had run out, the people turned to Joseph. Joseph agreed to hand out food in return for their cattle and, when at the end of the sixth year, they had no more cattle left either, he had to warn them to be very frugal in their eating habits.</p>

When the silver was used up, they came to Joseph and said, give us bread, the silver is used up. Why should we die before your eyes? Joseph said: give your flocks. Joseph gave them bread for one year in exchange for the flocks. The next year they came again and said, give us, since the flocks and bread are finished. Joseph took all of their fields and gave them bread for their fields. Ramban writes. Why does the verse have to say that the Egyptians said that the silver of the land of Egypt was used up and says again that the silver of the land of Canaan was used up? Why was Egypt concerned that the silver in the land of Canaan was used up? The explanation is that the Egyptians said to Joseph. You think to gather more silver for your grain. They knew that the silver was used up in all the lands. Why should we die for nothing, as nobody will buy your grain? (Ramban, Genesis, 47:15.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>“[Potiphar...an Egyptian man,] purchased him [from the Ishmaelites]” – those who were acquired were acquiring. (The Ishmaelites descend from Hagar, Sarah’s maidservant, and the Egyptians descend from Ḥam, of whom it is stated: “A slave of slaves he shall be to his brothers” (Genesis 9:25), and they were the ones purchasing and selling Joseph.)  All slaves damage the household of their masters. But this one – “the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph’s sake” (Genesis 39:5). All slaves are suspected of robbery, but this one: “Joseph collected all the silver…[Joseph brought the silver to Pharoah’s house]” (Genesis 47:14). All slaves are suspected of licentiousness, but this one: “But he did not heed her” (Genesis 39:10). Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin said in the name of Rabbi Levi: All slaves, their master feeds teruma to their slaves, but this one fed his master teruma, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Elazar took a wife from the daughters of Joseph. (Joseph was married to Potiphar’s daughter, so Potiphar’s granddaughter married Elazar, the son of Aaron, and ate teruma.)   Potiphar is “Potifera” (Genesis 41:45). Potiphar – because he would fatten [mefatem] calves for idol worship. Potifera – because he would defecate [pore’a atzmo] for idol worship. (Defacation in front of the idol of Baal Peor was a form of its worship (see Sanhedrin 60b). )  When the bull [par] (Joseph, who was likened to a bull; see Deuteronomy 33:17.)  descended there, [Potiphar] became wealthy. (Translation follows Matnot Kehuna. Alternatively, he became an officer, or a eunuch. )    “The official of [seris] Pharaoh” – he was castrated [nistares]. This teaches that [Potiphar] purchased [Joseph] only for intercourse, but the Holy One blessed be He castrated him. This is analogous to a she-bear that was killing its master’s children. He said: ‘Break its teeth.’ So, it teaches that [Potiphar] purchased him only for intercourse, and the Holy One blessed be He castrated him. That is what is written: “For the Lord loves justice [and does not forsake] His pious ones [ḥasidav]” (Psalms 37:28). Ḥasido is written. (The word ḥasidav is written with only one vav, such that it can be read ḥasido, “His pious one,” in singular. It should be noted however that the Masoretic text of Psalms actually has the word ḥasidav with two vavs. The midrash here cites a different tradition. Alternatively, in Midrash Shmuel the version of the text cites I Samuel 2:9 rather than Psalms, and in that verse the word in fact appears as ḥasido, with one vav (Etz Yosef). )  Who is that? It is Joseph. “They are guarded forever, while the seed of the wicked is cut off” (Psalms 37:28) – this teaches that [Potiphar] purchased him only for intercourse, and the Holy One blessed be He castrated him.  “Potiphar…an Egyptian man, purchased him [from [miyad] the Ishmaelites]” – a clever man. What was his cleverness? He said: In every place, a German sells a Cushite, (A white man sells a man of dark complexion (Matnot Kehuna). )  but here, a Cushite is selling a German? This is no slave. He said to them: ‘Bring me a guarantor,’ as the term “from [miyad]” is nothing other than a guarantor, just as it says: “I will guarantee him, [from me [miyadi] you can demand him]” (Genesis 43:9). That is why it says: “From [miyad] the Ishmaelites.”   Rabbi Levi said: A slave purchased, the son of a maidservant sold, and a free man was a slave to both of them. (Potiphar, the Egyptian, was a descendant of Canaan, who was cursed by Noah to be a slave (see Genesis 9:25). The Ishmaelites were sons of Hagar, described as a maidservant to Sarah (see Genesis 16:2). Joseph was, by birth, a free man. ) </p>

Go, and I will send you to them. And he said to him: Here I am&quot; (at your service). Joseph knew that his brothers hated him, but he would not transgress the words of his father. (Exodus 20) &quot;You shall not kill.&quot; He did not kill Potiphar (even though he could have.)

            <summary>Rabbeinu Bahya explains that Joseph's statement to his brothers not to fear was because he was a God-fearing man, implying that any retaliation on his part would be punished by God. Rashi clarifies that the term &quot;grain&quot; in Nehemiah 10:32 refers to all grains. Ramban interprets the storing of food by Joseph during the years of plenty as a way to ensure sustenance during the famine, including various types of food essential for life, and suggests that Joseph may have sold the grain back to the Egyptians during the famine.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>אל תיראו כי התחת אלוקים אני, “do not fear! For am I instead of G’d?” He meant that the reason they did not have to be afraid of him was that he himself was a G’d-fearing man. He implied, as explained by Onkelos who uses the word דחלא — “real fear”, that even if he were bent on retaliation this would only backfire as G’d would punish him in turn. The letter ה at the beginning of the word התחת must not be understood as introducing a question but as part of Joseph conception of “fear of the Lord.” If one “fears” the Lord it is because one knows that He returns tit for tat. We have other examples where such letters ה which at first glance appear to introduce a question do not in fact do so. Compare Samuel I 2,27 הנגלה נגליתי אל בית אביך. The translation of these words is clearly not: “did I appear in the house of your father?” Rather these words need to be translated as: “I revealed Myself to your father’s house.” Joseph repeated the words “do not be afraid,” in both verse 19 and 21. The first “fear” he spoke of was the brothers’ fear of him; the second fear he spoke of was the fear of the famine which had started again. This is why he added immediately, (concerning their second fear) “I will provide for you.” (Compare my comments on Genesis 47,14).</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND HE STORED UP ALL THE FOOD. “He” refers to Joseph mentioned above. (In Verse 46: And Joseph was…)  The same applies to the following verse: And Joseph piled up grain… until he ceased numbering. (Verse 49 here.)  The pronoun “he” refers to Joseph, who was mentioned. Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that the phrase, all the food, is not to be understood literally, for otherwise they would have died of famine immediately. A similar case is the verse, And all the lands came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain. (Verse 57 here. This verse is also not to be understood in its literal sense since Jacob and Benjamin did not come to buy grain.)  The meaning of he stored up all the food is only that Joseph stored up all the food which he could. It appears to me to be correct that Joseph gathered all food under his control, and he gave enough of it every year for sustenance to the Egyptians, so that they should not squander it. This is the intent of his statement, And let them store up all the food of those good years that come, and pile up corn under the hand of Pharaoh… and hold it there. (Verse 35 here. Ramban thus makes a distinction between ochel (food) and ibur (corn). At the end of the paragraph, he will mention that Onkelos makes no distinction between them.)  Now in view of the fact that it says, And let them store up all the food… and pile up corn, (Verse 35 here. Ramban thus makes a distinction between ochel (food) and ibur (corn). At the end of the paragraph, he will mention that Onkelos makes no distinction between them.)  and [here in the verses before us] it says, And he stored up all the food… And Joseph piled up grain, this would indicate that he gathered whatever is eaten by man; corn, bread, and all food essential to life, even figs, fresh and dried, and similar things. He piled the corn — meaning the produce which is brought under a winnowing shovel and fan for fanning and cleansing — under the hand of Pharaoh, and he laid up in the cities enough of all the fruits for sustenance. Thus all the food was held in need for the years of famine to be drawn upon to the degree essential for life, and the balance of the corn he preserved in the storehouses. It is possible that Joseph paid them money from the royal treasures at a low market price. This was why the corn belonged to Pharaoh, and he sold it to them in the years of famine, just as it is written, And Joseph collected all the money that was found in the land of Egypt. (Further, 47:14.)  It is possible that the king took it by force, saying: “I preserved it.” (For were it not for the king’s dream, the food of the seven years of plenty would have been squandered.)  Onkelos, however, translated both ochel (food) and bar (corn) alike. (Calling them ibur. See Note 111.) </p>

              <p>ולמה נמות….כי אפס כסף, &quot;why should we die …for there is no more money?&quot; The people complained that Joseph had proved unwilling to accept any payment other than money in return for grain. They argued that they were not destitute, they could pay him with other chattels; why should they die merely because they could not pay cash? This is why Joseph replied that he was willing to accept their cattle in payment only &quot;if indeed there is no more money.&quot; Joseph's reason for all this was to impoverish the Egyptians so that his brothers would not be in an economically inferior position vis-a-vis the Egyptians. Joseph was very clever not to accept any payment other than money as long as there was cash around. As long as the Egyptians still had their livestock they would have to provide fodder for their animals; presumably one effect of the famine was the absence of grazing land. The Egyptians therefore had to feed their livestock with barley. This in turn led to the money supply becoming completely exhausted within a year. As a result of Joseph's strategy the brothers who arrived during the second year of the famine were wealthy compared to the average Egyptian at that time.</p>

              <p>The Egyptians may also have meant to convey to Joseph that they did have money but that they had no cash flow at that time. They were unable to collect their receivables. This was not something unusual as many people invested their money in enterprises in foreign countries, sending money on ships which were meant to import goods. Their argument therefore was: &quot;why should we die since we have the necessary liquid assets and are only unable temporarily to collect that money?&quot; Accordingly, Joseph told them that if they really did have money in the form of receivables he was willing to accept their livestock as payment for food in the meantime. The livestock served as collateral for the cash the Egyptians would owe him. As soon as they would collect their receivables he expected them to turn over the money to him.</p>

              <p>ויבאו כל מצרים, the people living in the land of Canaan went elsewhere to secure their food supplies. By now the Torah speaks of conditions during the sixth year of the famine. During that year Joseph distributed food and accepted livestock as payment. In the seventh year he handed over food in return for the local land owners renouncing their title to their land in favour of Pharaoh. He distributed seed so that there would be a harvest during the eight’s year when the famine was supposed to have ended. Our sages, quoted by Rashi, claim that the famine ceased with the arrival of Yaakov in Egypt and his blessing to Pharaoh which resulted in the Nile once again overflowing its banks and providing irrigation for the fields. One can raise serious reservations about this approach. If the famine did indeed stop already in the second year or at the end thereof, when did all the measures Joseph is described as taking in verses 14-22 take place?

              <p>ויתום הכסף מארץ מצרים, “Egypt completely ran out of money,” money stopped circulating as there was too little of it both in Egypt and in the land of Canaan. The reason why the Torah had to mention that money had also run out in the land of Canaan was that the Egyptians said to Joseph: “seeing that there is no point in your waiting for more buyers from the land of Canaan, as they have no money with which to buy, you might as well introduce a new bartering system in Egypt. If you keep waiting for customers and we die in the meantime, you will be left with tons of supplies and no one who will buy it from you. The disappearance of money from circulation occurred gradually, beginning with the poor running out of cash first. The words ויתם הכסף describe a state when even the wealthy people had no more ready cash.
    According to the Midrash Joseph had been equipped with a degree of prophecy so much so that he knew how much money every person still possessed. He used this knowledge to charge higher prices to the rich and lower prices to the poor, in order to preserve a certain degree of equality amongst the population when it came to obtaining the necessities of life.

He explains “that He will see” as “when He sees” because the word כי (when) here is like “When (כי) you come to the land, etc.” (Vayikra 25:2) which means “when.” And the word אזלת means “surging.” The word “power” refers back to the enemy, even though it is not mentioned here. He also added the word “against them” to inform who the power is going against. “None (אפס)” means “no more” as in the verse, “for there is no (אפס) money” (Bereishis 47:15). “Structured (עצוב)” means collected under the authority of the ruler. “Fortified” (עזוב) means “strengthened” and he added the term “among them” after “and that there is no one” because “no more” applies only applies to them, i.e. it is finished their being gathered and strengthened. Rashi also adds “The Holy One, Blessed Is He” after “He shall say” to inform that the one who says “Where is their god” is The Holy One, Blessed Is He. He adds “concerning them” to show the subject of “their gods” refers to “about His servants” mentioned above. The conjunctive vav of ואמר “And He shall say” is like the vav of “And the Lord your God will guard (ושמר) for you” (Devarim 7:12) which means “He will guard” [in the future tense]. The meaning of the verses are as follows: When Hashem will inflict suffering on His people with all these afflictions, and He will reconsider and console them when He sees that the power of the enemy becoming greater and greater against them, and they cease to be guarded and held strongly, to be without a protector or a ruler, Hashem will say of them, “Where are your idols in whom you trusted? Let them come and save you.” Therefore it is appropriate for you to understand from all the evils that I have brought on you, and there is no savior from all the idols in whom you trusted. They have no power to stay My hand, because it is I Who has the power to lower or to raise, and “no one can rescue you from My grasp.” Afterwards Scripture mentions the vengeance which He will wreak on the enemies.

Such a word drops its first root letter in the plural masculine imperative and its second root letter is vocalized with a sheva. Compare, yada and yatza which in the imperative plural masculine become de’u and tze’u. Thus havu should have a chataf pattach beneath the heh. However, it does not. The heh is vocalized with a kamatz. It is therefore irregular.) </p>

            <summary>Joseph selected five relatively weak brothers to present before Pharaoh, avoiding the mighty ones whose names were repeated in Moses's blessing.

              </summary>
              <p>“From among his brothers he took five men, and he presented them before Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:2).  “From among [miktze] his brothers he took five men” – why did the verse state “from among [miktze] his brothers”? It is to teach you that they were not mighty. (The term katze indicates those on the periphery; those who are relatively weak.)  Who were these five men? They were Reuben, Levi, Benjamin, Simeon, and Issachar. Why did Joseph the righteous select these five men from his brothers? It is because he knew each and every mighty one among his brothers, and he acted wisely. He said: ‘If I present the mighty ones before pharaoh, he will see them and make them his warriors.’ Anyone whose name was repeated in Moses’s blessing was mighty, and anyone whose name was not repeated, was not mighty. Judah, who was mighty, his name was repeated, as it is stated: “This is for Judah, and he said: Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah” (Deuteronomy 33:7). Therefore, he did not present him before Pharaoh. Likewise Naphtali, as it is stated: “Of Naphtali he said: Naphtali” (Deuteronomy 33:23). Likewise Asher, as it is stated: “Of Asher he said: Blessed of sons is Asher” (Deuteronomy 33:24). Likewise Dan, as it is stated: “Of Dan he said: Dan” (Deuteronomy 33:22). Likewise Zebulun, as it is stated: “Of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun” (Deuteronomy 33:18). And likewise Gad – “Of Gad he said: Blessed is He who expands Gad” (Deuteronomy 33:20). That is why he did not present these before Pharaoh. The rest, whose names were not repeated, were not mighty. Therefore, he presented them before Pharaoh. That is why it is written: “From among his brothers he took.” It does not mention their names here because they were not mighty.  “Joseph said: Give your livestock, and I will give you for your livestock, if silver has run out” (Genesis 47:16).  “Joseph said: Give your livestock…” – your horse is before me. You are exposed as a peeled onion. (You can claim that you have no money, but not that you have nothing. I see your horses.)   (This is not part of the midrash but a later addition that suggests an explanation of the preceding sentence, on the basis of Genesis 47:18. ) </p>

              <p>R. Juda, in the name of Samuel, said: &quot;All the silver and gold of the world Joseph accumulated and brought to Egypt, as it is said (Gen. 47, 17) And Joseph gathered up all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt. From this we infer that he accumulated only that of the land of Egypt; whence do we infer that he gathered up the silver and gold of Canaan and all other countries as well? It is therefore said (Ib. 57, 41) And all the countries came into Egypt. And when Israel went forth from Egypt they took along all this wealth, as it is said (Ex. 12, 36) And they emptied out Egypt.&quot; R. Simon b. Lakish said they left her like a net without gram. All this wealth was in Israel's possession until the days of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, when Shishak, king of Egypt, invaded Jerusalem and took them away from Rehoboam, as it is said (I Kings 14, 25) And it came to pass in the fiftieth year of King Rehoboam that Shishak, the king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem. And he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord, and the treasures of the king's house, yea, everything did he take away. And he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. Then Zarah, the king of Ethiopia, invaded Egypt and took it away from Shishak, king of Egypt; later Assa, king of Israel, took it away from Zarah, king of Ethiopia, and sent it unto Hadrimon b. Tabrimon; and when the Ammonites invaded Syria they took it away from Hadrimon b. Tabrimon. Again Joshaphat came and took it from the Ammonites, where it remained until the days of king Achaz, when Sancherib came and took it away from Achaz. When Ezekiah fought Sennacherib, he took it away from him, and it remained with the former until the days of Zedekiah, when the Chaldeans invaded Judea and took it away from Zedekiah. The Persians later took it away from the Chaldeans, and Greece took it away from Persia. Finally the Romans came and took it away from Greece, and it is still hidden in Rome.&quot; </p>

            <summary>When Jacob arrived in Egypt, a blessing came with his presence, ending the famine, which continued in other lands. The famine resumed after Jacob's death, fulfilling Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream. The Egyptians offered their bodies and lands in exchange for food during the seventh year of famine, as the money collected during five years lasted throughout the famine. The famine was over after the eighth year, when the people planted and harvested crops.</summary>

              <p>בשנה השנית, “during the second year;” according to the plain meaning of the text, this refers to the second year after Yaakov had arrived in Egypt, which was the fourth year of the famine. The food which had been stored up during the seven years of plenty plus the financial savings of the population had sufficed to see them through the first three years. In the fourth year the people tendered their livestock for food, and in the fifth year they tendered their land holdings. In the sixth year they agreed to become slaves of Pharaoh in return for receiving rations from Joseph’s stores. In the seventh year, Joseph gave them seed to plant and they planted it, collecting a harvest in the eight’s year, and the famine was over.</p>

What was the point of speaking of hiding something which was bound to be revealed if indeed it existed? On the other hand, if they were to claim that their livestock and money had not been exhausted they had to deliver it! Why would they say that they would not conceal the existence of money or livestock? Besides, what is the meaning of the words כי אם? Furthermore, they had told Joseph already at the end of the previous year that their money supply was exhausted? Why did the Egytians say to Joseph: &quot;and the livestock is all gone to you, sir?&quot;</p>

              <p>Perhaps what the Egyptians meant was: &quot;we really have no more money, we are not hiding it, the money is truly exhausted.&quot; They did not want Joseph to suspect them of pretending to be destitute, asking for a handout. They added that as far as the livestock was concerned there was not even a need to tell Joseph they had none left, seeing Joseph had bought it all and it could not be hidden even if they tried. As a result the only thing they had left were their very bodies.</p>

              <p>According to the alternative meaning of the words אפס כסף, that their cash receivables were not collectible at that time, the verse does not need any explanation at all. They told Joseph that when they argued previously that they had receivables but that those could not be collected at that time, that had been a lie, and they would not deny that they had lied in order to get Joseph to accept their livestock in payment for the grain. The fact was that at this time all their assets other than their bodies had been exhausted. This is the reason that whereas the first time around the Torah speaks about אפס כסף, i.e an absence of money, they now spoke about תם הכסף, that the money had been completely exhausted.</p>

              <p>ויבואו אליו בשנה השנית, “they came to him in the second year.” This was the second year after their money had run out, i.e. the seventh year of the famine. At this point the people asked Joseph to acquire them as well as their soil in exchange for the food he would give them. Subsequently Pharaoh would have to provide the seed for planting to prevent the land from becoming wasteland. This explains the continuation of the verse: למה נמות לעיניך....קנה אותנו ואת אדמתנו בלחם ונחיה אנחנו ואדמותנו עבדים לפרעה, “Why should we die before your eyes?...Acquire us and our land for bread; and we and our land will become serfs for Pharaoh.” According to the plain meaning of the text this was an offer to buy both their bodies and their lands. According to Bereshit Rabbah that there were actually only a total of two years of famine seeing that Yaakov’s blessing that the Nile should rise again had stopped the famine in its tracks, we would have to understand verse 18 “that the people came to Joseph at the beginning of the ‘second’ year” as referring to the second year of the famine. If you were to say that this would result in the Egyptians suspecting Joseph of not having correctly interpreted Pharaoh’s dream, we would have to assume that the remaining five years of famine occurred immediately after the death of Yaakov.  Another possibility is that seeing Joseph had not predicted that the seven years of famine would occur consecutively, there was no question of Joseph’s competence as an interpreter of dreams would be questioned. Rabbi Yoseph in Tossephta Sotah 10,9 points out that the famine resumed after Yaakov’s death and that Joseph’s promise to provide for his brothers (50,21 made after his father had died) was precisely because the famine had resumed at that time. Just as Joseph had used the expression וכלכלתי אתכם, “I will provide for you” in 45,11 at a time when the famine was in full force, so the same expression used in chapter 50 also reflects that the famine was again in full force. Rabbi Shimon did not feel that such an explanation would reflect credit on G’d as it creates the impression that blessings by the righteous are valid only during their own lifetime. His son Rabbi Eleazar nevertheless said that he preferred Rabbi Yoseph’s interpretation to that of his father.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>THEY CAME UNTO HIM IN THE SECOND YEAR. I.e., the second year of the years of the famine. Now although Joseph had said, And there are yet five years when there will be no plowing and sowing, (Above, 45:6.)  as soon as Jacob came to Egypt a blessing came with his arrival, and they began to sow and the famine came to an end. And thus we read in the Tosephta of Tractate Sotah. (10:9. Tosephta means “addition.” This is a collection of Tannaitic teachings compiled by Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshayah soon after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi.)  Thus the language of Rashi. And it is similarly mentioned in Bereshith Rabbah: (89:11.)  “Rabbi Yosei the son of Rabbi Chanina said that the famine lasted for two years, for when our father Jacob went down to Egypt the famine ceased. When did it return? In the days of Ezekiel, etc.” But if so, then Joseph’s words regarding his interpretation of [Pharaoh’s dream which predicted the seven years of famine] were not fulfilled, and would thus cause people to doubt his wisdom! Perhaps we shall say that the famine continued in the land of Canaan as Joseph had said, but in Egypt our father Jacob went down to the river in the presence of Pharaoh and all of Egypt, whereupon all his people saw that the waters in the Nile rose as he approached it, and thus they knew that G-d’s blessing was due to the prophet’s arrival. In that case, the verse stating, And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to the want of their little children, (Verse 12 here.)  applies to the remainder of the seven years and for as long as his father lived, (According to the Tur’s version of Ramban, this passage reads: “applies to the years of plenty of his father’s entire lifespan.”)  for even after his father’s death, Joseph said, I will sustain you and your little ones. (Further, 50:21.)  Yet, with all this, I wonder: for if so, then Pharaoh’s dream was not true since it only revealed the decree to him but not what would ultimately become of those seven years! Now I have seen there in the Tosephta of Tractate Sotah: (10:9. Tosephta means “addition.” This is a collection of Tannaitic teachings compiled by Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshayah soon after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi.)  “Rabbi Yosei said that as soon as our father Jacob died, the famine reverted to its former condition, etc.” We have further been taught in the Sifre: (Sifre Eikev, 38.)  “And Jacob blessed Pharaoh. (Verse 10 here.)  How did he bless him? [His blessing was] that the years of famine should cease. Nevertheless they were completed after Jacob’s death, as it is said, Now therefore fear ye not; I will sustain you. (Further, 50:21.)  Now just as ‘sustaining’ mentioned above (Above, 45:11. And there I will sustain thee, for there are yet five years of famine.)  by Scripture refers to years of famine, so also ‘sustaining’ mentioned here (Further, 50:21.)  refers to years of famine. Rabbi Shimon says, ‘It is not a sanctification of G-d’s Name for the words of the righteous to be effective as long as they live, and then to be removed after their death.’ Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Shimon said, ‘I accept the opinion of Rabbi Yosei rather than that of my father, for it is indeed a sanctification of G-d’s Name for there to be a blessing in the world for the period that the righteous are in the world, and for the blessing to remove from the world when they leave.’” Thus far the text of the Tosephta. Thus the remaining five years of the famine were completed. The opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra is that these two years, [recounted in Verses 14-20, during which the Egyptians gave their money and cattle to Joseph in exchange for food], occurred after Jacob had come to Egypt, [and since there were two years of famine before he came to Egypt, this accounts for four of the seven years of famine]. And Ibn Ezra wrote as follows: “We find in homiletic texts of the Rabbis that the famine was removed by the merit of Jacob. It is also possible that there were three more years of famine, but that they were not as severe as the first four years which had passed.” But Ibn Ezra’s words are not at all correct. The account of the dream and its interpretation make all seven years alike, and, had it been as he said, Scripture would have mentioned the different nature of these three last years. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan during a period of five years, and he brought it to Pharaoh, for how is it possible for the money and cattle to be exhausted in one year? Rather, the money sufficed them for the entire five years, as is the usual way of the world. (In a time of famine, people conserve money and make it last for a long period of time.)  Now since nothing was initiated, and no change of any kind occurred during all these years, Scripture relates nothing about them except, And Joseph gathered up all the money, etc. (Verse 14 here.)  When the money was exhausted, Scripture relates that they came to Joseph — this was in the sixth year of the famine — and he gave them bread in exchange for their cattle. He fed them with bread only to the extent of sustaining them, but not to satiety. And when that year was ended, (Verse 18 here.)  in which he had vowed to them that he would feed them with bread in exchange for their cattle—which was the sixth year—they came unto him the second year, [i.e., the year following the sixth year of famine being discussed], and they told him that he should purchase them and their land for the bread which he will feed them during that seventh year, and since the land will then belong to Pharaoh, he should give them seed so that the land will not be desolate, for they knew that when the seven years of famine will be completed, they will have planting and reaping. The verse stating, And Joseph sustained his father…with bread, according to the want of their little ones, (Verse 12 here.)  thus means that he furnished them with bread sufficient for their needs during the famine, as the expression, according to the want of their little ones, indicates.</p>

              <p>ויבואו אליו בשנה השנית, “They came to him in the second year, etc.” according to Rashi the verse speaks about the second year of the famine, even though Joseph had spoken about another 5 years of crop failures, (45,11) However, as soon as Yaakov arrived in Egypt, a miracle happened and the blessings returned as a result of his presence.
    Nachmanides writes that although Joseph’s prediction of seven consecutive years of famine did not come true, no one used this as an excuse to call Joseph a liar or a false prophet. The reason was that they noted that the famine continued in the surrounding countries, so that it was clear to them that special circumstances had arisen when Yaakov went down to the Nile and suddenly the waters of the Nile rose to welcome him. Pharaoh himself had witnessed this phenomenon. He showed it to his servants and they realized that Yaakov’s blessing had been effective. We must therefore understand Joseph’s pledge to support his brothers economically as being meant for the normal years to follow, a pledge which was to be valid for at least as long as his father would remain alive. In fact, Joseph continued to support his brothers financially even after his father’s death (50,51) 
    Even considering all this, if all this is true, then Pharaoh’s dream had not been interpreted correctly seeing that Pharaoh had not really been shown the decree nor how it could be changed.
    There is an interesting Tossephta in Sotah according to which Rabbi Yossi said that as soon as Yaakov died, the famine resumed in Egypt. There is also a statement in the Sifri according to which Yaakov’s blessing to Pharaoh consisted in the promise that the famine would cease forthwith. Nonetheless, seeing seven years of famine had been decreed in the dream, these did in fact occur, at intervals, after Yaakov’s death. Rabbi Shimon protested such an interpretation, saying that it does not confer glory on either G’d or His righteous people on earth if the promise (blessing) of a צדיק remains effective only during his own lifetime. In response to this Rabbi Eleazar, son of Rabbi Shimon (ben Yochai) said that he prefers the interpretation of Rabbi Yossi to that of his own father, as it is a greater sanctification of G’d when people observe that as long as a tzaddik walks the earth there is visible blessing on earth thanks to his merit. The very fact that the blessings on earth we due to the presence of Tzaddikim at that time, becomes manifest when these blessings cease as soon as the Tzaddik leaves this earth. The fact is that there are 5 more mentions of famine in Egypt scattered throughout the Bible; these five years of famine completed those predicted by Joseph but interrupted by the blessing of his father Yaakov when he went to see Pharaoh. 
    [by the way, the clue Yaakov had found in Pharaoh’s dream that gave him the opening for this blessing was that the parched ears of corn symbolizing the years of famine, did not grow on a single stalk, whereas the good ears of corn all grew on a single stalk, suggesting that the good years would be consecutive. Ed.] 
    Ibn Ezra claims that here we are speaking about the first 2 years of the famine after Yaakov’s arrival in Egypt. We find support for this in the Midrash, which states that the famine ended thanks to the merit of Yaakov. It is also possible that the division was four years of famine at once, and three years at a later date, but of far less severity.
    Nachmanides writes that he finds these interpretations as unsatisfactory, for if that had been so the Torah herself would have referred to some of these events explicitly.
    At any rate, the meaning of the text read straightforwardly is that Joseph collected all the available money during five years of the famine, but seeing that during those five years no new elements developed, the Torah did not refer to those years individually, but treated them as if they had been a single year. When a new development occurred, i.e. the people for the first time confronting Joseph, the Torah resumes the thread of the narrative. What is related now actually occurred during the sixth year of the famine. At that time Joseph handed out grain and took cattle and beasts of burden as payment for this. When the people came back again in the following year, the second of the last two years, he acquired their land on behalf of Pharaoh and made sharecroppers out of all of them. When he began to hand out seed for sowing it became clear that this had been the last year of the famine.

              <p>“From among his brothers he took five men, and he presented them before Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:2).  “From among [miktze] his brothers he took five men” – why did the verse state “from among [miktze] his brothers”? It is to teach you that they were not mighty. (The term katze indicates those on the periphery; those who are relatively weak.)  Who were these five men? They were Reuben, Levi, Benjamin, Simeon, and Issachar. Why did Joseph the righteous select these five men from his brothers? It is because he knew each and every mighty one among his brothers, and he acted wisely. He said: ‘If I present the mighty ones before pharaoh, he will see them and make them his warriors.’ Anyone whose name was repeated in Moses’s blessing was mighty, and anyone whose name was not repeated, was not mighty. Judah, who was mighty, his name was repeated, as it is stated: “This is for Judah, and he said: Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah” (Deuteronomy 33:7). Therefore, he did not present him before Pharaoh. Likewise Naphtali, as it is stated: “Of Naphtali he said: Naphtali” (Deuteronomy 33:23). Likewise Asher, as it is stated: “Of Asher he said: Blessed of sons is Asher” (Deuteronomy 33:24). Likewise Dan, as it is stated: “Of Dan he said: Dan” (Deuteronomy 33:22). Likewise Zebulun, as it is stated: “Of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun” (Deuteronomy 33:18). And likewise Gad – “Of Gad he said: Blessed is He who expands Gad” (Deuteronomy 33:20). That is why he did not present these before Pharaoh. The rest, whose names were not repeated, were not mighty. Therefore, he presented them before Pharaoh. That is why it is written: “From among his brothers he took.” It does not mention their names here because they were not mighty.  “Joseph said: Give your livestock, and I will give you for your livestock, if silver has run out” (Genesis 47:16).  “Joseph said: Give your livestock…” – your horse is before me. You are exposed as a peeled onion. (You can claim that you have no money, but not that you have nothing. I see your horses.)   (This is not part of the midrash but a later addition that suggests an explanation of the preceding sentence, on the basis of Genesis 47:18. ) </p>

              <p>To this there are two radically different answers. There is the Jacob of Midrash who even in the womb longed for a synagogue, (Genesis Rabba 63:6.)  who spent his years as a young man studying in the bet midrash, (Ibid. 63:10.)  who looked like Abraham, (Midrash Lekaḥ Tov, Gen. 47:18.)  and whose arms were like pillars of marble. (Genesis Rabba 65:17.)  His motives were always pure. He bought Esau’s birthright because he could not bear to see Esau offering sacrifices (the privilege of the firstborn) to idols. (Ibid. 63:13.)  As for his father’s blessing, the very reason Isaac became blind in old age was so that this could be possible. (Ibid. 65:8.)  Esau was the opposite, a violent and mercurial character who had deceived his father into thinking he was ultra-pious, (See Rashi on Gen. 25:27.)  but who had – on the day he came in “tired” from the field – committed a whole series of crimes including murder.

              <p>Genesis 47,19.  “and provide us with seed so that we ‎may live and not die.” See Rashi’s commentary on ‎this verse who explains that since the arrival of Yaakov in Egypt ‎and his blessing, the people had begun to sow seed again ‎although the famine had been predicted to last for seven years. ‎Compare also the answer to the question of Nachmanides how ‎Yaakov was able to annul an interpretation given by his son of ‎Pharaoh’s dream according to which the famine would last for ‎seven years. After all, Joseph had spoken in the name of G’d when ‎he had told Pharaoh: ‎את האלוקים עושה הגיד לפרעה‎, “G’d has ‎revealed to Pharaoh that which He is about to do.” (Genesis 41,28) ‎Joseph had implied that no tzaddik could interfere with this ‎decree of G’d, although the Talmud in Moed Katan 16 told ‎us of the ability of the tzaddik through his prayer to bring ‎about a cancellation of harmful decrees. We must answer that ‎what Joseph had told Pharaoh at that time concerned the existing ‎circumstances, when there was no tzaddik in Egypt whose ‎prayer could influence G’d to rescind part or all of His decree. ‎With the arrival of Joseph’s father in Egypt, circumstances had ‎changed, as there now was a tzaddik of sufficient caliber to ‎bring about a cessation of this decree. This is why Joseph could ‎hand out seed and this was not a waste.‎</p>

            <summary>The Egyptians asked Joseph to purchase their bodies as servants for Pharaoh, but he only bought the land, establishing a share-cropping system with them working the land forever as Pharaoh's tenants. Joseph allowed them to keep 80% of the harvest, showing kindness, and the land would not be desolate. The famine in Egypt ended due to Jacob's merit, and the hunger lasted for seven years but was less intense in the final three years. Joseph's concern for human rights led him to allocate only 20% of the harvest to Pharaoh. The Egyptians asked for seed to sow, and when Jacob arrived, the famine ended. Joseph did not acquire their bodies but their labor, ensuring they could not leave the fields.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>BE NOT DESOLATE. Tesham (be desolate) comes from the same root as tishamenah in and the high places shall be desolate (tishamenah) (Ezek. 6:6). Tesham follows the paradigm of teda (she will know). (According to I.E. the root of tesham is yod, shin, mem (Filwarg). The yod drops out and the letters prefixed to the root which indicate that the word is an imperfect are vocalized with a tzere, as in the case of the imperfect of the word yada from the root yod, dalet, ayin.)  The Midrash tells us that the hunger ceased because of Jacob’s merit. (Bereshit Rabbah 89:11. See also Tosephta, Sotah 10, “Before Jacob came down to Egypt there was a famine there…after he came there Scripture tells us, Then Joseph said unto the people…Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings (Gen. 47:23-24), which indicates that the famine ceased.”)  However, it is possible that the hunger lasted for seven years but that it was less intense in the final three years than during the first four years. (I.E. wants to reconcile the Midrash with Joseph’s prophecy that there would be seven years of hunger. He does so by accepting the fact that there were seven years of hunger and interprets the Midrashic statement as meaning that the hunger eased. It should be noted that Vat. Ebr. 38 has the reading: “The Midrash tells us that the hunger ceased because of Jacob’s merit. This is possible. It is also possible that the hunger continued during the last three years of the famine but that it was less intense than during the first four years.” According to Weiser, I.E. is of the opinion that Joseph’s collection of the money (v. 14 and 15); of the cattle (v. 16 and 17); and of buying the land (v. 18 and 19) took place successively during the last three years of the famine and that it eased during these years. For another interpretation see Filwarg, Weiser and Krinsky.) </p>

              </summary>
              <p>BUY US AND OUR LAND. Now they said to him that he should also purchase their bodies as servants for Pharaoh, and thus did Joseph say, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land. (Verse 23 here.)  However, Scripture records, And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, (Verse 20 here.)  but it does not say that he bought their bodies, only the land. The reason for it is that the Egyptians told Joseph that he should purchase them as servants to perform the king’s business as he pleases. But Joseph wanted to buy only the land, and he made a condition with them that they work on it forever, thus becoming Pharaoh’s family tenants. Afterwards he said to them, “Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh, (Verse 23 here.)  not as servants as you told me, but you will belong to him with the land. Now it is proper that the king, who is now lord of the land, take four parts of the harvest and that you take the remaining fifth, but I will deal kindly with you in that you will take the portion due to the owner of the land, and Pharaoh will take the portion due the tenant. However, you will be sold to him in that you will not be able to leave the fields.” This is the meaning of that which they vowed to him, And the land will not be desolate (Verse 19 here.)  meaning that it will never be desolate. For this reason they said to Joseph, “We have found favor in the sight of my lord, (Verse 25 here.)  for you have been lenient with us by permitting us to take four parts of the harvest so that we may use them to live, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants, (Verse 25 here.)  as we have vowed, in that we will work the ground in accordance with his will.” Vayechi</p>

              </summary>
              <p>קנה אותנו ואת אדמתינו בלחם, “acquire us together with our land in return for bread!” They asked Joseph to also acquire their bodies as slave labour, and this is confirmed when Joseph told them in verse 23 that he had indeed acquired both their soil and their bodies on Pharaoh’s behalf. Seeing that this has all been spelled out by the Torah in unmistakable language, what do the words in verse 20: “Joseph acquired all the soil of Egypt on Pharaoh’s behalf,” add to the information we have already received? In fact that verse seems to contradict what we read in both verse 19 and 23 in that it speaks only of soil and not bodies having been sold. The reason for the insertion of this verse was to show that although the Egyptians were willing and eager to even sell their bodies, Joseph did not acquire their bodies,- as he considered the personal freedom of the body of a human being as of paramount importance- but he established a system of share-cropping, the former landowners being legally obligated to work the lands in question on behalf of Pharaoh, but sharing in the success or failure of the annual crops to the extent of 80%. When he did say to them in verse 23 “here I have acquired you,“ he refers to the entitlement to their labour, not to their bodies being owned, and subject to resale to other human beings, (as was the custom in the United States until1866)
    Moreover, Joseph’s concern for “human rights” was such that instead of allocating to Pharaoh 80% of the fruits of their labour he allocated only 20% to Pharaoh, the remainder belonging to the farmer who had worked the land. The expression קניתי “I have acquired you,” is justified as the farmers were not allowed to leave the land or offer their labour to someone else.

Now he gave them grain to sow. The people said that Joseph is no proper prophet. The explanation is that when Jacob came, all the Egyptians saw that the water of the river Nile went towards him and watered all the fields. All the ministers and also Pharaoh said that the blessing came because of Jacob. (Rashi, Genesis, 47:19.)  However, Ramban writes. As soon as Jacob died, the five years of famine began again, in the expectation that there should be seven years of famine to fulfill what Joseph had said. When the righteous person is in the world, the blessing is with them in the world. (Ramban, Genesis, 47:18.) </p>

Buy slaves to serve and buy the fields that they should be yours. Joseph said: I will only buy the fields. You must be included in the sale of the fields, in order to work the fields. It would be just that you should take a fifth part and Pharaoh will take four parts of the field to eat, for your labor. However, I will do a kindness with you. You should take four parts and Pharaoh will take the fifth part, just like you were the owners of the fields. However, be warned that you will serve Pharaoh forever, to work the fields. (Ramban, Genesis, 47:19.)  Joseph was concerned that each one would remain on his fields, and it would be forgotten in the long run and each one would say that the field was his, and they would not want to give to Pharaoh from the field. Therefore Joseph took all the people and interchanged them from one city to another city. (Hizkuni, Genesis, 47:21.) </p>

Abraham took the lower aspect in the crown, which is called 'Sihara,' as known, and it is called 'Sihara Tzedek.'                         Isaia 41:2:  &quot;Who has roused a victor from the East, summoned him to G-d’s service?&quot; as it is written: Exodus 24:10 &quot;and they saw the G-d of Israel; under whose feet was the likeness of a pavement of sapphire&quot;. Therefore, the Sihara is called 'Lavana' (moon) - the attribute of chessed/kindness. Therefore &quot;mountain&quot; is the secret of the apple, as known. Isaac took the aspect of Yesod, and he is called 'Yitzhak Ketz Chai' (Isaac, the end of life), as it is written in  Tikunei Zohar Chadash 98: 'Yitzhak Ketz Chai Olamin (Isaac, the end of life of the worlds).' It is tied with the left. There he is called 'field' and is connected to Nun-Heh-Yod (Netzach Hod Yesod) as is known and this is the meaning of &quot;field that is abandoned and plowed&quot; like it says: Genesis 47:23: &quot;here is seed for you to sow the land&quot; and Genesis 47:19: &quot;and that the land may not become a waste.” Jacob took the aspect of Tav Tav (Tiferet) meaning 'Bayit' (house) like: Yeshayahu  47:13 As a man's glory to sit in a house. As our Sages said, ' From (all) my days, I have not called my wife, my wife,' etc. For in the aspect of field is nothing, except when it is given over to be plowed, unlike a house, where a person is always present. And this is the aspect of Yesod and Tiferet, which is called 'Ish' (man), and Tiferet is called 'Adam.' This is the secret of 'and no man passed there, and no man dwelled there.' Here he passed (field), and here he dwelled (house), and they are the general principle of all, like the three aforementioned points. They are the general principle and the general body: head, abdomen, and body. They are the general principle of NR&quot;N (Nefesh-Ruach-Neshamah), and likewise all the principles of the Merkavah (Divine Chariot) and the general principle of the Ten Sefirot, as known. And this is in the external aspect, and it is known that Da'at includes Chessed and Gevurah, graces/sefirot, that draw from the small face. And this is Kel De'ot (G-d of knowledge), the secret of the knowledge of Z&quot;A (Zeir Anpin). And Moshe is the &quot;principle&quot; of da'at, awesome and holy and that is the &quot;bridal aspect&quot; of Moshe Rabbeinu and this is the meaning that Jakob served with his body and Moshe served with his spirituality for da'at is the inner fragrance and therefore he (Moshe) separated from his wife for he served with his mind/spirit, and this is the secret of the union of kisses, which is the voice and speech, and the hidden knowledge in the mouth, as stated in Perek Mishpatim (Chapter on Laws). And this is what it means, 'Face to face, I will speak with him,' and in the fifth aspect, which is the face. This is the second of the lights that diminished, as it said, &quot;aleph&quot; immediately followed &quot;tav&quot; on the fourth day when the lights were diminished.' And she descended into &quot;beriya&quot;, and this is ' HeshemElokeinu.' And this is with Z&quot;A (Zeir Anpin), and makes it a complete Name, and it is the aspect of Judah. And David is the fourth leg to the forefathers, as they brought him to their level, which is HG&quot;T (Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet), and this is the fourth leg. And this is what is meant by 'Judah descended,' as known. And this is 'Avnei Ma'asu Habonim' (the stone the builders rejected), and it is the supernal Malchut (kingdom) of the ten s'firot, as known. And this full name will ascend in the future, and this is what 'shall be the cornerstone' means.&quot; </p>

              </summary>
              <p>תנו לי אחוזת קבר עמכם, “let me have possession of a burial ground amongst you, etc.” It was the custom for every family to have its own field as a burial ground for its members, whereas they had set aside a special plot of land on which to bury aliens. This is what prompted Avraham to use the preamble: גר ותושב אנכי עמכם, “on the one hand I am an alien, seeing that I have come here from a distant land, and this is why I do not own a burial plot of my own. On the other hand, I have been very willing to become a resident amongst you, etc.”  They answered him: “Listen to us, my lord etc.” On the one hand they addressed him as a group, saying: “listen to us.” On the other hand, they continued with the singular “my lord.” The reason for this was that a single individual was conducting this conversation though he spoke in the name of a multitude. When this individual, i.e. the spokesman, continued by saying: “you are a prince in our midst, choose from the choicest of our burial grounds, etc.,” adding the compliment: “you are a prince of G’d,” he spoke in the name of the people who had made him their spokesman.  The term גר, “stranger, alien,” is demeaning, whereas the expression נשיא אלוהים אתה בתוכנו, “you are a prince of G’d amongst us,” is a compliment, contrasting Avraham’s stature amongst them with that of a stranger. They suggested that they themselves as well as their land was at Avraham’s disposal. (compare Genesis 47,19 where loss of land is equated with the status of subservience). As a result of their considering Avraham as royalty, he had the right to choose whatever piece of land he desired as his burial ground. Nobody would deny him even land he had previously reserved for his own eventual interment. When Avraham heard this, he immediately responded with the words: “if indeed you wish me to bury my dead, etc.” He meant that he had no intention of burying his dead in any unknown field; rather, he had a particular spot in mind for which they needed to speak to Efron son of Tzochar, the owner of that particular piece of property. This is Nachmanides’ version of what transpired here.</p>

And in the Targum (Onkelos Genesis 47:19), &quot;do not place,&quot; is &quot;do not tabur. And he did not need [to say], a boor cannot be pious, since he is not even one who fears sin - as from his emptiness, he does not [even] know to guard himself from sins. But an ignoramus is involved with the creatures through important traits and has a few straight dispositions: He knows how to protect himself and [so] he guards himself from transgressions. And he is [even] able to be righteous and to do and to fulfill what he is [told] that he is commanded. But only one who is great in Torah [knowledge] can reach the level of piety, since it is a trait that requires purity of heart and cleanness of soul. And [the ignoramus] does not have the wisdom in his hand to veer from the middle marker to the far end, to fulfill [going] beyond the [letter] of the law. And because of this he is called an am haarets - since he is with them in derekh erets (good manners), and because most of the world (land - haarets) is like him.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>THEY CAME UNTO HIM IN THE SECOND YEAR. I.e., the second year of the years of the famine. Now although Joseph had said, And there are yet five years when there will be no plowing and sowing, (Above, 45:6.)  as soon as Jacob came to Egypt a blessing came with his arrival, and they began to sow and the famine came to an end. And thus we read in the Tosephta of Tractate Sotah. (10:9. Tosephta means “addition.” This is a collection of Tannaitic teachings compiled by Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshayah soon after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi.)  Thus the language of Rashi. And it is similarly mentioned in Bereshith Rabbah: (89:11.)  “Rabbi Yosei the son of Rabbi Chanina said that the famine lasted for two years, for when our father Jacob went down to Egypt the famine ceased. When did it return? In the days of Ezekiel, etc.” But if so, then Joseph’s words regarding his interpretation of [Pharaoh’s dream which predicted the seven years of famine] were not fulfilled, and would thus cause people to doubt his wisdom! Perhaps we shall say that the famine continued in the land of Canaan as Joseph had said, but in Egypt our father Jacob went down to the river in the presence of Pharaoh and all of Egypt, whereupon all his people saw that the waters in the Nile rose as he approached it, and thus they knew that G-d’s blessing was due to the prophet’s arrival. In that case, the verse stating, And Joseph sustained his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to the want of their little children, (Verse 12 here.)  applies to the remainder of the seven years and for as long as his father lived, (According to the Tur’s version of Ramban, this passage reads: “applies to the years of plenty of his father’s entire lifespan.”)  for even after his father’s death, Joseph said, I will sustain you and your little ones. (Further, 50:21.)  Yet, with all this, I wonder: for if so, then Pharaoh’s dream was not true since it only revealed the decree to him but not what would ultimately become of those seven years! Now I have seen there in the Tosephta of Tractate Sotah: (10:9. Tosephta means “addition.” This is a collection of Tannaitic teachings compiled by Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Oshayah soon after the Mishnah was completed by Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi.)  “Rabbi Yosei said that as soon as our father Jacob died, the famine reverted to its former condition, etc.” We have further been taught in the Sifre: (Sifre Eikev, 38.)  “And Jacob blessed Pharaoh. (Verse 10 here.)  How did he bless him? [His blessing was] that the years of famine should cease. Nevertheless they were completed after Jacob’s death, as it is said, Now therefore fear ye not; I will sustain you. (Further, 50:21.)  Now just as ‘sustaining’ mentioned above (Above, 45:11. And there I will sustain thee, for there are yet five years of famine.)  by Scripture refers to years of famine, so also ‘sustaining’ mentioned here (Further, 50:21.)  refers to years of famine. Rabbi Shimon says, ‘It is not a sanctification of G-d’s Name for the words of the righteous to be effective as long as they live, and then to be removed after their death.’ Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Shimon said, ‘I accept the opinion of Rabbi Yosei rather than that of my father, for it is indeed a sanctification of G-d’s Name for there to be a blessing in the world for the period that the righteous are in the world, and for the blessing to remove from the world when they leave.’” Thus far the text of the Tosephta. Thus the remaining five years of the famine were completed. The opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra is that these two years, [recounted in Verses 14-20, during which the Egyptians gave their money and cattle to Joseph in exchange for food], occurred after Jacob had come to Egypt, [and since there were two years of famine before he came to Egypt, this accounts for four of the seven years of famine]. And Ibn Ezra wrote as follows: “We find in homiletic texts of the Rabbis that the famine was removed by the merit of Jacob. It is also possible that there were three more years of famine, but that they were not as severe as the first four years which had passed.” But Ibn Ezra’s words are not at all correct. The account of the dream and its interpretation make all seven years alike, and, had it been as he said, Scripture would have mentioned the different nature of these three last years. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan during a period of five years, and he brought it to Pharaoh, for how is it possible for the money and cattle to be exhausted in one year? Rather, the money sufficed them for the entire five years, as is the usual way of the world. (In a time of famine, people conserve money and make it last for a long period of time.)  Now since nothing was initiated, and no change of any kind occurred during all these years, Scripture relates nothing about them except, And Joseph gathered up all the money, etc. (Verse 14 here.)  When the money was exhausted, Scripture relates that they came to Joseph — this was in the sixth year of the famine — and he gave them bread in exchange for their cattle. He fed them with bread only to the extent of sustaining them, but not to satiety. And when that year was ended, (Verse 18 here.)  in which he had vowed to them that he would feed them with bread in exchange for their cattle—which was the sixth year—they came unto him the second year, [i.e., the year following the sixth year of famine being discussed], and they told him that he should purchase them and their land for the bread which he will feed them during that seventh year, and since the land will then belong to Pharaoh, he should give them seed so that the land will not be desolate, for they knew that when the seven years of famine will be completed, they will have planting and reaping. The verse stating, And Joseph sustained his father…with bread, according to the want of their little ones, (Verse 12 here.)  thus means that he furnished them with bread sufficient for their needs during the famine, as the expression, according to the want of their little ones, indicates.</p>

              <p>Perhaps even an ignorant (אשמאי) old man. Rashi [on that Gemara] explains that this is an expression of אשם (sin), meaning, a wicked man who is liable for many sins. Rabeinu Tam explains that this person is an ignoramus [desolate of wisdom], as in the expression “not become desolate (תשם)” (Bereishis 47:19), which Unkelos translates as לא תבור, i.e., desolate. (Gur Aryeh) You might ask that this [Rashi’s interpretation] is obvious, since why would one think that a wicked man should be honored? The verse (Shemos 22:27) writes, “Do not curse a leader of your people” [from which the Sages deduce in Bava Metzia 48b that this only applies] “when he acts [according to] the behavior of your people”! The answer is that one may have thought one has to stand in the presence of a wicked [old] man because he must have lived a long life due to having fulfilled mitzvos, and thus, one may have thought he must be honored. Therefore, the verse is necessary. </p>

Just as the curtains of Solomon are soiled and cleaned repeatedly, Israel's sins are atoned for on Yom Kippur. Israel will not be subject to the yoke of any creature in the future, similar to the tents of Kedar. Israel will overcome their captors, similar to Joseph who purchased his purchasers.</summary>

              <p>“Like the tents of Kedar,” just as the tents of Kedar appear externally to be ugly, black, and in tatters, but internally they are gems and pearls, so too Torah scholars, even though they appear ugly and black in this world, internally there is Torah in them, Bible, Mishna, Midrash, halakhot, Talmud, Tosefta, and aggada. If so, just as tents of Kedar do not require laundering, perhaps the same is true of Israel; the verse states: “Like the curtains of Solomon”—just as these curtains of Solomon are soiled and laundered, and are again soiled and laundered, so, too, Israel, even though they are soiled with sins all the days of the year, Yom Kippur arrives and atones for them, as it is stated: “For on this day He will atone for you” (Leviticus 16:30), and it is written: “If your sins will be like scarlet, they will be whitened as snow; if they will be reddened like crimson, they will be like wool” (Isaiah 1:18). If so, just as the tents of Kedar are moved from place to place, perhaps the same is true of Israel. The verse states: “Like the curtains of Solomon [Shelomo],” like the curtains (The heavens.)  of the One [of Whom it may be stated] that the peace is His, the One Who spoke and the world came into being, that from the moment He spread them, they did not move from their place. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov taught: “A tent that will not be displaced [yatzan]” (Isaiah 33:20); it will not emerge [yetze] and will not move [yanua]. (Yatzan is an acronym of yetze and yanua.)  Just as the tents of Kedar are not subject to the yoke of any creature, (The reference is to nomads who live in the wilderness.)  so too, Israel, in the future, will not be subject to the yoke of any creature. Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: “I led you upright” (Leviticus 26:13); with an upright stature, without fear of any creature. (Although the verse cited is stated regarding the exodus from Egypt, it is understood as also alluding to the future redemption.)  Rabbi Yudan said: Like Joseph; just as Joseph was sold to the tents of Kedar, as it is stated: “They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites… [and they brought Joseph to Egypt]” (Genesis 37:28), and he then purchased his purchasers, as it is stated: “Joseph purchased all the land of Egypt” (Genesis 47:20), so too Israel: “They will be captors of their captors” (Isaiah 14:2).</p>

Allein Josefs Weisheit milderte die Maßregel dadurch, daß immer eine Gesamtbevölkerung zusammenblieb und sich nur auf einem neuen Boden wieder zusammenfand. Somit blieben die alten sozialen und kommunalen Beziehungen dieselben und es trat nicht eine ganze Umwälzung aller bestehenden Verhältnisse ein. Die Weisen deuten auf die Folgen hin, die diese Versetzung der Gesamtbevölkerung für die neuen Ankömmlinge der Jakobsfamilie haben musste, auf welche fortan kein Ägypter mit Hohn herabblicken konnte. Es befand sich auch kein Ägypter mehr auf eigenem Hofe. Es war übrigens diese ganze Maßregel nicht eine von Josef erfundene. Das Volk selbst hatte sie V. 19, und zwar zugleich die Leibeigenschaft, in Vorschlag gebracht.

The aim of this population transfer was to highlight the fact that the people no longer owned any land and were considered slaves. A person who lives on a particular plot of land, even if he does not possess complete legal ownership of it, still feels that it belongs to him to a certain extent. Joseph transferred and scattered the people in order to uproot their sense that they were living in their homeland, and to eradicate their feelings of ownership and attachment to the soil. They are now sent to work in unfamiliar locations as slaves, with no say in the matter.</p>

              <p>Another matter, “Joseph was taken down to Egypt.” “Joseph was the ruler” (Genesis 42:6). “Joseph was taken down [hurad] to Egypt” – he ruled over them, just as it says: “He will rule [veyerd] from sea to sea” (Psalms 72:8). He subdued them, just as it says: “For he had dominion [rodeh] over the entire region across the River” (I Kings 5:4). He imposed relocation upon them, (See Genesis 47:21. )  just as it says: “He scraped it [vayirdehu] into his hands” (Judges 14:9).   He caused Jacob our patriarch to descend [horid] to Egypt. Rabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda bar Simon: This is analogous to a cow that they were pulling to the slaughterhouse, but it would not be pulled. What did they do to it? They pulled its offspring before it, and it was walking after it despite itself, and to its [ultimate] detriment. So, Jacob was supposed to descend to Egypt in chains and neck chains. (This is because of the decree of enslavement in the Covenant between the Pieces (see Genesis 15:13).)  The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Shall I take My firstborn son down [to Egypt] in disgrace? And if I introduce it into Pharaoh’s heart, would I not be taking him down [to Egypt] in public? (If I introduce it into Pharaoh’s heart to bring Jacob down to Egypt in an honorable fashion, the public nature of the spectacle of his leaving the Land of Israel would itself cause Jacob great discomfort (Etz Yosef). )  Instead, I will draw his son before him, and he will descend after him despite himself and to his [ultimate] detriment.’ He took down the Divine Presence with him. Rabbi Pinḥas said in the name of Rabbi Simon: From where do we derive that the Divine Presence descended with him? From what is written: “The Lord was with Joseph” (Genesis 39:2).  “To Egypt [Mitzraima]” – it is taught in the name of Rabbi Neḥemya: Any word that requires a lamed at its start, a heh [can be] placed at its end [instead]: Sedoma, Se’ira, Mitzraima, Ḥarana. (The lamed as a prefix or the heh as a suffix both mean “to.” These are examples where the verse uses the heh at the end of the name of the place, indicating “to Sodom” and the like. )  But is it not written: “The wicked will return to the netherworld [lishola]”? (Psalms 9:18). (Lishola has both a lamed at the start and a heh at the end.)  Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said: [They will be sent] to the lowest compartment in the netherworld.</p>

              <p>I have also told you that these &quot;sparks,&quot; i.e. result of these emissions, first surfaced during the generation of the Deluge and the generation of the Tower of Babel. Those generations were similarly remiss. Joseph first circumcised the Egyptians and then transferred them in order to morally refine them. He wanted to repair the damage inflicted on the world through the wasteful seminal emissions by all those generations. He tried to lead those people back to sanctity and the holy covenant by his action. This is the real meaning of Genesis 47,21: ואת העם העביר אותו לערים מקצה גבול מצרים ועד קצהו, &quot;He transferred the people from the cities from one end of Egypt to the other.&quot; Joseph had first circumcised the people whom he transferred. The transfer was to refine them morally. In the course of time the mixed multitude that joined the Jewish people at the time of the Exodus were people descended from those whom Joseph had circumcised. This is the mystical dimension of Exodus 1,9: ויאמר אל עמו הנה עם בני ישראל, He said to his people: &quot;Here are the people of the children of Israel, etc.&quot; Pharaoh later on referred to the people who became the ערב רב, the fellow travellers.</p>

              <p>What we learn from all this is how careful we must be when we reside in a land that enjoys G–d's daily personal supervision. We must conduct ourselves submissively vis a vis G–d. King David expressed this sentiment when he said גר אנכי בארץ , &quot;I am merely a stranger in the land (of Israel)&quot; (Psalms 119,19) David considered himself as at most possessing the status of a stranger in that land. When G–d told Abraham in Genesis 15,13: &quot;Know that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not theirs,” we must ask why He added the words &quot;in a land that is not theirs?&quot; Is it not clear that one can only be a stranger in a land that one does not own? Rashi addresses this problem and says that this expression includes the times when Abraham's descendants would also at times be strangers in countries other than the land of Egypt, during the 400 years which start with the birth of Isaac. Other commentators see in this expression an allusion to the fact that Israel would reside in Goshen, i.e. not Egypt proper, the expression לא להם, referring to the Egyptians who did not &quot;own&quot; Goshen, seeing it had been given to Sarah by Pharaoh. Alternately, it could refer to the resettlement policy of the Egyptians which Joseph had initiated in Genesis 47,21, where Rashi explains that as a result none of the Egyptians themselves had a real claim to the land they were settled on It is clear in our context, that Abraham's descendants, i.e. Israel, were meant to become strangers and subsequently slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt. At a later stage in their history they would become strangers in their own country. This is why G–d emphasized that during these first four hundred years or part thereof they would be strangers in someone else's country. Afterwards they would be strangers just as David described himself as a stranger in ארץ ישראל. </p>

              <p>The land of Egypt is to earth what the מקום ערוה, seat of the reproductive organs, is to man. This is why Ezekiel 23, 20 describes Egyptians as ejaculating seminal discharge that resembles that of horses, and generally describing them as debauched. [The theme is that it is the nature of the earth itself which contributes to the debauchery of its inhabitants. Ed.] Jacob's descendants were exiled to Egypt because in that country it was easiest to transfer their share of the serpent's pollution to their surroundings. Once they had disposed of those pollutants they could emerge purified. Joseph was especially suited to start such a process because he had demonstrated by his previous behavior how to maintain the Holy Covenant with G–d entered into by Abraham when he circumcised himself. The evil influence of the serpent's pollution remained only in the descendants of Esau. The reason the Torah presents us with such a long list of Esau's descendants at the end of פרשת וישלח, is to inform us that they were all ממזרים, bastards. Rashi already comments in this manner on Genesis 36, 2. Esau went to the land of Se-ir because he did not want to undergo the exile experience in either Egypt or the land of Canaan (where he would not have been sovereign, seeing that Israel owned that land). Had he been prepared to undergo that experience, he, too, could have rid himself of the negative influence of the original serpent.</p>

            <summary>In the commentary on Pesach Haggadah, it is explained how the Israelites were enslaved in a land not their own, with Joseph moving populations around, leading to the Egyptians being in a similar situation. The Ramban discusses Moses leading the people from Rephidim to Horeb to receive water from a rock, and the Ibn Ezra emphasizes the importance of sanctifying God. Additionally, in the commentary on Joseph and the Risks of Power, it is highlighted how Joseph acquired all the money, livestock, and land of the Egyptians for Pharaoh, using a policy of enforced resettlement.</summary>

              <p>It begins when the Egyptians have used up all their money buying grain. They come to Joseph asking for food, telling him they will die without it, and he replies by telling them he will sell it to them in exchange for ownership of their livestock. They willingly do so: they bring their horses, donkeys, sheep, and cattle. The next year he sells them grain in exchange for their land. The result of these transactions is that within a short period of time – seemingly a mere three years – he has transferred to Pharaoh’s ownership all the money, livestock, and private land, with the exception of the land of the priests, which he allowed them to retain. Not only this, but the Torah tells us that Joseph “removed the population town by town, from one end of Egypt’s border to the other” (Gen. 47:21) – a policy of enforced resettlement that would eventually be used against Israel by the Assyrians.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>AND THE ETERNAL SAID UNTO MOSES: PASS ON BEFORE THE PEOPLE. This is similar in usage to the following expressions: he [Joseph] caused them to pass into cities; (Genesis 47:21.)  and I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not. (Jeremiah 15:14.)  Thus the meaning thereof here is: “go away from them to another place,” [as will be explained further]. Perhaps this is similar to the expressions: and he [Ahimaaz] overran the Cushite; (II Samuel 18:23.)  and he [Jacob] himself passed over before them, (Genesis 33:3.)  meaning that he [Jacob] went in the forefront of them. The purport of this verse is that the people were in Rephidim, and the rock from which the waters were to come was in Horeb, (Verse 6: Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb.)  this being Mount Sinai, according to the opinion of the former ones, (I.e., the Rabbis of the Talmud. See Shabbath 89 a: “Mount Sinai bears five names: the wilderness of Zin, Horeb, etc.”)  or in my opinion, some city near the mountain, as I will yet explain. (At the beginning of Seder Yithro (18:1).)  Moses therefore had to go first before the people, to pass on from Rephidim to Horeb — a distance of one more parsah [a Persian mile] or more — from the camp before them. It was for this reason that G-d said to him, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel… and go. That is to say, “Go until you will see Me stand before you upon the rock in Horeb.” Now Moses hit the rock, and water came out of it. Scripture however does not relate that the congregation and their cattle drank, as it does in the second incident [at the waters of Meribah], (Numbers 20:11. This took place in Kadesh. See also above, Note 414.)  for it is self-understood that they did so. It is clear that the people did not go to Horeb to drink, since they did not arrive in front of Mount Sinai until afterwards in the third month. (Further, 19:1.)  Instead, they sent their young men and their cattle there to draw water and bring it to them, as is customary in camps. It appears likely to me that the waters — cold flowing waters (Jeremiah 18:14.)  — came out from the rock in Horeb and flowed to Rephidim, and there the people drank them. This is Scripture’s intent in saying, He brought streams out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers, (Psalms 78:16.)  and it is further written, He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; they ran, a river in the dry places. (Ibid., 105:41.)  The verse stating, Behold, He smote the rock, that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed, (Ibid., 78:20.)  also applies to the rock in Horeb, in line with the plain meaning of Scripture. (According to the Midrash, however, this verse (Psalms 78:20) was said with reference to Moses’ smiting the rock in Kadesh, or, as they are called, the waters of Meribah (Bamidbar Rabbah 19:8).)  The second rock in Kadesh, (Numbers 20:1.)  [instead of gushing forth water], became cleft with a sort of spring welling forth waters, and therefore Scripture states, That is ‘the well’ whereof the Eternal said unto Moses, etc., (Ibid., 21:16.)  and Israel said in the Song, ‘The well,’ which the princes digged, (Ibid., Verse 18.)  for it was like a well that was dug. It is for this reason that Scripture says there, and the congregation drank, and their cattle, (Ibid., 20:11.)  which means that there they drank from it at that place immediately, but here [in Horeb], overflowing rivers came from it and they drank of it in their homes at their will. Now although according to the tradition of our Rabbis, it was all Miriam’s Well, (“That is to say, the rock which was in Rephidim (Horeb) is the same as the one in Kadesh, this being ‘Miriam’s Well,’ which accompanied the Israelites on all their marches during the forty years’ wandering” (Rabbeinu Bachya, Vol. II, p. 153 in my edition). The tradition is mentioned in Bamidbar Rabbah 20:2. This miracle was wrought for the merits of the prophetess Miriam. Ramban’s intent is thus clear: If it was all Miriam’s Well, how can you explain its different forms of activity, for in Horeb it was like a gushing stream, and in Kadesh it was like a well?)  it is possible that on the first occasion [in Horeb] and during all their forty years’ wandering, the waters came gushing out from the rock like overflowing rivers. The second time, [in Kadesh], as a punishment for that which took place there, it became [only] like a dug well that was full of fresh water [not a gushing spring].</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Based on this we can explain Gen. 15:13 -14. The Holy One hinted to our forefather, Abraham, “Know well…” You already know what the Ari of blessed memory alluded to when God said, “A land not their own.” They were slaves in a land that did not belong to their masters. Joseph moved the populations around and switched one group with another. (See Genesis 47:20-21)  In this way the Egyptian also found themselves in a land not their own. That which is said, “Know well,” that I am the one who shall scatter the people and gather them. We might wonder - should they have been worried that the Israelites might have been mixed among the idolaters and they would then rule over them. (In this way) there would be no way to save them from entering into the fiftieth gate of impurity (The abbreviation of which is SATAN - ( ן' שערי טומאה). Then there would be no way for them to rise up. To this one could answer, “You shall be a stranger in a land not their own.” In other words, land of Egypt belonged to Joseph who exiled Egypt and moved them about from city to city - while they were under his authority. “They enslaved them” by day, and “Afflicted them,” by night. This was additional since according to Jewish law an enslaved Jew does not have to work at night. Since they were under the authority of the Holy One - as is hinted by the expression, “A land not their own, the nights were considered oppressive when the Egyptians made them work. In this way the days and nights added up to 400 years. For this reason, “The nation that enslaved you I shall judge,” because they oppressed them for 210 years with harshness since Israel had the status of Hebrew slaves. “Afterwards they shall leave with great wealth,” this refers to providing reparation (hanakah).</p>

Wherever it says כהן alone, without explaining the association to what he is a כהן, it assumedly means he is the servant of a deity. This is surely so when it states כהן to Hashem, or כהן to an idol. But with כהן מדין and כהן און, where it mentions the name of the country or city, it means he is their governor or leader. That is why Onkelos translates it here as כומריא (priests), but translates כהן און and כהן מדין as רבא דאון and רבא דמדין. (רבא means leader.)</p>

              <p>רק אדמת הכהנים, “only the land-holdings of the priests, etc.” Some commentators believe that Joseph favoured the priests because his former master Potiphar was now a priest in the monastery of On.
    Other commentators attribute Joseph’s showing preference to the priests to the tradition that it had been the priests who had to sit in judgment deciding if the accusation of Potiphar’s wife that Joseph had attempted to rape her was true or not had ruled in Joseph’s favour basing themselves on the manner in which his garments had been torn. Had the tears occurred in the frontal part of the garments this would have been incriminating. The fact that the tears were in the rear indicated to them that Joseph had fled from her and not vice versa. You need not consider the statement in our verse that there was a special law for the priests as contradicting the tradition we just quoted, seeing that this very law had been introduced by Joseph.
    Some commentators do not understand the word כהנים as referring to a religious order, but as a description of the local aristocracy, whom Joseph exempted from these new laws restricting land ownership to a numerically insignificant number of people.

              <p>“The priests had an allotment from Pharaoh” [47:22]. He gave the priests enough bread from the king’s table. Joseph made all this because the priests gave a proper judgment when his master’s wife said that Joseph had slept with her. His master’s wife had taken the white of a chicken egg and she threw it on the bed sheet. She said that this was Joseph’s semen, when he had slept with her. The sheet was brought before the priests and the priests said that the sheet should be held before the fire. If it were semen, then it would dissolve in the fire. However, if it was egg white, it would become hard and pieces of the egg white would remain as a sign on the sheet. They did so and the egg white remained on the sheet. Yet, it is written in the verse that Pharaoh gave them bread. The explanation is that Joseph spoke with Pharaoh that the priest should be given enough bread because they served in their idolatrous temples. (Imre Noam, Genesis, 47:22.) </p>

(Devarim 3:23-25)” [Berachot 32a] (It is noteworthy that the gemara choses to learn this lesson from Moshe’s prayer in V’etchanan, where it is made clear once and for all that his desire to enter the land will remain unfulfilled. Why learn from Moshe’s ‘failed prayer’ and not his ‘successful ones’ like his intervention on behalf of Am Yisrael after the Golden Calf and Miriam after her slander? This question is what drives Rav Kook to insist that Moshe’s prayer was not premised on the notion that G–d would change. The coming sections are going to rework our understanding of the traditional three part structure which underlies prayer – praise, request, and thanksgiving. In this and the following section, R’ Kook is teaching us that the purpose of praise is not to “butter up the boss” before we make our request, but rather to disabuse us of the notion that G–d’s will can change by exposing us to His absolute grandeur. For his re-understanding of request see section 2:5. For a re-working of thanksgiving see Olat Reiyah, Modeh Ani 1.)   Prayer must be clean of any notion of altering will (If we relate to the world as an expression of G–d’s will in a simple sense, then there is a fundamental problem with prayer as request. If G–d is perfect and therefor His will immutable, then what is the point of prayer? Not only is it arrogant to think I know better than G–d, it is futile to try and change Him. And yet we see that when Avraham Avinu was confronted with the immanent destruction of Sedom, he turns to G–d and says “Far be it from You to do such a thing…shall the Judge of all the earth not do justice?!” (Bereshit 18:25) Not only that, it seems from the verses which introduce the interaction between Avraham and G–d, that G–d expected such a response from Avraham. Avraham was not just arguing with G–d (the first instance we have of such a stance in the Torah and perhaps the reason that G–d felt the need to tell him of Sedom’s doom in the first place) he was saying – G–d, I know you better than that. You don’t want the innocent to die with the wicked. He is demanding not that his own will be done, but rather that G–d’s deepest will be manifest in creation. This is one way of understanding the requests we make of G–d – I know You don’t want sick mothers, or hungry children, or war, or exile, so please manifest your true will. This posture in prayer rejects the notion that the world as it is represents the full manifestation of G–d’s will and demands that He display His deeper will. Thus Rav Kook can say that we simultaneously ask for change while knowing that G–d does not change. As he says, we change and the world changes with us. We feel the lack in the world and allow it to change us through our desire that it be made whole. And when we lift up all the changes in ourselves and the world to Him, we become a channel for the manifestation of His higher will. And then the world changes.)  or affecting response in G–d’s decree, a false conception in relation to Divinity which brings about the destruction of the ways of human perfection (Perfection (שלמות) does not exist in this world of process, except in so far as one is always in the process of perfecting oneself ((השתלמות. This appears to be the aspect of G–dly perfection which this world expresses. See the gemara Bereachot 64a with the Maharsha) . In contrast, the actual value of prayer and the surety of its impact, within the realm of its terms, even aside from the attainment of that which is sought and the elevation and clarification of the soul through prayer, is a great cornerstone in the completion of humanity. Therefore, all who pray must understand that prayer is a wondrous statute (The word חק is central to this piece. Traditionally the chukkim are understood as the laws given by G–d whose rationale lies beyond the comprehension of man, see Rambam, Hilchot Me’ilah 8:8 for a moving articulation of this definition. In biblical Hebrew it can also mean the fixed portion one receives from the one who sustains you (see Bereshit 47:22). In this piece it is important to see that Rav Kook is embracing the incomprehensible paradox of G–d’s grace in giving us the power of prayer, together with the impossibility of prayer changing anything within the Divine will. And that this is the lot we’ve been given from on high.)  which the Holy One, blessed be He, engraved (חקק This can mean legislated, or engraved. There is an aspect of receiving law comes from adding a layer to existence, like ink on paper. This presumes that the person stays as they were and receives something new. There is another aspect of receiving which is a removal of part of the self – like the removal of stone in order to communicate meaning through engraving. One might think that the first is liberating and the second constraining, but see Pirke Avot 6:2 about the Tablets we received at Sinai.)  in His world for the completion of His works in all manners of perfection, and in particular to accomplish of their moral completion which grows out of it. Prayer does not lie within the bounds of those things embedded in His decrees, G–d forbid (See Hilchot Teshuva 5:1-2) . It is therefore fitting that every prayer be preceded by the telling of praise, to teach that it is right to give great praise over the fixing of the statute of prayer not according to that which is understandable, so to speak, as the nature of His divinity (The vision of prayer laid out in this piece fights against any mechanistic notion of action and reaction, but rather embraces the wondrous paradox of intimate relationship with the Infinite.) . And the proof from Moshe is very important. He, in his great understanding, would certainly never come to think that prayer could bring about any change in will or responsiveness in the decree of G–d. Nevertheless, his prayer was preceded by abundant praise, in order to reveal the truth of the proper consciousness fit to be impressed on the heart through prayer. All the more so we, ‘unsteady man,’ (See Tehillim 116:11) who might go astray after false ideas, should begin with that which elevates the soul and sets it on right conceptions.</p>

              <p>Thus, wherever in Torah you find the term Chok-חוק, it is a matter of the limitation of all things and their measure. This also applies to the verse, (Genesis 47:22)  “And they ate their measure-Chukam-חקם that Pharoah granted them,” or the verse, (Proverbs 30:8)  “Sustain me with my [daily] measure-Chok-חק of bread.” Since all creatures to their kind and boundaries were engraved-Nichkeku-נחקקו by these two Sefirot, HaShem-יהו&quot;ה, blessed is He, placed them in His Torah with known signs, that is, with the term Chok-חוק (masculine) and with the term Chukah-חוקה (feminine). Wherever you come upon the term Chok-חוק it refers to HaShem’s-יהו&quot;ה quality as the Living God-El Chai-א&quot;ל חי. It therefore is the decisor that mediates between them, which is, the third verse. This is as stated in Sefer Yetzirah, (Sefer Yetzirah 2:4)  “The tongue is the Decisor-Chok-חוק that mediates between them.” This is because the tongue is set between all the limbs of the body. It therefore is called Chok-חוק, in that HaShem’s-יהו&quot;ה quality as the Living God-El Chai-א&quot;ל חי is called the Decisor-Chok-חוק.</p>

(Ḥok here refers to a portion given as a gift (see Genesis 47:22). A righteous person is a gift to the world, as the merit of his good deeds provides all mankind with sustenance.)    Rabbi Yitzḥak Ḥipushit said: Yod is ten – corresponding to the Ten Commandments; tzadi is ninety – “shall a ninety-year-old woman give birth?” (Genesis 17:17); kof  is a hundred – “to one who is one hundred years old” (Genesis 17:17); ḥet [is eight] – corresponding to circumcision, that was given to be performed on the eighth day. (The letters yod, tzadi, ḥet, and kof spell Yitzḥak – Isaac.)  “Abraham circumcised Isaac his son when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him” (Genesis 21:4).  “Abraham circumcised Isaac…[when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him].” That is what is written: “One who is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations” (Genesis 17:12).</p>

              <p>R. Tachlipha, brother of Rabanai Huzanah, taught (Fol. 16): &quot;All the necessities of a man are definitely assigned to him by Heaven during the ten days between New Year and the Day of Atonement, except the expenses for the Sabbath, the festivals, and for educating his children; for these purposes, one who spends little is assigned little; but one who spends much gets a big assignment.&quot; R. Abahu said: &quot;Where is the passage to prove this? (Ps. 81, 4) Blow the horn at the new moon while it (the moon) is hidden on the day of our feast. What festival is that on which the new moon is hidden (seen only by a few)? This is New Year's. Immediately following the above is the passage. For this is chok (a statute) for Israel, an ordinance by the God of Jacob. How do we know that the word chok refers to maintenance? It is written (Gen. 47, 22) And they ate their (chok) portion which Pharaoh gave them. Mar Zutra said: From here we learn it (Pr. 30, 8) Let me eat the bread Chuki (appointed to me). We are taught in a Baraitha: It is told about Shammai, the senior, that every day of the week he ate in honor of the Sabbath. When he found a good animal, he would say: &quot;This shall be for the Sabbath.&quot; And when he found a better one, he ate the former, and left the better one for the Sabbath; but Hillel, the Elder, had another habit: Because all his deeds were for the sake of Heaven, as it is said (Ps. 68, 20) Blessed be the Lord! day by day. We are also taught so in the following Baraitha: Beth Shammai say: &quot;Prepare from every day for the Sabbath,&quot; but Beth Hillel say: &quot;Praised be the Lord day by day.&quot; </p>

              <p>‎‎Genesis 47,23. “here is seed for you to sow the land; ‎and you shall give one fifth (of the harvest) to Pharaoh ‎whereas the other four fifths are for you to feed your ‎families.” A glance at Rashi’s commentary on verse ‎‎45,6 that there would be five more years of no ploughing and no ‎harvesting, poses a problem. As soon as Yaakov had arrived the ‎people had noticed an improvement in the condition of the soil, ‎so that they began using some of the seed they had, and sowed it ‎instead of using it for food as instructed. (45,5) The Egyptians ‎prepared themselves to eat the seed that they had been keeping ‎in reserve until better times would make planting more ‎propitious. Since they had violated Joseph’s instructions, he had ‎decreed that any harvest from such seed would wither and be ‎useless; this is why the Egyptians accused Joseph of decreeing to ‎let them die. This also explains why Joseph did not need to ‎appoint overseers to ensure that the Egyptians who gathered in ‎an unauthorized harvest had delivered one fifth of it to Pharaoh ‎for storage. In the third year Joseph did not decree such a curse ‎on any crop grown, stipulating that their efforts would be ‎successful only if they would deliver one fifth of their crops to ‎Pharaoh. Anyone shortchanging Pharaoh would stand to lose his ‎entire harvest.. This enables us  to understand Rashi. Joseph’s ‎prediction of seven consecutive years of famine was based on the ‎people trying to grow food without Joseph’s blessing. (verse 19) ‎Even after Yaakov’s arrival, the decree of another five years of ‎famine would be cancelled only if Joseph withdrew his decree ‎against planting.</p>

Joseph did this en masse by transferring whole populations from city to city. Since one cannot acquire land by moving it, the word היום was interposed between these different kinds of purchases Joseph made.</p>

              <p>The Torah also wanted to clarify something else here. We have the principle (Pessachim 88) that when one acquires a slave one automatically acquires everything this slave owned at the same time. There was no need to mention the acquisition of these Egyptians' lands separately. Since it is possible that Joseph did not acquire these Egyptians in the manner one usually acquires slaves, but that they became his (Pharaoh's) slaves only to the extent that they had to continue to farm the lands they had farmed previously and pay a portion of their harvest to Pharaoh, the Torah distinguished between the acquisition of the people on the one hand and that of their lands on the other hand. In practice, these Egyptians became hired hands who were not free to leave their employment. As a result Joseph had to acquire the land separately. This is why the Torah wrote in verse 20 that &quot;Joseph acquired all the lands on behalf of Pharaoh as each of the Egyptians sold his land, etc.&quot; This would enable Pharaoh to bring in other labourers to work these fields, whereas he was not able to force the Egyptians who had previously owned those fields to farm them as he did not own those farmers bodily. When Joseph said: &quot;I have acquired you,&quot; he meant that he had acquired them as hired hands, as distinct from their lands which he had acquired outright.</p>

Since Pharaoh was now the owner of the land, it was in his best interest to invest in its development by providing the people with seeds. It is evident from this verse that the famine had become more moderate in Egypt. However, in more distant lands, such as Canaan, it was still causing significant damage, which was preventing any substantial recovery. The residents of these lands were incapable of planting anything, as all the seeds had been consumed. The famine continued in this manner for several years until the populace was able to recover.</p>

                <h4>Aderet Eliyahu, Numbers 12:8:1</h4>
              </summary>
              <p>Verse: &quot;By way of a hint: I will speak with him (Moshe) face to face, openly and not in riddles.&quot; Commentary: &quot;For the Nukva is located in the middle line, and the name 'Hashem' is given to her in the aspects of Aleph(one) in the crown, Aleph in the foundation, Aleph in Tiferet, Aleph in Da'at, and Aleph in the aspect of a distinct face. It is known that the Patriarchs were in the aspect of &quot;shuruk katan&quot;, and their root was in the aspect of cholam, shuruk and chirik (vowelization points). The meaning is that 'Keter Ehad' (the supernal crown) cleaved to the Shekhinah, and this is the aspect of the men who belonged to 'Keter Ehad.' Abraham took the lower aspect in the crown, which is called 'Sihara,' as known, and it is called 'Sihara Tzedek.'                         Isaia 41:2:  &quot;Who has roused a victor from the East, summoned him to G-d’s service?&quot; as it is written: Exodus 24:10 &quot;and they saw the G-d of Israel; under whose feet was the likeness of a pavement of sapphire&quot;. Therefore, the Sihara is called 'Lavana' (moon) - the attribute of chessed/kindness. Therefore &quot;mountain&quot; is the secret of the apple, as known. Isaac took the aspect of Yesod, and he is called 'Yitzhak Ketz Chai' (Isaac, the end of life), as it is written in  Tikunei Zohar Chadash 98: 'Yitzhak Ketz Chai Olamin (Isaac, the end of life of the worlds).' It is tied with the left. There he is called 'field' and is connected to Nun-Heh-Yod (Netzach Hod Yesod) as is known and this is the meaning of &quot;field that is abandoned and plowed&quot; like it says: Genesis 47:23: &quot;here is seed for you to sow the land&quot; and Genesis 47:19: &quot;and that the land may not become a waste.” Jacob took the aspect of Tav Tav (Tiferet) meaning 'Bayit' (house) like: Yeshayahu  47:13 As a man's glory to sit in a house. As our Sages said, ' From (all) my days, I have not called my wife, my wife,' etc. For in the aspect of field is nothing, except when it is given over to be plowed, unlike a house, where a person is always present. And this is the aspect of Yesod and Tiferet, which is called 'Ish' (man), and Tiferet is called 'Adam.' This is the secret of 'and no man passed there, and no man dwelled there.' Here he passed (field), and here he dwelled (house), and they are the general principle of all, like the three aforementioned points. They are the general principle and the general body: head, abdomen, and body. They are the general principle of NR&quot;N (Nefesh-Ruach-Neshamah), and likewise all the principles of the Merkavah (Divine Chariot) and the general principle of the Ten Sefirot, as known. And this is in the external aspect, and it is known that Da'at includes Chessed and Gevurah, graces/sefirot, that draw from the small face. And this is Kel De'ot (G-d of knowledge), the secret of the knowledge of Z&quot;A (Zeir Anpin). And Moshe is the &quot;principle&quot; of da'at, awesome and holy and that is the &quot;bridal aspect&quot; of Moshe Rabbeinu and this is the meaning that Jakob served with his body and Moshe served with his spirituality for da'at is the inner fragrance and therefore he (Moshe) separated from his wife for he served with his mind/spirit, and this is the secret of the union of kisses, which is the voice and speech, and the hidden knowledge in the mouth, as stated in Perek Mishpatim (Chapter on Laws). And this is what it means, 'Face to face, I will speak with him,' and in the fifth aspect, which is the face. This is the second of the lights that diminished, as it said, &quot;aleph&quot; immediately followed &quot;tav&quot; on the fourth day when the lights were diminished.' And she descended into &quot;beriya&quot;, and this is ' HeshemElokeinu.' And this is with Z&quot;A (Zeir Anpin), and makes it a complete Name, and it is the aspect of Judah. And David is the fourth leg to the forefathers, as they brought him to their level, which is HG&quot;T (Chessed-Gevurah-Tiferet), and this is the fourth leg. And this is what is meant by 'Judah descended,' as known. And this is 'Avnei Ma'asu Habonim' (the stone the builders rejected), and it is the supernal Malchut (kingdom) of the ten s'firot, as known. And this full name will ascend in the future, and this is what 'shall be the cornerstone' means.&quot; </p>

Pharaoh's dreams were prophetic, leading Joseph to interpret them as a message from God, ultimately saving mankind from famine. The Mishnah discusses the measure for joining Shabbat boundaries, with specific measurements for the size of meals. Rabbeinu Bahya explains the presence of God accompanying the Israelites to Egypt, associated with retribution and lack of pity.

              <p>‎‎Genesis 47,23. “here is seed for you to sow the land; ‎and you shall give one fifth (of the harvest) to Pharaoh ‎whereas the other four fifths are for you to feed your ‎families.” A glance at Rashi’s commentary on verse ‎‎45,6 that there would be five more years of no ploughing and no ‎harvesting, poses a problem. As soon as Yaakov had arrived the ‎people had noticed an improvement in the condition of the soil, ‎so that they began using some of the seed they had, and sowed it ‎instead of using it for food as instructed. (45,5) The Egyptians ‎prepared themselves to eat the seed that they had been keeping ‎in reserve until better times would make planting more ‎propitious. Since they had violated Joseph’s instructions, he had ‎decreed that any harvest from such seed would wither and be ‎useless; this is why the Egyptians accused Joseph of decreeing to ‎let them die. This also explains why Joseph did not need to ‎appoint overseers to ensure that the Egyptians who gathered in ‎an unauthorized harvest had delivered one fifth of it to Pharaoh ‎for storage. In the third year Joseph did not decree such a curse ‎on any crop grown, stipulating that their efforts would be ‎successful only if they would deliver one fifth of their crops to ‎Pharaoh. Anyone shortchanging Pharaoh would stand to lose his ‎entire harvest.. This enables us  to understand Rashi. Joseph’s ‎prediction of seven consecutive years of famine was based on the ‎people trying to grow food without Joseph’s blessing. (verse 19) ‎Even after Yaakov’s arrival, the decree of another five years of ‎famine would be cancelled only if Joseph withdrew his decree ‎against planting.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>Going back to the Talmud Pessachim 54, which we ‎quoted at the beginning of this subject of the creation of the ‎‎“light/fire, which is the subject of the benediction recited at the ‎end of the Sabbath, in the first chapter of the Talmud ‎‎B’rachot, folio 10 the question is raised why King David in ‎psalms 103-104 uses the expression ‎ברכי נפשי ‏‎ no fewer than five ‎times. The answer given is that David refers both to G’d and to ‎man’s soul. David sees a comparison between G’d and our soul, ‎G’d filling the whole universe and the soul permeating the entire ‎human body. G’d sees all without being seen, and the soul ‎similarly sees without being seen by a human eye. G’d provides ‎nourishment for all His creatures, and the soul provides spiritual ‎nourishment for the whole body. G’d is ritually pure, and the soul ‎remains ritually pure. G’d’s domain is in the innermost holy place, ‎and the soul’s abode is also in the innermost part of the body. ‎David appeals to G’d Who possesses these five attributes to bless ‎his soul that also possesses five comparable attributes. At the ‎same time we have a saying in the Zohar III 73 that just as ‎the Torah is supernatural and contains revealed and hidden ‎aspects, so it contains both hidden and revealed names of the ‎Lord. The four hidden aspects of G’d are that G’d sees while ‎Himself invisible, He provides nourishment, (though unseen); G’d ‎resides in the innermost part of the celestial regions is another ‎one of His hidden aspects. His is pure and incapable of becoming ‎impure; one of His hidden features is His ability to feed the ‎universe without His requiring nourishment Himself. However, ‎the fact that He fills the entire universe is the visible aspect of ‎G’d. When Joseph spoke about the four parts out of five that ‎would belong to the Egyptian farmer to use for himself and his ‎family, this was an allusion to the four hidden aspects of G’d, ‎whereas the fifth part that would be given to Pharaoh was an ‎allusion to the visible part of G’d. It is possible that on occasion ‎this fifth aspect of G’d becomes revealed as the letter ‎ה‎=5 is the ‎last letter in the tetragram, the holiest of G’d’s names. It is ‎accepted in kabbalistic circles that the last letter in the tetragram ‎alludes to G’d when He manifests Himself.‎</p>

The land of Egypt, normally, has a surplus of food due to the irrigation method based on the overflow of the Nile, so that by being allowed to keep four fifths of their crops the farmers would not suffer hardship.

              <p>For each year. I.e., not the first year alone. Re’m asks: Why did Rashi not make this comment at the beginning of the verse, “When it produces”? then it would apply to everything written afterward. The answer is: Here, [Rashi’s comment] is proven true. For Yoseif already said, “Here is seed, plant the soil.” Why does it say here, “For seed for your fields”? Perforce, because the statute of giving a fifth to Pharaoh applied for each year, thus he ordered them here to sow [each year] so that the fifth not become lessened. But if the statute was only for the first year, why was Yoseif concerned whether they sow [each year] or not? Perforce, it must have been for each year. (Nachalas Yaakov) </p>

            <summary>Pharaoh's dreams were prophetic and beyond the understanding of his magicians, leading Joseph to interpret them as a message from God. Joseph emphasized the importance of preparing for the coming famine, which ultimately led to him being appointed by Pharaoh to oversee the distribution of grain. Joseph's actions during the famine, including price gouging by private hoarders and strategic distribution of government stocks, allowed him to accumulate wealth for Pharaoh. Jacob's sons eventually traveled to Egypt to buy grain, where they were reunited with Joseph after he recognized them despite their changed appearance and behavior. Through Pharaoh's dream and Joseph's actions, God saved mankind from famine without interfering with free will.</summary>

              <p>(2) Whereas both Joseph, the butler and the baker were central figures in their respective dreams, Pharaoh had dreamt about things which seemed of no particular concern to him. This was sufficiently strange to trouble his mind. The other unusual feature was his waking and then having a second dream in which the same numbers played a central role. He felt that there was some symbolism in this. Pharaoh's magicians failed to understand the subject matter of the dream, because they concentrated only on the numbers. The subject matter was not really part of their art. (4) In the case of the butler and the baker, each had dreamt the other's interpretation; since the subject matter was closely related, Joseph could easily have mistaken it for being the same. Nonetheless, he was astute enough to recognize the differences in the two dreams. Joseph concentrated on interpreting the differences between the dreams instead of concentrating on their common denominator. (1) When the chief butler referred to Joseph in a derogatory manner, he did so in order that Pharaoh might not think that he had a personal interest in promoting Joseph's fortunes. This prompted Pharaoh to say to Joseph, &quot;I heard that you can interpret a dream when you hear it according to all its ramifications, even though it may appear to contain only a single message.&quot; Joseph replied, &quot;On the contrary, the task of the interpreter is beyond human intelligence alone, and requires Divine inspiration.&quot; (3) Pharaoh's waking in between was designed to confuse his magicians. Joseph exploited this fact to explain it as one of the reasons Pharaoh's advisers had failed him. The other reason was that the dream was prophetic in nature; G-d revealed His intentions. This is something quite outside the art of professional dream interpreters. At the same time, by portraying himself as privy to G-d’s intentions, Joseph improved his own image both in the eyes of Pharaoh and those of his servants. Joseph explained, A) There really has been only one dream. B) The subject matter was something that G-d was about to do on a universal scale; the dream did not relate to the fortunes of the person who had dreamt it. Although, normally, such matters are revealed by prophets, in this instance Pharaoh had been found worthy to be the vehicle of prophecy. In this way, Joseph flattered Pharaoh (Daniel, when interpreting Nebuchadnezzar's dream flatters N. similarly). (5) Although one might consider the seven fat cows as representing seven years and the seven good ears of corn as representing an additional seven years, and similarly one might consider the seven lean cows as seven years and the seven ears of corn whose kernels had been blown out as another seven years, Joseph repeats that this is not so. He had to emphasize that the magicians had erred on that score. Joseph then proceeded to explain that the interpretation of the dream was of secondary significance compared to the measures which had to be taken to neutralize the effects of the dream were it allowed to become history. (6) By suggesting in detail how to safeguard both the land and the people, Joseph promoted himself both in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants. Pharaoh was impressed by the advice on how to forestall an economic and human tragedy of vast dimensions. (7) Before giving the advice, Joseph had to stress, i.e. repeat the dreadful consequences that would ensue if the famine were to occur without proper precautions having been made as to how to deal with it. The reason that Joseph suggested that the matter be handled by Pharaoh personally, was to stress the importance of the steps to be taken. Pharaoh enlisted the support of his advisors by asking, &quot;Can we find such a person?&quot; After having obtained their consent, he turned to Joseph and appointed him. (8) The reason Joseph's age is mentioned at this point is to absolve him from blame for not having informed his father about his whereabouts while he was in an inferior position from which he had no chance to escape, even if ransom money were offered. Even now, his status would be contingent on his prophecies proving true. Should the seven good years not occur, or should the famine fail to materialize, he would be discredited and be in disgrace again. (10) When the famine struck, first in the surrounding countries, Egypt had plenty of bread and exported. The population protested the export, asking Pharaoh to prohibit grain exports. Pharaoh sent them to Joseph saying that the latter was in charge and had full power of attorney. Joseph stalled deliberately, in order to become the sole distributor of government stocks, once the private hoards had been exhausted. The famine in Egypt increased due to the price gouging by the individual hoarders. (11) As a result of this, the famine became country-wide, later on even world-wide. Once prices had risen dramatically, Joseph started releasing government stocks at what had by then become market prices. He could therefore not be accused of overcharging; thus he accumulated untold wealth for Pharaoh. After one had heard in Canaan that there was more bread in Egypt, the rumour began to circulate that Pharaoh had begun selling. (12) Some of this government grain had already reached Canaan; this is where Jacob had seen it. He then told his sons not to buy from middlemen at inflated prices, but to go to Egypt and buy at the source. Possibly, his sons needed to be encouraged, since they did not want to demean themselves and undertake such a lengthy journey in order to buy necessities, wealthy and dignified as they considered themselves to be. Also, they were anxious to avoid ostentation. This is why they are described as &quot;arriving with the other travellers.&quot; They made a point of mingling with the common people. Joseph at first had some doubts if these men were really his brothers, seeing that their conduct was quite unlike what he remembered. Only after having spoken to them severely did he become convinced that they were his brothers. This is why we read first &quot;he recognized them&quot; and later &quot;he recognized his brothers.&quot; The number of brothers travelling is stated to stress that all those who had been involved in selling him and stripping him of his colored coat were now facing the consequences of their actions. We observe that through Pharaoh's dream, G-d saved most of mankind from famine, enabling Joseph's family to survive and become reunited etc. without in the least interfering with the freely made decisions of any of the parties involved. </p>

              <p>What is the measure for an joining of Shabbat boundaries? It consists of a quantity of food sufficient for two meals for each and every one of those included in the eiruv. The tanna’im disagree with regard to the size of these two meals. It is referring to one’s food that he eats on a weekday and not on Shabbat; this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: It is referring to the amount he eats on Shabbat and not on a weekday. And both this Sage, Rabbi Meir, and that Sage, Rabbi Yehuda, intended to be lenient, as Rabbi Meir maintains that people eat more food on Shabbat, whereas Rabbi Yehuda believes that they consume more on a weekday. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: Food for two meals is the size of a loaf bought with a pundeyon, which is one-forty-eighth of a sela, when four se’a of wheat are sold for a sela. Rabbi Shimon says: Food for two meals is two of three parts of a loaf, when three loaves are prepared from a kav of wheat. In other words, the measure is two-thirds of a loaf the size of one-third of a kav. Having discussed measures with regard to a loaf of bread, the mishna states that half of this loaf is the amount called a half [peras], a measure relevant for the halakhot of a leprous house. If one enters a house afflicted with leprosy and remains there long enough to eat this amount of food, the clothes he is wearing become ritually impure. And half of its half, a quarter of this loaf, is the amount of ritually impure food that disqualifies the body. In other words, impure food of this amount imparts ritual impurity to the body of the eater, and disqualifies him by rabbinic law from eating teruma.</p>

            <summary>Rabbeinu Bahya explains that the presence of God, represented by the letter ה, would accompany the Israelites to Egypt, as seen in the use of the word מצרימה. This attribute of God is also associated with retribution, lack of pity, and will accompany the Israelites through various exiles, as seen in references in Ezekiel and Daniel. The increase of the Jewish people from 70 souls to over 600,000 at the time of the Exodus is attributed to the presence of God's benevolent שכינה. The use of the letter ה in various contexts, including Joseph's invitation to his father, signifies confidence in God's accompanying presence.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>A kabbalistic approach to our verse: The words: “I will go down with you,” are an allusion to the Presence of G’d, the שכינה, which would go down to Egypt with the Israelites. Our sages in Shabbat 89 and elsewhere say that G’d’s Presence descended with the Israelites. In order to hint at this, Onkelos translates the words as אנא אחות [a “physical” as opposed to a merely spiritual descent, in anthropomorphic terms, of course. Ed.], instead of as אנא אתגלי which is his usual translation for the word ירד, such as in Exodus 19,11 when applied to G’d. This is especially remarkable considering the care Onkelos takes not to apply anthropomorphic terms to G’d or His activities.  The reason the Torah writes מצרימה instead of למצרים, i.e. concluding with the letter ה, and also writing the word עלה in a form ending with the letter ה, is to provide tangible proof that G’d’s Presence, i.e. “ה,” will accompany the Israelites to Egypt. The letter ה, the last letter in the Ineffable Name, is the attribute which provided sustenance for Egypt during the years of famine.  Joseph already hinted at this attribute when he told the Egyptians in 47,23 הא לכם זרע, “here is seed for you.” In the following verse Joseph speaks of the חמישית, “fifth” or “hand” which G’d used to enact retribution from the Egyptians for abusing the Israelites during their exile there. This “hand” of G’d was in evidence when the livestock of the Egyptians was struck in Exodus 9,3, and it was the attribute the Israelites witnessed at the sea 14,31. It is also the attribute which Ezekiel mentioned when he described G’d’s anger during the destruction of Jerusalem and the Holy Temple (Ezekiel 16,43). We also find the words לא אחמול, “I shall not display pity,” five times in connection with that destruction (commencing in Ezekiel 5,11) after having described such scenes as parents eating the flesh of their children and children eating the flesh of their parents, to illustrate this lack of G’d’s pity for the state His people were in at that time.  We find that Daniel 2,43 refers to this attribute when he speaks about iron not blending with earthenware. Daniel mentions five different categories of materials which cannot form a blend, an alloy. This word הא occurs a total of three times in the Bible, once in the Torah, once in the Books of Prophets (Ezekiel 16,43), and once in the Hagiographa (Daniel 3,25). The message is that this attribute of G’d will accompany the Israelites through all the various exiles. The very word עמך, “with you,” which G’d uses to describe Himself as accompanying Yaakov to Egypt, is also associated with צרה, distress, sorrow, trouble, as we know from עמו אנכי בצרה, Psalms 91,15 “I am with him when it is in trouble.” In our verse the choice of that word then is a double-entendre. It means that even when the Israelites were exiled to Babylon the שכינה was with them also. Our sages base this on Isaiah 43,14: “for your sake I send (the redeemer) to Babylon.” We have a similar situation regarding the exile under the Edomites, (the present exile). Isaiah 63,1 describes the redeemer as coming from Edom, his clothing full of blood, etc., an allusion to G’d taking His vengeance on our oppressors. The word זה in that verse is a reference to G’d Himself being that redeemer. The word זה referred to our redeemer, i.e. G’d, already when the Israelites had crossed the sea and watched the Egyptians drown. At that time they broke out in a song of thanksgiving adulating G’d by saying זה א-לי ואנוהו “this is my G’d and I want to enshrine Him.” The word זה, of course, also ends with this letter ה, the attribute we have been discussing. Interestingly enough, even Joseph phrased his invitation to his father to come to him in Egypt in a word ending with the letter ה, when he said (45,9) רדה אלי אל תעמוד, “come down to me, do not delay.” He added the letter ה instead of saying רד אלי, which would have been quite sufficient. He meant to convey his confidence that the attribute of G’d represented by the letter ה would accompany his father and his family. Keeping all this in mind, the phenomenal increase of the Jewish people from 70 souls to over 600,000 arms-bearing men at the time of the Exodus (only 210 years later) becomes much less surprising. Clearly the Presence of G’d’s benevolent שכינה must be credited for this. (the author had referred to the addition of the latter ה in Avraham’s name in Genesis 17,5 as supplying the element which would enable his descendants to multiply prolifically). This element came into its own while the Jewish people were in Egypt and actually was also a prime factor in their eventual enslavement (compare Exodus 1,7-13). Once they had attained the required number of 600.000 men over 20 years of age they qualified for G’d revealing Himself to them openly at Mount Sinai.</p>

              <p>(2) Whereas both Joseph, the butler and the baker were central figures in their respective dreams, Pharaoh had dreamt about things which seemed of no particular concern to him. This was sufficiently strange to trouble his mind. The other unusual feature was his waking and then having a second dream in which the same numbers played a central role. He felt that there was some symbolism in this. Pharaoh's magicians failed to understand the subject matter of the dream, because they concentrated only on the numbers. The subject matter was not really part of their art. (4) In the case of the butler and the baker, each had dreamt the other's interpretation; since the subject matter was closely related, Joseph could easily have mistaken it for being the same. Nonetheless, he was astute enough to recognize the differences in the two dreams. Joseph concentrated on interpreting the differences between the dreams instead of concentrating on their common denominator. (1) When the chief butler referred to Joseph in a derogatory manner, he did so in order that Pharaoh might not think that he had a personal interest in promoting Joseph's fortunes. This prompted Pharaoh to say to Joseph, &quot;I heard that you can interpret a dream when you hear it according to all its ramifications, even though it may appear to contain only a single message.&quot; Joseph replied, &quot;On the contrary, the task of the interpreter is beyond human intelligence alone, and requires Divine inspiration.&quot; (3) Pharaoh's waking in between was designed to confuse his magicians. Joseph exploited this fact to explain it as one of the reasons Pharaoh's advisers had failed him. The other reason was that the dream was prophetic in nature; G-d revealed His intentions. This is something quite outside the art of professional dream interpreters. At the same time, by portraying himself as privy to G-d’s intentions, Joseph improved his own image both in the eyes of Pharaoh and those of his servants. Joseph explained, A) There really has been only one dream. B) The subject matter was something that G-d was about to do on a universal scale; the dream did not relate to the fortunes of the person who had dreamt it. Although, normally, such matters are revealed by prophets, in this instance Pharaoh had been found worthy to be the vehicle of prophecy. In this way, Joseph flattered Pharaoh (Daniel, when interpreting Nebuchadnezzar's dream flatters N. similarly). (5) Although one might consider the seven fat cows as representing seven years and the seven good ears of corn as representing an additional seven years, and similarly one might consider the seven lean cows as seven years and the seven ears of corn whose kernels had been blown out as another seven years, Joseph repeats that this is not so. He had to emphasize that the magicians had erred on that score. Joseph then proceeded to explain that the interpretation of the dream was of secondary significance compared to the measures which had to be taken to neutralize the effects of the dream were it allowed to become history. (6) By suggesting in detail how to safeguard both the land and the people, Joseph promoted himself both in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants. Pharaoh was impressed by the advice on how to forestall an economic and human tragedy of vast dimensions. (7) Before giving the advice, Joseph had to stress, i.e. repeat the dreadful consequences that would ensue if the famine were to occur without proper precautions having been made as to how to deal with it. The reason that Joseph suggested that the matter be handled by Pharaoh personally, was to stress the importance of the steps to be taken. Pharaoh enlisted the support of his advisors by asking, &quot;Can we find such a person?&quot; After having obtained their consent, he turned to Joseph and appointed him. (8) The reason Joseph's age is mentioned at this point is to absolve him from blame for not having informed his father about his whereabouts while he was in an inferior position from which he had no chance to escape, even if ransom money were offered. Even now, his status would be contingent on his prophecies proving true. Should the seven good years not occur, or should the famine fail to materialize, he would be discredited and be in disgrace again. (10) When the famine struck, first in the surrounding countries, Egypt had plenty of bread and exported. The population protested the export, asking Pharaoh to prohibit grain exports. Pharaoh sent them to Joseph saying that the latter was in charge and had full power of attorney. Joseph stalled deliberately, in order to become the sole distributor of government stocks, once the private hoards had been exhausted. The famine in Egypt increased due to the price gouging by the individual hoarders. (11) As a result of this, the famine became country-wide, later on even world-wide. Once prices had risen dramatically, Joseph started releasing government stocks at what had by then become market prices. He could therefore not be accused of overcharging; thus he accumulated untold wealth for Pharaoh. After one had heard in Canaan that there was more bread in Egypt, the rumour began to circulate that Pharaoh had begun selling. (12) Some of this government grain had already reached Canaan; this is where Jacob had seen it. He then told his sons not to buy from middlemen at inflated prices, but to go to Egypt and buy at the source. Possibly, his sons needed to be encouraged, since they did not want to demean themselves and undertake such a lengthy journey in order to buy necessities, wealthy and dignified as they considered themselves to be. Also, they were anxious to avoid ostentation. This is why they are described as &quot;arriving with the other travellers.&quot; They made a point of mingling with the common people. Joseph at first had some doubts if these men were really his brothers, seeing that their conduct was quite unlike what he remembered. Only after having spoken to them severely did he become convinced that they were his brothers. This is why we read first &quot;he recognized them&quot; and later &quot;he recognized his brothers.&quot; The number of brothers travelling is stated to stress that all those who had been involved in selling him and stripping him of his colored coat were now facing the consequences of their actions. We observe that through Pharaoh's dream, G-d saved most of mankind from famine, enabling Joseph's family to survive and become reunited etc. without in the least interfering with the freely made decisions of any of the parties involved. </p>

            <summary>The seven years of plenty in Egypt ended perfectly, leading to a severe famine where even coarse bread was sought after. Famine affected Phoenicia, Arabia, and Philistia, but Egypt had bread due to Joseph's preparations. Pharaoh directed the hungry Egyptians to Joseph, who compelled them to circumcise themselves, ensuring their lives in the World to Come. Joseph sold grain to the Egyptians during the intensified famine, providing the best of what they had.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>“The seven years of plenty that was in the land of Egypt concluded” (Genesis 41:53).  “The seven years of famine ensued, as Joseph had said; there was famine in all lands, but in all of the land of Egypt there was bread” (Genesis 41:54).  “Concluded [vatikhlena]…” – they emerged perfect [mekholalot].   “Ensued [vateḥilena]…” – they entered ill [ḥolaniyot]. (Although the Egyptians had eaten on the final day of the seventh year of plenty, on the first day of the first year of famine, they were already afflicted with hunger.)  By the time they sat at the table, they sought even coarse bread, but could find none. They said: ‘Is this not what Joseph said: “The food will be as a security [for the land for the seven years of famine]”? (Genesis 41:36). (They needed the security from the beginning of the seven years.)   “There was famine in all lands” – in three lands: Phoenicia, Arabia, and Philistia.  “The entire land of Egypt was hungry, and the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread; Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians: Go to Joseph; what he says to you, you shall do” (Genesis 41:55).  “The entire land of Egypt was hungry…what he says to you, you shall do” – Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: He compelled them to circumcise themselves. (When a Jew purchases a gentile slave, he is obligated to circumcise him.)  Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: “Ḥiyitanu” is not written here, but rather, “you have saved our lives [heḥeyitanu]” (Genesis 47:25) (When the Egyptians tell Joseph “you have saved our lives,” the Hebrew term used is heḥeyitanu instead of the similar form ḥiyitanu. The extra heh in the word implies that something additional is included, and is interpreted as an allusion to life in the World to Come: By seeing to it that they became circumcised, Joseph assured them of life in the World to Come; alternatively, the meaning is that some Egyptians converted and thereby merited life in the World to Come (see Yefeh To’ar). )  – you have given us life in this world, and in the World to Come.  “The famine was on the entire face of the earth, and Joseph opened all that was in them, and sold grain to the Egyptians. The famine was intensified in the land of Egypt” (Genesis 41:56).  “The famine was…everything that [asher] was in them” – the best [hame’usharim] of them.</p>

Jacob strategically settled his sons in Goshen to prevent political involvement in Egyptian affairs and minimize their exile, as highlighted in the commentary. Rabbi Soloveitchik observed that the Israelites became comfortable in Egypt despite reminders of their return to the Promised Land, needing to be forced to leave. Kabbalistic interpretations connect the removal of ḥallah from dough to purification and generation of clean seed, paralleling human coupling in Genesis 47:23. Various commentaries discuss the destruction of enemies leading to the return of holiness to the Jewish people, the significance of dwelling in certain places signifying impending calamity, and the prosperity and growth of the Israelites in Goshen as described in Targum.</summary>

The reason ‎that the latter type of tzaddik is able to do this, is that he ‎says to himself that if cultural values that are evidently vain and ‎ultimately useless, have attracted so much love and esteem by ‎their supporters, how much more love and esteem must he, the ‎‎tzaddik, bring to the service of the true and everlasting G’d! ‎When the Torah writes in our paragraph that the Israelites ‎‎“adopted” i.e. were taken captive, ‎ויאחזו‎, by the prevailing ‎cultural values of the Egyptians, the meaning is that they were ‎able to sublimate these values and yet remain Yisrael at the ‎same time.</p>

(“Gash” means “came close,” as in the very name of this Parsha, “Vayigash,” meaning “and he came close.”) </p>

            <summary>The Torah describes how the Israelites settled in the land of Egypt, particularly in Goshen, where they acquired property with title, multiplied greatly in children and property, and became attached to the land as their ancestral heritage. This settling was a strategic move by Jacob to prevent his sons from becoming politically involved in Egyptian matters of state, as he foresaw the beginning of their exile and wanted to minimize it. The Torah emphasizes the unity of purpose and lofty ideals of the fledgling nation Israel at that time, as they were possessed by these ideals and not simply by the land itself.</summary>

              </summary>
              <p>The Torah evidently wishes to remind us of the fulfilment of G'd's prophecy to Jacob in 46,3 that while in Egypt he would develop into a great nation, that the reason he and his family had to descend to Egypt was to liberate the stray holy souls that were entrapped amongst the Egyptians and their pagan practices. This is why the Torah emphasises that Israel dwelled in the land of Egypt, a morally thoroughly depraved society. The Torah adds that Israel lived in the land of Goshen to hint that the origin of that word is הגשה, approach, i.e. that all those scattered souls we have previously described were attracted to and collected in Goshen because of the presence there of a branch of sanctity as represented by Jacob/lsrael. The entire paragraph refers to the fledgling nation Israel in the singular to emphasise the unity of purpose that characterised that society at that time. When the Torah adds ויאחזו בה, &quot;they were possessed by it,&quot; this refers to their lofty ideal as a developing holy nation. The reason they were extraordinarily fruitful and multiplied was the fact that they were possessed by lofty ideals not because they happened to find themselves on Egyptian soil. The author suggests reading up the comments of the Maha&quot;rik on Exodus 1,6: &quot;Joseph, all his brothers and that entire generation died.&quot;</p>

              <p>וישב ישראל בארץ מצרים בארץ גושן, “Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the province of Goshen.” The city Goshen is close to the capital of Egypt. Seeing that his twelve sons were all prominent people in their own right, each one of them capable of dealing with kings on a basis of equality, Yaakov did not want to reside in Egypt proper to forestall his sons becoming politically involved in Egyptian matters of state. Yaakov was well aware that this was the time when the exile of his descendants began. He wanted to minimize this exile to the greatest extent possible and this is why he preferred the status of “וישב&quot; , he “settled down,” to the status claimed by those of his sons who had been introduced to Pharaoh and who had claimed the status as resident strangers, i.e. לגור בארץ באנו, “we have only come here as temporary residents” (47,4). It had been the sons’ intention to return to the land of Canaan as soon as the famine ended.</p>

              </summary>
              <p>ויאחזו בה, “they acquired property in it.” The word ויאחזו suggests the acquisition of permanent, hereditary property; their intention was never fulfilled, however. The correct wording of the verse should have been ויאחזו בניו בה, “his sons acquired landed property there.” In fact, what happened was the very reverse. The passive form of the word ויאחזו describes that instead of becoming masters of that soil they became enslaved to it. The word is reminiscent of something taking root. Seeing that their father had already “taken root” in that land as the Torah described him as “settling,” there was no need for the Torah to mention that his offspring branched out like roots. If the Torah describes what happened with Yaakov’s sons as something in its own right, it indicates that there was some dramatic change in the spiritual direction of future generations of Yaakov’s sons. The righteous are described as active, as setting the tone for something. Examples are Isaiah 27,6: “In days to come Yaakov shall strike root.” The psalmist in Psalms 80,10 speaks of “it took deep root and filled the land.” The reason that in this paragraph the Torah wrote: “these are the names of the Israelites who came to Egypt,” is an indication that only that generation was still “master” of its destiny. Later generations became “possessed” by the land instead of actively possessing it. We have numerous instances in the Bible of the wicked not striking root. Examples: Ezekiel 31,3 (speaking about Sancheriv). The prophet extols the height to which his kingdom had risen comparing it to a lofty cedar but carefully omitting mention of any roots. Daniel 4,8 describes Nebuchadnezzar and his rise to power in similar terms. The lesson is that the wicked, though apparently flourishing greatly at one time or another, are devoid of roots and therefore prone to sudden collapse. There is an exception to this in Daniel 4,12 where a root is mentioned in connection with Nebuchadnezzar’s dream (“however its major roots leave in the ground”); the angel mentioned this only to show Nebuchadnezzar that the kingdom would be restored to him. It has no bearing on the fact that the wicked are depicted as devoid of roots. This idea is spelled out in Isaiah 40,24: “their roots will dry out and the storm beats them off like straw.” The righteous by contrast is depicted as having solid roots which will not deteriorate. This is what Solomon alluded to when he said (Proverbs 12,3) “but the root of the righteous cannot be shaken loose.”</p>

              <p>Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik made an insightful comment about the opening of the Book of Exodus. The first verse reads, “And these are the names of the children of Israel who were coming (haba’im) to Egypt.” The verse uses the present tense rather than the past. In fact the Israelites had come generations before, but in the eyes of the Egyptians it was as if they had just arrived. They remained immigrants, foreigners, outsiders. The new Pharaoh, announcing his program of persecution, justified it with the words, “When we are called to war they may join with our enemies [and] fight against us” (Ex. 1:10). In the eyes of the Egyptians, they were not citizens but aliens, just as the people of Sodom had seen Lot. The Israelites for their part – despite the deathbed reminders of Jacob and Joseph that they would return to the Promised Land and were not to stay indefinitely in Egypt – “acquired property there” (Gen. 47:27), implying that they intended to make Egypt their home. It was not easy for Moses to get them to leave. In the end they were “driven out” by the Egyptians (Ex. 12:39), just as Lot was physically dragged by the angels from Sodom (Gen. 19:16).</p>

              <p>וישב ישראל בשטים ויחל העם לזנות, “Israel had settled down at a place known as Shittim, when the common people profaned themselves by whoring.” It is well known that whenever the Torah commences a paragraph with the word: וישב, what follows is some kind of disaster. Compare Genesis 37,1 when Yaakov “settled” down and the disaster with Joseph followed and he was sold by his brothers. When in chapter 50,22 of Genesis Joseph is described as having settled down, this is followed by his announcing to his brothers his premature death. (Genesis 50,24) When Israel is described as having settled down in Egypt, (Genesis 47,27) this is followed shortly by the report about Yaakov’s (premature) sickness and death. (verse 29) In Kings I,5,5 we read that the people of Israel including the tribe of Yehudah had settled securely, this is followed by a report in chapter 11,14, by: G–d arranging a revolt by the King of Edom against Solomon’s kingdom. [The Edomites had paid annual tribute to the state of Israel since David’s time. G–d had arranged this as His response to Solomon allowing his wife to erect an altar to the Moabite idol chemosh.
