# Introduction

The Torah, also known as the Five Books of Moses, has always held a special place in my heart. It’s a foundational text that offers wisdom, guidance, and spiritual depth. Every week, Jews around the world read a designated portion of the Torah, known as a parasha (parashot in plural), and reflect on its meaning. Alongside the Torah, generations of scholars have written extensive commentaries, offering their insights and interpretations of the sacred text. These commentaries add layers of richness to the Torah, but navigating through them can often be overwhelming due to their sheer volume and depth.

In this project, I wanted to create something that would help bridge that gap. Using the resources available on Sefaria, an incredible digital library of Jewish texts, I’ve gathered the weekly parashot and their available commentaries. These include the thoughts and reflections of scholars like Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Ramban, and others, whose words have shaped Jewish learning for centuries. For some lines, there were textbook's worth of commentary.

But I also recognize that not everyone has the time to dive into the full breadth of these commentaries each week. That’s where I’ve employed OpenAI’s GPT model to help summarize the vast commentaries into concise, digestible insights. My goal is to sacrifice the depth and wisdom of these scholars to make it accessible, whether you're a seasoned student of Torah or just starting out, to engage with the weekly readings. This way you can read from the generated booklet and have access to interesting notes.

In this book, you’ll find each weekly parasha, followed by a summarized commentary that draws from centuries of tradition. It’s my hope that this resource will make it easier for readers to engage with the text and the accompanying commentary, offering a clearer path into the richness of the Torah.

As part of my commitment to open learning, this project is open source and freely available for anyone to explore, contribute to, or use. You can find the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/DrAnomalocaris/SefriaToBooklets. I welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help this project grow and improve.

I’ve created this book for those who want to study the Torah more deeply, but also for those who might feel daunted by the vastness of the traditional commentaries. Whether you’re reading for personal reflection or using it as a guide for weekly study, I hope these summaries will inspire you to delve deeper into the text and connect with the timeless wisdom it offers.
