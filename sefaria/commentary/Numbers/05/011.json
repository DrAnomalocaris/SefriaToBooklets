T<small>HE BOOK OF</small> Numbers commences with several lists that serve to arrange and catalog the Israelite camp in the wilderness: first, the “accountings” of the Israelites fit for battle; then, the symmetrical arrangement of the camp itself, around the Tabernacle; and finally, the special listing of the Levite population, accompanied by an enumeration of its special tasks in the camp. The first part of Numbers thus takes place as it were in the shadow of Mount Sinai—that is, under the aegis of the priestly school of thinking, in which order is everything.", "There is a strong military bent to the arrangement. The census of Chapter 1 is not a head count of the entire Israelite population, but rather of those “twenty years of age and upward,” those eligible to serve in the army. The setup of the camp resembles that in ancient Egypt, with the sanctuary and ark (here “Dwelling” and “coffer”) in the center (in the Egypt of Raamses II—thought by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus—it was the king’s throne). The Levites, whom we have not encountered previously as a group with tasks distinct from those of the priests, emerge in this part of the book as caretakers and perhaps guardians of the sanctuary, in addition to their tasks of dismantling and transport of the “Holy-Shrine.” This military aspect reflects an ancient concept of Israel as the “forces of Y<small>HWH</small>,” surely a conquest image, which later becomes standardized in language in the phrase usually rendered “the L<small>ORD</small> of Hosts.”", "Some of the material in this section might well have been put elsewhere. Chapters 5–7 would have fit nicely in Leviticus; Chapter 7, the listing of the tribal gifts brought to the sanctuary upon its dedication, could even have followed Ex. 40, where Moshe completes the erection of the structure. That these chapters are here therefore must be the result of a conscious decision, either to include material that did not find its way into the other books, or out of a feeling that they were appropriately placed in the book about Israel’s wanderings in the wilderness."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

In both cases, the priest plays a central role in the ceremony described, administering the test and oath to the suspected adulteress and purifying the Nazirite (Milgrom).", "Here, as in several other cases in the book of Numbers, texts that one might have expected to find in Leviticus seem to have been deferred. The reasons are not difficult to fathom. Leviticus as it has been edited deals with three broad areas: the sacrificial cult, ritual pollution and purification, and holiness in communal and priestly behavior. Chaps. 5 and 6 of Numbers do not easily fit into these categories, although some connections can be found. These chapters are also long, detailed cases, and it is possible that they might have deflected the central thrust of Leviticus.", "Having said this, Chap. 5 opens, appropriately, with concern for the purity of the sacred camp that has just been described in Chap. 2. It continues with an innovation (vv.5–10): some sins that were intentional can now apparently be expiated via confession and an <i>asham</i>-offering (cf. Lev. 5)—unlike the situation that obtains in Lev. 4–5, where it is only sins committed “in error” that are forgivable by means of the sacrificial system (with the addition of confession and restitution). This little section has been placed here perhaps because of its verbal link with the next, larger section—which addresses the issue of “breaking faith” (vv.6 and 12).", "Beginning with v.11, we encounter a strange ceremony such as is found nowhere else in the Torah. Its odd aspects are not surprising, though, given the gravity of the accusation. Adultery in ancient Israel was a capital crime, while in the rest of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia, for instance) it could sometimes be expiated through payment to the wronged husband. And significantly, it is the husband who is in total control here, and the mere “breath of suspicion” (a possible rendering of the text’s “rush of jealousy” in v.14) on his part results in a grave psychological ordeal for his wife. This is consistent with the male control over the sexuality of wives (and daughters) often observed in biblical texts (cf. Wegner 1988); there was of course no such procedure in regard to husbands. The last verse is telling; it presumes guilt on the part of the wife.", "Frymer-Kensky (1984) sees the chapter as a manual for priests, and as a ritual that addresses “a crisis in the legal system”—for the crime is not provable by human agency (Milgrom points out that the word for “adultery” does not appear at all). She views the structure of the central parts of the ritual as revolving around pairs of verbs: the priest is to have the woman “stand before the presence of Y<small>HWH</small>” (vv.16–18); “swear” (vv.19, 21); and “drink” (vv.24, 27). The combination of drink, oath-taking, and declaration of innocence is found elsewhere in the ancient Near East (Fishbane 1974).", "Fishbane (1980) notes how the chapter ends with two summaries (vv.29 and 30) relating back to the descriptions in vv.12–14. The phrase found at the end of the chapter, “This is the Instruction,” often concludes ritual sections in the Torah (cf. Lev. 11–15), and indeed is found in 6:21 below; it may indicate the former existence of these laws in separate scrolls."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

<br>Ḥizkiya said two [statements]. Ḥizkiya said: Peace is great, as in the regard of all the<i> </i>mitzvot, it is written: “If you see…if you encounter” (Exodus 23:4–5); “if…will happen” (Deuteronomy 22:6). If a mitzva happens to present itself to you, you are obligated to perform it, and if not, you are not obligated to perform it. However, here, “seek peace and pursue it” (Psalms 34:15), seek it in your place and pursue it elsewhere. <br>Ḥizkiya said another: Peace is great, as regarding all the journeys it is written: “They traveled…they encamped” (Numbers 33:5);<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both verbs are written in the plural: <i>Vayisu</i>, <i>vayaḥanu</i>.</i> they traveled in dispute and they encamped in dispute. When they all came before Mount Sinai, they all became a single encampment. That is what is written: “Israel encamped [<i>vayiḥan</i>] there” (Exodus 19:2). It is not written here “Israel encamped [<i>vayaḥanu</i>]<i> </i>there,” but rather “Israel encamped  [<i>vayiḥan</i>]<i> </i>there.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verb is singular rather than plural. </i> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘This is the moment that I am giving the Torah to My children.’ <br>Bar Kappara said three. Bar Kappara said: Great is peace, as the verses presented matters of falsehood in the Torah in order to institute peace between Abraham and Sarah. That is what is written: “After my withering, will I have youth, and my lord is old?” (Genesis 18:12). But to Abraham He did not say so, but rather: “And I have grown old” (Genesis 18:13).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When God reported Sarah’s statement to Abraham, He did not tell him that she had said that <i>he</i>  was old, but rather that she had said <i>she</i> was old. </i> <br>Bar Kappara said another: Great is peace, as the verse employed expressions of falsehood in the prophets in order to institute peace between a man and his wife, as it is stated: “Behold now, you are barren and have not given birth; but you will conceive, and you will give birth to a son” (Judges 13:3).

There was a certain woman who would stand there and listen to him teaching the lecture, and she would wait until he concluded the lecture. [Once,] she went home and found the lamps extinguished.

On the first day, He created part of the supernal and part of the earthly [realms]. That is what is written: “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). On the second, He created from the supernal [realm]. That is what is written: “Let there be a firmament” (Genesis 1:6). On the third, He created from the earthly [realm]. That is what is written: “Let the water be gathered” (Genesis 1:9). On the fourth, from the supernal [realm]: “Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens” (Genesis 1:14). On the fifth, He created from the earthly [realm]: “God said: Let the water swarm” (Genesis 1:20). On the sixth, He came to create man. He said: If I create him from the supernal, the supernal will be more numerous than the earthly by one creation. If I create him from the earthly, the earthly will be more numerous than the supernal by one creation. What did He do? He created him from the supernal and from the earthly.

She also made a golden tablet, on which the portion concerning the suspected adulteress was inscribed.<br>For Nicanor miracles happened to his doors.<br>And they were all mentioned for praise.</b><br>Since at the end of yesterday’s mishnah we learned that Ben Gamala made the lots out of gold and he was praised for it, today’s mishnah teaches other ornaments that were donated by individuals and for which they were praised.  You can think of this mishnah as an ancient dedication plaque!<br>Section one:  Ben Katin, who was also a high priest, made twelve spigots for the Temple’s laver, a fancy word for sink (see Exodus 30:18-21). The Talmud explains that this was so each of the twelve priests who were offering the tamid (see above, mishnayot 2-3) could have their own spigot.<br>Ben Katin is also credited with another improvement in the Temple, this one also connected to issue of water.  He made a wheel that went into the water cistern which would cause the water in the laver to be connected to the water in the cistern.  The reason for this is that any water left out overnight in a vessel in the Temple is rendered unfit.  Without this wheel, the water left over in the laver would need to be emptied out every morning.<br>Section two:  King Monbaz was king of Adiabene, which is north of Israel, and is now part of Turkey.  He, as well as his brother and mother, are mentioned as converts in Josephus. They ruled in the first century C.E., slightly before the destruction of the Temple.  According to the mishnah, he paid to make the handles of vessels out of gold, in cases such as a knife, where the vessel itself could not be made of gold.<br>Section three:  Monbaz’s mother, who is also mentioned in Nazir 3:6, made a golden candelabrum to stand at the entrance to the Hekhal.<br>Helene also made a golden tablet on which to write the chapter of the Sotah (Numbers 5:11 ff.)  From here the priest could copy the words when he needed to perform the sotah (suspected adulteress) ritual (see v. 23).<br>Section four:  Finally, the mishnah obliquely mentions Nikanor’s doors and the miracles that happened to them.  The Talmud (Yoma 38a) explains:  “What miracles happened to his doors? They say that when Nicanor had gone to bring doors from Alexandria of Egypt, on his return a storm arose in the sea to drown him. They took one of his doors and cast it into the sea and yet the sea would not stop its rage. They wanted to cast the other into the sea. He rose and clung to it, saying: ‘Cast me in with it!’ The sea immediately stopped its raging. He was deeply grieved about the other [door]. When he arrived at the harbor of Acco, it broke through and came up from under the sides of the boat.  Others say: A monster of the sea swallowed it and spat it out on the dry land.”", "versionTitle": "Mishnah Yomit by Dr. Joshua Kulp", "license": "CC-BY", "versionTitleInHebrew": ""}, {"_id": "5e54fbc7335e8905a12822e7", "index_title": "Gray Matter III", "category": "Halakhah", "type": "", "ref": "Gray Matter III, Estate Planning, Health Care Proxies and Living Wills 10", "anchorRef": "Numbers 5:11-31", "anchorRefExpanded": ["Numbers 5:11", "Numbers 5:12", "Numbers 5:13", "Numbers 5:14", "Numbers 5:15", "Numbers 5:16", "Numbers 5:17", "Numbers 5:18", "Numbers 5:19", "Numbers 5:20", "Numbers 5:21", "Numbers 5:22", "Numbers 5:23", "Numbers 5:24", "Numbers 5:25", "Numbers 5:26", "Numbers 5:27", "Numbers 5:28", "Numbers 5:29", "Numbers 5:30", "Numbers 5:31"], "sourceRef": "Gray Matter III, Estate Planning, Health Care Proxies and Living Wills 10", "sourceHeRef": "גריי מאטר ג, תכנון עיזבון, הנחיות רפואיות מקדימות וייפוי כוח י׳", "anchorVerse": 11, "sourceHasEn": true, "compDate": [2004, 2008], "commentaryNum": 10, "collectiveTitle": {"en": "Gray Matter III", "he": "גריי מאטר ג"}, "heTitle": "הנחיות רפואיות מקדימות וייפוי כוח", "he": "", "heVersionTitle": null, "heLicense": null, "heVersionTitleInHebrew": null, "text": "Rav Shlomo Zalman (<i>Teshuvot Minchat Shlomo</i> 1:91:24) maintains that we withhold these extreme life-saving measures if so requested by the <i>gosseis</i>.

Although <i>Shabbat</i> 23b, the source for this halachah, refers to the two items mentioned in this halachah together, there is no necessity for the Rambam to do so. On the contrary, the Rambam structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> subject by subject. Seemingly, it would have been proper for him to mention this law in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>. [Indeed, the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 263:3) mention this law in connection with the laws of the Sabbath as well.]<br>By structuring his text in this manner, however, the Rambam indicates that the priority of kindling Sabbath candles stems not from a particular law associated with the Sabbath, but rather from a general principle - the importance of peace - which relates to the entire Torah as a whole (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XV).</i> - or, alternatively, lighting a lamp for one's home or reciting <i>kiddush</i> - the lamp for one's home receives priority, since it generates peace within the home.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shabbat</i> 23b associates the Sabbath candles with peace, explaining that they prevent the members of the household from stumbling over obstacles, and also allow them to avoid the discomfort of sitting in darkness.<br>Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:1, the Rambam mentions that the Sabbath candles contribute to the atmosphere of <i>oneg Shabbat</i>, Sabbath pleasure. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:5, he mentions them as being associated with activities carried out in honor of the Sabbath (<i>k'vod Shabbat</i>). In the laws of the Sabbath itself, the Rambam does not mention the connection between the Sabbath candles and peace within the home.<br>This relates to the concept mentioned previously, that the peace generated by the Sabbath candles relates to the Torah as a whole and not to the Sabbath in particular (<i>Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.</i>).</i><br>[Peace is of primary importance, as reflected by the mitzvah requiring] God's name to be blotted out<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 6, blotting out God's name is a severe matter and constitutes a Torah prohibition.

A curse against her containing God's name is written on a scroll. The text is rubbed out in water, and the water is given to the woman to drink. If she indeed committed adultery, she will die. (See Numbers 5:11-31; <i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 3:8-10.)</i> Peace is great, for the entire Torah was given<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's choice of wording is extremely precise. The Torah does not exist for the world. On the contrary, <i>Shabbat</i> 88b relates that the Torah existed even before the world came into being. I.e., the Torah represents spiritual truths that transcend our material existence. Nevertheless, the Torah \"was given,\" drawn down into the context of our material frame of reference for a purpose,</i> to bring about peace within the world, as [Proverbs 3:17] states: \"Its ways are pleasant ways and all its paths are peace.\"<br>Blessed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This concept shares an intrinsic connection to Chanukah (and is therefore chosen as the conclusion for <i>Hilchot Chanukah</i>), because the Chanukah candles are intended for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>. They project the light of Torah into the world at large and make the world conscious of its Godly purpose. The spreading of the awareness of Godliness is associated with peace, as reflected by the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:In that era (the Era of the Redemption), there will be... neither envy nor competition.... The occupation of the entire world will be solely to know God.... \"For the world will be filled with the knowledge of God as the waters cover the ocean bed.\"May we merit the coming of that era in the immediate future.</i> be the Merciful One who grants assistance.

Although the Tzaddikim’s teachings contain Divine Names, the destruction of these teachings is of great benefit to the world, for it makes it possible for us to come closer to God. It removes God’s spirit of jealousy so that the peace between Him and the Jewish people is restored.</small><br><b>The Spirit of Holiness</b><br>You chose us from all of the nations.
