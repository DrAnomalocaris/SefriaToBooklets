## Genesis 6

|אֵ֚לֶּה תּוֹלְדֹ֣ת נֹ֔חַ נֹ֗חַ אִ֥ישׁ צַדִּ֛יק תָּמִ֥ים הָיָ֖ה בְּדֹֽרֹתָ֑יו אֶת־הָֽאֱלֹהִ֖ים הִֽתְהַלֶּךְ־נֹֽחַ׃|9 P|This is the line of Noah.—Noah was a righteous man; he was blameless in his age; Noah walked with God.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of distancing oneself from sin to serve Hashem properly, contrasting Avraham's influence on sinners with Noach's lack of influence. Halakhah discusses Torah reading customs in Israel and the rise of false prophets leading to idol worship. Jewish Thought highlights the importance of prayer over good deeds, aligning inner and outer service to God, and developing faith through intellectual analysis. Kabbalah discusses the righteousness of individuals like Noach and Avraham, while Midrash delves into interpretations of Noah's righteousness and the reasons for women dying in childbirth. Musar stresses the importance of serving God out of love, perpetuating Torah knowledge, and engaging creatively with Torah. Quoting commentary provides insights from Rashi, Sforno, Radak, and others on Noah's righteousness and leadership. Second Temple texts discuss Noah's virtues, leadership role, and pleasing God. Talmud debates Noah's physical attributes and righteousness, while Tanakh references Psalms, Leviticus, Genesis, and Deuteronomy. Targum describes Noah as a righteous man walking in the fear of God. 

|וַיּ֥וֹלֶד נֹ֖חַ שְׁלֹשָׁ֣ה בָנִ֑ים אֶת־שֵׁ֖ם אֶת־חָ֥ם וְאֶת־יָֽפֶת׃|10 P|Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The birth order of Shem, Ham, and Japheth is discussed, emphasizing Shem's superiority; Noach's sons were mentioned to highlight their righteousness and connection to Noach; the number three and the word "sons" were used to emphasize positive qualities; the names of the sons were analyzed for deeper meanings related to intelligence, sensuality, and receptiveness to beauty. R. Joshua explains the significance of the third child in the Midrash, while Bereshit Rabbah and Aggadat Bereshit discuss the protection of descendants based on the merit of the fathers. Ramban, Onkelos, Ibn Ezra, R'dak, and Or HaChaim provide interpretations of various passages related to Noah's sons and the daughters of Tzelofchod. The Targum lists Noach's three sons as Shem, Cham, and Japheth. 

|וַתִּשָּׁחֵ֥ת הָאָ֖רֶץ לִפְנֵ֣י הָֽאֱלֹהִ֑ים וַתִּמָּלֵ֥א הָאָ֖רֶץ חָמָֽס׃|11 P|The earth became corrupt before God; the earth was filled with lawlessness.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The corruption on earth led to lewdness, idolatry, violence, robbery, and oppression, affecting all levels of society and eliminating the concept of possession and ownership, making it impossible for God to suspend punishment. Justice is crucial for maintaining righteousness and avoiding oppression, as failure to uphold it led to the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile of Israel. The Midrash and Talmud provide interpretations of the corruption on earth, emphasizing idol worship, thievery, bloodshed, and forbidden sexual relations. Separating from worldly things, holding onto truth, and dispensing abundance through procreation are essential for avoiding corruption. The corruption of the earth is linked to iniquity, licentiousness, and idol worship, leading to chaos and violence. 

|וַיַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֶת־הָאָ֖רֶץ וְהִנֵּ֣ה נִשְׁחָ֑תָה כִּֽי־הִשְׁחִ֧ית כׇּל־בָּשָׂ֛ר אֶת־דַּרְכּ֖וֹ עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|12 P|When God saw how corrupt the earth was, for all flesh had corrupted its ways on earth,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes guarding the brit before travel to avoid distress, elevating prayer to unify and avoid blemishes, and shining the concept of lights into faith while avoiding promiscuity. Commentary from Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Radak, Tur HaArokh, and others highlights the sins of the generation of the flood, including idolatry and sexual immorality. Halakhah discusses the consequences of corrupting passions and improper desires, while Kabbalah emphasizes the severity of wasteful seminal emissions. Midrash recounts the destruction of the generation of the flood due to inappropriate behavior, with Noah being spared for his righteousness. Musar connects Adam's interference with grapes to the loss of holiness and the Flood, and Quoting Commentary links the corruption of all flesh to divine punishment for theft, idolatry, and sexual infidelity. Second Temple texts discuss the corruption of humanity and God's involvement in the destruction, while Talmudic teachings highlight the sins of the generation of the flood and the importance of repentance. Tanakh references Yahweh's actions in Exodus, and Targum emphasizes the corruption on earth caused by sinful ways. 

|וַיֹּ֨אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֜ים לְנֹ֗חַ קֵ֤ץ כׇּל־בָּשָׂר֙ בָּ֣א לְפָנַ֔י כִּֽי־מָלְאָ֥ה הָאָ֛רֶץ חָמָ֖ס מִפְּנֵיהֶ֑ם וְהִנְנִ֥י מַשְׁחִיתָ֖ם אֶת־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|13 P|God said to Noah, “I have decided to put an end to all flesh, for the earth is filled with lawlessness because of them: I am about to destroy them with the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noach, despite being righteous, lacked faith and failed to intercede for others before the flood. The storm wind symbolizes destruction from abuse of speech, leading to slander and evil. The flood was due to widespread violence and theft, with the generation's sins sealing their fate. The flood was a result of robbery, violence, and other sins, with educators having the right to confiscate items that interfere with learning. The Zohar discusses the symbolism of the Ark and the role of righteous individuals in atonement, while the Midrash emphasizes the importance of belief, prayer, and purity of heart. Robbing the poor or oppressing others is a severe sin deserving of death, with verbal oppression considered greater than financial oppression. The destruction of the flood was due to robbery and violence, and the whole earth was engulfed in wickedness. The generation of the flood was condemned for robbery, with different interpretations of their sins offered by various rabbis in the Talmud. Elohim tells Noah that the end of all flesh has come due to violent crime and evil deeds, leading to the destruction of mankind and the earth. 

|עֲשֵׂ֤ה לְךָ֙ תֵּבַ֣ת עֲצֵי־גֹ֔פֶר קִנִּ֖ים תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֣ה אֶת־הַתֵּבָ֑ה וְכָֽפַרְתָּ֥ אֹתָ֛הּ מִבַּ֥יִת וּמִח֖וּץ בַּכֹּֽפֶר׃|14 P|Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; make it an ark with compartments, and cover it inside and out with pitch.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the spiritual growth and humility highlighted in the construction and purpose of the ark, while Ibn Ezra explains the symbolic choices of materials used. Jewish Thought emphasizes the close cooperation and mutual love between Adam and Eve, with a focus on their bond as kindred spirits. Kabbalah discusses the generation of the flood's failure to repent and the Creator's patience, while Liturgy details the rituals of the High Priest for Yom Kippur. Midrash emphasizes the warnings given to the generation of the flood, the purpose of Noah's ark, and the importance of repentance and righteousness. Quoting Commentary delves into the significance of various terms and materials used in biblical texts, while Second Temple symbolism connects the preparation of Noah's ark to the preparation of the human body for the soul. Talmud discusses the origins of gopher wood and the use of the phrase "make for yourself," while Tanakh introduces Noah as a righteous figure and Targum details God's instructions for the construction of the ark. 

|וְזֶ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֹתָ֑הּ שְׁלֹ֧שׁ מֵא֣וֹת אַמָּ֗ה אֹ֚רֶךְ הַתֵּבָ֔ה חֲמִשִּׁ֤ים אַמָּה֙ רׇחְבָּ֔הּ וּשְׁלֹשִׁ֥ים אַמָּ֖ה קוֹמָתָֽהּ׃|15 P|This is how you shall make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The ark in Genesis 6:15 was specified as being three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high, with specific compartments and rooms, with the ability to hold large creatures due to a miracle. Noach was instructed to use combinations of the letters in G-d's name to build the ark, which could become a Holy Temple. The dimensions of the ark in the Targum were three hundred amos in length, fifty amos in width, and thirty amos in height. 

|צֹ֣הַר ׀ תַּעֲשֶׂ֣ה לַתֵּבָ֗ה וְאֶל־אַמָּה֙ תְּכַלֶּ֣נָּה מִלְמַ֔עְלָה וּפֶ֥תַח הַתֵּבָ֖ה בְּצִדָּ֣הּ תָּשִׂ֑ים תַּחְתִּיִּ֛ם שְׁנִיִּ֥ם וּשְׁלִשִׁ֖ים תַּֽעֲשֶֽׂהָ׃|16 P|Make an opening for daylight in the ark, and terminate it within a cubit of the top.  Put the entrance to the ark in its side; make it with bottom, second, and third decks.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Chasidut emphasizes illuminating words with light and intention to unite with Divinity. The Commentary discusses the construction of Noah's ark, highlighting the use of a window for light and the purpose of different compartments. Halakhah describes the three divisions of God's creation and the sustenance of humans through hard work. Jewish Thought emphasizes the importance of prayer for spiritual elevation and achievement. Kabbalah connects the letter Vav to the Sefirot and the Name HaShem. The Midrash explores Noah's ark as a tool for repentance and discusses the encounter between God and Balaam. Musar discusses man's connection to G-d and the symbolism of the human body in the ark. Quoting Commentary contrasts "tzohar" and "sohar" in relation to light abundance. Second Temple compares the ark to the human body in terms of nourishment and waste elimination. Talmud discusses the construction of the ark with precious stones and three stories. Tanakh mentions the instruction for a source of light in the ark, and Targum explains the use of a precious stone for illumination. 

|וַאֲנִ֗י הִנְנִי֩ מֵבִ֨יא אֶת־הַמַּבּ֥וּל מַ֙יִם֙ עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ לְשַׁחֵ֣ת כׇּל־בָּשָׂ֗ר אֲשֶׁר־בּוֹ֙ ר֣וּחַ חַיִּ֔ים מִתַּ֖חַת הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם כֹּ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־בָּאָ֖רֶץ יִגְוָֽע׃|17 P|“For My part, I am about to bring the Flood—waters upon the earth—to destroy all flesh under the sky in which there is breath of life; everything on earth shall perish.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the difference between words that act as a window, merely conveying light, and words that act as a precious jewel, radiating light on their own. Ramban discusses the agreement between God and the angels regarding the fate of mankind during the flood, while Ibn Ezra explores the root of the word "mabbul" and its possible meanings. The Midrash delves into various topics, including the reasons for the flood in the time of Noah and the importance of peace, while the Zohar warns to avoid exposing oneself to danger during times of potential harm. The generation of the flood rejected God, leading to the flood as punishment, as stated in the Talmud. Both Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that a flood will come to destroy all living creatures on earth, as commanded by God, as mentioned in the Targum. 

|וַהֲקִמֹתִ֥י אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֖י אִתָּ֑ךְ וּבָאתָ֙ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֔ה אַתָּ֕ה וּבָנֶ֛יךָ וְאִשְׁתְּךָ֥ וּנְשֵֽׁי־בָנֶ֖יךָ אִתָּֽךְ׃|18 P|But I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall enter the ark, with your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noach, though considered righteous, lacked faith and did not pray for his peers, leading to the destruction of humanity. The covenant with Noach ensured his family's salvation during the deluge, with marital relations prohibited in the ark. Nature reflects man's behavior, with miracles occurring when it deviates from the norm to show subservience to God. The covenant with Abraham and Isaac guarantees Israel's future, emphasizing the importance of Isaac in maintaining the covenant. The prohibition against intercourse in the ark is derived from the separate listing of husbands and wives upon entering and exiting. God's covenant with Abraham is symbolized by a smoking oven and a flaming torch passing between pieces of a sacrifice. 

|וּמִכׇּל־הָ֠חַ֠י מִֽכׇּל־בָּשָׂ֞ר שְׁנַ֧יִם מִכֹּ֛ל תָּבִ֥יא אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֖ה לְהַחֲיֹ֣ת אִתָּ֑ךְ זָכָ֥ר וּנְקֵבָ֖ה יִֽהְיֽוּ׃|19 P|And of all that lives, of all flesh, you shall take two of each into the ark to keep alive with you; they shall be male and female.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah brought every kind of living creature, including demons, into the ark in pairs to preserve their species, with the creatures entering willingly inspired by divine intervention. Abraham is seen as the founding father of the Jewish people, chosen by God to demonstrate His Providence, while Noah lacked intellectual curiosity. Average people have both merits and sins within them, as indicated by "every living thing" representing merits and "all flesh" representing sins. The Talmud discusses the disqualification of animals lacking a limb for sacrifice and emphasizes the importance of physical completeness for offerings. Two of every kind of living creature, male and female, were brought into the ark to be preserved alive. 

|מֵהָע֣וֹף לְמִינֵ֗הוּ וּמִן־הַבְּהֵמָה֙ לְמִינָ֔הּ מִכֹּ֛ל רֶ֥מֶשׂ הָֽאֲדָמָ֖ה לְמִינֵ֑הוּ שְׁנַ֧יִם מִכֹּ֛ל יָבֹ֥אוּ אֵלֶ֖יךָ לְהַֽחֲיֽוֹת׃|20 P|From birds of every kind, cattle of every kind, every kind of creeping thing on earth, two of each shall come to you to stay alive.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah did not have to hunt for the animals, as they would come to him on their own accord for the ark. The clean beasts and fowl were to be taken by Noah for sacrifices, with a commandment later given to Israel for sacrifices to be only of clean animals. The angels gathered the animals and their food for Noah, who questioned if he had the strength to collect them all. The prohibition of crossbreeding different species is derived from Genesis 6:20 and applies to the descendants of Noah, with some tanna’im believing it was a mitzva. Two of every kind of bird, animal, and creeping thing on earth were brought by an angel to Noah for preservation. 

|וְאַתָּ֣ה קַח־לְךָ֗ מִכׇּל־מַֽאֲכָל֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֵֽאָכֵ֔ל וְאָסַפְתָּ֖ אֵלֶ֑יךָ וְהָיָ֥ה לְךָ֛ וְלָהֶ֖ם לְאׇכְלָֽה׃|21 P|For your part, take of everything that is eaten and store it away, to serve as food for you and for them.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah explains why man was forbidden to eat animals until the deluge, with Noach becoming the "owner" of the animal kingdom and learning the concept of acquisition from taking animals into the ark. Noah ensured each species had the appropriate diet, including predators on a vegetarian diet, storing a variety of food for all creatures. Noah fed the animals their accustomed food, such as straw for camels and barley for donkeys, being considered righteous and wise for nurturing them. The love God has for Israel is emphasized as unconditional and eternal, not dependent on anything, with Avraham chosen not for his righteousness but for a deeper connection. Noah was instructed to gather all types of food for himself and the animals on the ark to eat. 

|וַיַּ֖עַשׂ נֹ֑חַ כְּ֠כֹ֠ל אֲשֶׁ֨ר צִוָּ֥ה אֹת֛וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים כֵּ֥ן עָשָֽׂה׃|22 P|Noah did so; just as God commanded him, so he did.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah faithfully followed all of God's instructions in building the ark and gathering food, but he failed to enter the ark before the seven days as instructed. The repetition of Noah's obedience in Genesis is compared to the Children of Israel's complete adherence to God's commandments in Exodus, highlighting the praiseworthiness of both Noah and the Israelites in aligning themselves with God's will. Noah's obedience is also emphasized in the Targum, which states that he obeyed all the commands given to him by God. 

## Genesis 7

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ לְנֹ֔חַ בֹּֽא־אַתָּ֥ה וְכׇל־בֵּיתְךָ֖ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֑ה כִּֽי־אֹתְךָ֥ רָאִ֛יתִי צַדִּ֥יק לְפָנַ֖י בַּדּ֥וֹר הַזֶּֽה׃|1 J|Then יהוה said to Noah, “Go into the ark, with all your household, for you alone have I found righteous before Me in this generation.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut commentary compares Moses' self-sacrifice to Noach's lack of response, emphasizing the importance of connecting speech to understanding. Noah was informed by God of his salvation due to his righteousness, with the Tetragrammaton indicating mercy, and his family was saved solely due to his merit. The freewill offering is favored by God, as seen in Noach's thanksgiving offering, and the various types of offerings serve different purposes and require specific regulations. In Kabbalah, God's command to Noah symbolizes the Shekhina, while in Musar, Noach's challenges highlight the importance of being a welcomed guest and obtaining consent before bringing others. Rashi explains God's separation of Aaron and Miriam from Moses, emphasizing the importance of not excessively praising individuals to their face. Rabbi Yirmeya ben Elazar suggests only part of a person's praise should be said in their presence, based on the example of Noah. 

|מִכֹּ֣ל ׀ הַבְּהֵמָ֣ה הַטְּהוֹרָ֗ה תִּֽקַּח־לְךָ֛ שִׁבְעָ֥ה שִׁבְעָ֖ה אִ֣ישׁ וְאִשְׁתּ֑וֹ וּמִן־הַבְּהֵמָ֡ה אֲ֠שֶׁ֠ר לֹ֣א טְהֹרָ֥ה הִ֛וא שְׁנַ֖יִם אִ֥ישׁ וְאִשְׁתּֽוֹ׃|2 J|Of every pure animal you shall take seven pairs, males and their mates, and of every animal that is not pure, two, a male and its mate;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators such as Sforno, Or HaChaim, Radak, and Tze'enah Ure'enah discuss Noach's selection of ritually pure animals for offerings and survival. The text explores the significance of pairs and the number seven in relation to impurity and purity, as well as the importance of observing certain days for salvation in exile. Noah and Moses are praised for diligently following God's instructions, and the Torah employs circumlocutions to avoid impure language. Noach's righteousness is contrasted with the corruption of his contemporaries, and the Gemara questions if animals can be married. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both state that Noah was instructed to take seven pairs of clean animals onto the ark. 

|גַּ֣ם מֵע֧וֹף הַשָּׁמַ֛יִם שִׁבְעָ֥ה שִׁבְעָ֖ה זָכָ֣ר וּנְקֵבָ֑ה לְחַיּ֥וֹת זֶ֖רַע עַל־פְּנֵ֥י כׇל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|3 J|of the birds of the sky also, seven pairs, male and female, to keep seed alive upon all the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak explains that animals were distributed across the globe, Siftei Chakhamim suggests the need for seven clean animals for sacrifices, Rashi refers to clean birds, and Steinsaltz mentions taking seven male and female birds to keep offspring alive. The Midrash discusses punishment for sin, Solomon's wisdom, and God's avoidance of mentioning impurity in the Torah. Ramban highlights God's mercy towards Noah, the importance of sacrifices, and the significance of the Tetragrammaton. The Midrash of Philo explores the moral implications of the numbers seven and two. The Talmud disqualifies animals with fatal wounds from being sacrifices, based on the phrase "To keep seed alive." Onkelos and Targum Jonathan specify the number of birds to be taken onto the ark. 

|כִּי֩ לְיָמִ֨ים ע֜וֹד שִׁבְעָ֗ה אָֽנֹכִי֙ מַמְטִ֣יר עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ אַרְבָּעִ֣ים י֔וֹם וְאַרְבָּעִ֖ים לָ֑יְלָה וּמָחִ֗יתִי אֶֽת־כׇּל־הַיְקוּם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשִׂ֔יתִי מֵעַ֖ל פְּנֵ֥י הָֽאֲדָמָֽה׃|4 J|For in seven days’ time I will make it rain upon the earth, forty days and forty nights, and I will blot out from the earth all existence that I created.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah entered the ark seven days before the rain fell for forty days, aligning with the sun and moon, symbolizing mourning and punishment. The number seven symbolizes completion and perfection, as seen in Aaron's isolation before assuming priestly duties. Noah did not plead for the world, leading to the flood waters being named after him. The forty days of the Flood symbolize judgment and the destruction of iniquities, with a seven-day grace period for repentance mentioned in Targum Jonathan. 

|וַיַּ֖עַשׂ נֹ֑חַ כְּכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֖הוּ יְהֹוָֽה׃|5 J|And Noah did just as יהוה commanded him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah and his family obeyed God's command by entering the ark with pairs of pure and impure beasts, gathering animals, beasts, and birds as instructed (Genesis 7:5:1-3). Ramban explains that clean animals came in pairs, with Noah adding more pairs of clean animals. The Flood lasted forty days and nights due to the violation of the Torah given in forty days. Noah followed God's commands meticulously, entering the ark on the same day the flood began (Genesis 7:5). The Midrash of Philo praises Noah for obeying all of God's commands, highlighting the relationship between God and man as one of friendship (Philo 7:5:1-6). Noah's obedience is also emphasized in the Targum and the Talmud discusses the significance of Abraham's name change. 

|וְנֹ֕חַ בֶּן־שֵׁ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וְהַמַּבּ֣וּל הָיָ֔ה מַ֖יִם עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|6 R|Noah was six hundred years old when the Flood came, waters upon the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah entered the ark at 600 years old during the flood, symbolizing punishment for mankind's sins. Various Midrashim discuss the years from Adam to the Flood, the destruction of generations by water, and the birth of Shem and Peleg. Ramban and Ibn Ezra debate whether animals or Noah's family entered the ark first, while the Talmud emphasizes wisdom over birth order in determining the eldest brother. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan both state that Noah was 600 years old at the time of the flood. 

|וַיָּ֣בֹא נֹ֗חַ וּ֠בָנָ֠יו וְאִשְׁתּ֧וֹ וּנְשֵֽׁי־בָנָ֛יו אִתּ֖וֹ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֑ה מִפְּנֵ֖י מֵ֥י הַמַּבּֽוּל׃|7 J|Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the Flood.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah was considered lacking in faith by Rashi and the sages for not praying for his peers before the flood, highlighting the distinction between righteous people who believe in God's power. Despite his humility and lack of self-righteousness, God maintained the covenant with mankind through Noah and his family. Noah entered the ark out of fear of the waters of the flood, with interpretations differing on his faith and obedience to God's commands. Noah and his sons abstained from sexual intercourse in the ark as commanded by God, similar to Job and Joseph in times of distress. Jerusalem will only be rebuilt when all exiles are gathered, as promised by God. The writer of Mesillat Yesharim composed the work to remind people of what they already know, rather than to teach them new information. Rabbeinu Bahya explains that the Israelites were forced to drink salty water because they could not drink the sweet water from the river Nile, supported by the difference between the words "מי" and "מימי". Targum Jonathan states that Noah, his sons, their wives, and his wife entered the ark to escape the Flood. 

|מִן־הַבְּהֵמָה֙ הַטְּהוֹרָ֔ה וּמִ֨ן־הַבְּהֵמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵינֶ֖נָּה טְהֹרָ֑ה וּמִ֨ן־הָע֔וֹף וְכֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־רֹמֵ֖שׂ עַל־הָֽאֲדָמָֽה׃|8 P|Of the pure animals, of the animals that are not pure, of the birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut attributes economic hardships to unworthy shochetim, while worthy ones bring blessings through Torah wisdom. The Torah uses dignified language even for impure animals, and the Patriarchs observed the Torah before it was given. The Midrash discusses euphemisms to avoid impurity and clean language, while Musar emphasizes choosing honorable phrases. The Gevia Kesef addresses questions about animals in Noah's ark, and the Second Temple text highlights the importance of order and discipline. The Talmud uses euphemisms to avoid crude matters and interprets biblical verses without explicit disparagement, and the Targum comments on the animals taken onto the ark. 

|שְׁנַ֨יִם שְׁנַ֜יִם בָּ֧אוּ אֶל־נֹ֛חַ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֖ה זָכָ֣ר וּנְקֵבָ֑ה כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֛ר צִוָּ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־נֹֽחַ׃|9 P|two of each, male and female, came to Noah into the ark, as God had commanded Noah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Chasidut, each letter of the Torah has two interpretations representing Divine Mercy and Divine Judgement, with the righteous having the power to transform Judgement into Mercy. The animals came to Noah in pairs, guided by God, with some species having seven pairs, and all were saved. The importance of pairs, the number seven, and male and female symbolism in creation is discussed in Kabbalah. Noah took five years to build the ark, brought in all living creatures as pairs, except for the chameleon that had to prove itself by changing colors. Ramban explains that clean animals were brought by Noah for sacrifices, and Targum mentions that animals came to Noah in pairs as instructed by God. 

|וַיְהִ֖י לְשִׁבְעַ֣ת הַיָּמִ֑ים וּמֵ֣י הַמַּבּ֔וּל הָי֖וּ עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|10 J|And on the seventh day the waters of the Flood came upon the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The phrase "Seven days" in Genesis 7:10:1 signifies the mourning period for Mesushelach, highlighting the obedience to God's will and divine providence leading to the flood. The Midrash and Talmud discuss various instances of mourning lasting seven days, with Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnin emphasizing the importance of visiting mourners on Shabbat to prevent enmity. The delay of seven days after Noah entered the ark allowed time for mourning and settling in of the animals before the flood. Rabbeinu Bahya and Chizkuni highlight G'd's mourning before events happen and immediate obedience to G'd's command, respectively. The Targum and Tosefta discuss the impact of the righteous and evildoers on the world, with the Tosefta emphasizing the delay in divine punishment due to the presence of the righteous. 

|בִּשְׁנַ֨ת שֵׁשׁ־מֵא֤וֹת שָׁנָה֙ לְחַיֵּי־נֹ֔חַ בַּחֹ֙דֶשׁ֙ הַשֵּׁנִ֔י בְּשִׁבְעָֽה־עָשָׂ֥ר י֖וֹם לַחֹ֑דֶשׁ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֗ה נִבְקְעוּ֙ כׇּֽל־מַעְיְנֹת֙ תְּה֣וֹם רַבָּ֔ה וַאֲרֻבֹּ֥ת הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם נִפְתָּֽחוּ׃|11 P|In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day All the fountains of the great deep burst apart, And the floodgates of the sky broke open.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the soul's longing to return to its source through Torah and service to God, with the need for physical activities to renew the soul. In Halakhah, different opinions on calculating the years in Noah's story are discussed. Jewish Thought explores the consequences of intermarriage between Shet's descendants and Adam's daughters, leading to God's regret for creating mankind. Kabbalah predicts the opening of wisdom gates in the sixth millennium, symbolizing a new era. Midrash highlights divine justice and mercy in rewarding the righteous and punishing the wicked. The Mishnah lists five judgments lasting twelve months, including the generation of the flood. Musar discusses punishments for doubt and concerns about lineage. Quoting Commentary offers various interpretations of natural phenomena during the flood. Second Temple writings emphasize moderation in divine punishment and the symbolism of the flood. Talmudic discussions on the timing and causes of the flood are mentioned. Tanakh laments Saul's shield, and Targum describes the bursting of the great deep and the opening of heaven's windows. Tosefta explains the downfall of the generation of the Flood due to their arrogance and self-sufficiency. 

|וַיְהִ֥י הַגֶּ֖שֶׁם עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ אַרְבָּעִ֣ים י֔וֹם וְאַרְבָּעִ֖ים לָֽיְלָה׃|12 J|(The rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.)|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The rain fell non-stop for 40 days, ending on the 28th day of Kislev according to Rashi, with Da'at Zekenim arguing that the first day should be included in the count. Rabbi Yosi explains that the resurrection of the dead will bring an end to all troubles on the fortieth year, as seen in the journey of Yisrael in the desert and the stopping of rain after forty days. The Midrash discusses the generations of the Flood, Enosh, and Sodom, highlighting their wicked deeds and punishments. Rashi explains that the phrase "בעצם היום הזה" indicates events happening in broad daylight, while both Targums state that rain fell on the earth for forty days and nights. 

|בְּעֶ֨צֶם הַיּ֤וֹם הַזֶּה֙ בָּ֣א נֹ֔חַ וְשֵׁם־וְחָ֥ם וָיֶ֖פֶת בְּנֵי־נֹ֑חַ וְאֵ֣שֶׁת נֹ֗חַ וּשְׁלֹ֧שֶׁת נְשֵֽׁי־בָנָ֛יו אִתָּ֖ם אֶל־הַתֵּבָֽה׃|13 P|That same day Noah and Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, went into the ark, with Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noach entered the ark on the 17th day of the second month, emphasizing his special relationship with God and challenging his generation; in various Midrashim, God ensured his plans were carried out despite potential opposition, Noah and his family entered the ark in daylight to prevent interference, and God protected the ark with lions; Ramban explains the significance of the phrase "b'etzem" in the Torah, Siftei Chakhamim clarifies the prohibition of work on the Day of Atonement, Rashi parallels Noah, Daniel, and Job's experiences with the generation of Jeconiah, Midrash BeChiddush connects Egypt's firstborn with Noah's generation, and Tze'enah Ure'enah highlights Noah entering the ark at midday in response to threats. The Targum states that Noach, his sons, and their wives entered the ark together. 

|הֵ֜מָּה וְכׇל־הַֽחַיָּ֣ה לְמִינָ֗הּ וְכׇל־הַבְּהֵמָה֙ לְמִינָ֔הּ וְכׇל־הָרֶ֛מֶשׂ הָרֹמֵ֥שׂ עַל־הָאָ֖רֶץ לְמִינֵ֑הוּ וְכׇל־הָע֣וֹף לְמִינֵ֔הוּ כֹּ֖ל צִפּ֥וֹר כׇּל־כָּנָֽף׃|14 P|they and all beasts of every kind, all cattle of every kind, all creatures of every kind that creep on the earth, and all birds of every kind, every bird, every winged thing.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah uses the term עוף to refer to any creature that could fly, with כל צפור including both ritually pure and impure birds, and כל כנף indicating every creature with wings entering the ark. Noah and his family entered the ark in broad daylight to prevent his generation from stopping him, with the wild animals and birds coming on their own accord. Ramban explains that the term "tzipor" in Leviticus refers to small birds, both permissible and forbidden, but specifically denotes those that chirp and sing. The Jerusalem Talmud Megillah discusses the rules for offerings on altars, specifying which animals and birds are permitted, emphasizing the need for them to be whole and pure, and allowing Gentiles to make such offerings. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 7:14 both list the various kinds of creatures that were brought onto Noah's ark, including beasts, animals, creeping things, flying creatures, birds, and winged creatures. 

|וַיָּבֹ֥אוּ אֶל־נֹ֖חַ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֑ה שְׁנַ֤יִם שְׁנַ֙יִם֙ מִכׇּל־הַבָּשָׂ֔ר אֲשֶׁר־בּ֖וֹ ר֥וּחַ חַיִּֽים׃|15 P|They came to Noah into the ark, two each of all flesh in which there was breath of life.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The animals gathered to Noah in pairs before the rains, symbolizing the miraculous nature of the event and Noah's role as their savior. In Jewish thought, the term "breath" is symbolized by the word "ruaḥ." The downfall of Esau at the hands of Joseph and Benjamin is discussed in the Midrash, highlighting their contrasting upbringings and deeds. Ramban explains that "all flesh" refers to all people who corrupted their ways, while Onkelos and Targum Jonathan emphasize that the animals had the breath of life when they entered the ark. 

|וְהַבָּאִ֗ים זָכָ֨ר וּנְקֵבָ֤ה מִכׇּל־בָּשָׂר֙ בָּ֔אוּ כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֛ר צִוָּ֥ה אֹת֖וֹ אֱלֹהִ֑ים וַיִּסְגֹּ֥ר יְהֹוָ֖ה בַּֽעֲדֽוֹ׃|16 J P|Thus they that entered comprised male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him. And יהוה shut him in.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah brought male and female animals to the ark as commanded by God, who protected the ark during the flood and closed it to prevent water from entering. Animals attacked evildoers trying to overturn the ark, and all animals and birds died before people during the flood. The creation story, Adam and Eve, Noah and the flood, and the tower of Babel are discussed in the liturgy. The Midrash emphasizes God's ability to create, carry, bear, and rescue His creations, highlighting the significance of circumcision and the relationship between God and Abraham. The Talmud mentions that only pure animals approached Noah to enter the ark, and the Targum texts state that male and female creatures entered the ark as commanded by the Lord, who protected Noah by shutting him in. 

|וַֽיְהִ֧י הַמַּבּ֛וּל אַרְבָּעִ֥ים י֖וֹם עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ וַיִּרְבּ֣וּ הַמַּ֗יִם וַיִּשְׂאוּ֙ אֶת־הַתֵּבָ֔ה וַתָּ֖רׇם מֵעַ֥ל הָאָֽרֶץ׃|17 J|The Flood continued forty days on the earth, and the waters increased and raised the ark so that it rose above the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The flood lasted for 40 days, with the ark starting to rise after continuous rain and manifestations of the flood due to the force of subterranean geysers lifting it. The blessing oseh ma'aseh bereshit highlights the interconnectedness of miracles and nature, with nature being the greatest miracle. The word "ram" signifies elevation in space and dignity, as seen in the lifting of the ark and exaltation in power. In Tikkunei Zohar 54a:14, the lifting up and descending of the ark symbolize the filling of merits and transition from light to heavy. In Bereshit Rabbah 32:9 and Aggadat Bereshit 4:3, Noah's ark is described as partially submerged before floating and the generation of the Flood as crueler than the floodwaters. Sanctifying the body through Torah study and reciting the Shema with concentration imparts sanctity to each limb, but the human soul must be of good quality for this to have an effect. Both Targums mention a flood lasting 40 days, with the waters lifting the ark high above the earth. 

|וַיִּגְבְּר֥וּ הַמַּ֛יִם וַיִּרְבּ֥וּ מְאֹ֖ד עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ וַתֵּ֥לֶךְ הַתֵּבָ֖ה עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הַמָּֽיִם׃|18 J|The waters swelled and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark drifted upon the waters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary discusses the overwhelming power of the waters during the flood, driving the ark in different directions due to the pressure of external waters. The Tikkunei Zohar 55a:9 discusses five types of beings that overpower Israel in exile, associated with the four exiles, which will ultimately be stopped by the blessed Holy One. Rabbi Pinhas explains that Noah's ark was partially submerged in the water until it touched the ground, then lifted by the increasing water to float on the surface. Both Targums describe the flood waters causing the ark to float on the surface. 

|וְהַמַּ֗יִם גָּ֥בְר֛וּ מְאֹ֥ד מְאֹ֖ד עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ וַיְכֻסּ֗וּ כׇּל־הֶֽהָרִים֙ הַגְּבֹהִ֔ים אֲשֶׁר־תַּ֖חַת כׇּל־הַשָּׁמָֽיִם׃|19 J|When the waters had swelled much more upon the earth, all the highest mountains everywhere under the sky were covered.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The floodwaters exceeded the mountains by fifteen cubits, driving the ark far from its original location, symbolizing the power and turbulence of the waters. The Tikkunei Zohar emphasizes the importance of circumcision and the covenant, highlighting the negative consequences of interrupting the flow of the Shekhinah. The Midrash discusses the significance of the Temple and the High Priest's vestments in atoning for various sins, while Or HaChaim explains the symbolism of 'male waters' and seeds germinating from the ocean. The floodwaters rising fifteen cubits above the highest mountains symbolize the senses in the body occupying the head region. 

|חֲמֵ֨שׁ עֶשְׂרֵ֤ה אַמָּה֙ מִלְמַ֔עְלָה גָּבְר֖וּ הַמָּ֑יִם וַיְכֻסּ֖וּ הֶהָרִֽים׃|20 J|Fifteen cubits higher did the waters swell, as the mountains were covered.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The floodwaters in the story of Noah's Ark initially rose as high as the mountains, then an additional fifteen cubits above them, symbolizing the senses in the human body according to the Midrash and Targum. The Talmud questions how the Ark could travel over water at different levels, concluding that the water became level with the mountains before rising fifteen cubits above them. 

|וַיִּגְוַ֞ע כׇּל־בָּשָׂ֣ר ׀ הָרֹמֵ֣שׂ עַל־הָאָ֗רֶץ בָּע֤וֹף וּבַבְּהֵמָה֙ וּבַ֣חַיָּ֔ה וּבְכׇל־הַשֶּׁ֖רֶץ הַשֹּׁרֵ֣ץ עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ וְכֹ֖ל הָאָדָֽם׃|21 P|And all flesh that stirred on earth perished—birds, cattle, beasts, and all the things that swarmed upon the earth, and all humankind.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The flood was a punishment for societal rules not being followed, with all flesh perishing, including intelligent man. The plagues in Egypt had unique orders and locations, affecting different realms. Repentance on the Day of Atonement is accepted for those who are not completely wicked. In the flood, fire was sent upon the wicked, while the righteous Noah was saved by God's compassion. The word "שרץ" in Genesis 1:20:2 describes moving creatures, and the term "רמש" relates to trampling the earth. The phrase "all flesh capable of motion perished" in Genesis 7:21 signifies the destruction of souls due to indulgence in pleasures. Ishmael repented in Abraham's lifetime, and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 7:21 states that all living creatures perished in the flood. 

|כֹּ֡ל אֲשֶׁר֩ נִשְׁמַת־ר֨וּחַ חַיִּ֜ים בְּאַפָּ֗יו מִכֹּ֛ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר בֶּחָֽרָבָ֖ה מֵֽתוּ׃|22 J|All in whose nostrils was the merest breath of life, all that was on dry land, died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that names for prophets, angels, and souls are based on functions, not essence, and stresses the importance of intention in prayer. Commentary discusses the fate of land animals and fish during the flood, Halakhah dictates actions in cases of uncertain life, Jewish Thought emphasizes human effort in becoming complete, Kabbalah explains why those with a holy Neshamah died in the flood, Midrash delves into creation of man and fate of fish, Mishnah addresses clearing debris to rescue on Shabbat, Quoting Commentary discusses the creation of man and significance of the nose, Second Temple discusses the soul without wisdom, Talmud debates interpretations of Genesis 7:22 and impact of the flood, and Targum states that all living creatures on dry land perished in the flood. 

|וַיִּ֜מַח אֶֽת־כׇּל־הַיְק֣וּם ׀ אֲשֶׁ֣ר ׀ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י הָֽאֲדָמָ֗ה מֵאָדָ֤ם עַד־בְּהֵמָה֙ עַד־רֶ֙מֶשׂ֙ וְעַד־ע֣וֹף הַשָּׁמַ֔יִם וַיִּמָּח֖וּ מִן־הָאָ֑רֶץ וַיִּשָּׁ֧אֶר אַךְ־נֹ֛חַ וַֽאֲשֶׁ֥ר אִתּ֖וֹ בַּתֵּבָֽה׃|23 J|All existence on earth was blotted out—humans, cattle, creeping things, and birds of the sky; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators, including Ramban, Ibn Ezra, Sforno, Radak, and Rashi, interpret the text to convey that all living beings were obliterated by the flood, leaving only Noah and those with him in the ark. Albo suggests that post-flood, eating animals was permitted to demonstrate man's superiority over animals. The Kabbalistic text discusses the departure of the Shechinah, the resurrection of the dead in Yisrael, and the fate of the Generation of the Flood. The Selichot prayers mention the heavenly Palace during the flood, and the Midrash contrasts Noah's righteousness with the wickedness of the flood generation. The Talmud debates the punishment of the flood generation and the destruction of the animal kingdom. God's forgiveness over justice is highlighted in the Tanakh, and the Targums describe the obliteration of all beings on earth except for Noah and his companions. The Tosefta discusses the burial of Moses's bones and divine retribution for transgressions. 

|וַיִּגְבְּר֥וּ הַמַּ֖יִם עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים וּמְאַ֖ת יֽוֹם׃|24 P|And when the waters had swelled on the earth one hundred and fifty days,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The flood waters rose for 150 days after 40 days of rain, with the ark coming to rest on Mount Ararat on the 17th of the seventh month. Noach used instruments to measure time inside the ark, with the waters beginning to recede after 150 days, and the earth drying up after a total of 57 days, allowing Noach to exit the ark. Despite challenges, all creatures survived highlighting God's providence. Rashi and Ramban disagree on the interpretation of the depth of the water and the timing of events during the flood, with Ramban suggesting the hundred and fifty days include the forty days of rain and the ark resting on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan also state that the waters covered the earth for 150 days. 

## Genesis 8

|וַיִּזְכֹּ֤ר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת־נֹ֔חַ וְאֵ֤ת כׇּל־הַֽחַיָּה֙ וְאֶת־כׇּל־הַבְּהֵמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אִתּ֖וֹ בַּתֵּבָ֑ה וַיַּעֲבֵ֨ר אֱלֹהִ֥ים ר֙וּחַ֙ עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ וַיָּשֹׁ֖כּוּ הַמָּֽיִם׃|1 P|God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the cattle that were with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to blow across the earth, and the waters subsided.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses various prohibitions regarding sexual relationships, emphasizes the importance of memory in fulfilling mitzvot, and highlights the symbolic significance of garments in relation to moral character. On Rosh Hashanah, prayers focus on God's remembrance of Noah and his deliverance from the flood, highlighting divine memory's role in judging all beings' deeds. Rabbi Tanḥuma decreed a fast for rain, but rain fell after a man showed compassion by giving charity to his divorced wife. In the Talmud, Rabbi Eliezer and Rav Ḥisda agree that the generation of the flood sinned with forbidden sexual relations, leading to their punishment with scalding hot waters. 

|וַיִּסָּֽכְרוּ֙ מַעְיְנֹ֣ת תְּה֔וֹם וַֽאֲרֻבֹּ֖ת הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם וַיִּכָּלֵ֥א הַגֶּ֖שֶׁם מִן־הַשָּׁמָֽיִם׃|2 J P|The fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the sky were stopped up, and the rain from the sky was held back;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 8:2, the rain and wellsprings of the deep were stopped, with some left open for healing purposes like the hot springs of Tiberias, while the Torah mentions the gradual drying out of the earth due to the wind blowing and the closure of the windows of the heavens to prevent further water inundation from above or below. The Divine Presence moved after the Temple's destruction, leading to debates on its location, and Moses showed compassion for his flocks, leading to his role as a shepherd of Israel. Moses asked to die when the people sinned with the golden calf, showing compassion for all, and the Lord tests the righteous through shepherding. Rashbam, Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Ramban, and Bartenura reference Genesis 8:2 in various interpretations of other Biblical verses, connecting it to the stopping of rain and wellsprings. The Midrash of Philo and Targum Jonathan also discuss the closing of wellsprings of the deep and the windows of the heavens in Genesis 8:2. 

|וַיָּשֻׁ֧בוּ הַמַּ֛יִם מֵעַ֥ל הָאָ֖רֶץ הָל֣וֹךְ וָשׁ֑וֹב וַיַּחְסְר֣וּ הַמַּ֔יִם מִקְצֵ֕ה חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים וּמְאַ֖ת יֽוֹם׃|3 J P|the waters then receded steadily from the earth. At the end of one hundred and fifty days the waters diminished,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah prophetically knew it took 150 days for the waters to recede, with various interpretations on the timing of events. Different opinions exist on whether Noah followed a lunar or solar calendar, but it is not relevant to Jewish law. Judah the Persian believed the years in Noah's story were solar years, while Rabbi Saadia Gaon set Tishre as the beginning of Noah's years. In Midrash, it is mentioned that the Flood lasted twelve months, with the earth drying out after twelve months and eleven days. The text in the Second Temple discusses the closing of the fountains of the deep and the cataracts of heaven after the flood, symbolizing the need to eliminate sources of problems to prevent future overflow. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that the waters receded from the earth continually, diminishing after one hundred and fifty days. 

|וַתָּ֤נַח הַתֵּבָה֙ בַּחֹ֣דֶשׁ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔י בְּשִׁבְעָה־עָשָׂ֥ר י֖וֹם לַחֹ֑דֶשׁ עַ֖ל הָרֵ֥י אֲרָרָֽט׃|4 P|so that in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators, including Rashi and Midrash, provide interpretations of the timing and events surrounding the resting of the ark on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. Kabbalah relates the event to Netzah and Tishrei, while the Second Temple commentary discusses the significance of the seventh month and the twenty-seventh day. The Talmud questions the logistics of the flood, and Tanakh details the sacrifices made during the festival. Targum identifies the mountains of Ararat as Kardu and Armenia. 

|וְהַמַּ֗יִם הָיוּ֙ הָל֣וֹךְ וְחָס֔וֹר עַ֖ד הַחֹ֣דֶשׁ הָֽעֲשִׂירִ֑י בָּֽעֲשִׂירִי֙ בְּאֶחָ֣ד לַחֹ֔דֶשׁ נִרְא֖וּ רָאשֵׁ֥י הֶֽהָרִֽים׃|5 P|The waters went on diminishing until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first of the month, the tops of the mountains became visible.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The waters receded over seventy-three days until the mountain tops were visible in the tenth month, with the ark eventually settling on Mount Ararat. Circumcision is connected to Malkhut in Kabbalah and symbolizes the covenant with God. Rashi explains that the construction of the Temple began in the second month of the fourth year of Solomon's reign. Noah waited forty days before opening the window of the ark after the rain stopped, and the mountaintops became visible in the month of Tammuz in the Targum. 

|וַיְהִ֕י מִקֵּ֖ץ אַרְבָּעִ֣ים י֑וֹם וַיִּפְתַּ֣ח נֹ֔חַ אֶת־חַלּ֥וֹן הַתֵּבָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָֽׂה׃|6 J|At the end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noach opened the window of the ark after forty days to check if the waters had receded, with the floodwaters lasting a total of a year. The significance of the number forty is discussed in Kabbalistic texts in relation to various events, while the Midrash details the timeline of the Flood and Noah's actions. Rabbi Eliezer compares failure to fulfill the commandment of being fruitful and multiplying to murder, and Rashi explains the timing of the "tenth month" mentioned in Genesis 8:5. The Second Temple commentary highlights the pattern of increase and decrease in the floodwaters, and the Targum also mentions Noach opening the window after forty days. 

|וַיְשַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־הָֽעֹרֵ֑ב וַיֵּצֵ֤א יָצוֹא֙ וָשׁ֔וֹב עַד־יְבֹ֥שֶׁת הַמַּ֖יִם מֵעַ֥ל הָאָֽרֶץ׃|7 P|and sent out the raven; it went to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that the raven symbolizes anger, which Noach tried to rid the world of, but God showed it is necessary for self-defense against evil desires. Commentary adds that the raven's behavior indicated the waters had not yet eased, prompting Noach to send out a dove instead. Midrash compares Israel to a dove, symbolizing their role in bringing light before God. Quoting Commentary mentions the raven accusing Noach of having designs on its mate, leading to a conversation where Noach defended himself. Second Temple symbolism explains the raven was sent out first to expel wickedness, darkness, and arrogance. Talmud discusses the raven's reluctance to leave the ark due to fear of harm and mating purposes. Tanakh lists ravens as unclean animals. Targum commentary states the raven flew back and forth until the waters dried up. 

|וַיְשַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־הַיּוֹנָ֖ה מֵאִתּ֑וֹ לִרְאוֹת֙ הֲקַ֣לּוּ הַמַּ֔יִם מֵעַ֖ל פְּנֵ֥י הָֽאֲדָמָֽה׃|8 J|Then he sent out the dove to see whether the waters had decreased from the surface of the ground.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sending of the dove by Noah symbolizes checking for the abatement of the waters and the importance of working for sustenance, while the raven was not sent on a specific errand. The dove is associated with virtue and goodness, contrasting with the raven's representation of wickedness. Rabbi Yirmeya explains that kosher birds were kept with the righteous in the ark, as indicated by Noah sending the dove from his place. 

|וְלֹֽא־מָצְאָה֩ הַיּוֹנָ֨ה מָנ֜וֹחַ לְכַף־רַגְלָ֗הּ וַתָּ֤שׇׁב אֵלָיו֙ אֶל־הַתֵּבָ֔ה כִּי־מַ֖יִם עַל־פְּנֵ֣י כׇל־הָאָ֑רֶץ וַיִּשְׁלַ֤ח יָדוֹ֙ וַיִּקָּחֶ֔הָ וַיָּבֵ֥א אֹתָ֛הּ אֵלָ֖יו אֶל־הַתֵּבָֽה׃|9 J|But the dove could not find a resting place for its foot, and returned to him to the ark, for there was water over all the earth. So putting out his hand, he took it into the ark with him.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries and interpretations discuss the concept of the soul, represented by a dove, struggling to find rest and fulfillment in a world filled with challenges and sin. The significance of the dove returning to Noah, the struggle of maintaining virtue in a corrupt world, and the symbolism of the Sabbath as a day of rest and sanctification are explored. Additionally, the connection between the soul's journey, the Shekhinah in exile, and the need to maintain holiness to prevent negative influences is emphasized. 

|וַיָּ֣חֶל ע֔וֹד שִׁבְעַ֥ת יָמִ֖ים אֲחֵרִ֑ים וַיֹּ֛סֶף שַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־הַיּוֹנָ֖ה מִן־הַתֵּבָֽה׃|10 J|He waited another seven days, and again sent out the dove from the ark.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra suggests "va-yachel" is derived from "techillah," Radak explains it comes from "chol," Rav Hirsch proposes it means waiting, Steinsaltz mentions Noah waited seven days before sending the dove. The wisdom of expression in Jewish thought encompasses general principles, birds in Torah portions are linked to meanings of words, language complexity and human understanding are discussed. In Kabbalah, the dove's return symbolizes pressure and pain, wandering represents Israel's transgression. Midrash explains the dove's actions symbolize Jewish exile, the value of working for sustenance, and the receding waters. Various commentaries discuss waiting in different contexts, while the Second Temple Midrash discusses the significance of sending the dove out a second time after waiting seven days. Targum translations mention Noah waiting seven days before sending the dove out of the ark. 

|וַתָּבֹ֨א אֵלָ֤יו הַיּוֹנָה֙ לְעֵ֣ת עֶ֔רֶב וְהִנֵּ֥ה עֲלֵה־זַ֖יִת טָרָ֣ף בְּפִ֑יהָ וַיֵּ֣דַע נֹ֔חַ כִּי־קַ֥לּוּ הַמַּ֖יִם מֵעַ֥ל הָאָֽרֶץ׃|11 J|The dove came back to him toward evening, and there in its bill was a plucked-off olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the waters had decreased on the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban disputes Rashi's interpretation of the dove and olive leaf, emphasizing the importance of self-sufficiency and reliance on God rather than man. The Talmud discusses the olive leaf symbolizing a preference for sustenance from God over mortals, while Kabbalistic texts connect the olive leaf with various holidays and the hand of God. Midrashic sources discuss the bitterness of the olive leaf and the dove's return as a sign of atonement for the nations. Second Temple texts see the olive leaf as symbolizing repentance and the dissemination of wisdom, while Talmudic interpretations focus on the dove's choice as a request for sustenance from God. The Targum highlights the olive leaf as a sign of the waters subsiding. 

|וַיִּיָּ֣חֶל ע֔וֹד שִׁבְעַ֥ת יָמִ֖ים אֲחֵרִ֑ים וַיְשַׁלַּח֙ אֶת־הַיּוֹנָ֔ה וְלֹֽא־יָסְפָ֥ה שׁוּב־אֵלָ֖יו עֽוֹד׃|12 J|He waited still another seven days and sent the dove forth; and it did not return to him any more.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

In Genesis 8:12, the word "va-yiyyachel" is interpreted differently by various commentators, with Rashi explaining it as "he stayed" and Steinsaltz mentioning the dove finding rest after seven days. The Flood lasted twelve months, with the dove bringing back an olive leaf to indicate the waters had abated. In Psalms 55:7, the speaker expresses a desire to fly away like a dove for rest. The dove in the Second Temple period represents virtue and wisdom. Noah sent out the dove again after waiting seven days, and it did not return. 

|וַ֠יְהִ֠י בְּאַחַ֨ת וְשֵׁשׁ־מֵא֜וֹת שָׁנָ֗ה בָּֽרִאשׁוֹן֙ בְּאֶחָ֣ד לַחֹ֔דֶשׁ חָֽרְב֥וּ הַמַּ֖יִם מֵעַ֣ל הָאָ֑רֶץ וַיָּ֤סַר נֹ֙חַ֙ אֶת־מִכְסֵ֣ה הַתֵּבָ֔ה וַיַּ֕רְא וְהִנֵּ֥ה חָֽרְב֖וּ פְּנֵ֥י הָֽאֲדָמָֽה׃|13 J P|In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the waters began to dry from the earth; and when Noah removed the covering of the ark, he saw that the surface of the ground was drying.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The floodwaters receded after twelve months, with the ark coming to rest on the mountains of Ararat in the seventh month. Different interpretations exist regarding the calendar system used by Noah, with debates over the significance of the first month and day in the 601st year of Noah's life. The Talmud discusses the complexities of determining the start of a year in Jewish tradition, with conflicting views on when a year begins based on biblical references. The Tabernacle was set up in the first month of the second year on the first day of the month, as mentioned in Exodus 40:17. 

|וּבַחֹ֙דֶשׁ֙ הַשֵּׁנִ֔י בְּשִׁבְעָ֧ה וְעֶשְׂרִ֛ים י֖וֹם לַחֹ֑דֶשׁ יָבְשָׁ֖ה הָאָֽרֶץ׃|14 P|And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Flood lasted exactly one solar year, with the earth drying up on the twenty-seventh day of the second month, representing the 10-day difference between solar and lunar years. Noah waited for God's command to leave the Ark, similar to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah in the furnace. The earth's drying process was delayed due to cursed water in the soil. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri states that five judgments last twelve months each, including the generation of the flood. The deluge began and ended in the seventh month, symbolizing renewal and divine intervention. Moses parts the sea in Exodus with God's help, creating dry ground for the Israelites. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the earth drying completely on the twenty-seventh day of the second month after the flood. The Tosefta explains that the formal counting of months begins with Nisan in Exodus. 

|וַיְדַבֵּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־נֹ֥חַ לֵאמֹֽר׃|15 P|God spoke to Noah, saying,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah waited for a divine command to exit the ark, feeling desolate and fearful upon leaving but God addressed his concerns, promising procreation, dominance over animals, permission to eat animals, and a prohibition against murder. Midrash discusses unique interactions with Moses, Adam, Noah, and Abraham, the importance of prayer, repentance, and good works, and parallels to obedience. Musar explains the lack of shame in God speaking to Noach, who embodied faith and spiritual values. The Second Temple commentary emphasizes Noah leaving the ark only when commanded, while the Talmud discusses new commandments introduced with the term "dibbur" and scholars seeking refuge in cities of refuge. Targum mentions Elohim speaking to Noah. 

|צֵ֖א מִן־הַתֵּבָ֑ה אַתָּ֕ה וְאִשְׁתְּךָ֛ וּבָנֶ֥יךָ וּנְשֵֽׁי־בָנֶ֖יךָ אִתָּֽךְ׃|16 P|“Come out of the ark, together with your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

After leaving the ark, Noach and his wife resumed normal relations, with Noach being blessed to be fruitful and multiply in the earth. Noah's obedience and patience in waiting for permission to leave the ark are highlighted as examples to follow, emphasizing the importance of following God's commands. Noah did not engage in sexual intercourse while in the ark, and only three beings, including Ham and a dog, did so. Noah waited for God's command to exit the ark, demonstrating his obedience to God's instructions, as stated in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 108b:14). 

|כׇּל־הַחַיָּ֨ה אֲשֶֽׁר־אִתְּךָ֜ מִכׇּל־בָּשָׂ֗ר בָּע֧וֹף וּבַבְּהֵמָ֛ה וּבְכׇל־הָרֶ֛מֶשׂ הָרֹמֵ֥שׂ עַל־הָאָ֖רֶץ אִתָּ֑ךְ וְשָֽׁרְצ֣וּ בָאָ֔רֶץ וּפָר֥וּ וְרָב֖וּ עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|17 P|Bring out with you every living thing of all flesh that is with you: birds, animals, and everything that creeps on earth; and let them swarm on the earth and be fertile and increase on earth.”|

Ibn Ezra, Radak, Siftei Chakhamim, Rav Hirsch, Rashi, Steinsaltz, Chizkuni, and Ramban provide various interpretations of specific terms and phrases in the Bible, such as the conjugation of "haytze," the meaning of "kol hachaya," the sequence of "sharatzu, peru, ravu," the difference between "haytze" and "hotzei," and the term "sheretz." The Midrash explains the commandments given to Noah and his descendants, including prohibitions against idol worship, sexual immorality, bloodshed, and other practices. The Talmud discusses words in the Hebrew Bible spelled with a waw but read with a yod, while the Targum emphasizes the command for all living creatures to leave the ark and multiply. 

|וַיֵּ֖צֵא־נֹ֑חַ וּבָנָ֛יו וְאִשְׁתּ֥וֹ וּנְשֵֽׁי־בָנָ֖יו אִתּֽוֹ׃|18 P|So Noah came out, together with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The separation of males and females upon exiting the ark may indicate fear and reassurance, with Noah initially hesitant to have children but later reassured by God. The Torah's mention of males exiting in a group may allude to prohibited sexual relations during their time in the ark. The Midrash discusses the relationship between the order of conception and the gender of the child, the protection of infants in the womb, Noah's obedience to God's commands, and the commandments given to the descendants of Noah. The Second Temple commentary highlights the interruption and continuation of the process of generation symbolized by Noah and his family entering and exiting the ark. The Targum states that Noah, along with his family, left the ark. 

|כׇּל־הַֽחַיָּ֗ה כׇּל־הָרֶ֙מֶשׂ֙ וְכׇל־הָע֔וֹף כֹּ֖ל רוֹמֵ֣שׂ עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ לְמִשְׁפְּחֹ֣תֵיהֶ֔ם יָצְא֖וּ מִן־הַתֵּבָֽה׃|19 P|Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that stirs on earth came out of the ark by families.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators provide interpretations of Genesis 8:19, including Ibn Ezra suggesting animals did not breed in the ark, Radak including both domesticated and free-roaming animals, Tur HaArokh stating only reproducing animals left the ark, Siftei Chakhamim explaining animals mated within their own species, Rashi noting animals kept to their own species, and Da'at Zekenim suggesting animals rewarded for mating only with their own species continued to do so after leaving the ark. The purpose of God's tests in Scripture is to teach and guide man, not to test his love, as seen in the sacrifice of Isaac. The Midrash discusses the righteous nature of the animals in the ark, while the Talmud explains that the animals that emerged were descendants of those that entered, with Shem and his father caring for them. The Flood narrative in Genesis emphasizes themes of God's justice, punishment, and new beginnings, contrasting with Mesopotamian flood accounts. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan interpret Genesis 8:19 as describing how all living creatures left the ark in groups according to their families or seeds. 

|וַיִּ֥בֶן נֹ֛חַ מִזְבֵּ֖חַ לַֽיהֹוָ֑ה וַיִּקַּ֞ח מִכֹּ֣ל ׀ הַבְּהֵמָ֣ה הַטְּהֹרָ֗ה וּמִכֹּל֙ הָע֣וֹף הַטָּה֔וֹר וַיַּ֥עַל עֹלֹ֖ת בַּמִּזְבֵּֽחַ׃|20 J|Then Noah built an altar to יהוה and, taking of every pure animal and of every pure bird, he offered burnt offerings on the altar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah built an altar and offered burnt sacrifices of clean animals as a thanksgiving for his deliverance, symbolizing an elevation of the spirit towards God [Commentary]. The Mishneh Torah states that sacrifices must be brought to the top of an altar constructed outside the Temple Courtyard [Halakhah]. Noah offered burnt offerings on the altar to remove the curse from the ground, and God promised never to curse the ground because of man [Kabbalah]. The Midrash discusses the righteousness of biblical figures like Noah and explores the significance of offerings and their symbolic meanings [Midrash]. The Talmud discusses the types of animals sacrificed before the Tabernacle was constructed, based on Noah's sacrifices, and the prohibition of sacrificing animals lacking limbs [Talmud]. Noah built an altar to God, offering whole burnt offerings of clean animals as a display of gratitude for the renewal of mankind after the flood [Second Temple]. Noah's altar was a rebuilt version of the original altar built by Adam in the garden of Eden, and the Lord accepted his offerings with favor [Targum]. 

|וַיָּ֣רַח יְהֹוָה֮ אֶת־רֵ֣יחַ הַנִּיחֹ֒חַ֒ וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־לִבּ֗וֹ לֹֽא־אֹ֠סִ֠ף לְקַלֵּ֨ל ע֤וֹד אֶת־הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ בַּעֲב֣וּר הָֽאָדָ֔ם כִּ֠י יֵ֣צֶר לֵ֧ב הָאָדָ֛ם רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו וְלֹֽא־אֹסִ֥ף ע֛וֹד לְהַכּ֥וֹת אֶת־כׇּל־חַ֖י כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשִֽׂיתִי׃|21 J|יהוה smelled the pleasing odor, and יהוה resolved: “Never again will I doom the earth because of humankind, since the devisings of the human mind are evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living being, as I have done. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut discusses Noach's positive actions towards God and the attribute of mercy in creation, while Halakhah explains the purpose of placing bread and incense before God. Jewish Thought emphasizes the preference for freewill offerings and the senses attributed to God, while Kabbalah explores the consequences of sin and the use of metaphor. Midrash discusses reasons for leprosy and examples from biblical stories, and Musar highlights the importance of abstaining from lashon hara and repentance. Quoting Commentary focuses on sacrifices made by various figures, and Second Temple discusses God's decision not to destroy all living flesh. Talmud describes the evil inclination and its power, while Tanakh and Targum mention offerings and God's response to them. 

|עֹ֖ד כׇּל־יְמֵ֣י הָאָ֑רֶץ זֶ֡רַע וְ֠קָצִ֠יר וְקֹ֨ר וָחֹ֜ם וְקַ֧יִץ וָחֹ֛רֶף וְי֥וֹם וָלַ֖יְלָה לֹ֥א יִשְׁבֹּֽתוּ׃|22 J|So long as the earth endures, Seedtime and harvest, Cold and heat, Summer and winter, Day and night Shall not cease.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the incomprehensibility of God's Essence and Being, while the Commentary discusses the division of the year into seasons and the covenant with mankind. Halakhah delves into the interpretation of verses related to Sabbath observance, and Jewish Thought explores the Eternity of the Universe and the significance of miracles. Kabbalah focuses on the four directions in Genesis, while Midrash discusses the settlement of Noah's descendants and the importance of observing the Sabbath. Quoting Commentary touches on sacrifices and the covenant with Noah, and Second Temple emphasizes the unchanging nature of seasons. In the Talmud, the liability of a gentile observing Shabbat is discussed, and Targum emphasizes the continuity of cycles on earth. 

## Genesis 9

|וַיְבָ֣רֶךְ אֱלֹהִ֔ים אֶת־נֹ֖חַ וְאֶת־בָּנָ֑יו וַיֹּ֧אמֶר לָהֶ֛ם פְּר֥וּ וּרְב֖וּ וּמִלְא֥וּ אֶת־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|1 P|God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fertile and increase, and fill the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

After the flood, God blessed Noah and his sons with fertility and multiplication, emphasizing the importance of procreation as a central mitzva in the Torah, with promises of descendants and blessings for those who obey God. The blessing of being fruitful and multiplying is reiterated throughout the Torah and emphasizes the power and nature of humanity, with the commandment to increase, multiply, and replenish the earth being given to Noah and his sons as a way to establish a true relationship with God and maintain the Jewish nation. 

|וּמוֹרַאֲכֶ֤ם וְחִתְּכֶם֙ יִֽהְיֶ֔ה עַ֚ל כׇּל־חַיַּ֣ת הָאָ֔רֶץ וְעַ֖ל כׇּל־ע֣וֹף הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם בְּכֹל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר תִּרְמֹ֧שׂ הָֽאֲדָמָ֛ה וּֽבְכׇל־דְּגֵ֥י הַיָּ֖ם בְּיֶדְכֶ֥ם נִתָּֽנוּ׃|2 P|The fear and the dread of you shall be upon all the beasts of the earth and upon all the birds of the sky—everything with which the earth is astir—and upon all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hand.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights how anger can dehumanize a person, making them appear animal-like and removing the fear they instill in others due to the image of God. Halakhah emphasizes man's dominion over animals for his benefit, supported by biblical verses and Rambam's view. Jewish Thought discusses man's superiority over animals, the impact of human behavior on nature, and the importance of humility and obedience in Divine guidance. Kabbalah connects showing compassion to the poor with retaining the image of Adam and having dominion over all creatures. Midrash discusses various themes, including the formation of a fetus, the rulership of Adam over the earth, and the connection of leprosy to Adam and Eve. Quoting Commentary presents different interpretations of biblical verses related to man's dominion over animals, the permission to eat meat, and the fear animals have for humans. Finally, Talmud and Targum highlight the fear animals have for the living, emphasizing man's dominion over all creatures on earth. 

|כׇּל־רֶ֙מֶשׂ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הוּא־חַ֔י לָכֶ֥ם יִהְיֶ֖ה לְאׇכְלָ֑ה כְּיֶ֣רֶק עֵ֔שֶׂב נָתַ֥תִּי לָכֶ֖ם אֶת־כֹּֽל׃|3 P|Every creature that lives shall be yours to eat; as with the green grasses, I give you all these.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the permission for humans to eat all living creatures, including meat, after the flood, with various commentators attributing this change to Noach's care for animals during the deluge and shifts in human needs and conditions. The concept of Shechitah, the Jewish method of slaughter, is considered humane and painless, reflecting changes in human biology and dietary needs rather than moral concerns for animal welfare. The Midrash texts touch on the permission to eat certain animals, the distinction between ritually pure and impure animals, and the consequences of disobedience to God's commands. The Talmud discusses the prohibition of robbery, permissions and prohibitions related to eating meat post-flood, and rules for offerings on an altar. Both Targums state that every living creature is now permitted for consumption, similar to how green vegetation was previously allowed for food. 

|אַךְ־בָּשָׂ֕ר בְּנַפְשׁ֥וֹ דָמ֖וֹ לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ׃|4 P|You must not, however, eat flesh with its life-blood in it.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentaries and halakhic texts discuss the prohibition against eating flesh with its life or blood, rooted in Genesis 9:4, with interpretations ranging from not consuming a limb cut from a living animal to avoiding flesh with the life-force still within it. Jewish thought emphasizes the equal subordination of all beings to God and the need to respect and care for all aspects of creation, while the Midrash connects the prohibition to deeper meanings in the biblical narrative. The Talmud and Tanakh reinforce the prohibition against eating blood, with specific instances cited, and the Targum expands on the prohibition by specifying circumstances in which flesh should not be eaten. 

|וְאַ֨ךְ אֶת־דִּמְכֶ֤ם לְנַפְשֹֽׁתֵיכֶם֙ אֶדְרֹ֔שׁ מִיַּ֥ד כׇּל־חַיָּ֖ה אֶדְרְשֶׁ֑נּוּ וּמִיַּ֣ד הָֽאָדָ֗ם מִיַּד֙ אִ֣ישׁ אָחִ֔יו אֶדְרֹ֖שׁ אֶת־נֶ֥פֶשׁ הָֽאָדָֽם׃|5 P|But for your own life-blood I will require a reckoning: I will require it of every beast; of humankind, too, will I require a reckoning for human life, of everyone for each other! |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text emphasizes accountability for shedding human blood, prohibiting suicide and animal killings of humans. Halakhah allows violating Shabbos to save a life, permits confession as evidence, and discusses the legitimacy of war for non-Jews. Jewish Thought stresses respecting all creatures and oneself, while Midrash mentions the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal and the four kingdoms subjugating Israel. Mishnah details liability for intended killings, Musar warns against wastefulness and self-harm, and the Second Temple text highlights the sanctity of human life. Talmud discusses execution of Noahide descendants and liability for self-harm, while Targum states that God will demand accountability for shedding human blood. 

|שֹׁפֵךְ֙ דַּ֣ם הָֽאָדָ֔ם בָּֽאָדָ֖ם דָּמ֣וֹ יִשָּׁפֵ֑ךְ כִּ֚י בְּצֶ֣לֶם אֱלֹהִ֔ים עָשָׂ֖ה אֶת־הָאָדָֽם׃|6 P|Whoever sheds human blood, By human [hands] shall that one’s blood be shed; For in the image of God Was humankind made.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Humans are created in the image of God, as stated in Genesis 9:6, with implications for the sanctity of human life and the prohibition against murder. The procedure for washing hands in the morning is outlined in Halakhah, emphasizing cleanliness and personal hygiene. The Talmud discusses various aspects of procreation, bloodshed, and forgiveness, while the Tosefta addresses exemptions from waiting periods after divorce and the importance of fulfilling the commandment to "be fruitful and multiply." The concept of humanity being created in the image of God is fundamental in Jewish thought, emphasizing the value of human life and the responsibility to exercise dominion over animals. 

|וְאַתֶּ֖ם פְּר֣וּ וּרְב֑וּ שִׁרְצ֥וּ בָאָ֖רֶץ וּרְבוּ־בָֽהּ׃|7 P|Be fertile, then, and increase; abound on the earth and increase on it.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The importance of being content with one's own portion and not being envious of others is emphasized in Chasidut, with the sin of envy highlighted in the story of the generation of the flood. The duty to be fruitful and multiply is reiterated in Halakhah, with men having a more active role in fulfilling this commandment. The creation of man as the crowning achievement of creation is discussed in Jewish Thought, while the obligation to be fruitful and multiply is seen as a blessing and a commandment in Musar. The commandment to be fruitful and multiply is discussed in the Talmud, emphasizing its importance for both Jews and non-Jews. 

|וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל־נֹ֔חַ וְאֶל־בָּנָ֥יו אִתּ֖וֹ לֵאמֹֽר׃|8 P|And God said to Noah and to his sons with him,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah acted as an intermediary between God and his sons, who were not prophets, conveying a covenant that would govern the natural order of things. Joseph's success in his master's house was due to his ability to anticipate and fulfill needs promptly and with excellence. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya interpret Noah's communication with God as influenced by his actions of either violating or going beyond God's commands. The Targums state that Elohim/Lord spoke to Noah and his sons, delivering a message. 

|וַאֲנִ֕י הִנְנִ֥י מֵקִ֛ים אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֖י אִתְּכֶ֑ם וְאֶֽת־זַרְעֲכֶ֖ם אַֽחֲרֵיכֶֽם׃|9 P|“I now establish My covenant with you and your offspring to come,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains the covenant in Genesis 9:9 as a promise to not destroy the world with a flood again, while Sforno sees it as conditional on justice for murderers. Rashi reassured Noah about the world not being destroyed again, and Chizkuni adds that God encouraged Noah to resume marital relations. In Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Joseph's extended imprisonment was due to trusting the chief cupbearer, and in Bereshit Rabbah, Noah's delay in procreation led to his sons being included in the covenant. Nachmanides explains the covenant in Genesis 6:18 as universal, maintained with the righteous, and related to God's mercy towards humanity. In the Talmud, Rav Yehuda considers Adam a heretic for turning from truth, and Rabbi Yitzḥak links Adam's actions to breaking the covenant. The Targum commentary on Genesis 9:9 highlights God's covenant with Noah and his descendants. 

|וְאֵ֨ת כׇּל־נֶ֤פֶשׁ הַֽחַיָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִתְּכֶ֔ם בָּע֧וֹף בַּבְּהֵמָ֛ה וּֽבְכׇל־חַיַּ֥ת הָאָ֖רֶץ אִתְּכֶ֑ם מִכֹּל֙ יֹצְאֵ֣י הַתֵּבָ֔ה לְכֹ֖ל חַיַּ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ׃|10 P|and with every living thing that is with you—birds, cattle, and every wild beast as well—all that have come out of the ark, every living thing on earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The covenant made by God includes all species of creatures that came out of the ark, ensuring none will become extinct, including unclean birds and crawlers, dangerous animals, and every living creature in the world. The waters rose up to the throne of glory, forming seas and valleys upon the earth, until God rebuked them and restrained them, drying up and gathering in channels. Reflecting on one's actions and acknowledging mortality, humility, and connection to the earth before death is important for recognizing one's deeds and preparing for the afterlife, as suggested in Kav HaYashar 39:9. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 9:10 mention that all living creatures that left the ark are included in the covenant. 

|וַהֲקִמֹתִ֤י אֶת־בְּרִיתִי֙ אִתְּכֶ֔ם וְלֹֽא־יִכָּרֵ֧ת כׇּל־בָּשָׂ֛ר ע֖וֹד מִמֵּ֣י הַמַּבּ֑וּל וְלֹֽא־יִהְיֶ֥ה ע֛וֹד מַבּ֖וּל לְשַׁחֵ֥ת הָאָֽרֶץ׃|11 P|I will maintain My covenant with you: never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The covenant in Genesis 9:11 promises no more worldwide floods, confirmed by the rainbow sign, even if humanity acts similarly to pre-flood times. Pharaoh's demand for a wonder from Moses was justified due to righteous requests for signs, and his decree to harm male infants stemmed from a misunderstanding of God's promise. The Mishnah states that Shabbat limits must be measured accurately, even by unreliable witnesses, and the prohibition to walk more than two thousand cubits on Shabbat is interpreted leniently. Rava explains in the Talmud that a negative expression must be repeated twice to constitute an oath, as seen in Genesis 9:11 and 9:15. The Second Temple text emphasizes striving for excellence in virtues, even if not all aspects of the soul excel equally, with divine kindness allowing individuals to work towards perfection. The Targum highlights God's covenant to never again destroy all living creatures on earth with a flood. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים זֹ֤את אֽוֹת־הַבְּרִית֙ אֲשֶׁר־אֲנִ֣י נֹתֵ֗ן בֵּינִי֙ וּבֵ֣ינֵיכֶ֔ם וּבֵ֛ין כׇּל־נֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִתְּכֶ֑ם לְדֹרֹ֖ת עוֹלָֽם׃|12 P|God further said, “This is the sign that I set for the covenant between Me and you, and every living creature with you, for all ages to come.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The rainbow symbolizes the covenant between God and the earth, serving as a sign of peace and mercy in times of judgment, and is a reminder of hope and the bond between Creator and creatures. The rainbow, despite being a natural occurrence, signifies the promise of no more floods, and various righteous individuals have requested signs from God, such as Noah asking for the rainbow as a sign. The word "זאת" refers to the covenant of circumcision, and even King David, a righteous figure, was punished for his sins, highlighting the potential for ordinary individuals to fall into sin. The mountains and valleys of the land of Yehudah are described in relation to vineyards and sheep, symbolizing the success or failure of the Jewish people due to God's system of reward and punishment. The covenant between God and the people of Israel is represented by the word "זאת," and the Sabbath is considered the completion of the cycle of creation and a natural partner of the Jewish people. 

|אֶת־קַשְׁתִּ֕י נָתַ֖תִּי בֶּֽעָנָ֑ן וְהָֽיְתָה֙ לְא֣וֹת בְּרִ֔ית בֵּינִ֖י וּבֵ֥ין הָאָֽרֶץ׃|13 P|I have set My bow in the clouds, and it shall serve as a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The rainbow is a symbol of God's promise not to bring another deluge, representing a new relationship between God and mankind, as well as a covenant between God and the earth. The covenant of circumcision is one of five covenants mentioned in Kabbalistic texts, linking it to the decrease of power of the nations of the world. The rainbow is also discussed in Midrash as a sign of God's faithfulness and justice, while Mishnah lists it as one of the ten things created on the eve of the Sabbath. The Talmud explores the implications of different interpretations regarding the rainbow, and the Tanakh establishes the Sabbath as a lasting covenant between God and the Israelites. The Targum commentary on Genesis 9:13 emphasizes the rainbow as a sign of the covenant between God's Word and the earth. 

|וְהָיָ֕ה בְּעַֽנְנִ֥י עָנָ֖ן עַל־הָאָ֑רֶץ וְנִרְאֲתָ֥ה הַקֶּ֖שֶׁת בֶּעָנָֽן׃|14 P|When I bring clouds over the earth, and the bow appears in the clouds,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut highlights the symbolism of the rainbow connecting fear and security in God's presence, tied to the arrival of the Messiah and representing Israel's strength. Commentary from Ibn Ezra, Radak, Siftei Chakhamim, and Rashi offers interpretations on the significance of clouds and the rainbow after the flood. The Midrash discusses the rainbow as a symbol of God's covenant and explores the importance of Torah wisdom over material possessions, justice, and the protective nature of the Torah in life and the afterlife. The Targum explains that a rainbow will be seen in the clouds when they cover the earth, visible during the day when the sun is not obscured. 

|וְזָכַרְתִּ֣י אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֗י אֲשֶׁ֤ר בֵּינִי֙ וּבֵ֣ינֵיכֶ֔ם וּבֵ֛ין כׇּל־נֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּ֖ה בְּכׇל־בָּשָׂ֑ר וְלֹֽא־יִֽהְיֶ֨ה ע֤וֹד הַמַּ֙יִם֙ לְמַבּ֔וּל לְשַׁחֵ֖ת כׇּל־בָּשָֽׂר׃|15 P|I will remember My covenant between Me and you and every living creature among all flesh, so that the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra clarifies that the singular "shall become" in Genesis 9:15 does not mean "waters" is singular, Radak explains "I will remember" as a human approximation of God's reaction, and the phrase "no more" indicates less rain to fear. Rav Hirsch sees the rainbow as a symbol of peace, Steinsaltz summarizes God's promise not to flood again. Kabbalah notes Jacob's hardest affliction was his confusion about Joseph, Midrash discusses righteous individuals seeking signs from God, Second Temple interprets the rainbow as a sign of God's mercy, Talmud discusses oaths using negative and positive expressions, and Targum mentions a covenant between God and all living souls. 

|וְהָיְתָ֥ה הַקֶּ֖שֶׁת בֶּֽעָנָ֑ן וּרְאִיתִ֗יהָ לִזְכֹּר֙ בְּרִ֣ית עוֹלָ֔ם בֵּ֣ין אֱלֹהִ֔ים וּבֵין֙ כׇּל־נֶ֣פֶשׁ חַיָּ֔ה בְּכׇל־בָּשָׂ֖ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|16 P|When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures, all flesh that is on earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes the importance of prayer, tzaddikim, and mitzvot in rectifying the eternal covenant and elevating all worlds to receive spiritual beneficence. The rainbow symbolizes God's covenant with humanity and serves as a reminder of Divine Justice and mercy. Halakhah states that the blessing for seeing a rainbow signifies the promise of no more floods to destroy all living creatures. Kabbalah and Midrash discuss the symbolism of the rainbow, Shechinah, and the eternal covenant, emphasizing the importance of Torah wisdom and God's justice. Tanakh and Targum highlight the covenant between God and humanity, symbolized by circumcision and the rainbow. 

|וַיֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־נֹ֑חַ זֹ֤את אֽוֹת־הַבְּרִית֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הֲקִמֹ֔תִי בֵּינִ֕י וּבֵ֥ין כׇּל־בָּשָׂ֖ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר עַל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|17 P|That,” God said to Noah, “shall be the sign of the covenant that I have established between Me and all flesh that is on earth.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra sees "which I have established" as an oath not to bring a flood, Sforno views the secondary rainbow as a warning sign, Radak suggests God repeated blessings to reassure Noah, Rashi points to the rainbow as a sign of the covenant, Steinsaltz explains the rainbow represents the covenant between God and mankind. Ramban explains "With this" in Leviticus 16:3:1 refers to the High Priest entering the Holy of Holies through Israel's merit, Rashbam clarifies incense ingredients in Exodus 30:34:2, Targum emphasizes the covenant between God and all living creatures on earth. 

|וַיִּֽהְי֣וּ בְנֵי־נֹ֗חַ הַיֹּֽצְאִים֙ מִן־הַתֵּבָ֔ה שֵׁ֖ם וְחָ֣ם וָיָ֑פֶת וְחָ֕ם ה֖וּא אֲבִ֥י כְנָֽעַן׃|18 J|The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth—Ham being the father of Canaan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rashi explains the order of Yishmael's children's names, emphasizing exceptions and righteousness. Ham as Canaan's father is crucial for understanding his curse, with various commentators highlighting the spiritual connection and consequences of Ham's actions. The Midrash stresses the dangers of excessive drinking and the importance of Torah study. Rashbam focuses on the plain meaning of biblical verses and contextual explanations. The Midrash of Philo discusses shared responsibility in wrongdoing, while the Targum lists the sons of Noah. 

|שְׁלֹשָׁ֥ה אֵ֖לֶּה בְּנֵי־נֹ֑חַ וּמֵאֵ֖לֶּה נָֽפְצָ֥ה כׇל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|19 J|These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the whole world branched out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah's three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, were blessed by God and played different roles in the diversification and dispersal of humanity on earth. Shem focused on spiritual aspects, Ham on material desires, and Japheth on aesthetics. The dispersion of Noah's descendants symbolized the need to control base instincts and harness material instincts for higher attributes. The text highlights the connection between Ham's character and the subsequent actions of Canaan, emphasizing the importance of virtue in shaping future generations. 

|וַיָּ֥חֶל נֹ֖חַ אִ֣ישׁ הָֽאֲדָמָ֑ה וַיִּטַּ֖ע כָּֽרֶם׃|20 J|Noah, the tiller of the soil,  was the first to plant a vineyard.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah planted a vineyard after the flood, indulging in luxury over essential crops, leading to drunkenness and a curse on his descendants. The dangers of overindulging in intoxicating drinks are emphasized, with wine associated with curses and death. The narrative warns against excessive wine consumption, which can lead to sin and corruption, as seen in the stories of Noah, Adam, and Solomon. Noah's cultivation of the land symbolizes the removal of harmful habits and cultivation of virtues, while the consequences of uncontrolled drinking are highlighted in various interpretations from Jewish texts. 

|וַיֵּ֥שְׁתְּ מִן־הַיַּ֖יִן וַיִּשְׁכָּ֑ר וַיִּתְגַּ֖ל בְּת֥וֹךְ אׇהֳלֹֽה׃|21 J|He drank of the wine and became drunk, and he uncovered himself within his tent.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah's drunkenness and subsequent nudity in his tent are interpreted as allusions to the exile of the ten tribes due to excessive wine consumption, with references to the kingdom of the Ten Tribes and the consequences of drunkenness leading to humiliation and loss of wisdom. The story of Cain illustrates how jealousy, greed, and quest for glory can lead to moral corruption, while the sons of Aaron were faulted for deficiencies in intellect, emotion, and morals. The Mishna discusses the obligation of reciting blessings over specific types of fruits, with Rabbi Yehuda's opinion on wheat as a type of tree. In Zechariah 13:5, the denial of being a prophet and reference to addiction to wine since youth allude to Noah's experience with alcohol. Targum translations of Genesis 9:21 describe Noah drinking wine, becoming intoxicated, and exposing himself in his tent. 

|וַיַּ֗רְא חָ֚ם אֲבִ֣י כְנַ֔עַן אֵ֖ת עֶרְוַ֣ת אָבִ֑יו וַיַּגֵּ֥ד לִשְׁנֵֽי־אֶחָ֖יו בַּחֽוּץ׃|22 J|Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains the sanctity of Noah's sons through white, red, and green aspects, with Cham becoming materialistic and the father of Canaan, who dishonors Noah. Halakhah emphasizes loving one's neighbor and covering up any unseemliness in a friend, like Shem and Yefeth did for Noah. The covenant after the flood ensures the earth's continuity despite human nature's flaws. Midrash details the consequences of seeing Noah's nakedness, leading to laws about slaves and examples of curses and blessings. Musar highlights Cham's sin of not covering Noah and telling others, resulting in his curse. Quoting Commentary elaborates on the curse on Canaan and the progression of Torah laws. Second Temple texts blame both Ham and Noah for the deed of seeing Noah's nakedness, emphasizing Ham's contempt and ridicule. Tanakh and Targum reference Cham seeing Noah's nakedness and telling his brothers. 

|וַיִּקַּח֩ שֵׁ֨ם וָיֶ֜פֶת אֶת־הַשִּׂמְלָ֗ה וַיָּשִׂ֙ימוּ֙ עַל־שְׁכֶ֣ם שְׁנֵיהֶ֔ם וַיֵּֽלְכוּ֙ אֲחֹ֣רַנִּ֔ית וַיְכַסּ֕וּ אֵ֖ת עֶרְוַ֣ת אֲבִיהֶ֑ם וּפְנֵיהֶם֙ אֲחֹ֣רַנִּ֔ית וְעֶרְוַ֥ת אֲבִיהֶ֖ם לֹ֥א רָאֽוּ׃|23 J|But Shem and Japheth took a cloth, placed it against both their backs and, walking backward, they covered their father’s nakedness; their faces were turned the other way, so that they did not see their father’s nakedness.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut emphasizes that wearing tzitzit serves as protection against immorality and the evil inclination, as seen in the story of Shem and Yafet covering Noah's nakedness. Halakhah stresses the importance of not speaking lashon hara and rechilut against others, highlighting the need to preserve a friend's honor. Kabbalah connects the binding of phylacteries to Shem and Japheth's actions, emphasizing the importance of not seeing obscenity. Midrash and Musar highlight the righteous deed of covering Noah's nakedness and the positive outcomes for Shem and Japheth. The Second Temple period discusses the curse on Canaan for uncovering Noah's nakedness, leading to their descendants becoming servants. The Talmud debates whether the nakedness of a gentile is considered nakedness based on the story of Noah, while Tanakh and Targum provide prophecies and interpretations related to nakedness and burial. 

|וַיִּ֥יקֶץ נֹ֖חַ מִיֵּינ֑וֹ וַיֵּ֕דַע אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁר־עָ֥שָׂה ל֖וֹ בְּנ֥וֹ הַקָּטָֽן׃|24 J|When Noah woke up from his wine and learned what his youngest son had done to him,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah's youngest son, Canaan, was cursed by Noah after Ham disrespected him, leading to the belief that Canaan and his descendants would be evil. The curse on Canaan served as a warning against disrespecting parents, with interpretations suggesting that Ham had previously been blessed by God. The Second Temple text emphasizes that being referred to as the younger son of Noah symbolizes a state of mind rather than age or birth order, highlighting the inability of wickedness to understand wisdom. Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan provide additional details about Noah waking up to realize what his son had done to him, with Targum Jonathan adding that Noah learned of Ham's mistreatment through a dream. 

|וַיֹּ֖אמֶר אָר֣וּר כְּנָ֑עַן עֶ֥בֶד עֲבָדִ֖ים יִֽהְיֶ֥ה לְאֶחָֽיו׃|25 J|he said, “Cursed be Canaan; The lowest of slaves Shall he be to his brothers.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut: Violating the Covenant is associated with avdut and the characteristic of Cham, one must extricate themselves from these behaviors to merit the service of prayer. Keeping the mitzvah of tzitzit protects against immorality and the Serpent's advice. Ten measures of sleep correspond to the Serpent, who is associated with being a slave. By serving a Tzaddik faithfully, one can move from being cursed to being blessed. Even a non-Jew can elevate a holy spark by consuming it and serving a Jew with the vitality gained from it. Ibn Ezra explains that "a servant of servants" means a servant like all other servants, not a servant to servants. Radak suggests that the curse was put on Canaan, not all of Ham's descendants, and Rabbeinu Bahya interprets the curse as a punishment for Canaan's shameful behavior towards his father. Siftei Chakhamim suggests that Cham may have castrated Noah, leading to the curse on Canaan. Da'at Zekenim explains that the curse on Canaan was due to his shaming of his father, while Chizkuni states that Canaan was punished for his father Cham's actions. In the Mishneh Torah, Gifts to the Poor 8:17, it is stated that when providing sustenance or clothing for the poor or redeeming captives, precedence is given to a priest over a Levite, a Levite over an Israelite, an Israelite over a challal, a challal over a shituki, a shituki over an asufi, an asufi over a mamzer, a mamzer over a netin, and a netin over a convert. A convert is given precedence over a freed servant, as the latter was originally among those who were cursed. The observance of commandments such as the Sabbath, Passover, and wearing of blue threads serve as reminders of fundamental commandments. The days of Purim were established by the prophets and elders to remember the kindness bestowed upon Jacob, who was chosen by the Lord. Jacob's struggle with the angel and the importance of honoring one's father are also highlighted, along with the significance of circumcision and remembering the plight of the orphan and widow. The Zohar discusses how hidden knowledge was revealed to someone, allowing them to understand it. The Tikkunei Zohar explains that sexual obscenity is linked to Noah's son Ham, representing the evil inclination that leads to sinful behavior and reveals obscenities in the world. Ham is associated with the primordial snake, leading to a curse on his descendants. Noah was the first to plant a vineyard, drink from it, curse Canaan, and enslave his descendants. Ham was cursed because he looked upon his father's nakedness and told his brothers, causing the curse to fall upon Canaan. Noah desired slaves for his children, but Ham's actions led to the curse on Canaan. The curse does not coexist with a blessing, so Canaan received the curse for Ham's actions. Noah intended to make his descendants slaves, but Ham's actions led to the curse on Canaan. In Mishnah Eruvin 7:6, one can merge courtyards by placing a barrel of food for all residents of the alleyway, with possession being acquired by an adult son, daughter, Hebrew slave, maidservant, or wife, but not by a minor child or Canaanite slave. In Mishnah Horayot 3:8, there is a hierarchy of precedence among priests, Levites, Israelites, mamzers, Gibeonites, converts, 

|וַיֹּ֕אמֶר בָּר֥וּךְ יְהֹוָ֖ה אֱלֹ֣הֵי שֵׁ֑ם וִיהִ֥י כְנַ֖עַן עֶ֥בֶד לָֽמוֹ׃|26 J|And he said, “Blessed be יהוה, The God of Shem; Let Canaan be a slave to them. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah blessed the God of Shem, declaring Canaan would be a servant to Shem's descendants, emphasizing Canaan's subservience even in exile. The text compares wise figures inheriting glory with fools taking up shame, highlighting the importance of righteousness and wisdom in biblical actions. Rabbeinu Bahya explains that the Torah does not associate God's name with evil events, only with positive things, and does not initiate afflictions. The mention of God's benevolence in creating the world signifies the wise man's acceptance by both the world and God. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and Rabbi Yoḥanan argue that Torah scrolls can only be written in Greek, as it is considered a sacred language alongside Hebrew. 

|יַ֤פְתְּ אֱלֹהִים֙ לְיֶ֔פֶת וְיִשְׁכֹּ֖ן בְּאׇֽהֳלֵי־שֵׁ֑ם וִיהִ֥י כְנַ֖עַן עֶ֥בֶד לָֽמוֹ׃|27 J|May God enlarge  Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be a slave to them.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ibn Ezra explains that Shem and Japheth were blessed in Genesis 9:27, with Shem blessed with God's presence in his tents and Canaan destined to be their servant. The Greeks desired a translation of the Torah showcasing their wisdom, while the Midrash discusses the future judgment of nations, blessings from patriarchs, and the significance of translations. The Mishnah permits Torah scrolls in any language but requires phylacteries and mezuzot to be in Hebrew, with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel allowing Greek scrolls. Philo emphasizes virtues over possessions in Noah's blessings, and the Talmud discusses the use of Greek in Torah scrolls due to the language of Japheth in Shem's tents. Samson Raphael Hirsch contrasts ancient Greece's aesthetics with ancient Israel's ethics, highlighting the distinction between the two civilizations. 

|וַֽיְחִי־נֹ֖חַ אַחַ֣ר הַמַּבּ֑וּל שְׁלֹ֤שׁ מֵאוֹת֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וַֽחֲמִשִּׁ֖ים שָׁנָֽה׃|28 R|Noah lived after the Flood 350 years.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah lists the ages of antediluvian people to trace back to Adam's creation, with Noah living for 350 years after the flood and dying at 950 years old. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya debate whether the year of the Flood should be included in Noah's total years, with Rabbi Neḥemya arguing for its inclusion. The text emphasizes the importance of understanding God's knowledge of human lives, different interpretations of scripture, and the connection between biblical narratives and historical events. The Targum states that Noah lived for 350 years after the Flood. 

|וַיִּֽהְיוּ֙ כׇּל־יְמֵי־נֹ֔חַ תְּשַׁ֤ע מֵאוֹת֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וַחֲמִשִּׁ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּמֹֽת׃|29 R|And all the days of Noah came to 950 years; then he died.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Noah died at 950 years old, with the year in the ark not counted in his lifespan according to the Torah. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya debated whether the year of the Flood should be included in Noah's total years. The crime of "seeing the father's nakedness" in Genesis is interpreted as referring to the sexual immorality of the Canaanites. Philo's treatise on drunkenness explores Moses' symbolic use of wine, focusing on the truth revealed by nakedness. The Targum states that Noah lived for 950 years before his death. 

## Genesis 10

|וְאֵ֙לֶּה֙ תּוֹלְדֹ֣ת בְּנֵי־נֹ֔חַ שֵׁ֖ם חָ֣ם וָיָ֑פֶת וַיִּוָּלְד֥וּ לָהֶ֛ם בָּנִ֖ים אַחַ֥ר הַמַּבּֽוּל׃|1 P R|These are the lines of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah: sons were born to them after the Flood.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Before the flood, people were restrained by God from having children to avoid perishing, leading to most children being born after the flood. The Torah emphasizes the emergence of the Jewish nation through the seventy descendants of Noah, with Abraham descending from Shem. Various commentaries interpret the phrase "אלה תולדות" in different contexts, discussing important events in the lives of Noah, Yaakov, and Esau. The Midrash praises God's might, richness, and mercy, compares the creation of Israel to a noble marriage contract, and highlights the importance of documenting generations. The Second Temple Midrash of Philo discusses the placement of Ham among the sons of Noah, noting his consistent middle position. Targum texts discuss the descendants of Noah, specifically his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who had children after the Flood. 

|בְּנֵ֣י יֶ֔פֶת גֹּ֣מֶר וּמָג֔וֹג וּמָדַ֖י וְיָוָ֣ן וְתֻבָ֑ל וּמֶ֖שֶׁךְ וְתִירָֽס׃|2 P|The descendants of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Ramban emphasizes Japheth's mention first in Genesis 10 to highlight Abraham's lineage, while Radak identifies Gomer as the founder of the Altrach nation and Tiras as Persia. The Midrash discusses the Torah's noble nature and the departure from Egypt, while the Talmud connects Greek as the language of Japheth's descendants and identifies Tiras as Persia. The Targum lists the sons of Japheth and their provinces, and the Tosefta discusses the downfall of arrogant societies like the Tower of Babel, Sodom, Egypt, and Sisera. 

|וּבְנֵ֖י גֹּ֑מֶר אַשְׁכְּנַ֥ז וְרִיפַ֖ת וְתֹגַרְמָֽה׃|3 P|The descendants of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak and Steinsaltz identify Ashkenaz as Germany and Rifat as France from Genesis 10:3, with uncertainty in these identifications. The Midrash discusses the division of people into different languages and territories after Peleg's death, with descendants of Japheth establishing regions across the earth. Rashi explains the transformation of Ashkenaz and Diphath from weak to disgraceful, linking it to Sennacherib. In the Talmud, Rebbi Eleazar and Rebbi Joḥanan debate the languages spoken on Earth and the importance of speaking Japhet's language in Shem's tents. The sons of Gomer and Yawan are listed with differing interpretations on their locations. The Targum identifies the descendants of Gomer as Ashkenaz, Riphas, and Togarmah, with territories in Asia, Phrygia, and Barberia. 

|וּבְנֵ֥י יָוָ֖ן אֱלִישָׁ֣ה וְתַרְשִׁ֑ישׁ כִּתִּ֖ים וְדֹדָנִֽים׃|4 P|The descendants of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, the Kittim and the Dodanim. |
|--:|:-:|:--|

The commentary discusses the identification of Kittim with the Romans and Greeks, the debate over the spelling of "Dedanim," and connections between the sons of Yavan and ancient Greece. The concept of resurrection of the dead is explored, linking the present exile of the Jewish people to the exile of Edom. The text in the Midrash discusses the appointment of elders by God, the destruction of elders and Nadab and Abihu, and Israel's relationship with other nations. In the Second Temple period, Japhet's sons founded various nations, and the Hebrew language retained the original names with slight variations. The Talmud debates the origin of languages and specific locations associated with descendants of Japhet. The Tanakh and Targum list the sons of Javan as Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim. 

|מֵ֠אֵ֠לֶּה נִפְרְד֞וּ אִיֵּ֤י הַגּוֹיִם֙ בְּאַרְצֹתָ֔ם אִ֖ישׁ לִלְשֹׁנ֑וֹ לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתָ֖ם בְּגוֹיֵהֶֽם׃|5 P|From these the maritime nations branched out. [These are the descendants of Japheth]  by their lands—each with its language—their clans and their nations.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The descendants of Japheth settled on separate islands, fulfilling Noah's blessing of being numerous and scattered, while the sons of Ham lived close together on continents. The dispersion of nations after the Tower of Babel incident led to different languages and geographical separation, establishing Abraham's lineage from Shem. The Sanhedrin knew 70 languages, representing the 70 interpretations of the Torah, all separate and unrelated. The descendants of Japheth developed different languages and nations, leading to international friction as an act of God's kindness. The text from Sefer HaYashar in Book of Genesis describes the descendants of Japheth, Ham, and Canaan, who built cities and named them after their sires. Rashbam explains that the twelve tribes of Israel correspond to the twelve descendants of Canaan, with their boundaries described in Genesis. The people of Ceos, Rhodes, and the Gentile islands are descended from Japhet because he is associated with expansion and growth. The text from Onkelos, Targum Jonathan, and Tafsir Rasag on Genesis 10:5 all speak about how different nations were separated into islands based on their languages and families. 

|וּבְנֵ֖י חָ֑ם כּ֥וּשׁ וּמִצְרַ֖יִם וּפ֥וּט וּכְנָֽעַן׃|6 P|The descendants of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Midrash discusses warnings against immoral practices in Egypt and Canaan, the significance of Hebron, Amalek's attack on the Israelites, and the daughters of Zelophehad. Various commentaries highlight Moses sending gifts to his wife, the Israelites' slavery in Egypt, and interpretations of biblical verses. The Talmud discusses the construction and development of Hebron and Zoan, while different interpretations are given for why Noah cursed Canaan. The Targum lists the descendants of Cham and their respective regions. 

|וּבְנֵ֣י כ֔וּשׁ סְבָא֙ וַֽחֲוִילָ֔ה וְסַבְתָּ֥ה וְרַעְמָ֖ה וְסַבְתְּכָ֑א וּבְנֵ֥י רַעְמָ֖ה שְׁבָ֥א וּדְדָֽן׃|7 P|The descendants of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The descendants of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The descendants of Cush, Japheth, and Shem each became distinct nations, with some becoming heads of nations while others did not. The blue dye tekhelet originated in India, renowned for its expertise in dying with blue dye, as discussed in Halakhah. Rabbi Yoḥanan explains in the Midrash that Israel is called "My people" due to their acceptance of God's Torah at Sinai. Rabbeinu Bahya highlights the importance of faith in God's Oneness through the acrostic of God's name in the Ten Commandments, while Radak and Chizkuni discuss variations in spelling of names in ancient genealogical records. The descendants of Ham, Canaan, and other nations settled in various regions and founded nations such as the Ethiopians, Egyptians, Libyans, and Judeans, as detailed in the Second Temple period. Rav Yosef identifies Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca as inner and outer Sakistan in the Talmud. The Targum lists the sons of Cush and Mauritinos, detailing their provinces and descendants. 

|וְכ֖וּשׁ יָלַ֣ד אֶת־נִמְרֹ֑ד ה֣וּא הֵחֵ֔ל לִֽהְי֥וֹת גִּבֹּ֖ר בָּאָֽרֶץ׃|8 J|Cush also begot Nimrod, who was the first mighty figure on earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Nimrod, the son of Cush, was a powerful and rebellious figure who led people to rebel against God, becoming a mighty hunter and a historic hero after the flood. Various Midrashim discuss the significance of Nimrod's actions and rise to power, highlighting his evil nature and rebellion against the Holy One. In the Second Temple period, Nimrod is described as a giant and hunter associated with Babylon, symbolizing desertion and change of purpose. Targum translations also emphasize Nimrod's power and rebellion against the Lord on earth. 

|הֽוּא־הָיָ֥ה גִבֹּֽר־צַ֖יִד לִפְנֵ֣י יְהֹוָ֑ה עַל־כֵּן֙ יֵֽאָמַ֔ר כְּנִמְרֹ֛ד גִּבּ֥וֹר צַ֖יִד לִפְנֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה׃|9 J|He was a mighty hunter by the grace of יהוה; hence the saying, “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter by the grace of יהוה.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Nimrod was a powerful hunter who ruled by force, with interpretations varying from offering sacrifices to leading people to rebel against God. Esau took precious garments from Nimrod after killing him, symbolizing his connection to harsh judgment. The importance of recording historical events, the significance of prayer, and consequences of actions are highlighted in the text. Nimrod is portrayed as a wicked man opposing God in the Second Temple Midrash, while the Targums emphasize his strength and rebellion against divine judgments. 

|וַתְּהִ֨י רֵאשִׁ֤ית מַמְלַכְתּוֹ֙ בָּבֶ֔ל וְאֶ֖רֶךְ וְאַכַּ֣ד וְכַלְנֵ֑ה בְּאֶ֖רֶץ שִׁנְעָֽר׃|10 J|The mainstays of his kingdom were Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh  in the land of Shinar.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Nimrod established his kingdom in Babylon, Arak, Akad, and Kalne, leading to an insurrection against God. Midrash discusses tearing clothes, prayer, blessings, and the departure of the soul. Commentary notes parallels between Nimrod and Nevuchadnezzar's attempts to battle against God. Talmud identifies Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh in Mesopotamia. Tanakh describes a shrine in the land of Shinar. Targum mentions Nimrod's kingdom in various locations. 

|מִן־הָאָ֥רֶץ הַהִ֖וא יָצָ֣א אַשּׁ֑וּר וַיִּ֙בֶן֙ אֶת־נִ֣ינְוֵ֔ה וְאֶת־רְחֹבֹ֥ת עִ֖יר וְאֶת־כָּֽלַח׃|11 J|From that land Asshur went forth and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Nimrod and Asshur had political disagreements, leading Asshur to migrate and build cities like Nineveh. The origin of the blue dye mentioned in the Talmud is associated with Solomon's Sheba and India. The Midrash emphasizes orienting one's heart towards the Holy of Holies when praying. Assyria was separate from Ethiopia, and Nineveh is identified as the great city mentioned in the Torah. Asshur built Nineveh, Rechovos Iyr, and Kalach, while Nimrod built Nineveh, Pelatiath, Kartha, and Parioth in Athur. 

|וְֽאֶת־רֶ֔סֶן בֵּ֥ין נִֽינְוֵ֖ה וּבֵ֣ין כָּ֑לַח הִ֖וא הָעִ֥יר הַגְּדֹלָֽה׃|12 J|and Resen between Nineveh and Calah, that is the great city.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The interpretation of "the great city" in Genesis 10:12:1 is debated among commentators, with most suggesting it refers to Nineveh due to its description in Jonah. The book of Jonah portrays God as a compassionate ruler who helped Israel, with Jonah as an agent of God's mission in a political context. In Midrash, Nimrod, son of Cush, becomes a powerful ruler who turns away from God and teaches evil ways, leading to the building of the city of Shinar. Rav Yosef identifies various cities mentioned in the Talmud, with Nineveh determined to be the great city based on Jonah 3:3. God instructs Jonah to go to Nineveh and proclaim judgment due to its wickedness in the Tanakh, while the Targum describes Resen as a great city built between Nineveh and Kalach. 

|וּמִצְרַ֡יִם יָלַ֞ד אֶת־לוּדִ֧ים וְאֶת־עֲנָמִ֛ים וְאֶת־לְהָבִ֖ים וְאֶת־נַפְתֻּחִֽים׃|13 J|And Mizraim begot the Ludim, the Anamim, the Lehabim, the Naphtuhim,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The descendants of Mitzraim lived in or around Egypt, with names reflecting their own. The Torah mentions names of countries, each populated by a specific family. The name Mitzraim may be related to an incident at his birth, and the boundaries of Egypt were well-known. The descendants of Adam and Eve rebelled against God, leading to their expulsion from the garden and further corruption by their descendants. Ramban explains different interpretations of names in Genesis 25:3 and the changing of names in Genesis 10:15, while clarifying that the Philistine cities were part of Canaanite land given to Abraham. Targum lists different names for the descendants of Mitzraim. 

|וְֽאֶת־פַּתְרֻסִ֞ים וְאֶת־כַּסְלֻחִ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָצְא֥וּ מִשָּׁ֛ם פְּלִשְׁתִּ֖ים וְאֶת־כַּפְתֹּרִֽים׃|14 J|the Pathrusim, the Casluhim, and the Caphtorim,  whence the Philistines came forth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Philistines may have genetic input from both the Patrussim and the Kassluchim, who engaged in promiscuous intercourse, leading to the Philistines being their offspring, likely arriving from overseas. The Avim were originally Canaanites conquered by the Caphtorim, who were also Philistines, raising questions about the ownership of Philistine land. God brought both Israel and the Philistines from Caphtor, showing His power extends beyond just the Israelites. (Amos 9:7) The Targum translations mention various tribes from whom the Plishtim, Kaphtorim, Philistaee, and Kaphodikaee originated. 

|וּכְנַ֗עַן יָלַ֛ד אֶת־צִידֹ֥ן בְּכֹר֖וֹ וְאֶת־חֵֽת׃|15 J|Canaan begot Sidon, his first-born, and Heth;|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The descendants of Canaan originally had eleven sons, with one not developing into a separate nation. The land of the Philistines, although not descended from Canaan, was included in the lands given to Abraham. The Canaanites were caretakers of the land for the Israelites until they were ready to inherit it. The Midrash discusses the punishment of Canaan and the sins of Israel leading to the land being cursed, the lineage of Canaan and the nations in the Land of Canaan, and the reward shown to righteous individuals upon their departure from the world. According to the Musar, lying to deceive someone is considered deceitful and akin to idolatry. Ramban explains that the land of Canaan mentioned in Exodus refers to all seven nations, with the exclusion of the Perizzite and the Girgashite from certain laws. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention the descendants of Canaan, including Zidon as the firstborn. 

|וְאֶת־הַיְבוּסִי֙ וְאֶת־הָ֣אֱמֹרִ֔י וְאֵ֖ת הַגִּרְגָּשִֽׁי׃|16 J|and the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak explains that Canaanite tribes in Genesis 10:16 end with י and begin with ה, with Tzidon excluded. Midrash lists Canaanite descendants with specific locations. Ibn Ezra clarifies "Canaanite" in Numbers 14:25 refers to the Amorite. Targum translates Canaanite tribes as Yevusite, Amorite, and Girgashite. 

|וְאֶת־הַֽחִוִּ֥י וְאֶת־הַֽעַרְקִ֖י וְאֶת־הַסִּינִֽי׃|17 J|the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Midrash discusses God's favor towards mortals, inscribing death for sinners, lifting His face towards Israel, blessing the Children of Israel, raising Torah scholars, priests, and prophets, emphasizing repentance, addressing God's judgment during different periods, redemption of exiles in the future, nations promised to Abraham but not given to Israel, and descendants of Canaan and their territories. Ramban explains the conquest of the Avim by the Caphtorim, identifies the Avim with the Hivites and Rephaim, and discusses the interchangeability of names in scripture. Tur HaArokh challenges Rashi's interpretation regarding the Avim and Philistines, argues for Israel's possession of land taken from the Canaanites by the Caphtorim, and discusses the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham. Different Targums list various tribes descended from Canaan, including the Antosite, Hivaee, Irkaee, Tripolaee, Arkaee, and Kaphrusaee. 

|וְאֶת־הָֽאַרְוָדִ֥י וְאֶת־הַצְּמָרִ֖י וְאֶת־הַֽחֲמָתִ֑י וְאַחַ֣ר נָפֹ֔צוּ מִשְׁפְּח֖וֹת הַֽכְּנַעֲנִֽי׃|18 J|the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the clans of the Canaanites spread out.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Canaanites were scattered to the land of Canaan after the confusion of languages, leading to the establishment of various city-states in Phoenicia and Syria. The origins of the seven nations in Canaan are attributed to Canaan, with a focus on their merchant activities and the blessings and curses associated with their lineage. The descendants of Canaan, including the Kenite, Kenizzite, and Kadmonite, are identified as children of Canaan with dual names. Rebbi Eleazar and Rebbi Joḥanan debate the languages spoken before the Tower of Babel incident, with Bar Qappara suggesting Greek be spoken in Jewish tents. The descendants of Japhet, Gomer, Yawan, and others are listed with differing opinions on their locations. The people of Sidon, Arvad, and Zemar are mentioned in connection to their roles as rowers and pilots. The descendants of Canaan, including the Arvadites, Tzemarites, and others, were dispersed among different peoples and regions. 

|וַיְהִ֞י גְּב֤וּל הַֽכְּנַעֲנִי֙ מִצִּידֹ֔ן בֹּאֲכָ֥ה גְרָ֖רָה עַד־עַזָּ֑ה בֹּאֲכָ֞ה סְדֹ֧מָה וַעֲמֹרָ֛ה וְאַדְמָ֥ה וּצְבֹיִ֖ם עַד־לָֽשַׁע׃|19 J|(The [original] Canaanite territory extended from Sidon as far as Gerar, near Gaza, and as far as Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, near Lasha.)|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Canaanites settled in the land that would later become Israel, with their boundaries described from Sidon to Sodom, indicating widespread settlement, which is significant as the Israelites would eventually inherit their land. Abraham was consulted by God before the destruction of the five cities, Jacob and Esau are compared to two nations with mutual hatred, and the descendants of Canaan are listed with the Tzemarites identified as wool workers. The Avim, who dwelt in villages without walls, were conquered by the Caphtorim, and their land was possessed by Israel because the Caphtorim had conquered it from the children of Canaan. Rebbi Eleazar and Rebbi Joḥanan disagree on the languages spoken at the Tower of Babel, and Rebbi Simon and the rabbis disagree on the location of Tiras. God's reluctance to give up on the people of Ephraim and Israel is expressed in Hosea 11:8, comparing them to the destroyed towns of Admah and Zeboiim. 

|אֵ֣לֶּה בְנֵי־חָ֔ם לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתָ֖ם לִלְשֹֽׁנֹתָ֑ם בְּאַרְצֹתָ֖ם בְּגוֹיֵהֶֽם׃|20 P|These are the descendants of Ham, according to their clans and languages, by their lands and nations.|

Ibn Ezra, Radak, Rashi, and Steinsaltz comment on Genesis 10:20:1, noting structural similarities in genealogies, emphasizing unity despite differences in language and land, providing translations, and referring to earlier explanations. The Midrash discusses the importance of reporting blasphemy against God and warns against swearing falsely, highlighting consequences of sinning and not speaking out against wrongdoing. Ramban explains the separation of Japheth's descendants on islands and Ham's descendants on continents, linking genealogy to Abraham's lineage and the scattering of nations after the Tower of Babel. Targum Onkelos and Jonathan elaborate on the sons of Cham, detailing their genealogies, languages, lands, and people. 

|וּלְשֵׁ֥ם יֻלַּ֖ד גַּם־ה֑וּא אֲבִי֙ כׇּל־בְּנֵי־עֵ֔בֶר אֲחִ֖י יֶ֥פֶת הַגָּדֽוֹל׃|21 J|Sons were also born to Shem, ancestor of all the descendants of Eber and older brother of Japheth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Shem is identified as the father of the Hebrews and emphasized in the Torah as the youngest son of Noah, while Japheth is considered the eldest based on the flood timeline. Midrash texts highlight Shem's worthiness and the importance of genealogical chains, with differing opinions on the birth order of Noah's sons. Commentaries by Radak, Ibn Ezra, Ramban, and Chizkuni provide interpretations of the Torah's beginning, and the Talmud discusses the age of Noah's sons, concluding that Shem was not the oldest. Targum texts also mention Shem's role as the father of the Hebrews and his fear of the Lord. 

|בְּנֵ֥י שֵׁ֖ם עֵילָ֣ם וְאַשּׁ֑וּר וְאַרְפַּכְשַׁ֖ד וְל֥וּד וַֽאֲרָֽם׃|22 P|The descendants of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sons of Shem were Elam, Ashur, Arpakhshad, Lud, and Aram, with Arpakhshad considered the father of the Chaldeans and Babylonians, and Lud related to Lydia in Asia Minor. The Talmudic commentary identifies Sheba as both from the sons of Shem and Kush, associated with India and blue dye production. The Midrash explores the symbolic meanings of rivers and relationships between biblical figures like Abraham and Shem, emphasizing fear, blessings, and assistance. Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan interpret Zechariah 13:8 differently regarding the survival of Shem's descendants and the world's population. The Targum also lists the sons of Shem as Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. 

|וּבְנֵ֖י אֲרָ֑ם ע֥וּץ וְח֖וּל וְגֶ֥תֶר וָמַֽשׁ׃|23 P|The descendants of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Radak explains that Aram's descendants are listed in Genesis 10:23 because Terach may have married a descendant of Aram. The Sefer HaYashar contains historical accounts and moral lessons, including stories of the patriarchs and battles of the Israelites. Radak suggests Aram was mentioned as Uz's father due to his fame, Rashbam argues for misreported names, and Targum lists Aram's sons as Uz, Chul, Geser, and Mash. 

|וְאַרְפַּכְשַׁ֖ד יָלַ֣ד אֶת־שָׁ֑לַח וְשֶׁ֖לַח יָלַ֥ד אֶת־עֵֽבֶר׃|24 J|Arpachshad begot Shelah, and Shelah begot Eber.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Arpakhshad begot Shela, who in turn begot Ever, highlighting the family line crucial for the continuation of the story from the descendants of Shem. The word "ילד" is used in the sense of "sire" or "father" in Numbers 11:12:2 and actively in the sense of "begot" or "sired" in Deuteronomy 32:18:1, as seen with Arpachshad and Shalach in Genesis 10:24. The Targum also states that Arpachshad was the father of Shelach, who was the father of Eber. 

|וּלְעֵ֥בֶר יֻלַּ֖ד שְׁנֵ֣י בָנִ֑ים שֵׁ֣ם הָֽאֶחָ֞ד פֶּ֗לֶג כִּ֤י בְיָמָיו֙ נִפְלְגָ֣ה הָאָ֔רֶץ וְשֵׁ֥ם אָחִ֖יו יׇקְטָֽן׃|25 J|Two sons were born to Eber: the name of the first was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided;  and the name of his brother was Joktan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eiver named his son Peleg in anticipation of the dispersion and decrease in lifespan caused by the confusion of languages at the Tower of Babel, with Yoktan possibly reflecting humility. The Seder Olam Rabbah lists prophets and prophetesses of Israel and details Eber's prophetic naming of Peleg. The Mishnah discusses divine punishment for reneging on transactions and states that certain groups have no share in the World-to-Come. References to the division of the earth are also found in various commentaries and Targums. 

|וְיׇקְטָ֣ן יָלַ֔ד אֶת־אַלְמוֹדָ֖ד וְאֶת־שָׁ֑לֶף וְאֶת־חֲצַרְמָ֖וֶת וְאֶת־יָֽרַח׃|26 J|Joktan begot Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Hatzarmavet was named after a city where people lived in poverty and ate animal fodder, anticipating death daily. The Midrash explains that the place is characterized by extreme poverty and illegitimacy, with children not living long. Rashbam interprets the term "ילד" as meaning "he sired" in a context of inheritance, suggesting that the Israelites could view themselves as the heirs of the Canaanites. Yaktan had four sons: Almodad, Shelef, Chatzarmaves, and Yerach. 

|וְאֶת־הֲדוֹרָ֥ם וְאֶת־אוּזָ֖ל וְאֶת־דִּקְלָֽה׃|27 J|Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The names Hadoram, Uzal, and Dikla mentioned in Genesis 10:27 are believed to refer to locations or tribes in Arabia, with Hadoram possibly being a city, Uzal likely referring to a region in Yemen, and Dikla possibly being a tribe in Arabia. Both Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan mention these names in their translations of the verse. 

|וְאֶת־עוֹבָ֥ל וְאֶת־אֲבִֽימָאֵ֖ל וְאֶת־שְׁבָֽא׃|28 J|Obal, Abimael, Sheba,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the significance of the names Oval, Avimael, and Sheva in Genesis 10:28 and their connection to the origins of blue dye (tekhelet) and the nations of Sheba and Kush. It also explores the lineage of Nebuchadnezzar and the expertise in blue dye found in India, as well as the Targum translations of Genesis 10:28 mentioning these descendants. 

|וְאֶת־אוֹפִ֥ר וְאֶת־חֲוִילָ֖ה וְאֶת־יוֹבָ֑ב כׇּל־אֵ֖לֶּה בְּנֵ֥י יׇקְטָֽן׃|29 J|Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the descendants of Joktan.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Yoktan had three sons: Ofir, Havila, and Yovav according to Steinsaltz [Genesis 10:29]. Rav Aḥa in Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 6:4 uses analogies of humility to explain the importance of minimizing one's affairs to receive blessings from God. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan differ in naming the sons of Yoktan as Ophir, Chavilah, and Yovav. 

|וַיְהִ֥י מוֹשָׁבָ֖ם מִמֵּשָׁ֑א בֹּאֲכָ֥ה סְפָ֖רָה הַ֥ר הַקֶּֽדֶם׃|30 J|Their settlements extended from Mesha as far as Sephar, the hill country to the east.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The sons of Yokton settled in the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula, possibly including Mecca, after the dispersal of mankind. The generation of the dispersion rebelled against God, leading to their scattering to prevent further harm. Various interpretations discuss the extreme poverty and short life expectancy in Ḥatzarmavet, the lineage and social status of different regions, and the settlement of people from the East in Shinar. The descendants of the sons of Joktan dwelt from Meishah towards Sephor, the eastern mountain. 

|אֵ֣לֶּה בְנֵי־שֵׁ֔ם לְמִשְׁפְּחֹתָ֖ם לִלְשֹׁנֹתָ֑ם בְּאַרְצֹתָ֖ם לְגוֹיֵהֶֽם׃|31 P|These are the descendants of Shem according to their clans and languages, by their lands, according to their nations.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The descendants of Shem spread out into families, clans, and tribes, each developing its own language and becoming a nation in its own right. The Land of Israel is unique and cannot tolerate sinners due to its holiness, becoming defiled by forbidden sexual relationships and idol worship, leading to the punishment of the Canaanites as a warning to all mankind. The descendants of Shem are listed according to their families, languages, lands, and nations in Targum Onkelos and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 10:31. 

|אֵ֣לֶּה מִשְׁפְּחֹ֧ת בְּנֵי־נֹ֛חַ לְתוֹלְדֹתָ֖ם בְּגוֹיֵהֶ֑ם וּמֵאֵ֜לֶּה נִפְרְד֧וּ הַגּוֹיִ֛ם בָּאָ֖רֶץ אַחַ֥ר הַמַּבּֽוּל׃|32 P|These are the groupings of Noah’s descendants, according to their origins, by their nations; and from these the nations branched out over the earth after the Flood.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The descendants of Noah's sons, totaling 70 nations, were scattered across the globe after the Tower of Babel, with 14 from Japheth, 30 from Ham, and 26 from Shem being considered the founding fathers. Each nation bears the names of these ancestors, with Jerusalem being HaShem's portion of the earth and the Jewish people being His portion in the nations. The unity of language on earth after the dispersion of nations is discussed in the Midrash, with a parallel drawn to the forgetfulness of a fool being beaten, and a plea from the Jewish people to God to be saved from their enemies. The Targum describes how the nations were separated on earth based on the descendants of Noah's sons. 

## Genesis 11

|וַיְהִ֥י כׇל־הָאָ֖רֶץ שָׂפָ֣ה אֶחָ֑ת וּדְבָרִ֖ים אֲחָדִֽים׃|1 J|Everyone on earth had the same language and the same words.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Tower of Babel story in Genesis emphasizes the importance of the holy language, Hebrew, as a language rooted in understanding and life, contrasting with the meaningless speech of the builders. Various commentaries discuss the dispersion after the flood, the sin of stopping in one place instead of filling the land, and the unity of language and words among people. The generation of the dispersion planned to rebel against God by making a name for themselves, a plan later fulfilled by Nevuchadnezzar. The Talmud discusses the unity of language before the Tower of Babel and emphasizes the importance of loving all people, citing examples of unity and punishment for hatred. 

|וַיְהִ֖י בְּנׇסְעָ֣ם מִקֶּ֑דֶם וַֽיִּמְצְא֥וּ בִקְעָ֛ה בְּאֶ֥רֶץ שִׁנְעָ֖ר וַיֵּ֥שְׁבוּ שָֽׁם׃|2 J|And as they migrated from the east, they came upon a valley in the land of Shinar and settled there.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Various commentators offer interpretations on the migration of people to Shinar, with some suggesting rebellion against God and others proposing a desire for unity. The construction of the Tower of Babel is viewed as a sinful act, resulting in dispersion and the loss of a common language, showcasing God's attributes of judgment and mercy. Different practices for petitioning for rain are outlined based on the region's climate, with the ruling that places outside Eretz Yisrael should follow Babylonia's practice. The connection between the generation of dispersion and Nevuchadnezzar's idol is explored in Kabbalah, emphasizing the significance of understanding the secret meanings behind these events. The Midrash warns of the consequences of sin and highlights the importance of remembering God before difficult times, while Ramban discusses punishment for idolatry and the concept of jealousy in relation to idol worship. The Talmud describes the Tower of Babel builders seeking to reach heaven and their exclusion from the World-to-Come, while Tosefta explains the downfall of various groups due to their haughtiness and disobedience towards God. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֞וּ אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־רֵעֵ֗הוּ הָ֚בָה נִלְבְּנָ֣ה לְבֵנִ֔ים וְנִשְׂרְפָ֖ה לִשְׂרֵפָ֑ה וַתְּהִ֨י לָהֶ֤ם הַלְּבֵנָה֙ לְאָ֔בֶן וְהַ֣חֵמָ֔ר הָיָ֥ה לָהֶ֖ם לַחֹֽמֶר׃|3 J|They said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and burn them hard.”—Brick served them as stone, and bitumen served them as mortar.—|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The builders in Genesis 11:3 used bricks instead of stones due to the lack of stones in the valley, baking them until they were hard, using slime as mortar and bitumen mixed with pitch to make the bricks waterproof. The tower of Babel was not an attempt to ascend to the heavens, but rather to create a great city for fame and glory. The Tower of Babel was seen as idolatry, and those involved were punished, highlighting the importance of humility before God. Rashi explains the use of "we" in Genesis 29:27:2, while Rabbeinu Bahya interprets "ל" in Genesis 22:2:5 as indicating an exchange for a burnt offering. The confusion of tongues in the Second Temple text discusses the power of reasoning in turning talk into solid substance. Both Targums on Genesis 11:3 mention people making bricks and baking them in a fire to use as stone and mortar. 

|וַיֹּאמְר֞וּ הָ֣בָה ׀ נִבְנֶה־לָּ֣נוּ עִ֗יר וּמִגְדָּל֙ וְרֹאשׁ֣וֹ בַשָּׁמַ֔יִם וְנַֽעֲשֶׂה־לָּ֖נוּ שֵׁ֑ם פֶּן־נָפ֖וּץ עַל־פְּנֵ֥י כׇל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|4 J|And they said, “Come, let us build us a city, and a tower with its top in the sky, to make a name for ourselves; else we shall be scattered all over the world.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The people in Genesis 11:4 built a city and tower to avoid being scattered and challenge God's authority, resulting in their dispersion and punishment for rebellion. God's presence on earth was gradually withdrawn due to humanity's disobedience, but returned through righteous figures like Abraham, culminating in His descent onto Mount Sinai. The Giborim built structures to make a name for themselves, revealing their evil intent, while the Tower of Babel led to the dispersal of the people and the creation of nations. The Jewish people's humility contrasts with the arrogance of Gentile rulers, emphasizing the importance of humility and speaking out only in matters of Torah for the world's continuation. Various texts discuss the consequences of seeking greatness through sinful actions, such as building the Tower of Babel, and the downfall of the impious due to their haughtiness. 

|וַיֵּ֣רֶד יְהֹוָ֔ה לִרְאֹ֥ת אֶת־הָעִ֖יר וְאֶת־הַמִּגְדָּ֑ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר בָּנ֖וּ בְּנֵ֥י הָאָדָֽם׃|5 J|יהוה came down to look at the city and tower that humanity had built,|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Tower of Babel story in Genesis highlights God's intervention to prevent severe sins, emphasizing the importance of examining situations thoroughly. Halakhah stresses the necessity of avoiding conflicts of interest and thoroughly investigating all facts in legal matters. Jewish Thought discusses the tower as a symbol of mankind's pursuit of physical unity over moral perfection, emphasizing the importance of spiritual growth. Midrash highlights God's care for humanity and discusses various instances of God's descent to witness human actions. Musar sees symbolism in David's task to repair the damage caused by the Tower of Babel. Quoting Commentary connects Adam's sin to pursuing alien philosophies, as seen in the Tower builders' attempt to reach heaven. Second Temple interprets the idea of God physically coming down as figurative, emphasizing human unity in sin. Talmud argues against heretics by showing there is only one God, and discusses various instances of the Divine Presence descending to the world. Tanakh mentions God's plan to go down to Sodom and Gomorrah to assess the people's actions. Targum describes Adonoy's revelation to punish the people for building the city and tower. 

|וַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְהֹוָ֗ה הֵ֣ן עַ֤ם אֶחָד֙ וְשָׂפָ֤ה אַחַת֙ לְכֻלָּ֔ם וְזֶ֖ה הַחִלָּ֣ם לַעֲשׂ֑וֹת וְעַתָּה֙ לֹֽא־יִבָּצֵ֣ר מֵהֶ֔ם כֹּ֛ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָזְמ֖וּ לַֽעֲשֽׂוֹת׃|6 J|and יהוה said, “If, as one people with one language for all, this is how they have begun to act, then nothing that they may propose to do will be out of their reach.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

God confounded the language of the people to prevent them from building the Tower of Babel due to their unity posing a threat and practicing idol worship. The Midrash discusses the rebellion, repentance opportunities, and consequences of the people's actions. In Musar, the soul of an evildoer faces unending pain and separation from its source after death. Various commentators emphasize the punishment for intentions, the importance of unity, and the extreme consequences of godlessness. In the Second Temple texts, impious individuals face confusion and misfortune for their actions, while the Tanakh highlights God's decrees against Babylon and the consequences of disobedience. 

|הָ֚בָה נֵֽרְדָ֔ה וְנָבְלָ֥ה שָׁ֖ם שְׂפָתָ֑ם אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹ֣א יִשְׁמְע֔וּ אִ֖ישׁ שְׂפַ֥ת רֵעֵֽהוּ׃|7 J|Let us, then, go down and confound their speech there, so that they shall not understand one another’s speech.”|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis symbolizes human pride and the punishment of language confusion as a way to prevent further hubris. The confusion of languages led to the dispersion of the people and the end of their building project. Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis agree that God confounded the language of the people of Babel to scatter them, originally speaking Hebrew. The Talmud discusses changes made to the text for King Ptolemy to clarify certain passages and avoid contradictions. The confusion of tongues in Genesis 11:7 is meant to prevent harm caused by vice by making communication between people impossible. 

|וַיָּ֨פֶץ יְהֹוָ֥ה אֹתָ֛ם מִשָּׁ֖ם עַל־פְּנֵ֣י כׇל־הָאָ֑רֶץ וַֽיַּחְדְּל֖וּ לִבְנֹ֥ת הָעִֽיר׃|8 J|Thus יהוה scattered them from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The dispersal of people from the Tower of Babel and Egypt marked the beginning of the history of the Jewish people, leading to a purification of languages and a return to a unified spiritual and social order under God. The Avodah service on Yom Kippur recounts key biblical stories and emphasizes purification rituals, while the Mishnah states that certain generations and groups will not have a share in the World-to-Come. The generation of the flood, the Tower of Babel, and the people of Sodom are excluded from the World-to-Come, with the Talmud and Tanakh reinforcing this idea. Jeremiah 51:20-24 illustrates how Babylon was used as a tool of destruction by God. 

|עַל־כֵּ֞ן קָרָ֤א שְׁמָהּ֙ בָּבֶ֔ל כִּי־שָׁ֛ם בָּלַ֥ל יְהֹוָ֖ה שְׂפַ֣ת כׇּל־הָאָ֑רֶץ וּמִשָּׁם֙ הֱפִיצָ֣ם יְהֹוָ֔ה עַל־פְּנֵ֖י כׇּל־הָאָֽרֶץ׃|9 J|That is why it was called Babel,  because there יהוה confounded  the speech of the whole earth; and from there יהוה scattered them over the face of the whole earth.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The text discusses the punishment of the Babylonians for corrupting speech, as seen in the story of the Tower of Babel where God mixed up their language as a fitting consequence for misusing speech. The story highlights the significance of the Name of God, HaShem, associated with Jerusalem and the Jewish people, and the consequences of human defiance against divine order. Additionally, it emphasizes the power of the tongue, with slander being more harmful than other sins, and the importance of seeking guidance from the Torah and priests instead of necromancers. The generation of the flood, the generation of the dispersion, the people of Sodom, the assembly of Korah, and the spies who spread an evil report are excluded from the World-to-Come, with different beliefs about the return of the ten tribes to Eretz Yisrael. The people building the tower acted wickedly, leading to confusion and punishment among them, with the earth swallowing up part of the tower and fire consuming another part. The temple of Nimrod, remnants of the tower of Babel, is considered a place of idol worship that was abandoned and permitted, as the worshippers chose to abandon it. Love dependent on something will perish, while debates for the sake of Heaven endure, and gatherings for performing commandments are beneficial, unlike the assembly of the men of the Generation of the Dispersal who built the Tower of Babel. In Zephaniah 3:9, God promises to make the people pure of speech, reversing the confusion of languages at Babel for unity in serving Him. 

|אֵ֚לֶּה תּוֹלְדֹ֣ת שֵׁ֔ם שֵׁ֚ם בֶּן־מְאַ֣ת שָׁנָ֔ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־אַרְפַּכְשָׁ֑ד שְׁנָתַ֖יִם אַחַ֥ר הַמַּבּֽוּל׃|10 R R|This is the line of Shem. Shem was 100 years old when he begot Arpachshad, two years after the Flood.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The genealogy of Shem's descendants is detailed to show the direct lineage to Abraham, with Arpachshad being born two years after the deluge to provide chronological information. The Talmud and Radak argue that Shem was not the eldest son of Noah, with discussions on the order of brothers in the Bible based on wisdom rather than birth order. The Targum and Second Temple texts highlight the significance of perfect numbers associated with Shem, emphasizing his role in combating injustice and affliction. The Midrash discusses various genealogical and historical details, including the birth of circumcised individuals like Jacob and Moses. Isaac's actions in blessing Jacob and Esau are analyzed in the context of supplanting primogeniture, and the Musar commentary highlights the rehabilitation of evil through the birth of Jacob and Esau. The Halakhah commentary delves into interpretations of verses from Leviticus regarding the produce of the seventh year, Biblical time calculations, and discrepancies in counting years in Scripture. 

|וַֽיְחִי־שֵׁ֗ם אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־אַרְפַּכְשָׁ֔ד חֲמֵ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|11 R|After the birth of  Arpachshad, Shem lived 500 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah does not mention the deaths of the generations after the flood, as they are seen as forerunners to the emergence of Abraham, with Shem living 500 years after siring Arpachshad. The Midrash discusses Joseph and his family's dedication to studying Torah, while the Seder Olam Zutta lists the lifespans of the ten generations from Shem to Abraham. The long lives of the first men were due to innate strength, subsequent generations lived shorter lives, and the lack of mention of death in the genealogy of Shem and Noah's descendants is attributed to their role in building the world and their shorter lifespans. Onkelos and Targum Jonathan state that Shem lived for 500 years after the birth of Arpachshad. 

|וְאַרְפַּכְשַׁ֣ד חַ֔י חָמֵ֥שׁ וּשְׁלֹשִׁ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־שָֽׁלַח׃|12 R|When Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he begot Shelah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Arpakhshad was thirty-five years old when he fathered Shela, as mentioned in the Targum. The Midrash discusses the lifespans of ten generations from Shem to Abraham, connecting the concept of being expunged from the book of life to the descendants of Adam. Rashbam explains the stress on the first syllable in the term "chayah" in Genesis 11:12, contrasting it with the stress on the last syllable in Kohelet 6:6. 

|וַיְחִ֣י אַרְפַּכְשַׁ֗ד אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־שֶׁ֔לַח שָׁלֹ֣שׁ שָׁנִ֔ים וְאַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|13 R|After the birth of Shelah, Arpachshad lived 403 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Arpakhshad lived for 403 years after the birth of Shela and had other children. The Midrash Tanchuma emphasizes the importance of studying Torah despite persecution, while the Seder Olam Zutta lists the lifespans of generations from Shem to Abraham. Rashi explains the Torah's beginning with the story of creation to establish God's ownership of the earth and the non-eternal nature of the universe, emphasizing the importance of recognizing God as the Creator. According to Onkelos, Arpachshad lived for 403 years after Shelach and had sons and daughters, while Targum Jonathan states he lived for 430 years after Shelach and also had offspring. 

|וְשֶׁ֥לַח חַ֖י שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־עֵֽבֶר׃|14 R|When Shelah had lived 30 years, he begot Eber.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Shelah was thirty years old when he fathered Eber, according to the Targum [Onkelos Genesis 11:14; Targum Jonathan on Genesis 11:14]. This event is part of a genealogy that spans ten generations until the birth of Abraham, emphasizing the importance of righteousness in one's legacy according to the Midrash [Seder Olam Zutta 3:1; Bereshit Rabbah 24:3]. 

|וַֽיְחִי־שֶׁ֗לַח אַחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־עֵ֔בֶר שָׁלֹ֣שׁ שָׁנִ֔ים וְאַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|15 R|After the birth of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Shelah lived 403 years after the birth of Eber and had other children, as mentioned in Seder Olam Zutta 3:1 and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 11:15. The Midrash highlights the ten generations leading up to Abraham's birth and mentions Ephron's greed in Bereshit Rabbah 58:7. 

|וַֽיְחִי־עֵ֕בֶר אַרְבַּ֥ע וּשְׁלֹשִׁ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־פָּֽלֶג׃|16 R|When Eber had lived 34 years, he begot Peleg.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Terah lived to be 205 years old and fathered Abraham at the age of 70. The punishment of the generation of the dispersal was based on the potential consequences of their unity and common purpose. The ten generations from Shem to Abraham spanned until the year 2008 in the Jewish calendar. Eber had a son named Peleg when he was thirty-four years old. 

|וַֽיְחִי־עֵ֗בֶר אַחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־פֶּ֔לֶג שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שָׁנָ֔ה וְאַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|17 R|After the birth of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Eiver lived a total of 464 years and had other sons and daughters in addition to Peleg. The genealogy from Shem to Abraham spans ten generations and 2008 years according to the Jewish calendar. Jacob was 63 when he was blessed, Ishmael died, and Jacob spent 14 years in Israel before staying 20 years in Laban's house in Aram-Naharaim. Eiver lived for 430 years after having Peleg and had more children. 

|וַֽיְחִי־פֶ֖לֶג שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־רְעֽוּ׃|18 R|When Peleg had lived 30 years, he begot Reu.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Peleg had a son named Re'u when he was thirty years old. The total number of generations from Shem to Abraham is ten, according to the Jewish calendar year 2008. Haran died while his father Terach was still alive, considered an exception at the time, similar to Elazar and Ittamar being appointed priests during their father Aaron's lifetime. Some argue children did not die during their fathers' lifetimes, except for Peleg, but examples like Lemech, Noach's father, who died during Methuselah's lifetime, exist. 

|וַֽיְחִי־פֶ֗לֶג אַחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־רְע֔וּ תֵּ֥שַׁע שָׁנִ֖ים וּמָאתַ֣יִם שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|19 R|After the birth of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and begot sons and daughters.|

Peleg lived for 209 years after the birth of Re'u and had other children, as mentioned in Seder Olam Zutta 3:1 and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 11:19. This genealogy spans ten generations and ends with the birth of Abraham in the year 2008 according to the Jewish calendar. 

|וַיְחִ֣י רְע֔וּ שְׁתַּ֥יִם וּשְׁלֹשִׁ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־שְׂרֽוּג׃|20 R|When Reu had lived 32 years, he begot Serug.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Reu was 32 years old when he had a son named Serug. Ten generations passed from Noah to Abraham, with Abraham receiving the reward of all previous generations due to his righteousness. The Talmud discusses instances where the phrase "and it came to pass" is followed by negative events. In the Targum, Reu lived 32 years and had a son named Serug. 

|וַיְחִ֣י רְע֗וּ אַחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־שְׂר֔וּג שֶׁ֥בַע שָׁנִ֖ים וּמָאתַ֣יִם שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|21 R|After the birth of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Re'u lived for 207 years after the birth of Peleg and had other children besides Peleg. The total number of years for the ten generations from Shem to Abraham is 2,947 years. Re'u lived for 207 years after having Serug and had both sons and daughters. 

|וַיְחִ֥י שְׂר֖וּג שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־נָחֽוֹר׃|22 R|When Serug had lived 30 years, he begot Nahor.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Serug was thirty years old when he had Nahor, according to both Midrash and Targum commentaries. The total number of generations mentioned in the text is ten, with each individual's lifespan also specified in the Midrash commentary. 

|וַיְחִ֣י שְׂר֗וּג אַחֲרֵ֛י הוֹלִיד֥וֹ אֶת־נָח֖וֹר מָאתַ֣יִם שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|23 R|After the birth of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Serug lived for 200 years after the birth of Nahor and had other children besides Nahor, according to Steinsaltz on Genesis 11:23. The Seder Olam Zutta 3:1 lists the lifespans of ten generations from Shem to Abraham, with each father living until their son was born and then living a specific number of years thereafter, concluding in the year 2008 according to the Jewish calendar. The Targum also mentions that Serug lived for 200 years after having Nachor and had other children. 

|וַיְחִ֣י נָח֔וֹר תֵּ֥שַׁע וְעֶשְׂרִ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־תָּֽרַח׃|24 R|When Nahor had lived 29 years, he begot Terah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Nahor was 29 years old when he had a son named Terah. The genealogy from Shem to Abraham includes ten generations and details the lifespan of each ancestor, with Abraham living 175 years. Terah, Abraham's father, moved the family from Chaldea to Haran in Mesopotamia, where he died at the age of 205. Nahor had eight sons with his wife Milcha and four more with his concubine Reuma, including Laban and Rebecca. 

|וַיְחִ֣י נָח֗וֹר אַחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣וֹ אֶת־תֶּ֔רַח תְּשַֽׁע־עֶשְׂרֵ֥ה שָׁנָ֖ה וּמְאַ֣ת שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בָּנִ֖ים וּבָנֽוֹת׃|25 R|After the birth of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and begot sons and daughters.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Nahor lived for 119 years after the birth of Terah and had other children besides Terah. The Seder Olam Zutta 3:1 lists the ages and lifespans of the ten generations from Shem to Terah, with Terah living 205 years before Abraham was born. Targum Onkelos Genesis 11:25 and Targum Jonathan on Genesis 11:25 also mention that Nahor had sons and daughters during that time. 

|וַֽיְחִי־תֶ֖רַח שִׁבְעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֑ה וַיּ֙וֹלֶד֙ אֶת־אַבְרָ֔ם אֶת־נָח֖וֹר וְאֶת־הָרָֽן׃|26 R|When Terah had lived 70 years, he begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The spiritual input of parents during conception influences the child's spiritual focus, with Avraham receiving spiritual characteristics from G'd that enabled him to become the first patriarch of the Jewish people. Terach's biological contribution to Avraham was purely physical, and Avraham's connection to Terach was severed upon his conversion and name change by G'd. Avraham's spiritual lineage is emphasized in the Torah, highlighting his role as the founding father of the Jewish people. Terach lived for seventy years and fathered Avram, Nachor, and Haran. Rashi explains that Terah died in Haran after Abram had left for Canaan, even though Terah lived for 60 more years after Abram's departure, to avoid the perception that Abram did not show proper respect by leaving his father during his old age. 

|וְאֵ֙לֶּה֙ תּוֹלְדֹ֣ת תֶּ֔רַח תֶּ֚רַח הוֹלִ֣יד אֶת־אַבְרָ֔ם אֶת־נָח֖וֹר וְאֶת־הָרָ֑ן וְהָרָ֖ן הוֹלִ֥יד אֶת־לֽוֹט׃|27 P R|Now this is the line of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begot Lot.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The Torah emphasizes Lot's connection to Terach by including grandsons as part of the older generation. The repetition of names signifies a share in both worlds for figures like Noah, Abraham, and Terah. The Talmud suggests that in earlier generations, men fathered children at a young age, as seen with Terah fathering children at the age of eight. The Targum states that Haran was the father of Lot. 

|וַיָּ֣מׇת הָרָ֔ן עַל־פְּנֵ֖י תֶּ֣רַח אָבִ֑יו בְּאֶ֥רֶץ מוֹלַדְתּ֖וֹ בְּא֥וּר כַּשְׂדִּֽים׃|28 P|Haran died in the lifetime of his father Terah, in his native land, Ur of the Chaldeans.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans before his father Terah, with Abraham being saved from a fiery furnace by God after breaking idols, leading to Haran's death. The Midrash connects this event to the dispersion of the sinful generation. Inheritance laws regarding the firstborn son and priesthood are discussed in Tanakh, while Targum Jonathan describes Haran's death in the fire. Various commentators offer interpretations on different aspects of these events, including the significance of Terach's death, the tower of Babel, and specific terms in Isaiah. 

|וַיִּקַּ֨ח אַבְרָ֧ם וְנָח֛וֹר לָהֶ֖ם נָשִׁ֑ים שֵׁ֤ם אֵֽשֶׁת־אַבְרָם֙ שָׂרָ֔י וְשֵׁ֤ם אֵֽשֶׁת־נָחוֹר֙ מִלְכָּ֔ה בַּת־הָרָ֥ן אֲבִֽי־מִלְכָּ֖ה וַֽאֲבִ֥י יִסְכָּֽה׃|29 P|Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves, the name of Abram’s wife being Sarai and that of Nahor’s wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

The lineage of Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah is established through Nahor's wife Milcah, with sages suggesting Iscah is Sarah, supported by Gematria. The patriarchs and matriarchs, including Sarah, are considered prophets, with Miriam speaking against Moses and Hagar introduced as an Egyptian maidservant. The importance of familial relationships in marriage arrangements is highlighted in the Second Temple period, with examples like Abram and Nahor, Jacob and Laban, and Aaron and Elizabeth. The Talmud mentions the seven prophetesses, including Sarah, with textual support for Sarah as Iscah due to her divine inspiration and beauty. Lastly, the Targum states that Abram married Sarai, and Nahor married Milkah, the daughter of Haran. 

|וַתְּהִ֥י שָׂרַ֖י עֲקָרָ֑ה אֵ֥ין לָ֖הּ וָלָֽד׃|30 P|Now Sarai was barren, she had no child.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Chasidut explains that procreation includes physical offspring and the creation of souls through good deeds, with Sarah giving birth to souls for converts despite her barrenness. Commentary highlights Sarah's infertility issues and miraculous birth of Isaac. Jewish Thought notes Hagar's low status in Abraham's household and the eventual birth of a child from Abraham's "belly". Kabbalah emphasizes that Sarah was able to create souls through her spiritual connection with Abraham. Midrash details the descendants of Noah and his sons, with a focus on Shem's genealogy. Musar connects Abraham's journey to the land of Israel with the acceptance of the Torah at Mount Sinai. Quoting Commentary discusses Sarah, Rivkah, and Rachel's barrenness and the assurance of G'd's promise to Abraham. Talmud and Targum also address Sarah's barrenness and underdevelopment. 

|וַיִּקַּ֨ח תֶּ֜רַח אֶת־אַבְרָ֣ם בְּנ֗וֹ וְאֶת־ל֤וֹט בֶּן־הָרָן֙ בֶּן־בְּנ֔וֹ וְאֵת֙ שָׂרַ֣י כַּלָּת֔וֹ אֵ֖שֶׁת אַבְרָ֣ם בְּנ֑וֹ וַיֵּצְא֨וּ אִתָּ֜ם מֵא֣וּר כַּשְׂדִּ֗ים לָלֶ֙כֶת֙ אַ֣רְצָה כְּנַ֔עַן וַיָּבֹ֥אוּ עַד־חָרָ֖ן וַיֵּ֥שְׁבוּ שָֽׁם׃|31 P|Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot the son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans for the land of Canaan; but when they had come as far as Haran, they settled there.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Avram and his family initially planned to settle in Canaan but stayed in Charan due to attachments to their community. Avram's decision to go to the Holy Land was driven by his desire to serve God, leading to God's promise of the land to his offspring. Abraham taught his descendants about God and mitzvot to preserve his teachings, with Moses later sent by God to redeem the Jews. The Zohar explains that Abraham's intention to move to Canaan prompted Divine assistance, shifting from unassisted achievements to receiving guidance. Rav Hanan bar Rava mentions Abraham's imprisonment for rejecting idol worship, with differing opinions on the locations and durations of his imprisonment. Terach took Avram, Lot, and Sarai from Ur Kasdim to Canaan, settling in Charan instead. 

|וַיִּהְי֣וּ יְמֵי־תֶ֔רַח חָמֵ֥שׁ שָׁנִ֖ים וּמָאתַ֣יִם שָׁנָ֑ה וַיָּ֥מׇת תֶּ֖רַח בְּחָרָֽן׃|32 R|The days of Terah came to 205 years; and Terah died in Haran.|
|--:|:-:|:--|

Rabbi Abraham invited the Rebbe to spend one Shabbat with him on the Shabbat of Noah, after initially declining to move in permanently, on 3 Cheshvan. Terah's death in Haran at 205 years old was noted before Abram's departure to avoid criticism, with speculation that he may have repented at death. The Mishnah highlights the ten generations from Adam to Noah and from Noah to Abraham as demonstrations of God's patience, while the Second Temple commentary suggests Terah died as a virtuous explorer.
