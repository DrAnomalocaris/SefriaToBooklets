This pattern was already seen in the book of Exodus, where, despite the climactic miracle of deliverance at the Sea of Reeds, the Israelites “grumbled against Moshe” at Mara because of lack of drinkable water. Although a strain in later biblical thinking remembered the wilderness period as a kind of honeymoon (cf. Jer. 2:2), the Torah itself chose to remember it as a severe time of testing which the ex-slaves ultimately failed to pass.", "The second part of Numbers is a remarkable collection of rebellion narratives that simultaneously display striking similarities and great and colorful differences. The section details six rebellions of the people, and two of the leaders themselves. They are united by a consistent vocabulary: verbs such as “grumble” and “assemble/gather/speak against” depict complaints against Moshe and Aharon and against God. These stories also display the recurring themes of dearth of food and water, and God’s anger at the rebellions, usually expressed in some form of plague (or, additionally, fire).", "Rather than unfold in simple chronological order, one following another, these pieces of the text have been intensified by priestly editing, which has interspersed the stories with a number of cultic and legal passages (Chaps. 15, 18, and 19, all of which bear the theme word “law” [Heb. <i>hok</i> or <i>hukka</i>]), and which are somehow related to previous or succeeding narratives. The interruptions also allow each of the memorable rebellion narratives to “breathe,” giving the audience time to digest the images and the drama presented therein. The stories possess both in abundant measure; one thinks, for instance, of the “meat between the teeth” (11:33), of the grape clusters borne on a pole by two men (13:23); and of the great confrontation with Korah in Chapter 16 (not to mention its resolution), as well as Moshe’s dramatic failure in Chapter 20.", "As in any great literature, repetition of story type or type scene is here accomplished via variation of the most telling kind. In this case we observe once again an alternating pattern to the rebellions, a pattern which reveals not one theme but several:", "The people, over lack of food (chapter 11)", "Moshe’s siblings, over prophetic primacy (12)", "The people, over the spies’ false report (14)", "Levites, over Moshe and Aharon’s prerogatives (16)", "The people, over the rebellious Levites’ sinister fate (17)", "Moshe himself, over the burden of leading the people (20)", "The people, over the lack of food and water (21)", "The pattern observable here is broken, in true biblical rhetorical style (where the last in a sequence often serves by its oddness to reinforce the whole), in a final rebellion (Chap. 25), where the people’s actions involve neither the “complaining” vocabulary nor a revolt against human leadership, but rather comprise the greatest biblical crime of them all: worship of other gods. Viewed in this patterned fashion, the rebellion narratives emerge with a kind of crescendo effect.", "It is also possible, as I have done in “On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure,” above, to follow the scheme put forth by Mann—a three-part structure to the section, each with its internal logic and conclusions. These are treated below; for the moment, it will suffice to see in the first subsection (Chaps. 11–14) the inevitable result of wilderness rebellions: the divine decree that the slave generation must die out before entering the Promised Land; the second subsection (16–20) deals with the challenges to the leadership of Moshe and Aharon, and results in a similar decree, that they will die outside the land; and the third subsection (20–25) chronicles the encounter of the Israelites with neighboring nations, which initially goes in their favor but ends with the disastrous incident at Baal Pe’or (25).", "The primary issue in these stories, to the biblical writer, is lack of trust in God. Each of the three sections mentions or implies that problem; 14:11 and 20:12 use the verb itself, and the narrative of Chapter 25 suggests it. The bottom line is that the Israelites could not keep faith with God—even after both staggering acts of divine intervention (i.e., rescue) and demonstrations of the force of divine wrath—and this lack of faith led ultimately to their dying out in the wilderness outside the Promised Land, in punishment. The stories clearly were meant to be understood as an unfortunate example for later generations, and were taken as such already in the biblical period (see, for example, the treatment in Psalm 78).", "Read on another level, the rebellion narratives are largely concerned with the issue of human leadership, its qualifications, manifestations, and limitations (and even failures). Has there ever been a leader as beleaguered as Moshe? From the beginning of his career on the sands of Egypt, where he assumes the mantle of leadership in the matter of retaliating against the sadistic Egyptian taskmaster (Ex. 2:11–12), to its end at the plains of Moab, in stern address to the people he has struggled to lead (this is the setting of the entire next book, Deuteronomy), he must evoke trust in God, lead the people through an uncharted wilderness, and inspire confidence in his own leadership. His success is muted by the passing of the generation he initially leads, before it can enter Canaan; like them, he too must pass on—with merely a look beyond the Jordan, but no more. Later generations of Jewish readers wept on confronting Moshe’s seemingly premature death, and created heroic tales of his pleading before God to be let into the land he had so long sought to reach. In Numbers he fully deserves this stature, alternately interceding with and cajoling God, standing up for and then almost giving up on this people with whom his life has become so enmeshed. Our stories stress his gifts of prophecy and his pathos as a deeply human leader.", "A final, troubling issue is the character of God in this part of the book. It is a measure of the Bible’s artistry that the rebellion accounts are so varied in content and style; but the variations in punishment—from undetailed death to skin disease to stoning and the earth opening up, just to mention a few examples—create an impression, not of artistic richness but of unremitting severity. The Bible does not seem to have a problem with this kind of divine behavior, and other ancient cultures would have felt at home here, but already in late antiquity, and continuing down to our own day, Jews and Christians most often have preferred, and prayed to, a more forgiving, nurturing, and compassionate God. Dealing with these texts, in the end, raises the question of whether to understand them as the result of “historical necessity” or “literary conceit” (that is, the old generation simply had to die out) or as they stand in the text: a harsh portrayal of what happened when the covenant people violated the covenant."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure,it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. 16) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil'am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.", "It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).", "The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.", "Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area— there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. 13) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:", "I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp", "1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites", "2 The Ordering of the Camp", "3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties", "4 The Tasks of the Levites", "5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp", "6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing", "7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle", "8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites", "9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle", "10 The Journey to Canaan Commences", "II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge", "A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation", "11 First Rebellion: Food", "12 Second Rebellion: Siblings", "13 The Spies’ Mission", "14 Third Rebellion: Panic", "15 Interlude: Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels", "B The Crisis of Leadership", "16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites", "17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge", "18 The Levites as Guardians", "19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal", "20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon", "C Encountering the Other", "21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion:", "Food and Water", "22–24 The Bil'am Cycle", "25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy", "III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan", "26 The Second Census", "27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I", "28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days", "30 Rules Concerning Vows", "31 First Battle and Aftermath", "32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest", "33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning", "34 Future Borders", "35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum", "36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II", "In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.", "With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.", "The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos— and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy.", "Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. 8), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.", "As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names</i> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights</i> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.", "The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. Ex. 15–18); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along with the orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.", "It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <small>B.C.E.</small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <small>B.C.E.</small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers."], "versionTitle": "The Five Books of Moses, by Everett Fox.

ושהעביר הוא ית' כרוז בכל חילא דשמיא והרת ברית ואם היה ע\"י תשובה מה צורך לכל זה האם ע\"י תשובה וקטורת יצטרך לכרות ברית ולהעביר כרוז והלא אין דבר שעומד בפני התשובה. ג' המעשה עצמו שבלי תשובה המגפה נעצרה שאח\"כ צוה לו הוא ית' יחזירם בתשובה וגם שבתוך דבריו רמז הרב ז\"ל שעון קרח היה גדול כלומר שלכן לא הועיל הקטורת בלי תשובה. הנה גם זה יכזיבנו המאמר עצמו כי הוא אמר שהקטרת לא הועיל לאהרן ואדרבא הזיק והלשון שהביא הוא עצמו מכזיבו על פניו כי הנה ר' יצחק אמר בא וראה מה כתיב ויאמר משה כו' א\"ל אהרן למה א\"ל כי יצא הקצף מלפני ה' כו' ולא יכיל מלאכא מחבלא לשלטאה ונתבטלה מותנא הנה בפירוש כי הקטורת שעשה אהרן הסיר יכולת המלאך המשחית מלחבל והוא אמר כי אדרבא הזיק. ותימא איך לא חש לקימחיה שאמר כאלו גנוב הוא אתי ומה גם שגם טענתו כי רב עון קרח איננה כי הנה עון קרח חלף הלך וזה עון אחר הוא כמאמר הכתוב ויהיו המתים כו' מלבד המתים על דבר קרח הנה כי אשמתם אלו לא על דבר קרח היה רק על אומרו אתם המיתם כו' שהוא ככתוב למעלה על הר\"ן אנשים. ומה גם כאשר כתבנו מהכרח הכתובים לא חמור היה מעון הראשון. וזולת זה כמה מאמרי רז\"ל אומרים כי הקטרת מנע המגפה וגם מביאים ראיה מאהרן וכן פשט הכתובים ומי ישמע לדבר הזה שאדרבה הזיק. ועוד שאם הקב\"ה לא היה חפץ שיתפללו גם בקטרת לא יבחר ואיך אמר שעל מניעת התפלה בחר משה בקטרת. ועוד שאם ויתן את הקטרת הוא כדבריו הל\"ל ויתן את המחתה. ועוד שהל\"ל ויעמוד בצר\"י המ\"ם וכן באו' וישב הל\"ל השי\"ן בצר\"י וכן אומרו ויהיו המתים כו' פסוק מפסיק ללא צורך בין שתי בחינות התשובה. כלל הדברים שאין דרכו מתיישב בכתובים כלל: ", "<b>אמנם </b>לבא אל הביאור נשית לב אל ספורי מלות המאמר הנזכר ממנו נקח לבא אל כוונת הכתובים. והוא ממאמר רבי כרוספדאי מורה שכח הזכרת קרבן וקטורת ותועלתן היא להתיר כח מלאכים מעשות רע וכן ממאמר אליהו קיים גזר הקב\"ה בכל חילא דשמיא כו' מורה שהקטרת בוסמין מועיל להסיר כח חיל שמיא מלחבל. וכן ממאמר רבי יצחק שאמר ולא יכיל מלאכא לחבלא מורה שכח שליחת המלאך מתרפה ע\"י הקטרת. יראה מזה כ\"א יצוייר יהיה הוא ית' המכה בידו בלי מלאך מחבל לא יועיל קטורת בלי תשובה. רק בשליח שיתרפה כח הרוגז המסור לו. וזה יורה לשון סוף המאמר שאמר לרבי אחא מן השמים אימא לון דיחזרון בתשובה דחייבין אינון קדמאי הנה יורה באצבע כי הקטרת הועיל בפני המלאך. אך קמאי חייבין הם ולא שוה להם הקטרת לפני בלי תשובה. עוד שנית לקח מהמאמר ההוא כי הקטרת יועיל גם לנוטים למות אחר שנגפם המלאך הנוגף בהם כי כן צוה למו לעשות כסדר ההוא אחר כך אצל הנוטים למות. עוד שלישית נשית לב למה העמיד תחילה עשרה לכל זויות מהארבעה ושאחרי כן ילכו אצל הנוטים למות ולא צוה ילכו שמה אליהם תחלה ויעשו הכל בבת א'. אך אין ספק כי ג' חלוקות הן. א' אשר כבר מתו. ב' אשר הוכו במגפה ועודם חיים. ג' אשר נתעתדו להכות ולא הוכו עדיין. והנה המתים חלפו הלכו. אך השתי חלוקות צריכות תיקון. אך בהדרגה שהיא ראשונה הסיר כח הנוגף מלנגוף כאשר לא שלח בהם יד ואח\"כ למנוע מות מהמוכים בל ימותו ע\"כ תחלת מעשהו היה לסבוב את העיר למנוע המשחית מבא עוד לנגוף ואחרי כן ללכת אל בתי המוכים ונוטים למות להחלימם. ובשלשה הדברים האלה נבא אל ביאור הכתובים בס\"ד. הוא כי הנה הוא ית' באהבתו את בני ישראל ומה גם שהעון לא גדל מאד כמפורש למעלה ע\"כ וידבר ה' אל משה לאמר. והוא בשום לב אל מלת לאמר כי אינו לאמר לזולת. וטוב טוב יאמר וידבר ה' אל משה ואל אהרן הרומו וכו' כיון שהיה עתיד לכלול שניהם באומרו הרומו וכו' כאומרו למעלה אל משה ואל אהרן הבדלו וכו' ולשתוק ממלת לאמר. אך הוא כי דבר הוא ית' דבר לשיאמר משה תיקון. והוא מה שאמר לאהרן קח את המחתה וכו'. ומה שאמר כדי שיאמר משה התיקון הלא הוא הרומו וכו' כי מה צורך להפרישם היתכן שלא יבחין המשחית לבלתי הכות את משה ואהרן אם לא יופרשו מתוכם. ועוד שאמר הרומו ולא הבדלו כדלעיל. אך הוא כי הבדלה תורה על רעת העדה שהם כמנודים ומצוה ליבדל מהם. אך באומרו הרומו הוא ל' תרומה והפרשה בעלמא כלומר זכותכם מגן בעדם הרומו וכו' ואכלה אותם כדי שיתעוררו לתקן בשמוע כי זכותם מועלת למו. וגם כאב האומר הניחוני ואמית את בני למען יבקשו להצילו. ע\"כ אמר משה בלבו הנה אינם כמנודים שאפרוש כי הלא לא אמר הבדלו וגם להתפלל אין פנאי. וגם לא להקטיר קטורת משני טעמים. א' כי אמר ואכלה אותם כי הוא על ידי עצמו ית' וא\"כ אין הקטורת מועיל בלי תשובה כאשר למדנו מל' המדרש אם לא בהיות הפקידה ע\"י מלאך להתיש כח. שנית כי אמר כרגע ואם רגע שאול יחתו ואין פנאי להקטיר. ע\"כ לא פירש מהעם להגין עליהם כ\"א נפלו על פניהם כאומרים מותני תחתיהם כענין מאמר ספר הזוהר כי זו כוונת נופלים במוסרים עצמם למות ומה גם כי על כבודם היו לוקים על או' אתם המיתם וכו' ובזה היקלו ברעה וישוב ה' מעשות הרעה אשר דבר ע\"י עצמו ית' וגם מלהיות כרגע. ולמה כי משה הרואה מה למעלה באספקלריא המאירה ראה והנה ע\"י נפילתם זו לתקנו שני הדברים אז אמר לאהרן קח את המחתה וכו'. ולמה שאהרן לא ראה התיקון כאשר ראה משה על כן אמר לו משה אל תתמה איך אצוך בקטורת אחר שהקב\"ה עושה בעצמו ולא שבו עדיין וגם שהות כרגע כי דע איפה כי כה הראני ה' כי הנה יצא הקצף מלפני ה' אחד מהמשחיתים הנקרא קצף יצא מלפני ה' לפעול ולא יעשה בעצמו ית'. ועל השנית אמר אל תחשוב שגם הקצף שיצא לנגוף יעשה כרגע כי לא כן הוא רק לאט למו וז\"א היחל הנגף שהחילה ולא כרגע אשר אין בו התחלה וגמר רק החילה לימשך. לכן הולך מהרה כו' כי יש תקוה. אז אמר אהרן מג' דברים שאמר משה האחד אני אעשה ותרי מגו תלתא אמנע מלעשות מה שאמר שאקח את המחתה והאש והצריך אליה כן אעשה וזהו ויקח אהרן כאשר דבר משה שהוא בענין הלקיחה. אך בשנית שאמר והולך מהרה לא אעשה אלא שארוצה ולא הליכה מהרה בלבד כי הדבר נחוץ מאד. ועל הג' שאמר ושים קטורת ואח\"כ והולך וכו' מוחלפת השיטה והוא כי ראה אהרן כ\"א כה יעשה היה מגדיל המדורה ועוד יוסיפו לחטא ובערה ואין מכבה. והוא כי ארז\"ל והביאו רש\"י ז\"ל כי תלונותם היתה כי הקטורת היה ממית ומכלה את העם וע\"י צוות משה יקחו הר\"ן אנשים מחתות וכו' המיתם ושע\"כ בחר משה בקטורת להראות כי אדרבא בו יחיו וגם יהיה ע\"י אהרן שלא יאמרו עוד אתם המיתם כי אדרבא על ידם יחיו וזה יהיו לדעתם צורך שוב אהרן אל משה שלא נעצרה עד שובי אליו להורות כי ע\"י שניהם והקטרת יחיו. וע\"כ יתכן כי אמר אהרן אם אשים קטורת טרם בוא אליהם יוסיפו לחטא כי בראותם המחתה בידי מלאה קטרת פה אחד יאמרו אכן נודע הדבר מי עשה המגפה הזאת כי אין זה כ\"א חרב הקטורת כי מאז היחל הנגף שימת הקטורת במחתה והוא אשר כלנו ואשר דמה לנו ובשלי הצער הזה עלינו כאשר עשה לר\"ן אנשים אז ישיבו לכסלת מאמרם אתם המיתם את עם ה' וגם אותנו היום בקטורת הלז. לכן התחכם אז יותר ולא שם קטורת במחתה. למען יראו כי אדרבא טרם תת קטורת היה הנגף ואחרי כן נעצר על ידי הקטורת ואז יחזיקו לי טובה על שומו הקטורת. וזהו שנותו את טעמו באומרו ויתן ולא אמר וישם כלומר כי עתה למתנה תחשב להם כי יהיה הקטורת להם כמתנה טובה הפך דעתם. והנה עשה אהרן ככל אשר עשה רבי אחא ואחשבה כי מאהרן למד שהבין הכתובים כדרכנו. והוא כי לא יבצר מהשלש סוגים הנזכר. המתים שכבר מתו. והנווכים אשר עדן לא מתו והם נוטים למות כי לא היו מתים כרגע. ואשר עדיין לא הוכי. וראשונה דרך כלל נתן את הקטורת לכפר על העם בל ישלוט בם עוד הנוגף לנגוף וכן עשה רבי אחא כי ראשונה בקש על הבריאים בארבע כנפות העיר בל ישלוט בם עוד משחית לנגוף. ואחר כן על הנוטים למות והוא מעשה אהרן שאחר שום קטרת ויכפר על העם בל יכה עוד בם המשחית עמד לתקן את המוכים שעודם חיים וזהו ויעמוד בין המתים וכו'. והוא כי הנה אשר כבר הוכו והם גוססין הם קשים מהחלימם והחיותם יותר מלעכב את השטן מהכות בבריאים. כי אשר כבר הוכה הוא כנמסר לסרדיוט וקשה להשיב. וע\"כ אחר שרב אחא סיבב את העיר לתקן דרך כלל בל ישלוט המשחית עוד להכות בבריאים צוה להוסיף ללכת אחרי כן בבתי הנוטים למות כן אהרן עמד בין המתים הם אשר כבר מתו ובין אשר הם חיים עדנה אך מוכים היו וגוססין אשר היו כמתים ממש מסירין ביד המשחית ועמד להפסיק בין אלו לאלו עם היות כי היו כאחדים ממש ולא היה הפסק ביניהם והמתים. הוא עמד והפסיק שהגוססין ישובו מדרך המות ולא ימותו. והוא כי בענין הקטרת ובכוונתו וזה שנותו את טעמו מנגף למגפה כי נגף היא הכאה ומגפה היא המיתה מחמת הנגף. והנה מאז נתן את הקטורת ויכפר לא היה נגף עוד ועדיין היו קצת גוססין קרובים למיתה ואח\"כ והמגפה היא המיתה נעצרה גם מהנגפים כמדובר. ובזה יתכנו דברי רז\"ל האומרים כי השטן לימד למשה במתן תורה מעשה הקטרת למנוע הנגף ויקשה עלהם שא\"כ למה לא רצה כמ\"ש ז\"ל עד ששב אהרן עמו אל משה שאל\"כ היה מסרב. אך הוא כי השטן הודה שמניעתו מלנגוף עוד אך אשר כבר הכה והיו גוססין לקוחים למות על אילו סירב עד שנצטרף זכות משה. כי אמר כי די לו יספיק הקטורת לבטל מלנגוף אך לא לחיות הלקוחים למות. ובזה נשית לב עוד אל שינוי הלשון כי מתחלה הקדים בעצירה למגפה באומרו ותעצר המגפה ואח\"כ היפך והקדים והמגפה נעצרה. וגם אומרו ויהיו המתים וכו' למה נאמר קודם שיבת אהרן אל משה. וגם אומרו מלבד המתים על דבר קרח מה צורך לאומרו. אך הנה ע\"י שום קטרת ויכפר על העם כשל כח השטן ולא יכיל לנגוף עוד ועדיין נשארו הגוססין ועליהם שם לבו אהרן להחיותם ולא שוה לו בעצם רק לעכבם כי ויעמוד בין המתים ובין החיים כמדובר עמד בזכותו בין שתי הכתות וישארו בהוייתן ולא מתו וזהו ותעצר כי היה העצור ועדיין המגפה תלויה וז\"א לשון עצירה שהיא לשון עכבה ועדיין היה אפשר יקטרג השטן וירא אהרן כי הנה ויהיו המתים במגפה כבר כ\"ד אלף
